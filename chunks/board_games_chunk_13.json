        "description": "&quot;Lasalle&quot; is a miniatures wargame for two or more players, and is the first wargame in the HONOUR series. Players take the role of a brigade or division commander in the Napoleonic Wars.<br/><br/>The game is small-scale and tactical in nature, focusing on the movement of individual battalions and regiments of cavalry. The player will manage a small force of roughly a dozen units as he tries to complete some specific mission assigned to him, such as &ldquo;Hold the village and our bridgehead at all costs!&rdquo; or: &ldquo;Drive the French from Plancenoit!&rdquo;<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Lasalle is ideal for a small gaming table, and it plays in real-time with most battles lasting 2-3 hours. It is perfect for pick-up games or tournament play. It therefore includes sample army lists enabling players to collect and paint typical small forces from a large number of possible nationalities.<br/><br/>If you have a club, or a larger collection and gaming area, Lasalle can also be used to simulate historical battles of the Napoleonic Wars, such as Quatre Bras, Albuera, Saalfeld, or Eggm&uuml;hl. In these cases, multiple players with multiple forces and a larger table will allow your group to simulate the excitement of a significant battle.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you move your character to a different location on your player board, taking one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from your hand), then refill your hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, conditions, and (for some characters) curses. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition, which sometimes involves overcoming the hero from your villain's particular Disney film.<br/><br/>Disney Villainous: Introduction to Evil was originally released to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Disney, with the initial box design featuring Ursula, lustrous movers, and platinum rainbow-foil packaging as well as a Disney100 sticker.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Pyramid of Keops (also known as Giza) was the first wonder of the Ancient World. Built around 2600 BC, it was the tallest building on Earth for nearly 4,000 years. For its construction were used about 2 million blocks of granite stone, covered by limestone, assembled by complex systems of wooden cranes and transported on barges from the Upper Nile. Various theories suggest that the Egyptians had access to advanced technology, or even that they were assisted by otherworldly beings.<br/><br/>Be that as it may, the construction of The Pyramids was the most important engineering work of mankind to date, with an unprecedented waste of resources and manpower.<br/><br/>In Keops, you will become one of the Viziers of Pharaoh Khufu, who has decreed the construction of the largest pyramid to date. The eternal glory of all Mizraim is at stake. You will have to compete with the rest of the Viziers to obtain the Pharaoh's favor and make Mizraim the envy of the people who want to destroy it. Keep Ra and the other gods of the Pantheon happy, making offerings in their temples.<br/><br/>Construct buildings to obtain better rents when you recover your officials, besides obtaining prestige constructing a city worthy of the Pharaoh's relatives and assistants. Reinforce the borders with your Medjay to avoid the invasion of the fearsome enemies of Egypt.  Acquire the best barges in the port, fill your warehouses with granite and limestone, and send your craftsmen to prepare the tomb for Jufu's journey to the afterlife, building the first Wonder of the ancient world. The game is played over three rounds, marked by the construction of the three levels of the Pyramid. During the round, players will take turns until the current level of the Pyramid is built. To do so, they will have to wisely manage their craftsmen, scribes and priests, without forgetting their needs and happiness.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, the Pharaoh Jufu will grant his Favor to the Viziers (players) who have contributed the most to the defense of the Frontiers, the welfare of the Gods, the construction of the city and the Pyramid. Keops is an action building game, with worker placement and resource management mechanics. The actions available at the start of the game are related to obtaining materials to build the Pyramid and defending the borders. However, as players build the city, and new temples and crops, the available actions will increase, increasing the possibilities and strategies. Each game of Keops is conditioned to what the players build, so each one will be a different experience. This, added to the different families available and the use of the Decree cards, which modify the rules of the game, make each game completely different. This is one of the strong points of Keops.<br/><br/>The game is played over three rounds, the end of each round being determined by the level of construction of the pyramid. During a round, players will play their turns one at a time, assigning their officials to the various actions or removing them from the central board to obtain their rents and pay their salaries. Each of the buildings that have been constructed are available to all players, regardless of who built them. However, you will receive benefits every time another player makes use of one of your buildings. This is important when it comes to developing your long-term strategy, as it provides extra income, which always comes in handy. In Keops there are no victory points. To win the game you will have to win the favor of the Pharaoh Jufu. Be the player with more offerings in the temple of Ra, to obtain the favor of the priests of the Pharaoh. Build the Pyramid to earn the favor of the architects' guild of Jufu. Defend the Borders hiring Medjays to avoid the invasion of your territories and not to lose resources, workers or your own buildings. And build the city to obtain Prestige, thus gaining the Favor of the Pharaoh's court. At the end of each level of the Pyramid, players will have the opportunity to obtain these favors, but also to lose them...<br/><br/>For the most daring, the Ra-utoma deck adds a virtual player with three levels of difficulty in games for 1 to 3 players, who will make things difficult for the Viziers. All this under the watchful eye of Jufu, who will not stop in the construction of his great tomb. Although players do not build the Pyramid, the game itself will do it little by little, so every action becomes relevant, because you never know how much time you have left to obtain the Pharaoh's favor.<br/><br/>",

You need to buy more boats to increase the columns on which you can fish. You need to buy reef cards (5 in total) on which you breed the parents, first to get 5 offspring wins. There are also pearl cards, which act as joker worms, and sharks, which eliminate cards by eating them.<br/><br/>There is a deck of offspring, 4 are dealt up, being combinations of the 5 colors. So there are blue green fish, pink yellow fish, purple purple fish. The parents are in the same colors, some male, some female. So, for example, to collect the blue green baby fish, you need a blue male and green female, or a blue female and green male. Any used cards go to the discard, which gets shuffled round and feed back into the reef. The cost of cards depends on their position on the reef, and there is a rule for flowing cards through past your boats.<br/><br/>The Reef is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>",

The board is created by 25 randomized tiles to keep the game fresh each match.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing counters of their color on the intersections of the tiles. When the board is full (after each player has placed 18 counters), the majorities are checked for each tile. The player who has the majority of corners of a tile receives the books inside as points. A mouse is worth -1pt because it eats a book. In case of total control of the tile, the points received or lost are increased by 1.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each card features a vial that contains several liquids &ndash; that is, colored and numbered suits &ndash; and players will collect these cards if they win the trick. Each player has a randomly-dealt public color that counts as negative points for them, and after checking their dealt cards each player chooses a secret hidden color for which they'll score positive points at game end. Finally, each player chooses two more colors that will be added to the trump deck.<br/><br/>Each round, a card from the trump deck is revealed, then players sequentially play any card from their hand. Whoever plays the card with the highest trump color wins the trick. But beware! Since the vials contain liquids in several colors, even if the trump is blue, you could be getting a lot of red liquid!<br/><br/>After all cards in hand have been played, the game ends, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

To increase the pressure on Paris and Normandy, Henry IV lays siege to Evreux as well. The Duke of Mayenne, lieutenant general of the kingdom of France for the League, decides to go meet the Royalist army. <br/>The clash occurs on the great prairie of Ivry where the king makes his famous speech about his white panache during the charge against Egmont&rsquo;s Spanish lancers.<br/><br/>- Marc&rsquo;hallac&rsquo;h 1591<br/>After the entry into the League of the governor of Brittany, Philippe de Merc&oelig;ur, Henry IV replaces him with the Prince of Dombes.

Things seemed to change with the arrival of 7000 Spaniards for the League and 2400 British for the Royalists.

In Empires at Sea, you play as one of five nations, and work to amass the largest empire at the end of 15 rounds of play.<br/><br/>A Quick Overview of the Game<br/><br/>Each Round opens with a History Card, which hurts or helps one nation or another based on the actual impact of the actual historical event. A Weather Card is played, limiting or improving movement for all players for the Round (e.g., ships can only move North and East). Next, all players gain resources, based on the Ports they own, plus any Resource Cards played during the game.<br/><br/>Each player then takes a turn, first by playing a Captain's Card (used to launch a ship, advance your military, strengthen a port, etc) and then by sailing their fleet to take command of new ports, trade, or attack their enemies. The combat system is based on a roll of the dice, plus modifiers for ship size, the weather gauge, military advancements, and Captain's Orders.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, all players may bribe the Pirate. The highest bidder gets to use this ship to attack their friends/enemies/loved-ones.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you tally up your Empire score based on the ships you sink, the ships you command, the ports you own, and the gold and resources you've collected. The biggest Empire wins.<br/><br/>",

Two category cards are in play, and on your turn, you must say something that fits in one category and something that fits in the other, with both of those somethings not having been said previously. If you can't think of something, you can play a category card from the three in your hand to cover the one you're blanking on, then name something from that new category. If you can't think of something for a category, you must take that pile as a penalty, then flip a new category from the deck.<br/><br/>If you say something that fits both categories at the same time, you can either discard one of your penalty cards or draw a new category card from the deck, then play a third category card to the table. (Once someone is penalized, drop back to two categories.)<br/><br/>Keep your friends' iffy answers in check with judge cards, and win by collecting the fewest cards once the deck runs out.<br/><br/>",

But be careful: if all of your remaining stock holdings crash, it is possible to be eliminated before the game is even over.<br/><br/>Originally published in 1961 as Broker by the Spencer-Murray Corporation of Swarthmore, Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>The original box is white, with lettering and logo in black, very basic, drab, and uninspiring. Yet this obscure title was quite a gem considering the limitation of games to choose from during its day.<br/><br/>In 1967 it was re-published by the German firm Otto Maier Verlag, which is the ancestor of Ravensburger Verlag. Numerous re-publications followed (1972, 1977 and others) including at least one which gave the rules in German, English and Italian. It was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.<br/>Components list for these editions are as follows: 160 stock certificates, 68 Market Action cards, 4 price markers, play money, stock price board.<br/><br/>The 1983 (9th edition) by Ravensburger changes the title slightly to B&ouml;rsenspiel instead of Das B&ouml;rsenspiel and the original rules heavily. Although this set is well-designed and much nicer on the eyes, the bland original version featured larger (regular card deck) size action cards. An extra set of 18 &quot;risk&quot; cards replacing 18 market cards had been added and they act as event cards that immediately effect changes in the market.

        "description": "The wicked witch Grimelda has cursed the wizard Akata and imprisoned him in a magic book. As you are brave adventurers, you venture into the magic labyrinth to free the wizard &ndash; but you cannot do this without the help of its inhabitants. Visit the inhabitants and bring them certain items. You will receive coveted magic stones as a reward! The first player to fill his magic key with the magic stones and return to his starting field wins. But beware! Danger lurks everywhere...<br/><br/>In Das Elektronik Labyrinth, designer Reiner Knizia marries his facility for electronics in board games (e.g., Wer war's? and Die Insel) with Max J. Kobbert's long-running Labyrinth series of games from Ravensburger.<br/><br/>The basic game play is the same as in Labyrinth. The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.<br/><br/>After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.<br/><br/>In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.<br/><br/>The game comes with a &quot;book&quot; containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.<br/><br/>",

Once you regain your full powers, you will unleash your Doom upon the world!<br/><br/>There's only one problem: You're not alone. The other Great Old Ones are here as well, and your rivals are determined to steal your cultists and snatch victory from your flabby claws! It's a race to the ultimate finish as you crush houses, smash holes in reality, and fight to call down The Doom That Came To Atlantic City!<br/><br/>You and your fellow players are Great Old Ones competing to be the first to destroy the world. There are two ways to achieve this:<br/><br/><br/>    Any Great Old One can win by obtaining six gates, at which point the game instantly ends. You have only five gate markers because if you open a sixth gate, you win!<br/><br/><br/><br/>    At the start of the game, each Great Old One receives a Doom card providing a shortcut to victory. If you land on one of your gates and meet the preconditions, you may attempt the action listed on your Doom. If you succeed, you win!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe StoryBlend it Like Becca&mdash;a small-town smoothie shop sensation!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s been a slow night, and Becca the shop owner, her young son Kevin and the Master Mixers -- including you! -- have started closing up shop. One minute before close, the door swings open. Outside, you see parked school buses and a line of people all the way to the street corner! The high school girl&rsquo;s volleyball tournament has just gotten out, and everyone is craving a smoothie for the ride home. Becca cuts a deal: whoever blends the most smoothies tonight gets free smoothies for a month!<br/><br/>The Blend Off has begun, and only one can win. There&rsquo;s just one problem: Kevin. Skittish at best on normal days, he flies into a frenzy, grabbing fruit for you from the fridge at random. Grab the fruit, complete the Orders, and blend your way to victory!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOverviewBlend Off! is a game of skill and speed for two to four players from designer Scot Eaton. Master Mixers roll the die (Kevin) to collect fruit to fill Orders from the deck (Becca). When a Master Mixer's fruit matches the Order, they can blend the ingredients and claim the Order for gold stars. There are no turns; everyone plays at the same time in a race for the finish. The winner is the player with the most gold stars at the end of the game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplayThe actions the player may take at any time are: Collect, Blend, Dump, and Blunder.<br/><br/>Collect - Roll your die to send Kevin to the fridge for fruit. You may take one of the fruit from the table and put it on one of your Blenders. You don&rsquo;t have to take the fruit; you may reroll the dice until Kevin brings you what you want.<br/><br/>Dump - You may dump the fruit out of one of your Blenders. Because the fruit is already mixed together, you may not dump just one or two ingredients; you must dump the whole Blender. You may, however, choose to dump one Blender into another, combining ingredients.<br/><br/>Blend - When the fruit in one of your Blenders matches the recipe on one of the faceup Orders, shout out &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Blunder - If you catch another player make a mistake like calling &ldquo;Blend!&rdquo; with wrong or extra ingredients in their Blender, shout &ldquo;Blunder!&rdquo; They must correct their mistake by dumping their Blender and, returning the Order card for their botched recipe to Becca&rsquo;s deck.<br/><br/>",

You have ships full of passengers and precious cargo, but can you outrun pirate robbers, terrifying storms and a stock market crash that might devalue your goods?<br/><br/>Manifest is a game of cargo ships, sea scoundrels, and nautical mayhem. Win points for your shipping company by completing Contracts. Pick up the required goods or passengers at their source, then navigate the high seas to deliver them to their destination.

The Standard game is the introductory and family game. The Expert game builds on this, with a deck-buying and building mechanism replacing the blind card draw, thus adding another level of strategy that confident players may prefer.<br/><br/>",

The terrain analysis includes rivers, woods, rough, mountains, karst, swamp, and impassable mountains. Six-hundred die cut counters represent the military units of the nine nations that took part in the campaign. Units are deployed as individual battalions, regiments, brigades, and divisions - each with its historical designation, strengths, and capabilities. Aircraft units are groups of approximately 40-50 planes organized by type (such as fighter or dive-bomber) and model (from obsolete CR.42 biplanes to Me109's). The Hungarian Duna river flotilla is included; for future Europa use, so are the entire navies of Greece and Yugoslavia.<br/><br/>The standard Europa rules present a framework of movement, combat, and combat/motorized exploitation. Special considerations cover Greek mountain capability, the Yugoslav coup, and British naval interdiction.<br/><br/>Marita-Merkur is designed to be played by itself as a seperate game, and also to mate with other Europa games.<br/><br/>Game components: <br/><br/>    one and a half maps (14 &amp; 15a)<br/>    two and a half sheets of die cut counters (#20=240 counters, #21=240 counters, #22=120 counters) = 600 total counters<br/>    one rules folder<br/>    one set of charts:<br/>        Map Legend<br/>        Italian, Hungarian &amp; German Order of Battle / Reinforcements<br/>        Greek &amp; British Order of Battle / Reinforcements<br/>        Jugoslav Order of Battle<br/>        Axis Unit Breakdown Chart / Axis Victory Points<br/>        Unit Identification Chart / Unit Symbols<br/>        Turn Record Chart / Weather table / Allied Breakdown Chart / Allied Victory Points<br/>        Combat Results Tables / Terrain Effects Chart (x2)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

No two games will play the same as changing Fate and Rune cards are introduced to create a variable game board offering phenomenal replayability. Players will be executing exciting combinations and managing valuable resources, all while cautiously engaging other players.<br/><br/>To begin the game, the game board is seeded with five Starting Rune cards, six Rune cards at random, and one randomly-drawn Fate card. Once the first player is determined, they gain the powerful Primus Token and randomly determine the placement of the starting &quot;Round 1&quot; card, while all other players receive one Skill card or one gem.<br/><br/>Players then take turns placing or socketing one die at a time onto a Rune card of their choice, yielding Skill and Power cards, gems or victory points, and they can even attack other players.&nbsp;After all dice have been placed, the cards on the board are resolved in sequential order. As each die is removed, the effect of that placement is resolved. This sequence makes for exciting combinations and rewards strategic play.<br/><br/>All resources of the game are finite, so players need to play carefully in order to avoid wasting placements. The game ends after five rounds or immediately if any player reaches  Victory on the Score Track.<br/><br/>",

The data includes information on Speed, flying qualities, armament, ability to absorb punishment, etc.<br/><br/>Aces High, although not as detailed as Wings, includes rules for stalls, spins, ropey (unreliable) engines, aircrew quality, spotting, archie (anti-aircraft fire), and more.<br/>Aces High even has rules for different types of missions, from photo-reconnaissance to balloon busting to bombing.<br/><br/>The number of maneuvers is limited to banks, turns, sideslips, and half-loops. For example, there are no rules for Immelman turns or barrel-rolls, but the Immelman is accomplished just as in real life... a half-roll followed by continuous banking from the inverted position back to the upright position; a barrel roll is accomplished by a combination of banking and altitude changes during otherwise forward-flight.<br/><br/>There is an interesting rule for ace pilots where the ace pilot can withhold (i.e. not write a movement plot for) a certain number of movement points. After the non-aces have completed their entire movement plot then the ace's can plot out the rest of their move and therefore react to the less-skilled pilots actions. The number of points the ace can withhold is based on the 'grade' of the pilot with a 'grade 5' pilot unable to withhold any points to a 'grade 1' pilot being able to withhold 3.<br/><br/>Game related to Aces High: The American Aces<br/><br/>",

Its Great and Lesser Houses rise and fall with the whims of its Family Royal, the Sovereign House Kythid&ucirc;hr. Amidst the festivals of summer, House Kythid&ucirc;hr announced its intent to elevate one of D&ucirc;hr&rsquo;s Lesser Houses to Great House status. By autumn&rsquo;s frosts, the Lesser Houses were deeply embroiled in a fierce battle for the coveted title. Not with soldiers, for that would waste blood and gold, but with the most insidious of political weapons: suspicion and scandal. They attacked each other with aspersions and calumny, well devised and craftily exploited, designed to erode the social standing of their rival Houses and thereby remove them from contention.<br/><br/>D&ucirc;hr: The Lesser Houses accommodates 4 to 6 players. Each player is the master of a Lesser House of D&ucirc;hr, vying for Great House status. Players take turns using cards in their hand to trigger events, place suspicions and scandals on each other&rsquo;s House, or activate their own House&rsquo;s unique ability to affect cards already placed. The accumulation of suspicion and scandal cards on a House card erodes the populace&rsquo;s favor for that House by raising suggestions of wrongdoing or embroiling it in scandals that incite public outrage.<br/><br/>All Houses begin the game without any suspicions or scandals and favored by the people of D&ucirc;hr. When a House accumulates a combined total of 5 suspicion and/or scandal cards, that House falls into disfavor with the populace. If a disfavored House ever has 3 or more revealed scandal cards, the House becomes vilified. The game ends immediately when the number of favored Houses remaining is 1 or none. Whoever has the highest score at that point wins the game. It is possible for a disfavored or vilified House to outscore a favored House and win the game!<br/><br/>Pronunciation note: pronounce &quot;&ucirc;&quot; in &quot;D&ucirc;hr&quot; like the &quot;oo&quot; in &quot;doom.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Space Station Zero, a miniatures-agnostic tabletop wargame where you and your friends explore the hidden depths of the ancient station to uncover its darkest secrets... and perhaps survive. Designed to play solo, co-op, or as an adversarial skirmish game, Space Station Zero is created by Adam Loper and Vincent Venturella for 1-4 players<br/><br/>Use any sci-fi miniatures you'd like to explore the massive and mysterious space station you and your crew have found yourselves in after an unsuccessful hyperspace jump. Enjoy a deep campaign system with a branching mission structure and overcome all challenges - and learn the truth of Space Station Zero.<br/><br/>The players gather 5-9 miniatures to be their crew, building stats for each one based on the type of crew chosen (Medical, Science, War, Shipping, Pirate, Exploration). This crew is used to explore the unknown sections of Space Station Zero. Each turn or challenge represents exploring one compartment of the station and contains varying opponents or environmental dangers that must be overcome (some chosen by random die rolls). Rolling for each activation, the player moves their crew into the compartment. If activation fails, the AI opponent then begins to move against the player. Once the challenge is overcome there is a choice of next challenge. This branching adventure moves through the two dozen challenges allowing for a different experience each game.<br/><br/>The game can end horrifically with the death of the entire crew (permadeath is a real thing in this game), or the crew can come to the end of their particular branching narrative.<br/><br/>A winning play of Space Station Zero is accomplished by successfully overcoming each challenge along the branching path that unfolds during the course of the campaign.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Compass Games website:)<br/><br/>Storming the Reich is a game about the World War II Allied campaign to liberate Northwest Europe from Nazi occupation. It is a game of brutal attrition and slashing advances. Opening on the evening of D-Day, with the Allies on the beaches and the Germans reacting (albeit belatedly) to the landings, the game covers the full campaign through to the battle of the Ruhr Pocket in April of 1945.<br/><br/>With plenty of armor, paratroop divisions, naval gunfire, air superiority and even the 79th Funnies, the Allies will break out from the beaches and race across France toward the Seine River. To keep pace with operations they will face difficult logistical decisions including the grounding of units and Red Ball Express in favor of other operations, a surprisingly thin infantry leash, and whether to give Monty the lead in offensive operations over Patton (or vice-versa)&hellip; For the Allies there&rsquo;s a chance at an early auto-victory for breaking out of the landing areas ahead of schedule, but they can quickly lose the game if they don&rsquo;t cross the Seine on schedule.<br/><br/>The German player will need to counter the Allied push with a healthy dose of reinforcements (admittedly of low quality), but with very limited replacements. They will need to take advantage of opportunities to thwart the Allies such as when Monty looks the other way at Antwerp, and they can even win the game, although not the war, by launching a successful Counteroffensive (aka. The Bulge). Careful use of Panzer Brigades and Tiger Battalions in offense and defense will play a key role in stopping the Allies.<br/><br/>Storming the Reich is a two-map game with units portrayed mostly at division level (with some armored brigades and battalions). Each hex is about 8 miles across (or about 13km). Each turn represents a month of operations except during summer where each turn is 2 weeks. For players of Red Storm over the Reich, there are many similarities such as the variable movement allowances for both sides (a key feature for fog of war, variability, replay value, and solitaire play) and the same basic combat engine. A key difference is the elimination of the Redeployment Phase.<br/><br/>There are 3 scenarios included. Scenario one is the full 15-turn campaign using both maps, beginning on D-Day and ending in April of 1945. The second is a one-map &ldquo;Normandy Breakout&rdquo; scenario &ndash; at only 4 turns it is a perfect learning scenario covering the initial desperate fighting following the landings. Lastly is a one-map &ldquo;Bulge to Victory&rdquo; scenario where both players really get to flex their gaming muscles.<br/><br/><br/>Ted Raicer's game on the campaign for Northwest Europe, using a variation of his Red Storm Over the Reich system. <br/>It does not link up with Red Storm Over the Reich.<br/><br/>",

It is preposterously easy to learn and teach, but has sneaky twists and turns that will reveal themselves every time you play - a lovely little treat for whoever fancies climbing aboard.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll play through 5 turns. Each turn has three steps:<br/><br/>     At the start of each turn, the Host rolls a pair of dice and determine a Banquet Goal.<br/>     The Host makes 3 &quot;scavenge&quot; rolls and rats collect supplies.<br/>     The Rats compare supplies with the Host to see who gets to take special actions. There are five different types of supply, and five different things you can do.<br/><br/><br/>Goals are scored at the END of the game. The game ends after five turns. The last turn begins when you circle the 5th goal. After this final turn, the rats throw the banquet. The Host who was decided at the end of the final turn leads the rats through the Awards Ceremony, checking each circled Banquet Goal from lowest to highest number to see who won awards for each goal.<br/><br/>The rat with the MOST awards is deemed the most fabulous aboard and wins the ship&rsquo;s only life raft. (If there is a tie, the final Host selects which rat with the most awards deserves the life raft.) Everyone applauds the winner. Finally, the rat with the FEWEST awards flips a coin. If the coin lands on heads? Congratulations! All the rats escape into the ice-cold water, moments before the ship sinks. But if the coin lands on tails? Do send our regards to the captain.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game theme is the Portuguese Discoveries in the 15th and 16th century, and their contribution to Portuguese wealth, symbolized in the Jer&oacute;nimos Monastery. It is an historic fact that the spices trade, brought by the Caravelles, had to pay a tax of 5% in Lisbon, and this tax was used to pay for the monastery construction.<br/><br/>The goal is to achieve the highest possible number of victory points (VPs). The game ends when the last piece of Jeronimos is bought by any player.<br/><br/>The boardgame is the world map with 32 ports / destinations marked around the world (Americas, Africa, Asia and Indic Islands). In 8 of them you can collect the respective merchandise from that port. The board has also marked the real sea currents that the Caravelles followed at the time. It is surprising that often the fastest way is not the shortest, and the game reveals that perfectly.<br/><br/>Each player has a card representing 3 ships, and indicating the player's ability to travel (translated into 9 navigation discs) and the cargo capacity (translated into 6 different merchandise spaces).<br/><br/>The players place their wood ship piece in the board in Lisbon and start navigating. If they follow the sea currents marked in the board, they can do it &quot;free of charge&quot; and endlessly. But they wouldn't go very far. Every time a player wants to go in a different direction than the one indicated by the sea current, he has to use a navigation disc from his player card. When all the navigation discs are used, the player turn stops. So, in each turn, a player can go against the currents at most 9 times, thus determining how far he can go.<br/><br/>During navigation, players arrive in ports. If they are the first to get there, that is, if they are the ones that discover that local, they can place their coloured marker in that port and register the number of VPs marked for that port. If the port is a &quot;trade port&quot; (there are 8), the player can also collect the respective merchandise and place it in his player card.<br/><br/>But there are also some possible surprises. When navigate, players can pass by special marked cells which force them some kind of effect:<br/><br/>- &quot;Event&quot; cells: for each round, players have 5 &quot;Event&quot; cards in their hand; when they pass over these cells, they must choose a card from their hand. These cards can be of 3 types: &quot;Storm Card&quot;, &quot;Dead Calm Sea Cards&quot; and &quot;Good Wind Cards&quot;, thus having negative or positive effects in their navigation. But they also have an effect on other players, but for these the effect is always positive. This creates interest during players downtime. <br/>- &quot;Pirate Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players lose immediately 1 of their navigation discs. they can only enter the cell if they have the necessary disc available to pay.<br/>- &quot;Sinking Cells&quot;: when passing over these cells, players must take their chance with a 50/50 dice - worse can happen is they lose 1 of the 3 ships they have (or 4 - see below), and the corresponding cargo space. They will only get it back when they arrive in Lisbon.<br/><br/>After some time of navigation, of discovering new ports and collecting one each of the possible 6 merchandises that his player card can carry, the player returns to Lisbon.<br/><br/>In Lisbon the player can:<br/>- trade merchandises per VPs (5 each)<br/>- specifically, the merchandise &quot;pepper&quot; can be traded for 1 piece of the Jeronimos Monastery which worths 10 VPs, which are immediately registered<br/>- the player can also trade 15 VPs for a 4th ship - this 4th ship gives him 3 more navigation discs (increasing it's navigation autonomy from 9 to 12) and 2 more merchandise space cargo.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a number of Objective Cards with specific Ports. If they are the first player to get to that port, they will receive 5 extra VPs per each at the end of the game. These VPs can be decisive in the victory decision.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Xactika is an original card game that challenges players' ability to estimate the outcome of playing eight cards. You must predict the chances of being able to take the other players' cards that are laid down during each round. There is no drawing or discarding. You must predict exactly &ndash; hence the name Xactika &ndash; the number of rounds in which you will be able to take the cards played. Cards that appear too weak to take a trick initially may become strong enough to do so as the hand evolves. Players must recognize the value of their hand, not just from having the highest point cards in one of the four combinations on each card, but also from an understanding of the chances that for some of their other cards that no cards of the same combination may remain in the hands of the other players. Xactika, while of the same genre as Spades or Euchre, has more opportunity and takes a little more skill.<br/><br/>To play you must examine your hand to find cards in specific combinations that have values that are greater than your opponents. Some cards are sure bets, but only if you can take the lead. Other cards have a high probability of taking a trick, but this depends upon how the cards are played by others. So, careful attention must be paid to the moves of other players. You must also arrange to play your cards so that at the end of each hand you don't get stuck with a trick you don't want. The outcome of a hand is not determined until the end of the eight rounds, so each player must keep focused on the play throughout each of the eight hands of the game. Keep on your toes, and figure out how to take, as well as avoid taking, tricks. There are a number of ways to play each hand, but finding the way to make exactly the right numbers of bids is the challenge.<br/><br/>",

Discover wild new spell powers in this innuendo-filled, standalone version of the original game. Sparkle*Kitty Nights adds hidden roles and cooperative play to the game. Time to get ready, it's about to get naughty! Designed to easily mix and match with the original Sparkle*Kitty game and expansion packs, Sparkle*Kitty Nights adds So. Many. Naughty. Word. Spell. Combinations!<br/><br/>Knights roam the night, seeking someone to save, but Miss Sparkle*Kitty aims to misbehave. The princesses are gone and now the Knights find themselves locked in the tower! Players are Knights on Team Naughty or Team Nice - or maybe the Dragon! Find your teammates while casting saucy, twisted spells that are as mature as you make 'em to escape your tower. Spells are cast via card play into a spellbook just like the original game. Wild new abilities and sneaky enchantments are now in play as Knights work to free themselves and their teammates.<br/><br/>The first team to escape their towers by removing all tower sections win - unless the dragon is in the game and frees themselves and an unsuspecting Knight's last tower card to snatch victory. Tower sections are removed in a variety of ways including: playing the last card from your hand, matching a word in play (out of turn play), and playing special spell cards.<br/><br/>Into the crazy mix of silly word spell casting, Sparkle*Kitty Nights adds bluffing and cooperative team play. Players now may choose to remove tower sections from other players they believe are on their team - but were they mislead? Did they just free the Dragon? The dragon is used when there is an odd number of players, but commands special powers, such as being able to expose themselves at any time to become immune to certain effects.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each property group has a given dollar value, which you can collect by rolling the dice and collecting that group.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll ten dice, set aside any die reading &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;to&quot; or &quot;jail&quot;, then set aside any color group dice that you wish. If the &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;to&quot; and &quot;jail&quot; dice are set aside, your turn ends immediately, and you score nothing. Otherwise you can choose to either (1) stop and score for what you've rolled or (2) roll again with any dice not set aside, once again setting aside the &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;to&quot; or &quot;jail&quot; dice, etc. The dice have a couple of &quot;Wild&quot; faces, and you can use at most one Wild in a color group. (If you roll the proper color, you can replace a Wild die in a group and roll that die again on a later turn.)<br/><br/>If you stop, you score for all completed color groups and one incomplete color group. Your goal is to be the first player to reach a predetermined dollar amount or to have the most money at the end of a pre-set number of turns.<br/><br/>Monopoly Express &ndash; an updated version of this game that was first released in the UK and Europe, then later in the U.S. &ndash; alters the gameplay as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     The policeman from the &quot;Go To Jail&quot; corner of the board game replaces the words &quot;Go,&quot; &quot;to&quot; and &quot;jail&quot;.<br/>     One blank face on one of the policeman dice depicts a green &quot;GO&quot; arrow. A player earns $200 each time they roll GO, but they lose this money if they bust due to policemen. <br/>     The game includes an eleventh &quot;House/Hotel&quot; die that can earn (or lose) a player Houses (worth $1,000 each), earn Hotels (worth $5,000, but only if a player has already earned four houses) and a &quot;Get Out Of Jail Free&quot; side that negates a policeman (including a policeman that would bust a player). This die cannot be rolled until a player completes a property group (i.e., neither railroads nor utilities).<br/>     The Wild faces are replaced by the Chance &quot;?&quot; logo; the ? act as a Wild, but unlike a Wild it cannot be replaced.<br/>     The first player to have at least $15,000 wins immediately; players don't complete the round.<br/><br/><br/>In 2021, this game was re-released in the US as Monopoly DICED! with square packaging rather than the round used for Express.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Simple but fun game based on playing from a hand of cards representing robots. Each has special powers and affects the stack (stak) in different ways, making it more tactical than a simple rock-paper-scissors exercise.<br/><br/>The game functions by giving each player a stack of cards as well as a hand.  Each turn, players take a new card from the shared draw pile and may add a face-up card to the stack, trash a card from the stack or from their hand.  When a card is played, it will have &quot;entry effect&quot; that may operate on the stack ordering of the player or opponent.<br/><br/>Once all playing/trashing is finished for a turn, the player may attack the card on top of an opponent's stack with the top card of their own.  The battle itself is quite simple and just a matter of comparing power, although assuming your bot survives its first battle, it can go on to attack the newly revealed card underneath.  The real tactical consideration goes into the pre-attack stack manipulation phase.<br/><br/>There is an open turn structure which allows players to carry out actions in any order and any number of times. This means they can react to the often unpredictable results of long entry effect chains, or to cards that their opponents play defensively during your turn.<br/><br/>The game is also customisable: you can adjust the complexity or game length by adding more Staks for each player or by changing basic game mechanics.<br/><br/>",

The 2 maps use hexagons to regulate placement and movement of units, and have overlays for the hills creating a 3D effect. The smaller map represents the area around the Golan Heights: the frontier region between Israel, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. The Jordan River crosses the map from north to south, with the Galilean Sea in the middle. The big map represents the Sinai, focused on the area around the Suez Canal.<br/><br/>The basic game is only played on the Sinai map. Each turn corresponds to 2 days and is subdivided into 10 phases. The Egyptian player goes first, taking 4 phases. Then the Israeli player takes 6 phases. During each phase players can move their units. Combat takes place, using a calculation based on the number of units a player has.<br/><br/>The advanced game is played on both maps by 2, 3, or 4 players. The aircraft combat rules are introduced. The aircraft are divided into 3 categories: bombers, interceptors, and fighter-bombers. Each turn is divided into 9 phases. Arabian player turn has 4 phases and the Israeli 5.<br/><br/>Victory is calculated by comparing victory points:<br/>- for Israel, 20 points if Damascus is occupied, 5 points for any other Syrian city occupied, 2 points for each intact bunker, 1 point for each reduced bunker, 5 points for each unit standing west of the Canal, 2 points for each Egyptian bridge destroyed.<br/>- for the Arabs, 10 points for each Israeli city occupied, 2 points if the Syrian bunker remains intact, 10 points for each controlled pass, 1 point for each unit exiting along the coast road to Israel, 1 point for each Israeli unit eliminated. If less than 16 units are standing east of the Canal, the player has to remove (16 - number of unit) to the score.<br/><br/>",

But just when you think  you're the big fish... a bigger fish comes along.  Gobble up the most fish and you win!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The goal of Fish Eat Fish is for a player to catch as many fish pieces as possible. Stacks of 1 to 5 fish are moved around the board in search of prey. Adjacent stacks engage in combat. Cards are played, and the number on the card is added to the number of fish in a player's stack.  Highest total wins the combat, and that player's stack is placed on top of the loser's stack. If a stack contains more than 5 fish, the extras are placed in the winner's pool of caught fish. Ties result in both stacks of fish being discarded. Cards may only be played once, so players must balance the need to win a combat with the need to hold on to high cards for future combats against growing stacks.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to steal an ancient relic from a massive structure floating in space. The players compete against each other, all trying to bring home the Relic. The game has a capture-the-flag system.<br/><br/>The gameplay mechanics are based around a maze made up out of primary coloured doorways (red, blue and yellow), two doorways touching each other make a combination of colours that can (or not if the two colours are the same) form a secondary colour. The aliens you play with are made up out of these secondary colours, each player has three aliens: 1 green, 1 orange and 1 purple. Aliens can only pass through doorways that form their secondary colour.<br/><br/>While moving through the maze the players will continuously have to change the maze to get the right colour combinations. And while everybody is getting closer together, players will start to be in each others way, eventually changing the maze in ways others will not be too happy about. Especially not when you prevent them from grabbing the relic!<br/><br/>This is a game where you plan ahead for a perfect round, just to see it all being completely overthrown by some odd move your opponent is making (providing all other players with some cheap laughs). Most of the time spreading your chances will be the best way to go, but you can always rush for it and hope for the best...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Defending America is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of an actual or experimental interceptor aircraft during a frightening look at what might have been in World War II. Each turn consists of one sortie, during which the player will fly a mission to intercept Amerika Bombers which are en route to bomb the mainland of the United States.  As the player progresses, he may choose to upgrade to even more advanced interceptors in this alternate history game.  It builds a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to earn skills, rise in rank through promotion, receive awards and survive a dangerous year above the Atlantic Ocean and America.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a interceptor pilot and rack up as many bomber kills as possible, with a special emphasis on preparing to stop atomic attacks. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. Awards and technological advances via use of the technology track help to narrate the player's eventual goal &ndash; to become the &ldquo;Scourge of the Amerika Bombers&rdquo; and end the threat to the United States from the air.<br/><br/>Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot along with your assignment, play proceeds by taking off when the enemy bomber force nears, then checking to intercept them before they get a chance to bomb a multitude of targets on the mainland United States. Combat consists of interception from your U.S. carrier or land-based aircraft, depending on where the player is currently located, then intercepting one of six historically modelled (albeit hypothetical) Amerika Bombers. After interception, landing operations occur, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain if any awards have been earned or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Experience points if desired to gain skills and may request a new interceptor type if one is available. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until the end of March 1948, should you make it through unscathed.<br/><br/>While Defending Amerika is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions, and an option to link the game with Amerika Bomber: Evil Queen of the Skies<br/><br/>Scale:<br/>    Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>    Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10<br/>    Time Scale: Weekly turns (individual sorties, 4 per month)<br/>    Map Scale: Abstract<br/>    Unit Scale: Individual aircraft, weapon systems, specific crew members, and ammo rounds<br/>    Players: One (with option for two or more)<br/>    Playing Time: 60-90 minutes<br/><br/>Components:<br/>    One Counter Sheet of 9/16&quot; unit-counters<br/>    Eight Aircraft Display Mats<br/>    Nine Player Aid Cards<br/>    One Combat Display Mat<br/>    One Pilot Awards Display Mat<br/>    One Air Operations Mat<br/>    Rules Booklet<br/>    One Logsheet<br/>    Two 6-sided, and one 10-sided die<br/>    Box and Lid<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Pikto, you want to draw pictures so that whoever is guessing this round might be able to identify your drawing &mdash; but will you go for a simple image that the guesser might have first crack at (and miss), or a more detailed image that might have you waiting to see whether someone else's image is guessed first?<br/><br/>In more detail, each player receives a dry-erase board and a pen. One player is the guesser for the round, and they step away from the table or hide their eyes while everyone else draws a word or phrase. To choose what to draw, roll the twelve-sided die, then consult the appropriate number on the card that you drew. (The box has 46 double-sided cards, with twelve words/phrases on each side, or 1104 total answers.) Show everyone but the guesser the word to be drawn.<br/><br/>Everyone then draws their own image on their dry-erase board, but you can use only straight lines and circles in your drawing! Nothing else! No wiggly lines, half-circles, or anything else other than straight lines and circles. If you want to draw a triangle, you must draw three straight lines and connect them. After you complete your drawing, count how many objects you drew, write that number in the lower-right corner of your board, then set your board face down on the table.<br/><br/>Once everyone has finished, everyone announces their numbers, and whoever has the lowest number is the first player to reveal their board to the guesser. (In the event of a tie, whichever tied player finished their drawing first wins the tie.) If the guesser identifies the image, the guesser scores two points and the drawer one point; if the guesser is wrong, then the drawer with the next-lowest number reveals their image, now giving the guesser two images with which to identify the secret word. This process continues until the guesser has said the secret word or all drawers have revealed their images.<br/><br/>After everyone has been guesser one or two times, depending on the number of players, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Speed - but not reckless haste - is the key to success.<br/><br/>On 25th April 1915, Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, launched a hastily assembled force of British, Australian, New Zealand and French troops against the Turkish defenses on the Gallipoli peninsula. Their goal was to capture the forts that guarded the Dardanelles. With that achieved, the British and French Fleets would sail to Constantinople, topple the Ottoman government, and open up a supply line to Russia. However, defending the beaches was an equal number of Turkish divisions, hardened in the recent Balkan Wars, led by well-trained Turkish officers, supported by advisors from the German General Staff.<br/><br/>An hour before dawn, in complete silence, the Anzacs rowed ashore at Ari Burnu, a place later to be famous as Anzac Cove. The Royal Navy had landed them in the wrong place! Huge dirt cliffs and scrub-choked washouts confronted them, rather than a beach and low dunes. Nevertheless inland they went, overrunning the Turkish pickets, only to become hopelessly confused by the night landing, jigsaw terrain, and inexperience. Several miles inland, a gifted Turkish Officer, Mustafa Kemal, was reviewing his regiment after night maneuvers above Ari Burnu. Kemal's quick and furious counter-attack saved the day for the Ottomans, and set him on the path to become the founder of modern Turkey. Further south, at Cape Helles, the Lancashire Fusiliers won six Victoria Crosses - before breakfast - as they ripped through the barbed wire on the beach. The invaders never reached even their first day's objectives, although the Turks only avoided defeat by a hair's breadth. With a different plan, they might have thrown the invaders back into the sea.<br/><br/>The map scale is 400 metres per hex and covers the entire peninsula from north of Anzac Cove to Cape Helles, based on the 1922 British Ordnance Survey (i.e. from Anzac to Helles, including all the forts in between). Players can choose to land at the historical beaches, or create their own plans.<br/><br/>This wargame system emphasizes command and control. Players command by Brigade and Regiment. To be successful, a player must plan for the eventual exhaustion of their troops, rotating them out of line to rest and recover stragglers. The result is an accurate modeling of the tempo of these battles. Infantry combat is ranged rifle and MG fire, culminating in close assault. Artillery is powerful but ultimately limited. Shrapnel from the standard field guns is deadly against troops in the open, but only the rare howitzers firing high-angle HE can deal with trenches.  Daylight turns are two hours, night turns are four hours.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives their own sheet and a pencil. 6 dice are rolled, and players take turns drafting a die used to fill in a space on their map. The dice display 5 colors, representing the 5 town types on the map. When a colored die is chosen, the player fills in a space adjacent to a matching colored town.<br/><br/>By reaching towns with groups of filled in spaces, players will trigger town scoring in the book of successes on their sheet. If players plan their routes wisely, these escalating successes can trigger a cascade of combos to give them a competitive edge in earning the public achievements and private bonuses.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when all the public achievements have been claimed or when one player gains all the private bonuses. Players will then tally up their successes and achievements to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Cascadito retains the challenging, combotastic core of Cascadero &mdash; the interplay between the map and book of successes &mdash; while providing a refreshingly unique and complementary experience:<br/><br/>     Players are limited to the dice options on the table, and they must watch their opponent&rsquo;s plans and routes carefully when drafting a die on their turn.<br/>     Features 4 dramatically unique sheets with different maps, tracks, achievements, strategies, landmarks, and bonuses. These sheets are (1) Rural Beginnings, (2) Raiding Bandits, (3) The Two Rivers, and (4) Trade and Defense.<br/>     Contained within a smaller and faster package, great as a filler game or travel companion.<br/>     Includes a solo mode for each sheet with a standard and advanced difficulty.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Obcy (Aliens), is a game based on great sf movie &quot;Aliens&quot;.<br/>The game takes place in the Weyland-Yutani atmospheric processor. One player takes the role of the Alien Queen and other players play as colonial marines (Vasquez, Hicks, Gorman and Hudson), the civilian Ripley and Bishop the android. The humans collect data discs which they bring to computers in order to learn their mission objectives. Once a pre-determined number of those is completed, the Alien Queen is defeated and the team must escape from the base. Every turn the Alien player spawns a die-roll worth of aliens and tries to stop the humans from succeeding. Players can use equipment like rifles, flame throwers, grenades, explosions and many others to fight with hordes of aliens. They even have access to the APC, if they can fuel it. The mechanic is easy (four page manual). The game bears some resemblance to Space Hulk. <br/>The Box includes:<br/><br/>- gameboard<br/>- 6 character cards<br/>- 7 paper figures<br/>- 72 counters of aliens<br/>- 74 counters of equipment<br/>- 16 black counters<br/>- 1 blue counter<br/>- 20 card with tasks<br/>- fight result table<br/>- legend<br/>- dice<br/>- manual<br/><br/>There was expansion made by fans, called Predator. It allowed playing as a Predator, as a third side of the conflict. Predator attacks both aliens and humans, its goal is to kill efficient number of aliens and/or humans.<br/><br/>",

To find the perpetrator, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.<br/><br/>As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone.<br/><br/>You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day. You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.<br/><br/>",

There, two teams fight for control, alternating between day and night phases. Each night, the villains wake up one by one and use their unique abilities to chase their objectives. Each day, the gathering debates and tries to unmask the traitors amongst them, but since no one knows which team other players are on, trusting each other will be tricky, and bluffing will be their best route to dominance within their new surroundings.<br/><br/>While each role is known by the other players, every character also has a &quot;secret alignment&quot; that determines their objective &mdash; making it even trickier to know who to trust!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The honeybee is wild and can be connected with any symbol. Honeycombs&trade; has three unique ways to play, each varying in speed and competitiveness.  Choose the one that suits your mood.<br/>  <br/>Version A &ndash; Worker Bee<br/>   Fast-paced competition between opponents<br/>   (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)<br/><br/>1. Divide tiles evenly among all players/teams. <br/>   2 players = 26 tiles each, 3 players = 17 tiles each, 4 players = 13 tiles each<br/>2. Each player places their tiles face-down in front of themselves.<br/>3. On the word &lsquo;go&rsquo; players turn over their tiles and connect as many matching symbols as possible. It&rsquo;s a race to complete your honeycomb before <br/>  your opponents complete theirs.<br/>4. The first player to connect all their tiles together yells &ldquo;HONEYCOMBS&rdquo;. <br/>   This signifies the end of the round and all other players must immediately stop. <br/>5. Players quickly check the honeycomb of the player nearest to them to see if anyone has broken rules 1 and/or 2 (see rules 1 &quot;Single Match&quot; &amp; 2 <br/>   below). If so, deduct points accordingly. However, if the player finishing first is in violation of the rules, the round <br/>   resumes until someone finishes with a mistake free honeycomb.<br/>6. Next, each player calculates their points for the round - (See Scoring) and tells the scorekeeper. The scorekeeper keeps a running tally of <br/>   everyone&rsquo;s points.<br/>7. Return all tiles to the bag to prepare for another round.<br/>8. The player with the most points after 3 rounds is crowned Queen Bee.<br/><br/>Version B &ndash; One Big Honeycomb<br/>   A leisurely competition, one turn at a time<br/>  (2-4 players / 2-4 teams of 2)<br/><br/>1. Players take turns to build one big honeycomb while collecting individual points.<br/>2. Draw one tile and place it face up in the center of the table.<br/>3. Each player draws three tiles from the bag.<br/>4. Moving clockwise, players choose one of their three tiles and connects it to the honeycomb. One point is earned for every match made and it is added <br/>   the player&rsquo;s total.<br/>5. After each turn, players draw one tile from the bag to replenish their hand.<br/>6. When all 52 tiles have been connected to the honeycomb, the game is over and the player with the most points is the champion.<br/>7. Some tiles have special powers which are indicated in the center of the tile. To maximize their value, be strategic in how you use them. They are <br/>   only active in Version B- One Big Honeycomb.<br/><br/>Special Power Tiles.<br/><br/>Double Points: When playing a tile marked with the Double Points symbol &quot;2X&quot;, all points earned are doubled.<br/><br/>Steal: When playing a tile marked with the Steal symbol (picture of a masked robber) you have the power to steal another player&rsquo;s turn. Before <br/>               a player lays their tile, yell &ldquo;STEAL&rdquo; to indicate you are stealing their turn. Lay your &lsquo;Steal&rsquo; tile and collect your points. <br/>               Replenish your hand to 3 tiles.  Continue with the next scheduled player.<br/><br/>Extra Turn: After taking your normal turn, you can play the Extra Turn tile (tile marked with a symbol of an arrow in a circle) <br/>               right away. It is a bonus turn and does not affect your next turn. Replenish your hand to 3 tiles<br/><br/>Wild Tile: When playing the tile with the &quot;bee&quot; symbol in the center of the tile the player chooses 1 symbol on this tile to become wild. It can <br/>               now be matched with any symbol.  *note: this is not to be confused with the wild bee on the perimeter of the tile.<br/><br/>Version C &ndash; Honeycombs Puzzle<br/>   Work together to build a creative honeycomb<br/><br/>1. All tiles are placed face up on the table as you would with a puzzle.<br/>2. Players work together to build one honeycomb.  The object of this game is to make as many connections as possible.<br/>3. Tiles can be moved around at any time, by any player.<br/>4. Work at your own pace as everyone contributes at the same time.<br/>5. When all tiles are connected to the players&rsquo; satisfaction the game is over.<br/>6. This is a non-competitive version; count the total points and record your score if you want.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Rule 1: Single Match (Applies to Worker Bee Version Only)<br/>When a round is finished, only one tile in a players honeycomb can have a single match. A single match is a one that is isolated (the symbols on either side of it are not matched). This means you cannot string tiles together in a train to finish quickly.<br/><br/>Rule 2: Mismatched Connection<br/>If a mismatched connection is discovered when the round ends, the player must remove the tile with the mismatch without receiving any points<br/>for it. For example, a player may need to remove a tile and forfeits 2 points even though 1 of the connections was a match.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>1 match = 1 point<br/>1 core connection = 5 points<br/>Unused tile = minus 1 point (Worker Bee Version Only)<br/><br/>How to Score<br/>1. Count your core connection points first<br/>2. Count your matches. To ensure accuracy when counting, points should be tallied while you disassemble your honeycomb. As you remove each tile, count <br/>   the number of matches it has. (see picture below)<br/>3. Minus your negative points.<br/><br/>Core Connection<br/><br/>A core connection is a tile that has matched all 6 sides. In the One Big Honeycomb version, the player who placed the 6th and final tile earns the<br/>core connection bonus of 5 points.

There is no wrong way to debate because anything you say in this game is automatically true. If a player states that the galaxy is at war with evil space oysters, then that is the case for the rest of the game. As the debates go on, the players establish the galaxy and how it works, creating a unique experience every time you play.<br/><br/>After each debate the voters use their race cards to vote for the &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; or &ldquo;Con&rdquo; candidate. Voters may choose the candidate who best appealed to their race's needs or whoever had the funniest or most creative response.<br/><br/>At the end the game, the player that received the most votes is elected President of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>",

Each player competes in an armored racer equipped with an assortment of &quot;accessories&quot; not commonly found in your average Auto Parts store. Road hog won't let you pass? No problem&hellip; debate the right of way with a burst of your front machine-guns. Annoyed by that tailgater? &hellip;a few well-timed grenades should scrape him off your bumper. Reckless passer? &hellip;well, if your smoke screen doesn&rsquo;t discourage him, a nudge from your scythe-blade hubcaps should do the job. And these are just the &quot;standard&quot; accessories. In the Advanced Game, you can customize your car into something even James Bond would envy.<br/><br/>Running low on fuel &hellip; better pull into the next Rest Stop, but beware of sabotage or theft. Only losers nap during RoadKill. Besides, what better time to salt the track with tire spikes or change a road sign or two. Everything goes in Roadkill, an uproarious game of highway combat more vicious than the Santa Monica Freeway.<br/><br/>Players vie for the lead so they may lay the next section of the course. For example, a player with a Nuclear Fuel Cell will want to lead the others on a merry chase through mountainous terrain to sap their fuel. However, someone already running on fumes will opt for a desert straight-away to finish the race before he must pit and relinquish the lead. But pole position has its price-attracting more than its share of misfortune, while slipstreaming provides opportunities back in the pack.<br/><br/>As if the players don't heap enough mayhem upon each other, the game throws an endless series of monkey wrenches into play as cars breakdown, the road widens and narrows or comes to a temporary stop in a blizzard, rock slide, or drawbridge (or does it?). You never know what is around the bend in Roadkill.<br/><br/>",

The game is played over a series of Engagements (or rounds), split betwen a Draft Phase (where each player can Recruit cards for his deck) and a Way Phase (where players play the cards from their decks to win conflicts). With its focus on player interaction, multiple ways to use each card, and a variety of ways to score points, The Valkyrie Incident is unlike any other deck building game.  The game is fast, chock full of choices and player interaction.<br/><br/>There are six different card types: Valkyrie, Cogdrives, Actions, Assaults, Locations, and Emblems. Each of the first four card types are included in the main deck. Each card has a Clan Emblem (this is the clan it belongs to), a Recruit Cost (this is in the gray), a Strength Value (this is in red), and a special ability which can be used during either the player&rsquo;s Recruit Turn, or during his Conflict Turn.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game, each player selects an Emblem. Every card recruited by the player is worth 1 point. However, cards of the clan of the player's selected Emblem are worth an additional 1 point. Emblem also grant the player a special once per Conflict ability and a chance to score bonus Conflict cards during the Recruit Turn. Each Engagement, the player who started the War chooses which location the Conflict will take place in. Each Location has an overall effect for the Conflict.<br/><br/>",

You tell me!<br/><br/>After you tell everyone the story of how you used various tools to ward off the threat, everyone votes on whether or not you succeeded. If a majority backs you, you keep the threat card; otherwise, you don't. Each player secretly belongs to either the Secret Society or the Cult, and you naturally want to vote for the players on your team, but no one knows who is on which team.<br/><br/>After a certain number of threats, the game ends, players reveal which group they belong to, and each group tallies the number of threats that their members escaped.

During these sessions, you will gain or lose points, and, at the end of the semester, the Student who earned the most points will be knighted by King Arthur himself!&quot;<br/><br/>Here comes the new edition of Medieval Academy, all fresh and revamped!<br/><br/>Medieval Academy is a fast, dynamic family game. It is a simple card game with very intuitive rules : when you play a red 3 card, you move 3 spaces on the red track. <br/>The core of the game is the drafting of the cards between the players. Choices have to be made at each turn. The gameplay is fluid, as everyone plays at the same time, and it is very interactive.<br/><br/>The depth of the gameplay comes from thoughtful timing and<br/>risk taking in each round versus long term planning for the whole game.<br/><br/>The back of the board offers another version, more strategic and challenging for experienced players.<br/><br/>There is also a solo mode offering different levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>It is a game in which players will moan and grump about fate, the other players and the world in general. :)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games, highly prized by collectors.<br/><br/>This one is the American War of Independence game. The British have four armies of 5 units each, 3 warships and a troop carrier with 2 reinforcements on board. The Americans have 16 units spread all over the board (including a special &quot;Continental Army&quot; unit), 1 warship and a troop carrier with 4 reinforcements on board.<br/><br/>The Americans use two dice for movement (unless down to just one unit), the British one. All three dice are 0-1-1-1-2-3. Both players roll their dice using shakers and peek at them. The British player designates the unit he'll move, then the American reveals his throw and moves. Finally, the Bristish reveals his throw and moves.<br/><br/>A single unit is moved by each die --the grid is square and no diagonals are allowed. Units that end up on the same spot stack to form an army (which cannot be split), but each army is limited to 6 units. Naval moves are harbour to harbour except for the troop carriers (and any warship attempting to intercept them).<br/><br/>A Skirmish occurs when opposing units are adjacent. A card is drawn to resolve the Skirmish. This can result in a unit loss for either side (sometimes two), a major battle being triggered, or one or both armies moving a space or two. Major battles normally occur when an army lands on an enemy army by exact count; numerical superiority is added to the stronger side's throw, and the adjusted throw difference indicates how many units the losing side lost (however, that loss is limited to the number of units in the winning army).<br/><br/>Once the British have lost an army, they can call for Reinforcements. The Americans can do this once they've won a Major Battle. Reinforcement play is resolved separately from normal play. Two dice are used by both sides, one player trying to bring in his troop carrier whilst the other attempts to intercept with a warship (if the opponent has no warships left, the reinforcements automatically succeed). If the troop carrier makes it to a harbor, the reinforcements land (triggering a major battle if the harbor is enemy-held) and the troop carrier remains as a normal warship henceforth.<br/><br/>The British win by eliminating the Continental Army, whilst the American wins by eliminating all four British armies. To keep the game from dragging on, if there is no skirmish nor major battle in 10 moves, the weaker side surrenders.<br/><br/>The asymmetrical mechanics work surprisingly well; the British lacks mobility and try to force Major Battles on the Americans, whilst the latter skirmish as much as possible until they can muster a large enough army together to win a major battle and call in their reinforcements.<br/><br/>",

Each golfer is represented by his own card, which recreates his abilities, highlighting his strengths and weaknesses. The same golfer cards are used in both versions of the ASG game. Each course is drawn to scale by George Gerney, who has been analyzing and drawing courses for over 10 years. They are rendered in vivid color and are like an oversized yardage book. Each hole of every Quick Play course has its own card. In addition to the result numbers, each card features a small full-color drawing of each hole.

        "description": "Reprint of the CSR Award Winner: Best Desktop Published Wargame, 2007.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Little Bighorn, also known as Custer's Last Stand, was the epic fight between a massive combined force of Plains Indian tribes and the 7th United States Cavalry under the command of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. The battle was the most famous event in the Indian Wars and was a crushing victory for the Indians. Custer, already famous for his Civil War exploits, became an American folk legend. Little Bighorn was the last great victory for the Sioux and Cheyenne. Defiant and proud, they were determined to preserve their way of life, but within a year, they were broken and defeated by a nation swept up in the emotions of the Centennial and bent on revenge for the death of an American hero.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Little Bighorn is the third game in the Indian Wars of the American West series.  This game also includes the Montana column led by Col. Gibbons.  This column was the third column in the field within General Terry&rsquo;s campaign plan.  Crook&rsquo;s Wyoming column was the other part of this campaign, and included in Volume II of the series, The Battle of Rosebud Creek.<br/>The Montana column includes Col. Gibbon, the 7th Infantry, 2nd Cavalry, and Low&rsquo;s Artillery Battery of Gatling guns(?) and a 12 lb howitzer.  Players may now explore the possibilities and capabilities of these guns, and what effect these forces could have had on the outcome of the battle.  Scenarios included the historical game, the Montana columns arrival, assigning the Gatling guns or the 2nd cavalry with Custer. Is this last line correct?<br/>The new expanded maps (from the original DTP version), allows for the relocation of the Indian village, the arrival of the Montana column, and if Custer had waited for Terry or was delayed because he took the Gatling guns.<br/><br/>",

Stones enjoy the freedom of chess Queens, except that with every move they must come to rest on a band closer to the Throne. A stone flanked by two adverse stones (either orthogonally or diagonally) is captured and defects to the other player. The aim is to capture the Throne for one's own King by completing a 'frame' (i.e., a rotationally-symmetrical arrangement of four stones) around it at any distance. The Throne may change hands any number of times in the course of play, but whichever side's King is in occupation at game's end (i.e. when one player, on his turn, has no available move) is the winner. If the Throne remains neutral throughout, the game is drawn.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>      Boardspace.net Real time, against humans or robots<br/>      Littlegolem.net Turn-based<br/>      Mindsports.nl Turn-based<br/>     Against Stephen Tavener's AI at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mrraow.com/index.php/aiai-home/</a> (Java 8 required)<br/><br/><br/>Mobile Apps<br/><br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS<br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android<br/><br/><br/>Similar to: <br/><br/>     Ming Mang played on NxN board (8x8 for ToyToyToy version)<br/>     Othello different setup and play, but same type of conversion capture.<br/>     (Designer clarification) Neither Ming Mang nor Othello.

You may or may not be a fan of Morelli, but either way there's no escaping the fact that in its gameplay it's just about as unlike any other Abstract as you can get.<br/><br/><br/>",

Taking place near K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz and Sadowa in Bohemia on 3 July 1866, it was an example of battlefield concentration, a convergence of multiple units at the same location to trap and/or destroy an enemy force between them.<br/><br/>There are some extensive rules for cavalry charges, artillery, morale loss, and weather effects.  The game also includes a number of 'what if?' scenarios which include alternate orders of battle as well as the historical one.<br/><br/>Game length and victory conditions are determined by the scenario being played.  Victory usually relies on capture of geographical objectives and/or elimination of opponent's forces.<br/><br/>The game was first published as a supplement to Command Magazine Issue #21 Mar-Apr 1993.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with 3W's Blood and Iron, this game is a two-player wargame covering the battle of Koniggratz (3 July 1866), the decisive battle of the 7 Weeks War between Austria and Prussia.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 hours<br/>Hex: 500 yards / 457 meters<br/>Units: Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (240 1/2&quot; counters - 200 for Blood &amp; Iron, 6 for Tet '68 &amp; 34 for Gettysburg)<br/>One 24-page Blood &amp; Iron rulebook<br/>One 12-page Lost Victory Study Booklet (Designers Notes)<br/>Two 4-page dual-side printed Player Aid Cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-12 hours<br/><br/>",

Ships will fire cannons at each other while pirates use their special abilities to gain as much gold as possible. The player who controls the most pirates and has gathered the most gold by the end of the sixth round will be named the new master of Treasure island.<br/><br/>Cannon Buster is based on Koryŏ, but developed as a family game with more player interaction. In more detail, in each of the six rounds players draw cards based on the round number, then place three cards from their hand in front of them, with all players revealing their cards simultaneously. Players then check to see who has a majority of each character, using their majority effects as desired and firing cannons.<br/><br/>After six rounds you determine a winner by checking gold coins and the number of character tokens in a player's possession, with additional points being given for possession of antique cannons. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Without long openings, the players enter directly into confrontation. The original rules of Chess are simplified/expanded by a few additional rules.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player has a king and four pawns. Cards for the remaining chess pieces form a deck from which the player draws three. The active player first moves a piece according to the original rules for chess, then (optionally) chooses one of the three cards in hand, places it next to an existing card, then draws a replacement card. Pawns must be placed beside another pawn, and all other figures must be placed behind a pawn. The aim of the game remains the same: Checkmate the opponent's king!<br/><br/>Schachen is for players who like and know chess, but who think the original game is too complex and takes too long.<br/><br/>",

Their objectives were to undertake reconnaissance patrols and to observe enemy movement, as well as to conduct offensive missions deep in enemy territory. They often operated in groups as small as four and moved slowly through thick jungle and bushland. The kill ratio of the SAS was surpassed by no other Australian unit in Vietnam. They were feared by the North Vietnamese Army and the Viet Cong who referred to them as the &lsquo;Ghosts of the Jungle&rsquo;.<br/>In the game, it&rsquo;s 1966 and Sergeant Allen, together with Troopers Baker, Clarke and Dixon of the Third SAS Division must undertake covert missions in the jungle of Vietnam, in an area swamped by Viet Cong.

        "description": "Zimby Mojo is a co-opportunistic game for 2-8 players that also supports solo play. Each player is the all-powerful shaman of a tribe of ferocious, conniving, vicious little cannibals called zimbies, and each player has a single goal: to become the new Cannibal King. To achieve their goal, each player will have to use their zimbies to infiltrate the current King&rsquo;s compound, kill him, take his Crown, and carry it safely to their tribal board before a rival zimby tribe can do so first.<br/><br/>In solo play, the player must use their zimbies, scrolls, and strategy to defeat the Cannibal King, evade his thugs, and bring the Cannibal Crown to their tribal board before time runs out. In a multiplayer game, the players must work together to gain access to the Cannibal King&rsquo;s sanctum before they can confront him. Once they kill the King, however, it&rsquo;s every tribe for itself and the player that reaches their tribal board with the King&rsquo;s Crown immediately becomes the new Cannibal King and wins the game!<br/><br/>Keep one eye on the Crown.  Keep the other on your back.<br/><br/>WHAT'S A ZIMBY?<br/>Zimbies are vicious, conniving little cannibals.  They are small, stubborn, anti-heroes in a game of control of a land of nasty little creatures.  They are not human: each zimby tribe has followed its own cultural and evolutionary path -- there are humanoid zimbies, avian zimbies, aquatic zimbies, simian zimbies, ursine zimbies, arachnid zimbies, the list goes on!  That's why there's a bunch of reptilian-eyed, orange-skinned, clawed, stick-haired creatures on the box!  The name &quot;zimby&quot; itself derives from a play on words on the word &quot;zombie&quot; and the designer's love of the cartoon character Invader Zim, who he feels exquisitely exemplifies zimby behavior and fanaticism.<br/><br/>MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CONCEPTS AND ELEMENTS<br/>Each player plays the shaman of a different zimby tribe.  Zimbies are nasty, unruly, conniving little cannibals that follow their shaman with fanatical loyalty.  Each player&rsquo;s goal is to bring about the death of the Cannibal King, steal his fallen Crown, and get the Crown to his tribal board so he can become the new Cannibal King.  To do this, the players will have to:<br/><br/>1. Get some zimbies onto the main game board (you can&rsquo;t get the Crown without a zimby to grab it and carry it home),<br/>2. Cooperate with at least one other tribe to activate a sigil (you can&rsquo;t kill the King unless you can get to him),<br/>3. Kill the Cannibal King (that&rsquo;s the only way he will give up his Crown),<br/>4. Get the Crown and deliver it to your tribal board (you win the game by becoming the new Cannibal King).<br/><br/>Part 1 of the game is completely cooperative.  Part 2 of the game is completely competitive.<br/><br/>CREATURES<br/>There are four creature types in the game: zimbies, obnoxious little cannibals that do a shaman&rsquo;s bidding with ruthless (sometimes inept) fanaticism; zombies, undead meat-puppets; thugs, the Cannibal King&rsquo;s dim-witted, fervently devoted brutes; the Cannibal King, the sadistic yet cowardly overlord of the zimby tribes. Shaman are players and don&rsquo;t count as creatures.<br/><br/>MOJO<br/>Mojo is &quot;a power that may seem magical and allows someone to be very effective, successful, etc.&quot; (Mirriam Webster).  It is the inexplicable, mystical energy than allows shamans to both impel their zimbies into action and release the powerful magical spells bound in the scrolls they raid from the Scroll Library!  But be warned, mojo is drawn from shamans and zimbies!  The more zimbies a shaman sends forth to kill the Cannibal King and steal his Crown, the less mojo that shaman has available!  Every turn, each player (shaman) generates a small amount of mojo and may also draw forth mojo from zimbies on their tribal board, thereby depleting them of energy for the remainder of the turn and rendering them useless. A shaman may also cannibalize (yes, eat!) their own zimbies for more mojo... Of course, eaten zimbies are dead and gone...<br/><br/>STACKING<br/>Multiple zimbies can stack to form columns which count as single, giant creatures.  The more zimbies in the stack, the stronger they are but the slower they move.  And the shaman whose turn it is fully controls the column...<br/><br/>SCROLLS, MOVEMENT, AND COMBAT<br/>Shamans may use mojo to empower scrolls to cast one-off rituals, long-lasting incantations, and blindingly fast witcheries.  These cast magical effects -- beneficial and detrimental -- on the shaman themselves.  Shamans also use mojo to move their zimbies on the main board -- so, the more scrolls a shaman uses the less mojo they have available for movement. Combat is a simple 1d6 &quot;roll-off&quot; with the combatant making the higher die roll dealing a number of wounds damage equal to the difference in the die rolls to the combatant making the lower die roll.<br/><br/>TIMING<br/>Many of a player's actions are limited to the player's turn, such as spawning new zimbies, turning zimbies into zombies, movement and combat.  Players may extract and use mojo at any time on any player's turn.  So, scroll use is always an option!<br/><br/>FIRST MOVER STRATEGY<br/>At the end of the round, after all the players have gone, the player with the most undepleted zimbies on his tribal board becomes the first mover on the next round.  That player goes first and play proceeds clockwise from them.<br/><br/>SOLO<br/>There is also a solo mode, which is not only a fully realized game but also very useful to hone the strategies that you will use in your multiplayer games. But be warned: solo play is limited to 12 turns and your score gets lower the more turns you take.  It's not too hard to win, but it's tough to get a high score!<br/><br/>HAVE FUN WREAKING HAVOC!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Kaiser&rsquo;s War (KW), is an intermediate-complexity, strategic-level simulation of the last year of World War I in Europe, including an optional what-if extension into 1919. As 1918&rsquo;s campaign season opened, the Central Powers had defeated the Russian Empire and dominated much of Europe, yet less than a year later the Western Allies were triumphant.<br/><br/>The concept of &ldquo;victory points&rdquo; (VP) is central to play of game. Players begin each scenario with a designated number of VP. They may expend them to gain reinforcements and carry out certain actions. They gain new VP as a result of achieving objectives; they lose VP when they lose units in combat. To win the game you must have more VP than your opponent; so play is a balancing act between expending VP and attaining objectives.<br/><br/>This is a two-player game: one player controls the Central Powers; the other player controls the Allies. Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) from side to opposite side. The map shows all of Europe from London to Moscow and south to Italy and Greece. Each game turn represents two months. Units of maneuver are mostly armies, along with certain elite and specialized corps. There are 17,500 words in the rules. Two experienced players can finish the shorter (historical) scenario in about four hours. Designed by Joseph Miranda.<br/><br/>The rules cover such things as: mobilization, replacements, unit conversions, trenches, fortified zones, fog of war, railroads, headquarters, air bases, naval bombardment, seasons, neutrals, Bolshevik and nationalist forces, critical cities, psychological warfare, morale, stand-fast orders, shock troops, proto-mechanized warfare, the Poles, the Allied Blockade, alpine units, the USMC, guerrillas, the Arab Legion, and much more.<br/><br/>S&amp;T issue 261<br/>Reprinted in Command Magazine Japan #140 in April 2018.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is a very high quality &ldquo;word find&rdquo; board game, and appeals to a very large audience, ages 8 to adult.  It is designed to entertain a wide range of audiences and age groups.  Keesdrow is ideal to play at family gatherings, an evening with friends, or any time of day when people just need a break.  The game consists of 64 double-sided wood tiles (each tile consisting of four letters with number values assigned to each letter along with a hole for the placing of a colored peg)<br/><br/>The object of the game is simple.  Players compete for high score by identifying words within a maze of letters and scoring points based on the letters they use.  As players identify words, they insert a colored peg in the hole of each letter used to form the word.  Adjoining letters may be up, down, left, right or diagonal.  The letters must be joined in sequence, and may be used more than once within the same word.  Letters have varying point values, and may be used a maximum of three times during the game.<br/><br/>The first time a letter is used, it counts as a single point value, and a green peg is inserted in the hole of the letter.  The second time a letter is used, the point value is doubled and a yellow peg replaces the green peg.  The third and final time a letter is used, the point value is tripled, and a red peg replaces the yellow peg.  Once a letter has been used three times, it is expired and may not be used again for the remainder of the game.  (While playing the game, think of a stoplight &ndash; first play the green, then the yellow, and finally the red at which time play is stopped for that letter.)<br/><br/>The key to making this game so enjoyable is the ability to use the same letter multiple times within the same word, to move in any direction to connect letters and to limit the use of individual letters to a maximum of three times.<br/><br/>Game contents include a game board, sixty-four wood double-sided tiles (each side contains four letters, numbers and holes), 300 colored pegs, plastic case for the pegs, blue organization bag for the tiles, two-minute sand timer, very descriptive game instructions with color illustrations of the first twelve turns, and score pad.<br/><br/>2006 Mensa Select<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Note: The title changed to Rabbit Island in December 2016, thanks to lots of crowd input. Original title was Bunny Island.)<br/><br/>In Short: Tile-laying modular board game; main mechanic is territorial control.<br/><br/>In Full:<br/><br/>You are a rabbit --  one of a wandering band of rabbits in search of a new land to call home. After many months at sea, you and your companions discover a beautiful, uninhabited island. Splitting up into your separate tribes (Blue, Red, Yellow, or Green), you will each set out from Founder's Hill to explore the island, discovering new areas to build up and plant carrots. It is up to you to lead your tribe into the unknown and develop the largest and most successful civilization on the island!<br/><br/>While it looks cute at first, Rabbit Island reveals itself as a very competitive and multi-faceted game. The primary aim is territorial control, and there are several supporting mechanics that increase your strategic potential, including Action Cards and Harvest Groups.<br/><br/>Each player starts out with a rabbit pawn, 100 Carrots in Carrot Tokens, and 25 Building Tokens. There are three phases to the game - Explore, Build, and scoring (Conquer!). The main goal of the game is to gain the most Victory Points by the end of 20 rounds of play (or 10, if playing a short game).<br/><br/>During the Explore Phase, each player lays down the uniquely shaped Map Tiles to create the board and form the Pathway Arrows. Players also get the chance to build their first Camps (lowest building level) on the Territory Tiles.<br/><br/>During the Build Phase, players now follow the Pathway Arrows around the Island until they reach the Rabbit Holes, which take them right back to Founder's Hill to start following the paths over again. They will Harvest new carrots from their established Territories, and continue to upgrade their buildings - from Camp to Village, and Village to Town - for more Victory Points!<br/><br/>By upgrading an opponent's Territory, you can wrest away control to become the new Territory Owner! All players will receive Victory Points for each building level they establish, so build build build - but watch out for Earthquakes, Poor Harvests, and more, from the Action Card deck!<br/><br/>Harvest Groups are two or more adjacent Territories owned by the same player; these areas equal big Harvests for their Owner.<br/><br/>The Conquer Phase is the scoring phase, where players count the number of Victory Points each building level has netted them. There is one extra point awarded to the player with the most Carrot Tokens, and another point awarded to the player with the largest Harvest Group.<br/><br/>Who will come out on top at the end? Conquer your opponents and feast with your tribe!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from game review:<br/><br/>The  game is composed of 11 cards. These are numbered 4 through 13 plus 16 and each also bears a number of &quot;pips&quot;. (From one on the 4 card to four on the 16 card.) A round is played as follows: each player is dealt 5 cards with the eleventh card discarded face-up. (Note that this means that you know exactly what cards your opponent holds.) Each turn both you and your opponent secretly select one of their respective cards and reveal them simultaneously. The higher card wins and that player sets that card aside scoring the number of pips on it. The loser retains his/her played card. However, if the higher card is more than twice the lower card then it's the lower card that is placed aside and scored. So the 13 will beat the 10 but lose to the 6. Play continues until one player is left with but a single card. Points are then scored and, here's the clever bit, players swap hands and do it again. This ensures that each game is exactly fair as both players will have equal opportunity to play a strong/weak hand. After these two rounds the points are totaled and a winner declared. There are, at most, fourteen card plays in a game and so the game is usually over in two or three minutes.<br/><br/>",

The vampire is invisible, so there's no vampire pawn, but he IS somewhere on the map. The only clues are from radars. When a human uses a radar, the humans get to know how far the vampire is from the radar. With the clue from the radar and guessing his moves, humans shoot their guns blindly, trying to damage the vampire.<br/><br/>Before all bullets are spent or all humans are killed, if the vampire's life is reduced to zero, the humans win. The vampire wins when he kills all the humans or when the humans are out of bullets.<br/><br/>The second edition of Vampire Radar has nine 2x2 tiles instead of 36 1x1 tiles, making for faster set-up, and it includes variant rules for the human players. Instead of each human player taking two actions, then the vampire acting twice, each human player takes one action, then they pass the starting marker clockwise, then each human takes another action, then the vampire acts. This change rotates the turn order among the humans.<br/><br/>ヴァンパイアレーダーは、人間対ヴァンパイアの戦いのゲームです。<br/>格子状のマップに8～9人の人間駒を置いてゲームを始めます。ヴァンパイアは目に見えないので、駒はありませんが、マップ上のどこかにいます。<br/>唯一の手がかりはレーダーです。レーダーを使用すると、ヴァンパイアとの距離がわかります。人間はレーダーの手がかりからヴァンパイアの動きを推測し、虚空に向けて銃を撃ち、見えないヴァンパイアを攻撃します。<br/>弾丸が尽きるか人間が全滅する前に、ヴァンパイアのライフを0にできれば人間の勝利です。<br/><br/>(This game was first published with an English title &quot;Vampire Rader&quot;.

One commands the Romans, the other the Gauls as well as allied Brittanic and Germanic tribes. The game pieces include: legions, auxiliaries, fleets and tribal war bands. The map stretches from the Roman frontier across the three parts of Gaul to the Rhine, as well as across the Northern Sea into Britannia.<br/><br/>In Caesar&rsquo;s War each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate recruits for the armies, movement abilities, special combat bonuses and historic events. Some of the Roman cards include: Legions on the March, Unrest in the Ranks, and British Campaign. Some of the Gallic cards include: Helvetian Migration, German Invasion, and Uprising of Gallic Tribes.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical procedure. Each side has unique advantages, with Roman discipline pitted against Gallic ferocity. There are special rules for camps, sieges, morale, and great leaders such as Vercingetorix and Caesar himself. Having the right commander at the right battle can mean the difference between laurels and disaster.<br/><br/>",

On each play the Ark is revealed differently &ndash; both the types of rooms and their positioning varies and players also get random mission cards. <br/>In addition to the competitive &ldquo;Awakening mode&rdquo;, the game features a competitive &ldquo;Fallout&rdquo; mode, solo mode and collaborative mode that can be played against a player or an automated opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It was then no surprise that Kiev held out for three months and that Hitler had to fatefully divert Guderian from Moscow to break the stiff Soviet resistance along the Dnieper.

        "description": "Players take on the role of club-owners vying for customers' Deutsch Marks in this unique board game, called Full House in German.<br/><br/>Each player is given a small board representing their cafe or pub. In your turn, you can either place a tile in your pub, representing different types of seating (bar, patio, formal) &amp; activities (dancing, shooting pool, playing fooseball), or you can select a customer card, to draw in customers to those specific tiles, if you have the seating available. A third choice is to take a Billing card, which gives you a tip in cash money, and makes all customers in all the players bars pay their bills too. Yellow customers are worth 10 DM, red 20 DM and blue customers pay 30 DM.<br/><br/>When there are at least ten customers floating around, players can also spend a Action card which moves customers around. The cards either move off a specific tile type to a type you choose, or from a tile type you choose to a specific tile. So you might move customers specifically from the terrace seating to any other type of your choice (such as the disco floor), or from a tile of your choice (such as the bar) to specifically a Pool Table. The cards allow from 1-4 customers to move, depending on the tiles.<br/><br/>This is the clever part. As the customers move, they normally pay their bill, unless the Action card shows a No Pay symbol, making them bill-dodgers. When customers move, they first look for a suitable spot within the same pub! Only if they can't find one (either it lacks that type of tile, or there isn't enough room to accommodate them), do they then start wandering clockwise to the next pub, and keep going until they find a suitable spot. If they can't, they leave the game.<br/><br/>So if you have an Action card that pays a bill, and you have the right empty spaces in your bar (because you've carefully put in a variety of attractions), you move your customers around inside your bar and collect the money (&quot;Hey, we're paying our bar tab now, we're gonna shoot some Pool&quot;). If you have a suitable Action card with a No Pay symbol, you move customers from another player's bar into yours (&quot;This place stinks guys, let's skip out and find a Fooseball!&quot;). It is this clever management of customers that will net you big profits.<br/><br/>And if your bar is pretty full, especially with blue and red customers, you call a billing as your first action. The other players also collect, but you should have a margin on them, plus the tip (from 30-70 DM).<br/><br/>There are always three Customer cards and three Action cards face up, and two fresh tiles, so you should be able to make good choices and plan ahead a little. The game ends when the Action cards or the Billing cards are exhausted.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most money, having milked the punters as much as possible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stonewall Uprising is a two-player asymmetric deck-building game in which you play as either The Man or Pride, fighting for or against equal rights.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can either play a card from your hand or fold. Playing cards moves one of three tracks in the game; Systemic Support, Public Opinion, and Individual Support. Getting to the end of these tracks gives the side it lands on an immediate effect, and then resets it to the middle of the track. Folding allows you to take the value of your hand at the end of the round and gain new cards from your market, but be warned - once you have folded your opponent's cards are doubled in value! You will however get to draw a card for each card they play while you are folded, but will that be worth it?<br/><br/>As the decades progress from the 1960s, to the 1970s, and finally to the 1980s, watch as your strategy and tactics stretch and morph based on the changing tides. Events can sway certain strategies, and the cards you're able to buy shift as the decades pass.<br/><br/>The Man's goal is to detain and demoralize 10 people from Pride's deck to take the wind out of Pride's movement. Pride's goal is to shift the Overton Window and to organize protests, demonstrations, and sit-ins to sway the public, represented by their dice pool, to keep their movement's momentum going well past the 80s. The game ends immediately when either of these conditions have been met.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

At each turn, you take 2 actions: move a totem of your choice (X or O) as many squares as you like, but always in the same row (horizontally or vertically), then place one of your pieces with the same symbol as the totem played, on a free square orthogonally around the totem's new position. You can only move a totem if you still have pieces of the same symbol in reserve, otherwise you will be forced to play the other totem.<br/><br/>The most original aspect of Oxono is when a totem is completely surrounded. You can then play the totem over the surrounding pieces, and if you land on another encircled square, you can place your piece anywhere on the board. Note that you can use your opponent's colour to win by aligning symbols. The turnarounds are surprising for a game that lasts only 15 minutes and the replayability is maximum. The game feeling is very satisfying and the desire for revenge is immediate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description form the publisher<br/><br/>",

Don't worry, the rules are carefully constructed so that no dangerous weapons are used. Typically the game is played in real time -- that is, the game is more likely to be played at school or at a game convention over a period of days or weeks than at a friends house in an afternoon.<br/><br/>There are many scenarios outlined in the game but the simplest is to give every player the name and picture (if necessary) of another player and a dart gun. If you successfully kill your target you take his target as your new target. You may not shoot at anyone who is not your target except in self defense.

Packed with rabid and bloodthirsty fans, these barges feature an array of deadly hazards that are designed to indiscriminately kill or injure both combatants. These hazards range from floor saws that tear across the arena floors to pits that are home to monstrosities just looking for something to eat. Full of beautifully illustrated and amusingly inappropriate cards and lore, each match leaves you with a story to tell and laughs to be had by all.<br/><br/>Gamers will appreciate the nostalgic art style and classic RPG elements that drive the brutal theme of the game. NEXUS puts classic tabletop gaming tools like dice, pen, and paper to good use; to pit genetically engineered champions against one another in visceral combat. Players will experience a rush as their dice rolls determine the fate of their hapless champions followed by thunderous bursts of laughter.<br/><br/>The skirmish mode, while easily picked up by even the most novice of players, has just the right amount of depth, complexity, and self-generating narrative to make each match exhilarating. Dive even deeper with RPG legacy features and build your wealth and influence allowing for countless upgrades and bribes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Upgrade your ship, manage your crew, and engage in deep tactical combat. Keep your ship intact and adapt as the situation escalates to emerge victorious!<br/><br/>Solar Titans uses a unique blend of deck-building and tableau-building mechanics to offer fast-paced and strategic gameplay. You build a capital ship by placing down and connecting ship cards that represent your command deck, core systems, plating, and weapons. Your layout decisions determines the relative strong and weak points of the ship. As you play, you use crew cards from your hand to operate the ship and acquire new ship parts and crew from a market. When you are ready, fire your ship weapons at your opponent's ship. Take down their command deck to win!<br/><br/>Each turn allows you to make important decisions. In combat, you decide on the sequence of weapons to fire and what to target. Ship weapons differ in their attack strength, direction of attack, and special effects. Disabling the right ship modules on the opponent's ship can make all the difference. When buying from the market, you decide on whether to improve your economy, defense, offense, or utility. The market offers many powerful weapons, advanced plating, and specialized crew. You also have the opportunity to modify or perform repairs on your ship each turn - but keep in mind that your supply of field repairs are limited!<br/><br/>Solar Titans is designed to be easy to learn, but with gameplay that is tense and engaging. You and your opponent's capital ships will accumulate damage over time, forcing new strategies and priorities. The randomized market and gradual arrival of new ship components will also shift the dynamics of combat. You must balance between short-term gains and long-term plays, knowing that each ship may only be a few turns away from being disabled. Do you reinforce your command deck or your crew quarters? Do you fire your weapons now, or prep for a large volley? Do you take down the opponent's missiles or heavy cannon? The opportunity for almost infinite ship layout variations, the randomized market, and changing combat dynamics ensures that this game offers replayability and a sense of mastery over time.<br/><br/>Solar Titans suits 1 to 4 players and offers 6 distinct game modes: The classic capital ship dual (1v1), free-for-all (3-4 players), hunter killer showdown (2v2), titan ship dual (2v2), titan ambush (1v2), and a solo and 2-player co-op mode against a powerful automata ship with 3 boss variants and randomized AI bonuses.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To set up Findevier, lay out the ten double-sided animal discs in a circle. Shuffle the deck of cards, place them in the circle, then reveal the top card, thereby showing the animal that players will search for in the first round. Place 1-4 tokens in the circle to account for the animals of this type that aren't visible. (Two cards show woodland elves instead of an animal, and the player who draws this card chooses which animal players will search for.)<br/><br/>On a turn, a player flips over one of the discs to reveal the animal shown on the other side. If the player reveals the target animal, she earns one token from the circle; if the player reveals the fourth animal of this type, the player takes the final token, along with the animal card. Once all four animals of the desired type are visible, reveal the next card. Once all twelve cards have been used, the game ends and the player with the most points wins. Each token and animal card is worth one point, while the two elf cards are worth two points each.<br/><br/>Game play in Taiga is nearly identical to that of Findevier, with the differences being (1) that the game has only ten animal cards and no elf cards; (2) that a player who reveals an incorrect animal must return a token to the bank; and (3) that each token is worth one point and each animal card is worth two points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Road to Infamy, is a fast-paced bidding, gangster-themed game for 2-4 players. Road to Infamy is all about anticipating what moves your opponents will make, taking risks, and playing counter moves. It&rsquo;s simple enough to learn in 3 minutes, yet deep enough where you are discovering new strategies every time you play it. But best of all, it&rsquo;s always your turn.<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of 6 bids. Bids are valued 1 - 5 with the lower valued cards containing some game changing actions. Players chose a bid and place it face down in the ready position. When everyone is ready the bids are simultaneously revealed. The bids&rsquo; colors signify what you are bidding on. Red bids recruit gangsters with unique abilities, green bids buy various types of Contraband (worth victory points), and blue bids bribe the Cop, which protects your points and forces the competition to lose theirs. After 3 rounds the highest bidder for a given color wins the corresponding prize. Players take their winnings and reset the board for the next hand.<br/><br/>Player interaction comes from the actions on the lower numbered bid cards. Actions allow you to steal your rivals contraband, assassinate their mercenaries, and put the odds in your favor.<br/><br/>Each gangster has their own unique ability that is active throughout the entire game. Depending on which gangsters you recruit, different strategies will become available. For example, the Mob Boss gives you an additional Victory Point for each Gangster on your team, this card pairs well with the Recruiter who gives you a permanent +2 to your red bid total. This combination helps you outbid your opponents for new gangsters and earn you victory points when you do so.<br/><br/>The game ends after 12 rounds of bidding. The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players play the role of opposing Sheepie generals in the grand tournament of cakes.<br/><br/>Players start a round with several cake tokens each and take turns playing Sheepie cards to steal cakes from the other player. The first player to take all the cakes wins the round. The first player to win three rounds wins the duel. The catch is that all cards are played face down, so any card can be bluffed as any other card, and all plays can be challenged, instantly ending the round. Each round comes with new opportunities to make tricky plays and mind game the other player. Experienced players can also keep track of which cards have been played and bluff strategically to strengthen their attacks.<br/><br/>The basic deck contains 20 cards: 12 attackers, 7 blockers, and a Wolf which can only be played by bluffing. There are also 10 special cards, two of which are randomly added to the basic deck at the beginning of each duel. These special cards all change up the basic game in their own way, either by adding special mechanics, or altering the balance of power. Players discover which special cards are in the deck over the course of the duel, and can use this information to make more believable plays and deduce which of their opponent's plays are likely to be bluffs.<br/><br/>",

This two-player wargame plays in about an hour or two, with a lightning fast set-up time. The Greeks start in their unassailable supply centers, controlling Jerusalem, but the Maccabeans can use ambushes to whittle their foe while cutting off the Greek supply.<br/><br/>At the heart of the game you strive for control of critical cities in the region, especially Jerusalem, playing cards to move or recruit units or to use a special ability that benefits only your faction. However, there's only one deck, and the more special ability cards you play, the weaker your side becomes in combat &mdash; which leaves you to make tough decisions at almost every play: Do you push for an early advantage, capturing critical regions and amassing a victory point advantage? Or do you bide your time, watching your opponent weaken themselves, then strike hard at the end to steal the win?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be one of the provincial governors trying to reach the presidency of Argentina in the middle of the political and economic crisis of 2001.<br/><br/>In this 1-5 player board game you play as the Senators and Governors of the provinces, all seeking to outmaneuver the others and become the next President of the Rep&uacute;blica Argentina. In a country tired of politicians, you need to prove that you are the least bad option, by making sure that the provinces of the other governors are full of conflicts. By making it look like your opponents cannot even manage their own provinces, they will be even less able to manage the country. The game<br/>ends when a player is declared President<br/><br/>The rounds are divided into two phases:<br/>First, you have to choose one of the options on the board (propose a Laws, Decrees, Debt Payment, Embezzlement Fund, etc) and then buy cards from the Market. At the next phase, you play a set of cards from your hand (Make Operations, Lobby, create conflict with the Establishment, create bad campaigns with the press, etc). Meanwhile, you handle your economy, the events (Lootings, Floods, a Bush's call, more) and negotiate short alliances.<br/><br/>To win, you must be the player with the most Support when the game ends because other players are full of conflicts.<br/><br/>The game comes with a modular system that allows the players to choose the complexity level that best suits their tastes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SherCo's GrandSlam Baseball Game is back in a new graphically-enhanced print and pdf downloadable format, including a new base-36 dice variant entitled SherCo Plus that can be used as a stand-alone game or as a &quot;kit&quot; to upgrade the original game that has been on the market for 50 years.<br/><br/>First brought to market in 1968 (as SherCo II Baseball Simulation, and &quot;the most fun to play!&quot;), the game was brought back to market two years ago by its inventor, Dr. Steve LeShay, and is under license with Brien Martin of Hot Stove Games.   It is being distributed by ASGgames.<br/><br/>SherCo was the first of its kind to be played on a game board representing a composite stadium with a 28 x 28 numbered square grid. It also was the first to rate every player who played in at least one game in a season; and it was the first to provide its unique rating formulae so that customers could rate their own players and teams.<br/><br/>Each player is rated for batting average, home runs, triples, clutch-hitting, walks, strike outs, hit by pitch, base stealing speed, throwing arm, and fielding range and average; and each pitcher is rated for his ERA, innings of effectiveness, number of complete games, K/BB ratio, and home runs allowed. In the SherCo Plus versions, pitcher ratings include batting average against ratings to further refine pitcher vs. batter control and the accuracy of statistical outcomes.<br/><br/>All versions of SherCo GrandSlam Baseball (Plus and Classic) still have all of these unique features (including a wind factor; automatic umpire; artificial turf rules; injuries, hit and runs, special and freak events, and error charts; and playing pieces representing the ball, fielders, batter, and base runners so that you can position players exactly where you want them to play and watch every play unfold right before your eyes. There are also Fast Action Charts included with each season to get one-roll accurate results for games between other teams as you complete a season for your favorite team.  The new SherCo Plus variant has expanded pitcher-batter-runner ratings and offers many more realistic play results per chart, including rarities such as catcher's interference.<br/><br/>Each dice-activated result allows a patented &quot;stop-action effect&quot; to visually occur when a probable hit or probable out batted ball is plotted on a specific square on the stadium's playing field.  As the runners advance, the fielder moves to the ball, fields it and throws to where you want the ball to go in a quick, seamless sequence of turns.  A ball may drop in for a hit or become an out depending on where it is hit, the strength and direction of the wind, and where a defensive player is positioned. Depending on where you are playing, a long fly ball may be caught or go over the fence for a home run, or ricochet off the wall for a double or possible triple. We've even added an optional rule that measures the &quot;hang time&quot; of a fly ball to the outfield.(e.g., will it drop in or will the fielder have enough time to make a fantastic catch?).<br/><br/>A solitaire or head-to-head game takes only 30-45 minutes to play, depending on the score. SherCo has also re-released its rules supplement for setting up SherCo Leagues of Baseball Simulation (a/k/a SLOBS) for short-season (e.g., 24-game) leagues that you can play with family and/or friends.  Additionally, SherCo offers another set of rules for &quot;Olde Tyme Base-ball&quot; for those interested in playing 1870-1920 seasons.<br/><br/>Historical and all modern day ball parks have been beautifully redone to include features such as the fountains at Kauffman Stadium, McCovey Cove at A&amp;&amp;T, Fenway's Green Monster, the fans swimming pool at Chase Field, and even the Big Apple Home Run display at Citi Field. Each year (on/about Jan. 1st) SherCo includes the most recently-completed big league season. Also available are many specialty sets of vintage old-time teams, famous world championship series, greatest also-rans, and entire early seasons rating every player who had at least one at bat or pitched to one batter.<br/><br/>",

Like their American brothers to the west, a large number of British paratroopers drowned in the zones flooded by the Germans. Despite the challenges, the men of Major-General Gale threw themselves valiantly towards their objectives.<br/><br/>&quot;Night Drop 2&quot; covers the first hours of D-Day in the sector to the east of Caen that was assigned to the 6th Parachute Division. Based on the rules from Night Drop (which covered the 82nd Airborne Division&rsquo;s sector), the rules of ND2 are adapted and very slightly different.<br/><br/>Scales : 1 hex = 400 meters - 1 turn = 1 hour - 1 counter = 1 platoon or a company<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The various landings represented try to reflect some of the actual situations and events as they happened, but this is meant to be an accessible game which is quick and easy to play and so it is not a complex simulation. Players will still be challenged by the conditions and the enemy, so expect a tough time out there!<br/><br/>There are 12 beaches in the game, including Utah, Gold, Juno, Omaha, Sword, Pointe du Hoc, Iwo Jima and Tarawa.

In Twisty Tracks, players are rewarded for both long journeys and arrival at point B &mdash; assuming not too many others arrived there first.<br/><br/>Each player has their own playing area that consists of a cardboard frame that depicts stations, loops of train track, and four train depots. Place a wooden train on each depot, and shuffle face down your personal stack of fifteen track tiles. On a turn, each player draws a tile, then places it somewhere in their frame so that they can advance at least one of their trains along the track. When you advance a train, you score 1 point each time it crosses the border between two tiles or between a tile and the frame. Try to send trains on long loopy journeys to score lots of points!<br/><br/>If a train reaches one of the seven stations on the frame, you receive the highest value for this station that hasn't yet been claimed. Wait too long, and you risk scoring nothing. If two of your trains collide while moving on freshly laid tracks, you score points for the borders they've crossed, then remove them from play. When all four of your trains have reached stations or been removed, stop placing tiles.<br/><br/>Once all players' trains have stopped moving, the game ends, and whoever has scored the most points wins. In a tie, the tied player who placed more tiles wins. For an easier game, you can play with only the station scoring or only the border scoring.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The ancient Greek world was ruled by the Olympian gods, 12 beings of immense power, but also victims to their own feelings, passions and vices.<br/>They vied for supremacy very often even amongst themselves, sometimes through brute force like hurling bolts of lightning, but they also conspired against each other through guile and intricate machinations.<br/>This is the game the gods were playing when they tried to consolidate their power by working in the shadows, manipulating mortals to do their bidding, either showering them with promises of immortality and other divine gifts, or bending them to their will with dreadful threats and curses. The gods would compete against each other in a contest of wits and tactics, having the heroes of ancient Greece face mythical creatures and threats and gain glory in their name.<br/><br/>Deus ex Machina  is a competitive game for 2 to 4 players with an innovative hero placement mechanism in which each player takes the role of an Olympian god trying to achieve supremacy over the other gods via manipulation of heroes and behind the scenes planning. Their ultimate goal is to accumulate the most Glory Points by having heroes complete quests. The winner of the game is the player who has completed his secret objective.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a board on which they place different polyominoes, with three, four, or five squares. Cards are drawn from a pile to tell the players which piece to take. But as every player has a different start tile to place first, the players will need different tactics to maximize their points. The pieces may be rotated and reversed before they slide down the board.  Scoring is based on quantity and configuration of squares left uncovered.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/><br/>     FITS <br/><br/><br/>",

One of the tools that he uses for exploring ancient battles is simulation.<br/><br/>In this 298 page book, Sabin guides us through the creation of a system for simulating pitched battles in the ancient period, and then applies the system to 35 historical battles. Scenario setups are shown on color plates.<br/><br/>The rules for the system are approximately 16 pages long, and can be used with either miniatures or counters. (Counters are available for free download from the author's Web site.) Armies have roughly 20 units, which are graded into Veteran, Average, and Levy training levels. Battlefields are divided into a rectangular grid 5 areas wide by 4 areas deep.  Each turn, players throw a single die to determine command points, which allows units to move and fight between areas.  Veteran units require few points to command.  Unit states are very simple:  fresh, spent, and shattered (eliminated).<br/><br/>The book contains extensive references to both primary and secondary sources.<br/><br/>Fifth Column Games version is found at Lost Battles.<br/><br/>",

You start with two basic vineyards and your goal is to grow your businesses into a world-class winery. The player with the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>The game covers a period of 6 years in 6 rounds, each year consisting of 5 seasons. Multiple actions are available in every season; players begin by selecting their preferences and this decision determines the course of the entire round (year).<br/><br/>The round progresses from season to season. You will optimize grape production to improve quality and meet the demand, and use a special process to blend your wines and create high-quality cuv&eacute;es.  To be successful, you must prepare for the forces of nature, introduced by weather cards, and do your best to mitigate damages by preventive measures. You can also expand your facilities: enlarge your cellar, build and run wine houses, restaurants or guesthouses, and make sure they are supplied with enough wine and that the workers are paid.<br/>You will sell your wines on the local and international markets at a price based on quality and demand, and you can participate in annual wine-rating contests, as award-winning wines sell for a higher price. You may also trade with wholesalers, or utilize the options offered by various event cards, such as a loan, a grant, promotion, and much more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>A Cuv&eacute;e kiemelkedően tematikus, akci&oacute;v&aacute;laszt&oacute; strat&eacute;giai j&aacute;t&eacute;k, mely hasonl&oacute; feladatok el&eacute; &aacute;ll&iacute;tja a j&aacute;t&eacute;kost, mint egy val&oacute;di bor&aacute;szat &uuml;zemeltet&eacute;se eset&eacute;ben.

But as they stake their claims and build anew, the old rivalries that were once their downfall resurface. You take on the role of one of these realms, working together with your opponents to develop Pandoria. But all the while, you are also looking to be the dominant realm in the land through gathering resources, building, and learning spells that harness the magic of this mysterious place.<br/><br/>Pandoria Merchants transforms the critically-acclaimed board game into a &ldquo;roll-n-write&rdquo; game that you can print at home and play anywhere &mdash; even online! In the more streamlined &ldquo;family&rdquo; version of the game, you gain valuable spells whenever you close out a region, and instead of managing different resources, every region rewards you with victory points. If you are new to the world of Pandoria, then Pandoria Merchants Family is highly recommended.<br/><br/>For the first time, you can play Pandoria solo:<br/>Your scouts have discovered a hidden valley deep in the mountains, divided by rivers and enormous lakes, a place for your Realm to expand exclusively! But as you begin to settle these new lands, you find that you are not alone: Trolls from the surrounding hills have come to lay claim. As you compete for the most influence in these 8 new territories, the Trolls become stronger. Can you develop your realm fast enough to be the dominant people group when the land is settled?<br/><br/>Pandoria Merchants is one of the most interactive &ldquo;roll-n-write&rdquo; games ever created!<br/><br/>Key differences with the Pandoria Boardgame<br/>Pandoria Merchants retains some of the main elements of the board game, but there are several key differences in addition to the components:<br/>You use dice to determine the 2 resources on your &ldquo;tile&rdquo;.<br/>The merchants of Pandoria produce an additional Resource: &ldquo;Crafts&rdquo;.<br/>You draw your worker on its own hex space, not on a space with a resource.<br/>Workers stay on the board the entire game.<br/>Resource tracks have a capacity of only 5, and every 2 resources over that is exchanged for a victory point.<br/>You can buy any Spell and Building &ldquo;card&rdquo; on your sheet, but if you buy all 3 in a column, your opponents are locked out of buying further cards from this column.<br/>There are no special powers for each realm.<br/>The Artifacts and Relics from the Pandoria Artifacts expansion are included in this game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In To Unlimited, and Beyond, a.k.a. Chip It, players need to rid themselves of both cards and chips to win the game. The problem? Getting rid of your cards might require you to take chips!<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a random hand of cards and a few chips. On a turn, you either play cards to the center of the table (with you beating the cards previously played, if any) or return two chips to the stock.<br/><br/>In more detail, the first player to play cards lays down one or more cards of the same value. You can take chips from the stock to alter the value of the cards you play. With a red card, each chip you take adds 1 to the value of that card; with a yellow card, each chip you take adds the value of the card to itself. If you play a red 7 and a yellow 4, for example, you can take two chips from the stock to make the 7 an 8 and the 4 an 8, and now you've played a pair of 8s. (Chip It has green and purple cards instead of red and yellow ones.)<br/><br/>To play cards on top of this, you must play a pair of 9s or some stronger pair. If you cannot play or choose not to play, you must return two chips to the stock. You are still in the round, but if all players pass in turn, then the player who last played cards clears the pile and plays whatever they wish (or returns two chips to the stock, passing the lead to the right).<br/><br/>Whoever first has no cards in hand and no chips in front of them wins!<br/><br/>",

There are seven different units: King, Knight, Archer, Heavy Infantry, Infantry, Mercenary, and Peasant.  Each turn players can perform any 2 actions: move, turn, or attack.  Foot units move one square forward per action.  Mounted units move as many unblocked squares in front of them as they like.  Units attack the square they are facing (archers attack an area of squares in front of them).  Attacks are resolved by rolling the combat dice.  Each appropriate symbol rolled (axes or arrows) counts as a &quot;hit&quot;.  Scoring more hits than the target has hit points removes some of the units (miniatures) from the target army.  The winner is the player who eliminates his opponent's King or eliminates every other warrior in his opponent's army leaving the King standing alone on the field of battle.<br/><br/>",

Millions of roaming undead have taken over most of 17th century Europe. You and a ragged band of survivors discovered an abandoned haven, a ghostly city with crumbling stone walls. You are few, low on supplies and an undead horde is drawing closer. You have to make your stand here it seems.

Before starting the game, draw 10 Undead Cards randomly; without knowing their order or strength; to create the Undead Deck and each player receives their own Weapon Deck of 12 cards.Each player places their card face down and turn them simultaneously.<br/><br/>The combined scores will tell whether you&rsquo;ve lost the battle&hellip;<br/>...or vanquished the enemy! The player who played the strongest Weapon Card can keep the defeated Undead Card as a trophy.<br/><br/>If your Haven has survived the onslaught, the next step is to sum up the strength of the remaining Weapon Cards and to add the value of the defeated Undead Cards Trophy Points player by player. The player with the highest score will become<br/>the LEGEND.<br/><br/>If you have lost and your Haven was razed to the ground, sum up the strength of the remaining Weapon Cards. The player with the highest score will become<br/>the SCAPEGOAT.<br/><br/>Campaign Mode enables players to fight the Undead in four waves, where each wave tis stronger than the previous one.<br/>Players can upgrade their weapons after each wave and the best defenders will also gain extra rewards. At the end, if the Haven is still standing, the summed up scores of the four waves will determine the winner.<br/><br/>The game can be played up to 12 players with 2 core box.<br/><br/>-description from artist<br/><br/>",

Players are manifestations of the Thornwatch: scarred veterans of the Eyrewood who now live as spirits summoned by the ancient ritual of tying a knot of thorns around a birch tree. The Thornwatch summoned to a particular tree do not necessarily know each other or the true nature of the problem they've been called to resolve; all they know is that they've answered the call, and they're bound to see it through.<br/><br/>Thornwatch bestows upon one player the role of the Judge, who enacts the will of the Judging Wood. Each other player plays a Thornwatch character: the Blade, Briarlock, Greenheart, Guard, Sage, or Warden. The game begins with the Judge selecting a storyboard in which the Thornwatch manifest before a tree adorned with a knot of thorny brambles, surrounded by conflict. If the players overcome this first challenge, the Judge offers choices that lead to new storyboards and further adventure.<br/><br/>The game takes place on one of many maps that display forests, swamps, and villages of the Eyrewood. The pawns lay flat, as if the heroes, enemies, and denizens of the forest are characters in a set of comic book panels.<br/><br/>The core engine is the momentum system. This system tracks turn order and monster health, encourages teamwork, and creates dynamic combat with priorities that change turn-by-turn and round-by-round.<br/><br/>The Thornwatch players each have decks of cards which give them skills and actions, as well as playmats and trait cards to show their unique outlook on the world. They roll custom dice including hero dice gained by manifesting their traits. Each session Thornwatch players have an opportunity to gain knots, which grant their wearer a bonus, regardless of which Thornwatch they choose to manifest in a particular session.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dig Down Dwarf is a fast-paced press-your-luck dice game that was the winner of the Micro Game Challenge! 128 designs were entered into the contest and Dig Down Dwarf was unanimously picked #1 overall by the judges! The Micro Game Challenge was judged by board game critic Cyrus Kirby, who is better known as Father Geek, and by the podcast team at All Us Geeks.<br/><br/>Dig Down Dwarf is a fast and casual game that is fun for all ages and all skill levels. Newcomers will be attracted to the easy-to-learn rules and press-your-luck mechanics, while skilled gamers will love the ability to alter dice rolls by spending gems and to activate special dwarven powers. There is a bit of something for everyone, and the quick playtime and portability make it a great travel game and an outstanding filler game as well.<br/><br/>What is New in the Second Edition<br/><br/>Objective Cards - This new edition will come with 18 Objective Cards. Players will randomly draw 3 at the beginning of the game and these will become a way to score bonus points at the games end. Players decide, as a group, if the objectives are be kept secret or placed up for all to see.<br/><br/>New Artwork - Second Edition comes with clean new graphic design work and artwork throughout. You will still recognize some of the icons and fonts, but the new design is meant to convey a sense of nostalgia.<br/><br/>More Gems - Second Edition comes with 20% more of the shiny gems that made the First Edition such a smash hit!<br/><br/>Six Player Support - With the addition of extra gems and other components, Dig Down Dwarf Second Edition can host up to six players.<br/><br/>New Dwarf Power Cards - These new cards utilize acrylic cubes to track the dwarven skills you have unlocked during the course of the game, instead of rotating the card like you had to do in the older version.<br/><br/>New Dice Colors - Like the new Dwarf Power Cards, we have listened to the feedback over the course of hundreds of plays since the first Kickstarter over two years ago. One thing I noticed was players not noticing that they triggered a dwarf power, because each dice was a different color and it was too much to keep track of for many. A very simple solution has been implemented. You now roll three black dice and one red die on your turn. The red die activates everyone's dwarven powers.<br/><br/>New Gem Colors - Another complaint we got was that some of the gems looked alike in color. We made sure to make that a non-issue this time around. Star gems are now really yellow and we are now able to manufacture the gems in black for the cursite (fossilized dragon dung) which further helps distinguish each gem type.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hail to you, intrepid explorer! You've been selected to take part to the biggest event in the world. The best among explorers, archeologist, and adventurers will compete to decide who's the most excellent. The veil of mystery continues to surround many treasures and legendary places: Will you be able to dig them up and prove that you are the best? &mdash;&quot;Legend Raiders Inc. - Scouting Bureau&quot;<br/><br/>In Legend Raiders, each player represents an adventurer who wants to collect as many ancient coins (a.k.a., victory points or VPs) as possible, searching for legendary treasures and mythical places. In every round on the main board are four different missions, each composed of a discovery to be performed and two random tools (ropes, shovels, compasses and maps) supplied by the bureau. The explorer who gains the most points wins.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player chooses between two actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a discovery and place it on the personal board together with the two randomly related tools, or<br/>    Perform one or more discoveries with the tools already on the personal board.<br/><br/><br/>To be discovered, each treasure requires a specific combination of tools. Places require more tools than artifacts, but will give more VPs in the following expeditions. When a player uses their favorite tool, they gain more VPs; the torch can be used as a joker by turning it off, but only if it's on!<br/><br/>Discovering new treasures gives the player VPs based on number of ancient coins visible on the personal board, uncovered by the ongoing missions. Solving one mission at a time allows the player to have more visible ancient coins and thus to score more VPs, but having more missions on the board and solving more of them in a single turn gives the player a benefit in terms of time. Each time one or more legendary treasures are discovered, the player also gains a expedition card from the four available at the bureau; expedition cards show goals that grant VPs at the end of the game if achieved.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, the player rolls the adventure die and gains the resulting benefit &mdash; or causes the torches of all players to be flipped over!<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player has dug up six or more ancient treasures. Which strategy will you choose to apply? Will you succeed being the best explorer in the world? How many and which mythical treasures will you uncover?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ariete: The Battle of Bir el Gubi, Libya November 1941 is the 17th game in the Tactical Combat Series by Multi-Man Publishing and covers  the Italian Ariete Division's defense of Bir el Gubi, Libya, on November 19, 1941.<br/><br/>Moming of 19 November 1941: General Mario Balotta, commander of 132nd Armored Division Ariete, the only Italian armored division in North Africa, is completing his defensive dispositions to cover the southern approaches to Tobruk. He orders his division's motorized infantry regiment, the crack 8th Bersaglieri, to occupy three battalion strongpoints around a key cross-roads near the well (bir) of Gubi. The 8th Bersaglieri, supported by the reinforced divisional artillery, begins moving into position around Bir el Gubi and digging in. Most of the M13/40 tanks of Ariete 's understrength 132nd Tank Regiment are kept to the rear.<br/><br/>At the same time, General William Henry Ewart Gott, commander of the British 7th Armoured Divi-sion, orders the 22nd Armoured Brigade  (Brigadier John Scott-Cockburn) to attack the Ariete at Bir el Gubi, a complete change from his original orders for the brigade to secure Sidi Rezegh, 25 miles to the north. The reason for the change is still not clear: perhaps Gott hopes to give this well-equipped but inexperienced brigade an opportunity to season itself against an Italian formation that he assumes will be a weak opponent; possibly he just wants to clear his division's left flank before advancing. Whatever the reason, the full-strength brigade, equipped with 162 brand new Crusader tanks, is eager to emulate the Commonwealth's easy victories against the Italian Tenth Army die previous winter.<br/><br/>The stage is set for a swirling desert battle between evenly matched opponents.<br/><br/>Ariete covers this entire mobile action in turns representing 30 minutes each and a map scale of 150 meters per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. A minimal amount of special rules bring the Tactical Combat Series to North Africa, highlighting the unique tactical challenge of the desert environment.<br/><br/>The Italian player must manage a mobile defense against stronger British armored units until reinforcements arrive in the form of the 132nd Tank Regiment. He must make good use of artillery and AT assets (especially truck-mounted 102mm guns) to bloody the Brits and set them up for an armored counterattack.<br/><br/>The Commonwealth player must solve the problem of using an armor-only force to crack defensive positions held by a well-led combined-arms force. The desert environment, with swirling dust clouds and relatively long lines of sight, will not help him in this regard!<br/><br/><br/>     12 Scenarios:<br/>        Destruction of the III/8 Bersaglieri, 2 turns<br/>        The Nearest Thing to a Cavalry Charge, 6 turns<br/>        The Attack on the 8th Bersaglieri, 6 turns<br/>        The Attack on Bir el Gubi (Prepared Defense), 6 turns<br/>        The Attack on Bir el Gubi (Early CW Arrival), 6 turns<br/>        Attack of the 2nd Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, 10 turns<br/>        Attack of the 4th County of London Yeomanry, 11 turns<br/>        The Ram Strikes, 6 turns<br/>        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (historical), 11 turns<br/>        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Prepared Defense), 11 turns<br/>        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Early CW Arrival), 12 turns<br/>        The Battle of Bir el Gubi (Free Deployment), 11 turns<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 30 minutes<br/>Hex: 164 yards / 150 meters<br/>Units: most vehicles Platoon/Squadron, infantry platoons, support weapons generally individual &amp; sections<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (240 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Tactical Combat Series version 4.02 rulebook<br/>One 16-page Ariete game-specific rulebook<br/>Two 4-page Tactical Combat Series version 4.02 Charts &amp; Tables<br/>One front coversheet<br/>One rear coversheet<br/>One plastic zip lock bag<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to provide one red, and one white 6-sided die for game play.<br/><br/>Note: In order to keep production costs down, Ariete is produced as a bagged game only; there will not be a boxed edition.<br/><br/>",

Each of four suspects claim to have been at a certain location at a certain time, and each alibi is represented by a card. At the beginning of the game these 16 cards are shuffled and one is put away. This is the missing alibi that needs to be identified, and the remaining cards are divided between the players.<br/><br/>Players takes turn choosing one of three available interrogation cards from the middle of the table. The chosen card lets you ask one other player for information about their cards. Questions are in the form of &quot;How many cards do you have showing either the park or the shopping mall?&quot;, &quot;How many cards do you have showing the young woman?&quot;, and so on.<br/><br/>In a 2-player game each has two hotel rooms with 3 or 4 guests. All questions only concern the occupants of one room.<br/><br/>Each time a player is asked a question they receive 1 coin. Coins can be used to hire the help of assistants, which provides special abilities, like the ability to lie, to avoid showing cards, take another turn and so on.<br/><br/>This coin mechanism balances a problem of many deduction games, that the player being asked more questions are generally at a disadvantage.

It is played with 35mm miniatures and uses a system that relies on rolling 10-sided dice to determine results.  Players adopt a faction (such as Union, outlaws, and native Americans) and build their forces with a pool of points dependent on the scenario played.  A mechanic of the game allows players to use Influence tokens (generated by their forces) to re-roll dice.  The game's objectives are dependent on the scenario played and can include killing off all your opponents' forces or having the largest force (in terms of cost) at the end of 6 turns.<br/><br/>",

There are two versions of the game: a version designed exclusively for two players and a four-player version. The 1986 versions comes with manufactured components of a much higher quality than previous editions including:<br/><br/>Four high quality color map boards that fit together &quot;puzzle&quot; style, two bags of colored 3-D playing pieces representing ancients-era military units, a four-page rulebook (two double-sided pages), and an attractive storage box.<br/><br/>Set in a time of ancient warfare, Conquest is a strategy game that emphasizes strategic movement, sort of like an upgraded version of Chess. Players control different combinations of foot troops, cavalry, chariots, elephants and ships to try to capture their opponents' fortifications and/or occupy the &quot;quest&quot; locations. There are several scenarios included in the short rule book (Really a booklet!) and players are encouraged to design their own.<br/><br/>Though confusing in name, Conquest is a re-implementation of this game with the same name but with play up to four players.<br/><br/>",

The American player may also control French and Spanish units if those nations enter the war. Instead of the full campaign game, players may also choose to play the shorter scenario that ends in 1779.<br/><br/>Each inch on the area map, which covers all of North America from the Mississippi River east, including the Caribbean, equals 100 miles. Each brigade-sized unit represents two to four battalions (about 1,500 to 4,000 men). Each game turn represents one year. All the game&rsquo;s charts and tables are printed on the mapsheet.<br/><br/>The rules contain a total of 13,000 words, which works out to allow two experienced players to finish a game in four to five hours. The system can be fudged for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: initiative, rabble rousing, revolutionary political progress, colonial loyalties, the European balance of power, mobilizing new units, forced march, supply and forage, enlistment expirations, leaders, fog of war, fleets, French and Spanish alliances, Hessians, Indian sovereignty, fortresses and sieges, partisans, militia, overrun, massacre, political vs. military victory, frontier warfare, honors of war, grenadiers, light troops, detachments, regulars, and much more.

Special about this game is that everyone is playing the cards at the same time. <br/>Who finds as quickly as possible the right cards fitting the racecourse and is the first one to reach the finish line? And who isn't attentive enough and makes a car crash?<br/><br/>This is how it's played: At the beginning each player gets ten cards. The fronts of the cards show in which direction you drive the car and the backs of the cards show in which direction the racecourse continues. Every player tries to find the right fronts of the cards which are fitting the racecourse shown on the stack in the middle of the table and playes the card as quickly as possible faced down. Now, every player has to find a fitting card for the new track. The game is over, when all cards are discarded. To figure out, who's the winner, the players reconstruct the race and find out who has made a car crash and who has collected the most bunny-coins.<br/><br/>",

Maybe another bar can; work a deal with that bar owner that&rsquo;s beneficial to both of you. Capone will be keeping tabs on the operation too, so make sure to keep him happy.

        "description": "Darkness is a strategy card game set in ancient Northern Europe where druids vie for control of powerful artifacts.  It's a simultaneous action game where players play a progressing amount of colored cards in order to acquire unclaimed artifacts and relics, in a complex, and fun game of prediction, observation, and thought.<br/><br/>Game play takes place over the course of six rounds.  In each round player try to acquire cards that give them end game points, and special abilities.  The objective of the game is to score the most points at the end.<br/><br/>Each round is separated into four phases.  In the first phase, players place three of their colored cards from their hand in front of them, face down.  Then everybody reveals their cards.<br/><br/>Next, everybody places two cards down in front of them, and then reveals those.  Then players play one final card face down and reveal that one, for a total of six revealed cards.  Finally, there is a resolution phase where the players determine who has the largest amount of dominant, and sub-dominant colors for each of the available artifacts, and they are divided up accordingly.<br/><br/>Players have the same hand of 15 cards throughout the course of the game, thus limited luck.  The 15 cards a comprised of five colors, with three cards of each color.  Once a card is played during a round, it is put back in a player's hand at the end of the round and can be played again.<br/><br/>On each artifact card this is a dominant, and sub-dominant color.  The card goes to the player that has played the most color cards that match the dominant color.  In the case of a tie, the player with the largest number of color cards played that match the sub-dominant color gets the card.  The reason the game is complex and fun is, there are many different dominant and sub colors on the board at the same time, and people have to predict what other people are going for based on set collection, and the optimization of color specialization.<br/><br/>The game ends after six rounds.  The person who wins is the person with the most number of points, which is determined by how much of a type a player has in each of their sets, and how many gem relics they have.<br/><br/>",

They have been re-mastered and updated into all-new, super-sized editions. These were well regarded by many as balanced and thoughtful games. They cover fascinating, almost forgotten conflicts that would guide the course of World War II in the Mediterranean Theater and East Africa.<br/><br/>Forgotten Legions is yet another Classic Reborn! by Compass Games.<br/><br/>Drive on Damascus gives you an Operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (June and July) 1941 Allied invasion of Vichy French held Syria and Lebanon. Here you can hone your game play skills with open maneuvering on the desert side of the map and tough in-fighting on the mountain side. A fluid situation can develop as both sides seek the opportunity to outflank and attack. And along the coast players will probe for vulnerabilities by maneuver and infiltration. An exhaustive Order of Battle based on archival records helps capture key historical facets of the campaign including armor advantage, air power, ranged artillery, flotillas and commandos, garrisons, mountain units, untried units, and more. Also examined is the possibility of a German intervention<br/><br/>Bloody Keren presents an Operational level simulation that faithfully recreates the (January through April) 1941 campaign in Italian Eritrea that historically saw a climax at the mountain pass at Keren. Here too, good game play is at a premium as strategically you allocate your forces to various mountain passes. Both sides can attack and counter-attack while guerilla forces attempt to close off reinforcements coming from the south.<br/><br/>This Designer Signature Edition provides a fully updated treatment to the 1981 and 1983 releases by World Wide Wargames (3W) that honor the original game designs. All aspects of the games have been enhanced &ndash; rules, charts and tables, map, counters &ndash; based on years of player experience and feedback. The rules are common to both games and are short and well illustrated, along with extensive Design Notes. Each game has a short scenario in addition to the Campaign scenario. While suitable for solitaire play and designed as a two-player game, each Campaign scenario can allow for up to four players (two per side). This edition serves as the ultimate treatment in paying homage and celebrating the original classic designs by Vance von Borries. For your gaming enjoyment, this game has been super-sized by featuring a larger playing surface (two maps) and the larger 5/8&rdquo; counters to deliver an optimal play experience that can be completed in a single sitting.<br/><br/>",

The game includes over 40 scenarios, with six new scenarios and three introductory scenarios. Scenarios range from the Mithridatic wars (88-63 BC) through more than six centuries of greatness and decline to the final burst of glory in the last Romano-Persian War (AD 622-629). Two to six persons may play, depending on the scenario chosen. Scale is 50 miles to the hex and each unit represents Legions and Fleets. Most leader counters are named and represent individual leaders and their staffs.<br/><br/>Imperium Romanum includes counter graphics with all units displayed in a neutral color while the players use leader and control markers to show the forces each faction controls. The maps are enlarged and have a directory of all provinces with their cultivated and road status depicted for each scenario. The rules are updated with a new format and include new optional rules designed to give all players more detail in the military, logistical and political actions of the game.<br/><br/>New Scenarios:<br/><br/>Pompey versus the Pirates (AD 101-102)<br/>Trajan&rsquo;s Parthian War (AD 115-117)<br/>Heraclius and the last Persian War (AD 622-629)<br/>Introductory solitaire scenario<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player has his own gameboard and a set of tiles with tracks. In every round, you draw one tile, place it in your play area and move all trains that are connected to the new track. Be careful not to crash them! You score 1 point for every tile crossed by each train, and looping through tiles multiple times can help your score. Additionally, the farthest stations are the most valuable--until the first trains arrive.  Each delivery decreases the value of a station, so you may have to change your plans in the middle of your journey if an opponent reaches your initial destination first!<br/><br/>",

Each feather color has similar scoring conditions, with slight variations from feather to feather. Some may want feather sets, while some may want odd or even numbers of feathers of a certain color. The more complex the card is to score, the more points you can earn.<br/><br/>During the game, you swap cards to affect both your hand and the central nest, perhaps taking a card an opponent wants, perhaps bluffing desire for a card so that someone else takes it, thereby revealing what you actually wanted. The game ends as soon as the last card is drawn from one of the two draw piles, with players competing in either a single game or a three-game &quot;Pauly's Feather Tournament&quot; as desired.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(David A. Vandenbroucke review - <a target='_blank' href=\"http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://grognard.com/reviews/france44.txt</a>):<br/><br/>France 1944 (Victory Games) is a Mark Herman design.  It's a 130 counter, 1 map game of the breakout and pursuit across France. Units are divisions, I believe.  Components are up to VG's usual high standards.<br/><br/>Complexity is rated as &quot;low,&quot; and solitaire suitability is &quot;medium.&quot;  The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality.  There is a track display that you use during movement/combat.  As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions.  It's easier to play than it is to describe.<br/><br/>For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.<br/><br/>The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).<br/>Chrome rules cover Market-Garden and the Bulge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Foragers is a strategy game in which players take on the role of ancient foragers competing to be the most respected member of the tribe. In the game, foragers pick fruit from trees, fish in lakes, and hunt aurochs in the fields. After collecting these foods, the foragers return to a fire pit, where they &quot;share&quot; their food with the tribe and earn victory points. In addition, the foragers sometimes happen upon tools, which allow them to forage, fish, or hunt more efficiently.  Of course, foragers are not completely altruistic and so they occasionally fight with each other to earn respect. The player who can best optimize their food and tool gathering, while also avoiding or winning skirmishes is the one who eventually earns the tribe leader title.<br/><br/>The game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, depending upon the number of players. In each round, all players simultaneously choose an action card, from a hand of 3 action cards (drawn from a deck of 10) to use for that round. Each action card lists 5 different actions, but a player may only use 4 of those actions each round. Then, in clockwise order, each player performs 1 of the actions on their card until all players have performed 4 actions. Such actions include things like: walking, foraging, eating, discovering, resting, sharing, and picking up a tool.<br/><br/>When players pick up food, they place it on their tableau, which tracks the food's freshness. At the end of each round, a &quot;spoilage card&quot; is flipped and all players &quot;age&quot; their food (i.e., move them along a food track).  As the food gets older, it does not provide as much energy if eaten.  Also, to score victory points, players must &quot;share&quot; their food before it spoils.  In this sense, the players are racing not only against each other, but against nature.<br/><br/>",

Great issues are at stake &mdash; slavery, states rights, the preservation of the Union &mdash; but as a British arms manufacturer, you don't care!<br/><br/>As a profiteer, your aim is to make as much money as possible by supplying the troops needed to fight the war with your factories and by speculating in the bonds issued by the Confederacy and the Union to finance their war effort.<br/><br/>Profiteers is a strategic speculation game. Players seek to accumulate gold and bonds (the value of which varies according to the progress each side in the war). Players can choose to invest money in arms factories, which give them more bonds and greater influence over the outcomes; simply speculate; or buy up businesses such as coffin makers and hope for a bloody and prolonged conflict. Ultimately the only thing that matters is the final amount of cash in hand when the war ends.<br/><br/>The game lasts between three and seven turns, in each of which players first make their investment and production decisions, and then (in reverse order) contribute troops to the outcome of one of the great battles of the US Civil War. The battles are simply resolved and allow for a bit of bluff and negotiation, but they do not attempt to replicate the tactics of the conflict. Those looking for a simulation of &quot;Pickett's Charge&quot; at Gettysburg should probably not buy this game.<br/><br/>The game is fast paced and highly interactive as the ability to anticipate or influence other players' strategies is crucial to victory. A long game (where the war is finely balanced and lasts the full seven turns) can take up to 45 minutes; shorter conflicts are finished in less than half an hour.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts the game with one location, and cards in the deck consist of attackers, defenders, locations and support cards. To start a turn, you draw two cards, pick up any cards banked from a previous turn, and take the three cards passed to you earlier by the player on your left. You play or bank cards until you have only three in hand, then pass those to the player on your right and end your turn.<br/><br/>Attackers target specific locations and earn points for the player wielding them if they're in play at the end of the game. Defenders try to remove attackers so that the location owner scores points for protecting the location. Support cards provide different abilities, such as enlarging your bank or providing time points (which can be used to draw additional cards). Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rogue Dungeon is a solo roguelike dungeon crawl. It's a premium offering that is more than just a stinking deck of cards. It comes with a play mat that emulates the UI of a CRPG that organizes play into thematic slots for your weapon, shield, armor, helmet, gauntlets, boots, scrolls and your backpack full of loot.<br/><br/>Rogue Dungeon is highly replayable and is dripping with theme. Not very many games let you go from zero to hero in one hour. It's a loot management game at its core and that's where its charm comes from. You might start the game with a hunk of meat, that you use to charm a wolf who helps you defeat the zombie who drops a lockpick,  which you use to open the safe where you find the jeweled goblet,  which you trade for a lucky shield which you use to negate the Dragon's fire.<br/><br/>Rogue Dungeon is hard and you will DIE! However, experience and skillful play will ensure that veteran Rogues will make it out of the dungeon alive, more than you will. You, your going to end up in a Goblins belly. Prove us wrong!<br/><br/>Pick your Rogue, grab your starting loot, grab your skills, set your starting stats and enter the dungeon. Choose which room to navigate to via the mini maps. Rooms are divided into the following types....<br/><br/>Traders - Offer you a choice to trade loot or stats for other loot, stats, or henchman. Some trades involve a stat test or the luck of a die. Loot traders typically trade two items for any one item they offer for trade. They make exceptions for the shiny stuff and will trade any item for a single treasure.<br/><br/>Combat - Most combat room have you draw 1 to 3 monsters from the monster deck equal to the dungeon level. Combat is resolved using your Rogues primary stat and a D10. If the two combined are greater than the monsters combat stat your Rogue hits the monster. If they are equal both are hit. If it's less than only the Rogue is hit. Damage can be negated by discarding an armor or by playing a skill or magical item. Potions and food can be consumed at any time to increase your hitpoints to prevent your death. Some monsters have a weakness to specific thematic loot and are vanquished immediately such as when the Medusa gets a look at your face in the mirrors reflection.  Once the monsters hitpoints reach zero the monster dies and you receive one loot and XP equal to the dungeon level.<br/><br/>Traps - traps litter the dungeon but most can be disarmed or bypassed if you have the appropriate equipment. Even if the gremlins ran off with your rope there is always a chance you can come out unscathed if you pass an appropriate Strength, Agility or Intelligence test. Successful, tests result in an XP reward and negation of any potential damage. Your Mom called and insisted that you should get at least one XP even if you fail the challenge just like in High School.<br/><br/>All rolls maybe manipulated with the use of the luck stat. Spending one luck will allow you to modify a die result by 1 up or down or allow for a complete reroll.<br/><br/>Play progresses through 5 dungeon levels separated by a staircase.  You may camp at the stairs without the threat of a wandering monster interrupting your siesta. You may level your Rogue at anytime so long as you have the XP. When you get to the final room draw a boss monster and fight. Boss monsters have special abilities activated depending on your attack roll they can summon additional monsters, drain your level, heal, etc...<br/><br/>Upon slaying the boss monster...<br/><br/>Do: Take a photo of your Rogue and discuss your victory on the forums. Then email your Mom, let her know you did do something with your life after all.<br/><br/>Don't: Call your primary school bully and challenge her to a rematch. She's busy running a fortune 500 company and driving her Lambo.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game presents the escape of the submarine ORP Eagle from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea in the first weeks of World War II.<br/><br/>After the outbreak of war in September 1939, ORP Orzeł left its base in the Bay of Gdańsk. Its commander, complaining about health problems, directed the ship to the Talinn, the capital of Estonia. There, on September 15, the unit was interned by Estonians. But the Polish crew decided to flee, to reach Great Britain and continue the fight against Germany. At this point, the game begins.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is different for each player. The Polish Navy player wants the submarine ORP Orzeł to escape from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea. He must carefully plan his movement to avoid detection by the German air force and attacks by Kriegsmarine torpedo boats. The German Kriegsmarine player wants to sink the ship before it leaves the Baltic.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player rolls dice, and the results enable various activities: moving, attacking, placing mines, and more. The Polish moves are partly hidden from the German player, which makes the game very suspenseful.<br/><br/>Box contents:<br/>A game board presenting a map of the Baltic Sea, a figurine of the submarine ORP Orzeł, 8 wooden dice, 24 cardboard tokens, 2 player screens, two booklets with game rules and a historical article (one booklet is in Polish, and second in English).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

As always with the Native Americans, the wise elders have the most influence and occupy the highest positions in the hierarchy. Due to their old age, however, they are also vulnerable to the youngsters, who want to take their place and will not hesitate to challenge their opponents. Which clan can obtain the most feathers and thus select the new leader?<br/><br/>In Cherokee, players try to occupy the most and highest positions in the hierarchy with their clan members. On a turn, a player chases away one member in the pyramid of cards, which represents the hierarchy of the tribe. This gap is then filled with one successor from below, with that gap being filled likewise. At the end of a turn, the player adds one card from his hand to the final gap in the base of the pyramid.<br/><br/>Cherokee is a game of paranoia &ndash; which colors are your enemies?<br/><br/>",

Played with 32-cards, a German pack is usually used (acorns, leaves, hearts, bells) but a French-suited pack (spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs) will do just as well. The game is a trick-taking one with an interesting mechanism used for selecting the trump suit. Furthermore, when playing towards tricks, in most cases one is not obliged to follow suit!<br/><br/>The game is often played in pubs in Bavaria, with the losers buying the drinks. A system of signaling to your partner using a code involving small facial movements is permitted. Your opponents may or may not notice these, and you may in any case be bluffing!<br/><br/>",

The shared deck includes a fixed amount of five types of resources, which are from the most common to the rarest: coal, oil, natural gas, wood and uranium.<br/><br/>The game lasts three rounds and at the end of each round, players check their production. The more cards you have played on the table, the more you produce. If your company cannot produce enough energy for the market, it will be fined for not upholding its end of the contract. In addition, after comparing the production of all players, whoever has used the most of each resource type is fined for pollution. To make things interesting, you have the option of turning your production cards face down, so that they won't be counted as pollution. Though this action requires valuable turns to accomplish, all of the companies might use plenty of effort to mitigate their pollution!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player who produces the most energy, while dodging production fines through clever card play, wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a group of adventurers attempting to sneak into the Lonely Mountain (Erebor) and steal as much loot as possible. However, they must escape before Smaug the Dragon awakens, discovers their trespasses, and slays them all. The game takes place relatively soon after Smaug attacked and drove out the Dwarves in Third Age 2770. At that time, Smaug had not yet sealed all of the minor entrances to Erebor, and he considered the entire inner complex of rooms and tunnels to be his &quot;lair&quot;. Thus adventurers can enter (and hopefully leave) in a variety of ways. A raid such as the one this game depicts could have been the event that caused Smaug to close all the minor entrances and to gather most of Erebor&acute;s loot into one huge pile.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board representing the inner complex of rooms and tunnels where Smaug and most of the &quot;treasure&quot; of the Lonely Mountain reside. The board is highly abstracted and simplified to make play quick and easy. Four of the available groups of adventurers represent the interests of the four major races of Middle-earth: Dwarves, Elves, Men, and Orcs. The &quot;Freebooters&quot; are an independent group of adventurers out for glory and loot. Each group has the same mix of 10 characters: 1 Mage, 1 Animist, 1 Bard, 1 Ranger, 2 Scouts, 2 Archers, and 2 Fighters.<br/><br/>",

Will you be able to make the highest cake?<br/>The object of the game is to make the highest cake (10 layers) according to the orders you receive, keeping in mind that balance plays an important role.<br/><br/>Players place their Plates on their hands. On top of these Plates, they will stack the layers of their cakes depending on the Order card (one layer, two layers&hellip;). In order to do so, each player draws 2 Sponge Cake cards and places them in a way they can put a Frosting card on top of the Sponge cake. In following turns, they will stack layers on top of the ones that are already on their Plates.<br/><br/>The game ends when at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:<br/>&bull;    A player makes a 10 layer cake, without it collapsing, and rings the bell.<br/>&bull;    The Order deck runs out of cards. In that case, players tally their points. The player with the most points wins the game (Order cards grant points according to their difficulty).<br/>In case of a tie, the tied players share the victory.<br/>Remember! There are 2 strategies to get the victory:<br/>&bull;    Stack the layers very quickly, with a high risk that your cake will collapse,<br/>&bull;    Or make the cake slowly in order to get the 10 layers.<br/><br/>La pasteler&iacute;a del Chef Sweeter est&aacute; a todo gas.

Para ello, toman dos cartas plegadas de bizcocho, y las colocan de tal forma que puedan poner sobre ellas una carta redonda de cobertura. En turnos posteriores, construir&aacute;n pisos sobre los que ya tuvieran en su bandeja.<br/><br/>El juego termina cuando se cumpla, al menos, una de estas condiciones:<br/>&bull; Un jugador elabore una tarta de 10 pisos sin que se caiga y pulse el timbre.<br/>&bull; Se terminen todas las cartas de pedido. En este caso, se cuentan los puntos conseguidos por cada jugador y gana quien m&aacute;s puntos haya obtenido. (Las cartas de pedido tienen puntos seg&uacute;n su dificultad).<br/>En caso de empate, se comparte la victoria.

The base game uses 3 types of poisons, and 4 optional cards add a fifth.  Some cards have jewels, and some have medicine.  Other cards have no special feature.<br/><br/>After each trick, the winner of the trick collects, in front of themselves, any jewels shown on the cards played and any poison or medicine cards played.  Next, before the following trick proceeds, a card is revealed from a different deck of cards.  Some of these cards have poisons on them, and others only jewels.<br/><br/>At any time a player has a chance to play a card, they can instead play a card face down to indicate that they are withdrawing from the round.  They move any jewels they have collected from this round into their bag, and while they continue to play cards, they will not win any further jewels.<br/><br/>The player with the most jewels after 5 rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

The Toastmaster may only communicate by repeating your guesses back to you!<br/><br/>Each time someone makes a guess, the Toastmaster must decide whether that guess is &ldquo;closer&rdquo; to their Secret Word than the &ldquo;closest&rdquo; previous guess.<br/><br/>If the new guess is closer, the Toastmaster repeats it back to you. If the new guess isn&rsquo;t closer, the Toastmaster repeats the closest previous guess instead. Keep making clever guesses to get closer and closer to the Secret Word, until you can guess the Secret Word itself!<br/><br/>What makes one guess &ldquo;closer&rdquo; to the Secret Word than another? It&rsquo;s completely up to Toastmaster! They can use whatever criteria they think will help you guess the Secret Word &ndash; and hopefully the rest of you can figure it out!<br/><br/>You have only six rounds to guess the Secret Word, so make every guess count!<br/><br/>",

Actions include foraging for food, scavenging for valuables washed up ashore, and lighting the signal fire. Of course, it might be easier to forage for food in your neighbor's stockpile. Conflicts are resolved by comparing total size on each side of a fight. A random card is added to each side's total.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, look to see if a boat was sighted and the signal fire lit.

When the raids of the Uskoks, corsars of Catholic faith in service of the Habsburgs, from the Kvarner Gulf to the Venetian routes became more insistent, Venice reacted by triggering a long and bloody war on its eastern borders and in Istria with the idea of putting an end to the raids, defeat the Austrian challenge and to regain the fortress once founded and then lost, Gradisca.

Everything you need to create your own unique squad of soldiers!<br/><br/>At the start of each mission, you each select one or more Player Soldiers, equip them with skills, weapons, and combat gear within the mission's Resource limit. You then fight your way through hostile territory and engage enemy soldiers, as you attempt to reach and complete your mission objective. Every mission is a stand-alone game. You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>The contents of this set includes:<br/><br/><br/>     280 cards comprising:<br/><br/><br/><br/>        5 UK Player Soldiers / 3 Team Soldiers / 5 Non-Player Soldiers / 5 Squad Soldiers / 2 Squad Light Vehicles<br/>        8 Missions / 8 Objectives / 16 Locations<br/>        14 Weapons / 12 Gear<br/>        22 Skills / 6 Situation / 4 Service Records<br/>        80 Action / 13 Location Markers<br/>        66 German Hostiles / 11 Events<br/><br/><br/><br/>     6 counter sheets with 516 counters<br/>     d6 and d10 dice<br/>     Mounted display board<br/>     Warfighter Universal Rulebook<br/><br/><br/>As with all Warfighter products, Warfighter: North Africa is compatible with all other Warfighter products, especially the Europe, Pacific and Mediterranean WWII core boxes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Patton&rsquo;s Vanguard: The Battle of Arracourt, 1944, is a two-play area movement game that simulates the German counterattacks in the Lorraine region of France. As the summer of 1944 drew to a close and Combat Command A of the American 4th Armored Division passed through the French town of Arracourt the war seemed all but over. It seemed as if nothing could stop the Americans from forcing their way across the German border and reaching the Rhine River. The weather, however, was rapidly deteriorating and Allied air reconnaissance failed to detect a counteroffensive by the German 5th Panzer Army. The stage was set for the largest clash of armor on the western front until the Battle of the Bulge.<br/><br/>The game consists of two quick-playing four turn scenarios depicting the German attempt to drive the Americans from the German border. The first scenario (September 19 - 22, 1944)  pits two inexperienced German panzer brigades against a confident and veteran Combat Command A. The German side has more armor, including the superior Panther tank, and the poor weather generally favors them, but the American side has more artillery as well as better tactics and leadership. The second scenario (September 25-28, 1944) pits the experienced German 11th Panzer Division against Combat Command A and the newly arrived Combat Command B, now hampered by restricted fuel supplies. In each scenario both players will be challenged to determine whether it is better to simply attack, or spend valuable time attempting to maneuver in continually changing weather conditions before attacking. Fast, furious, and chess-like, this is a game for players who love concentrated action!<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day <br/>Area: 1&quot; = .75 mile / 1.21 kilometers<br/>Units: Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>1 - 22 x 17&quot; full color map<br/>176 - full color 5/8&quot; die-cut counters<br/>16 Page Rule Booklet<br/>​Ziploc Bag<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "KerFlip! is a fast-thinking word game that rewards you for making anagrams from a group of letter tiles faster than your opponents can. At the beginning of each round, players simultaneously drop a predetermined number of tiles onto the board, then quickly flip them all ivory side up. (The fronts of the tiles are ivory, while the backs are orange.) At this point the round is a free-for-all, with players racing to call out one word each. If the last player is taking too long to call a word, any of his opponents can &quot;hurry&quot; him by starting the timer; if he doesn't call out a word in 15 seconds, he busts, scoring nothing.<br/><br/>Once every player has called a word for the round, they score points in the order they called out the words, so the first player who called scores first, the second player second, etc. The first time a tile is used &ndash; that is, while its ivory side is face-up &ndash; the tile is worth 10 points. Once it's been scored, flip (or &quot;KerFlip&quot;) it to its orange side, reducing its value to 5 points for all other players who used it in the same round. Some tiles, identified by a small number in the bottom right corner, are &quot;premium tiles&quot; that award players cards with bonus point values.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, return any unused (ivory) tiles to the draw pouch and sweep all used (orange) tiles into the collection chutes in the game box. The game lasts 15-20 minutes (about 10-12 rounds) depending on the number of players (2-4). To clean up at the end of the game, pick up the game box and gently shake it to funnel the tiles into a collection cup under the board.<br/><br/>",

This journey is arduous and lasts for many days. Their destination is the mystical oasis called Tzerzura, in the heart of the desert that lies beyond the mountains. Back home the village elders, too wary to travel, watch over the children. One night though, the elder notice that the stars stopped shining, without the stars in the firmament, their sons and daughters cannot hope to find their way back across the desert. So the elders tell their grandchildren about the legend of the Tzerzurians. Now they must ask the young children to embark on a journey to find these legendary Tzerzurians.<br/><br/>In Zura, players are the children that venture into the far reaches of the land to find the Tzerzurians, that will make the stars shine once again for their parents to find the way back from the desert. To do so, players will attempt to play as many travel cards of the same type as they can. The more cards they play, the better are the chances they will find the Tzerzurians. On their journey they might find other beings they aren't looking for but who, by chance, were entrapped in the middle of that mystical mess!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Lee.<br/><br/>General Joseph Hooker, newly appointed by President Lincoln, was in command of the Army of the Potomac. Lincoln&rsquo;s engagement letter ended with the words &quot;Give Us Victories&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The game begins on April 30, 1863, with the Army of the Potomac now beyond the Rappahannock and Rapidan, marching toward Chancellorsville. The game is of intermediate complexity and has simple and intuitive rules. The command system is the heart of the game: you simply check how many points you have in a turn, choose the formations to activate (divisions for the Confederates and corps for the Union), and put them in a cup. Your opponent does the same; then mix and pull&hellip;! Formations may move, attack, entrench, bombard and so on. Special rules cover the use of skirmishers, trench building, and bridge building. Players perform actions alternately with a random activation system always engaging and different, creating chaos and uncertainty, in a realistic and tense simulation.<br/><br/>Four games included<br/><br/>    Main game - 2 standard maps, 2 counter sets (figure and Nato style, so players can choose), medium difficulty, 6-8 hours for the campaign, 4 scenarios, 2 variations.<br/>    Strategic game - 1 A3 map, 1 counters set, 1 hour of gameplay, low difficulty.<br/>    Solo game - AI simulates Army of the Potomac, 1 counters set; uses the same maps of the main game.<br/>    Skirmish game - set of paper toy soldiers, landscape elements and counters; low difficulty, playing time 30 minutes.<br/><br/><br/>In the box:<br/><br/>    2 standard maps (86x54 cm)<br/>    1 A3 map (strategic game)<br/>    1 12x10 (cm) map (variant for main game)<br/>    4 counters set, 17 mm side <br/>    Set up charts<br/>    Rules aid, tables, solo game display, solo game booklet<br/>    Paper soldiers (cardboard)<br/>    Rules booklet (Main game, scenarios, strategic, solo system, skirmish)<br/><br/><br/>",

The objective is to connect five (or more) of one's tiles, including at least one of each type, together (sides and corners count).  Additionally, all five (or more) tiles must be face-up, or unactivated.  The game ends immediately when a player achieves this goal.

The infected tile is removed from the Grid and replaced with a Zombie tile that has not yet been added to the Grid.

The closer you get to uncovering your target, however, the more you risk compromising your own position. Stealth and cunning are your greatest allies as only agents who remain hidden in the shadows will survive the hunt.

If the card is a match, you eliminate that safe house. Otherwise your opponent reveals whether your card is higher or lower than the hidden card in the safe house but does not reveal the numeral on that card.<br/><br/>When you switch agents, you replace a face-down card from one of your safe houses with a card in your hand, possibly the same card. You can take this action at most five times during the game.<br/><br/>When you attack from your safe house, you reveal one of your face-down safe house cards, then reveal an opponent's safe house. If the numbers match, your opponent's safe house is eliminated; otherwise your safe house is eliminated.<br/><br/>Players keep swapping turns until all three of a player's safe houses are eliminated.<br/><br/>",

Players make money for each transported passenger, with the player making the most money in the last round being the winner.<br/><br/>The airport, plane and passenger cards, which can be purchased in auctions, have been designed to join up together (when laid inline) in a way that visually validates all flights. Longer flights require larger fuel trucks so management of the order of flights to different geographical destinations becomes a mini-puzzle of increasing complexity as players acquire more passengers, planes and airports.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players must face aviation-related events, some of which force rearrangement of their flights. The key to victory is creating a flight network resilient to events and sabotages while effectively using your unique player ability and trading skills.<br/><br/>Connecting Flights can also be played in a cooperative mode (1-2 players), in which players work together to fly passengers to their desired destinations.

        "description": "The active player each turn draws cards from the deck equal to the number of players but does not look at these cards. He then turns one card face-up and gives it to one of the players, including himself; he repeats this process until each player has received exactly one card.<br/><br/>Each card includes a number from 0 to 5&mdash;the lower the better&mdash;and might also have an action or victory points! Each time a player receives a card, he checks to see whether his total equals 13 or more. If it does, each other player receives VPs from his own cards. The unlucky player with the total of 13 or more discards all his cards.<br/><br/>Possible actions on the cards include veto cards (in order to say no to a card in the future), 13 --&gt; 18 (raising your bust total to 18), lose your last card, and receive 1 or 2 VPs immediately.<br/><br/>The German title of the game translates into English as 'That takes the biscuit'.<br/><br/>",

Buildings are lucrative only if the immediate surrounding area is preserved. The value of nature is appreciated so much more if it is in danger of disappearing. Correspondingly, the price of virgin land varies widely - either very high, or very low - because preservation of nature does not give you income, but it does get you more recognition for your troubles.<br/><br/>This edge between commerce and nature is rendered even more difficult for the players because at the end (at least in this game) only one pays you money. Who then possesses little at the start, and who has lost in every game, matters little, except who is the richest person at the end.<br/><br/>Each round, players bid for tiles to lay on the island paradise. One side is a building, the other a forest. The buyer chooses which side to play on. The more forest remains, the more your buildings are worth. However, the more buildings you own, the less forest there will be. Players bid with coins in their closed fist. The highest bidder wins, however, they only pay the cost of the second highest bid. In order to win, you must finish with more money than you started with. As soon as the last building counter has been sold and placed on the board (and any resulting bonuses have been paid) the game ends. All players who have less money than they started with have lost. Out of the remaining players, the winner is the person with the most money.<br/><br/>",

Players each control a hero, arrange them in a formation, and prepare for the oncoming waves of monsters, traps, treasure, etc.  If they can survive this automatically-advancing onslaught, then they win as a team.  This is not your father's &quot;move-and-attack&quot; dungeon crawler: by combining deck-building elements with a blazingly fast &quot;conveyor belt&quot; mechanic, this game has deep tactics, but plays incredibly quickly.<br/><br/>Each player controls one hero.  Each hero represents a different theme: chaos, order, harmony, or discipline.  Their hero choice decides their starting deck of cards.  Each different theme has a different playstyle, but also informs what future cards they can add to their deck.  But, the players are not locked into these themes - they can combine others into their decks to create new twists and combinations on classic fantasy characters.  These heroes line up in a row, with the &ldquo;marching order&rdquo; formation extremely tactically important.  Don&rsquo;t worry, they can (and will) rearrange throughout the game.<br/><br/>Across from the party line-up is the deadly dungeon itself.  Whenever a card is removed from the dungeon, be it by killing a monster, overcoming a challenge, or taking some treasure, the dungeon automatically shifts towards the players and refills the missing card.  This way, the game is incredibly fast-paced: no moving, exploring, or down-time.  This dungeon is coming at you full-speed!<br/><br/>Fighting is resolved by playing unique combinations of cards, but be careful!  Your hand of cards is also your lifebar!  Overextend and you&rsquo;ll leave yourself vulnerable.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game includes one neutral piece. Shuffle the pieces with the markings hidden, then place them in a wiggly snakelike row, then reveal the markings. One player chooses the color they want, then the other player takes the first turn.<br/><br/>On a turn, choose a stack that you control &mdash; that is, that has one of your pieces on top &mdash; then move the topmost piece of that stack or the top two pieces of that stack left or right a number of spaces equal to the number of markings on that piece. As you create gaps in the row, you can squish the stacks closer to one another to create a shorter snake. Instead of moving a piece or a stack of two pieces, you can choose two stacks that you control and swap them. (You cannot swap stacks if the opponent swapped stacks on their previous turn.) The neutral piece can be landed on, and it becomes part of a stack.<br/><br/>As soon as someone creates a stack of seven pieces, they win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Box description:<br/>War of Resistance is a detailed, operational level game which chronicles the second Sino-Japanese Conflict starting on July 7, 1937. Often touted as the true beginning of World War II, this 8 year war is the culmination of a decade of aggressive Japanese policy in northern and central China. The game covers the conflict through Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.<br/>The Chinese theatre is neither trivial nor inconsequential to the progress and outcome of World War II on a global scale. Over one million soldiers on each side perished. It is estimated that another 7.5 million Chinese civilians died. Over 40 million Chinese were left homeless. The vast majority of Japanese ground combat and support soldiers were engaged in China, preventing their use against the western Allies in the Pacific. America's material dominance may have been the decisive factor contributing to the Japanese demise, but Japan was already doomed to failure in the Chinese quagmire. This is essential to the greater understanding of the war in the Pacific.<br/>Western nations tend to ignore and forget the Chinese contribution to the war effort. It is an indication of western arrogance that World War II is considered to have started on September 1, 1939 and not July 7, 1937. The Chinese war effort was far from stellar, but it was enormous. The immensity of the conflict sapped the Japanese war machine to exhaustion.<br/>War of Resistance is a two-player game, with one player representing the military high command of the Japanese forces and their puppet allies, and the other the fractured Chinese military forces. The Japanese player must force the collapse of the Chinese national will to resist. The Chinese player must cling to survival until the entry of the western nations into the Pacific war ensures ultimate victory over the Japanese invaders. Both sides maneuver their forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    One rules booklet.<br/>    Two Orders of Battle booklets. One for the Japanese and one for the Chinese orders of battle.<br/>    A Battle Scenarios Booklet<br/>    Four &quot;full-sized&quot; maps (Maps G1 thru G4) and 2 &quot;half&quot; maps (Maps G5 and G6).<br/>    Two map overlays<br/>    8 counter sheets (CS G1 - CS G7)<br/>    A set of charts <br/>    Two six-sided die<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the morning of July 1st, 1863 a column of Rebel soldiers from Brig. Gen. James Archer&rsquo;s brigade of the Army of Northern Virginia headed down the Chambersburg Pike from Cashtown, PA towards the town of Gettysburg in search of provisions. Since JEB Stuart&rsquo;s cavalry was nowhere to be found, the Confederate column was actually being led by the cannons of Pegram&rsquo;s Artillery Brigade in a rare 19th century deployment of &ldquo;recon by fire&rdquo;. Archer&rsquo;s Division commander, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth, was not worried however &ndash; he had it on firm authority that only militia was in the area and that &ldquo;they would run as soon as we appeared&rdquo;. Upon their approach up to Herr&rsquo;s Ridge to the west of Gettysburg, the dismounted Union cavalry pickets of Buford&rsquo;s 1st Cavalry Division began harassing the approaching butternut columns. As they were driven off and the Rebs crested the ridge, they were confronted with a far larger cavalry force than they had anticipated and they were now hotly engaged in an unexpected encounter. Archer&rsquo;s men, along with the quick-marching soldiers of Brig. Gen. Robert Davis&rsquo; brigade, began a coordinated advance on Buford&rsquo;s horse soldiers. The blue-clad troopers were hard pressed but their carbines allowed them to fire rapidly and from cover. Relief finally appeared at about 9:30 am when Maj. Gen. John Reynolds of Ist Corps rode up to Buford at the Lutheran Seminary. He then famously asked Buford, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, John?&rdquo; Buford&rsquo;s reply was &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s to pay!&rdquo; And from such inauspicious beginnings started one of the greatest battles of history. This first day was to set the tone of the entire three-day Battle of Gettysburg &hellip;. a first day in which ultimate victory or defeat for either side could be traced to the decisions, maneuverings and fighting performances of each army&rsquo;s soldiers and leaders during these initial critical hours.<br/><br/>The Devil&rsquo;s to Pay! is a game depicting not only the actual events of July 1st at the Battle of Gettysburg, but also what could have happened on that fateful first day. Two players will each command either the Confederate forces of Lt. Gen A.P. Hill and Lt. Gen. Richard Ewell or the Union forces of Maj. Gen. John Reynolds and Maj. Gen. Oliver Howard. The game is played on a gorgeous map of the battle area designed and drawn by Rick Barber, with each hex equaling 250 yards. Formations are multi-counter brigades, with each Strength Point representing about 100 men, with each unit counter representing a group of regiments, apportioned as they were deployed at the battle. The system is a new version of the Blind Swords system, with this implementation emphasizing ease-of-play and accessibility while maintaining the popular spirit of &ldquo;historical chaos&rdquo; represented by the other games in the Blind Swords family. The system utilizes a unique chit-pull mechanic that will keep players on their toes and engaged throughout the entire game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

The Wiseman, trusting in his skills and wanting some peace, proposes a challenge to the monkey to take place in the sacred court. The first to reach the opposite side is the winner and will become the master of the temple &mdash; the sense&iuml;.<br/><br/>The rules of Sense&iuml; are simple, yet the depth of the game is infinite. On your turn, you can move two stones and send your character across the game board. Your goal is to block your opponent and at the same time to find a path to victory. There are two ways of playing: the Arashi variant is played without limits of movements and the Shizukana is played with a more Zen-like challenge.<br/><br/>Sense&iuml; is a new edition of Diaballik, and you can use either the original rules for that game or the new rules that allow players to move pieces as many squares as they want, which changes gameplay greatly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cultistorm is a Cooperative Weird Fiction and Cosmic Horror Board Game in the universe of H. P. Lovecraft.<br/><br/>Cultistorm is the expression of our respect and love for H. P. Lovecraft. It is more than just an ordinary board game &ndash; this is a Lovecraftian gaming experience with literary and musical dimensions. Our theme choice was motivated by a deep commitment to the work and heritage of H. P. Lovecraft. We want to create an excellent board game for those who know and love Lovecraft, and we would like to make Lovecraft&rsquo;s work known to those who are board game fans.<br/><br/>Each round of Cultistorm consists of 6 phases where players combat cultists and try to close 5 portals.  The game is lost if any of the following happens:<br/>● Any investigator goes insane. <br/>● Any Great Old One reaches a location card. <br/>● The number of cultists exceeds the cultist threshold. <br/>● The investigators do not manage to seal all the locations before they defeat every Great Old One <br/>after the activation of the Final Act card.<br/><br/>Additional expnsions include:<br/>- Narrative Expansion and Script Book: the true jewel of Cultistorm is a hardcover book containing 500+ pieces of high quality weird fiction, illustrated with colourful full-page artwork. The Narrative Expansion is a story-driven game mode in which the stories impact the game itself.<br/>- Solo Expansion for those solitary detectives who wish take up the fight on their own.<br/>- Campaign Expansion: seven connected and increasingly challenging scenarios introducing new game mechanics.<br/>- Overlord Expansion: this adds a sixth player who takes on the role of Lovecraft himself. As a puppet master, this player controls the cultists, and thus the whole game.<br/>- Nine minor expansion modules: each of these introduces new game mechanics, increasing the replayability and difficulty of Cultistorm. Most modules can be played simultaneously.<br/>- Game Night Expansion (as add-on): this unique and innovative expansion provides the possibility of combining up to six separate Cultistorm games into one epic story. A common fight, in which the choices of the different teams can impact each other. This expansion was developed specifically for clubs who organise board gaming events.<br/><br/>",

He tries to make a further &pound;300 by drawing dividends and by buying and selling shares in trading companies. There are six companies. Players do not own companies. The only way a player can obtain an interest in a company is by buying its shares. Players may invest all their money in one company or invest it in several companies as they please. Dice decide the dividends paid on the various shares, and these in turn influence the share values. Frequently, during the game, players may be able to foretell which shares are likely to rise and which to fall, and can buy or sell accordingly. The game is thus a mixture of luck and skill, and fun galore.<br/><br/>What You Get:<br/><br/>1 mounted Playing Board<br/>6 sets of share pegs<br/>Rule booklet<br/>Money in 5 denominations<br/>Deck of 'Market News' cards<br/>6 sets of Share Certificates (8 each in Flutter, 10 each in Mr. Moneymaker)<br/>1 six sided die and 1 letter die<br/>1 dice shaker<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On 18 July 1936, various generals in the Spanish army rose up against the government of the Second Republic. The failure of the coup as it had been originally planned gave way to a civil conflict between the defenders of the democratic government and the backers of the military coup. Machado&rsquo;s two Spain's fought each other for nearly three years in a battle which reflected the political and social tensions affecting the world at that time.<br/><br/>The  opposing armies were very different: on one hand, the Republican army possessed a limited number of professional soldiers and many popular militias belonging to political parties and labor unions. To this were added the International Brigades, formed from foreign volunteers of diverse origin; a fighting force which was highly motivated, but poorly coordinated and typically poorly organized. On the other hand, the Franco&acute;s army had most of the professional military, along with Carlist and fascist militias, many native Moroccan troops, and the volunteers of the Condor Legion and the Corpo Trupe Voluntarie, sent by Hitler and Mussolini, respectively.<br/><br/>From a military point of view, the Spanish Civil War presaged the global conflict which would soon erupt. In the mid-1930s, military high commands from all over the globe theorized on the possibilities of motorized armies and &ldquo;lightning war&rdquo;. Both Nazis and Soviets rehearsed armored tactics in Spain, and tested various types of weapons. In addition, the importance that air superiority would have on all later conflicts was made clear. All of these elements make the Spanish Civil War a fascinating conflict from an historical point of view and with regard to military strategy.<br/><br/>To the Barricades!, the first title in the War Storms series, is a game which attempts to simulate, at platoon and company level, the battles which took place on the different fronts of the war. The rules are oriented towards the tactical simulation of combat involving armored vehicles, infantry, artillery, and aircraft, and as such they are especially suited to represent almost any 20th century armed conflict as it actually happened.<br/><br/>",

On that night, the ghosts travel through the neighborhood looking for delicious candy. Using their best scare tactics, ghosts will haunt the costumed kiddos to steal their sweet sweet candy. But they have to be careful not to scare them away. Ghosts just want a candy delight, not to cause them a fright.<br/><br/>This new edition expands upon the original version with more kids (100 total!), a new &quot;junk&quot; set of treats that you do not want to collect (like toothbrushes, rocks, ketchup packets, pennies, etc.) and new ghosts.<br/><br/>Playing the game is easy. Select one of your ghost cards to bid for turn order. Then resolve by choosing a kid to haunt, taking their candy then using their unique ability. Treats score at the end of the game based on your ghosts specific preferences.<br/><br/>Note: Ghosts Love Candy Too is a revised and expanded new version of Ghosts Love Candy, released by Steve Jackson games in 2016.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The English Civil Wars were actually a series of wars fought between the year 1642 and 1651 by the Parliamentarians and the Royalists. Battles of the English Civil War presents some of the key battles from the period 1642 to 1646, commonly known as the First English Civil War. In the game, the Player will be commanding various units, often representing many hundreds of men each, seeking to achieve various Objectives. The aim of this book is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. It does not try to replace more complex wargames which often take many hours to learn and to play. Each of the 15 Battles can be played in around 20 to 40 minutes, and each one should provide plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces.<br/><br/>This book is a solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will need at least 8, but preferably 10, standard six-sided dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A single token of a third color called the Bobail starts in the center of the board. To win, either surround the Bobail or move it to your baseline. On a turn, a player does these two actions in this order:<br/><br/><br/>    Move the Bobail: Move it one square in any direction; if you can't move it, you lose (because the other player has surrounded it).<br/>    Move one of your tokens: Move it any direction to the furthest square possible without leaping over other tokens.<br/><br/><br/>On the first turn, the starting player skips the Bobail move.<br/><br/>Neutron is identical to Bobail and first appeared in 1978 with Robert A.

Earth is weak and lies directly between its two opponents, but its society is vigorous and expanding. They can use technologies of both other races.<br/><br/>The game is unique as it is practically the only balanced three player wargame in existence.

        "description": "Days of Decision II is a strategic level game about the politics and conflicts that created the Second World War. The period covered is 1936-46, and the players can make (or choose not to make) many of the decisions that led to the war.<br/><br/>The game is very detailed in its political aspect, and is more a political game than a wargame. Each country affected by the war is represented on an &quot;ideological&quot; chart which tracks the movement of the powers into the different spheres of influence: Fascist, Communist and Democrat.  Where each country lies on this chart is vital to which country controls their decisions and forces.  Political decisions are chosen from a large array of IPOs (International Policy Options) and a number of Political Options available only to the country that you're playing.<br/><br/>The game is based on the original Days of Decision (I) but is almost a new game. The old one had 4 million possible outcomes, this one has over one hundred trillion (according to the game designer).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Napoleon Retreats - Campaign in France II<br/><br/>Winter 1814: Hope Against Hope<br/><br/>After dispatching Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Army of Silesia at Vauchamps, Napoleon diverted temporarily toward the Seine at Montereau, for an inconclusive brush with Schwarzenberg&rsquo;s Army of Bohemia. His inveterate foe Bl&uuml;cher apparently had learned no lessons and threatened to move again on Paris. By March 3rd Napoleon was returning northward along the bank of the Ourcq River. The fall of Soissons, cheaply surrendered by General Moreau, saw the quarry escape over the Aisne River to link-up with 43,000 reinforcements near Laon, raising his strength to over 100,000. While the Emperor concentrated between Fismes and Berry au Bac, Bl&uuml;cher continued to retreat on Laon. Reaching Craonne, the Emperor decided to advance along the chemin des dames to test Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s position on the plateau, and clear the flank of his advance on Laon.<br/><br/>The next game of the TLNB-Series covers the Campaign in France, Part II: <br/>6 March to 13 March 1814. <br/>The major battle was Laon, on 9-10 March, when Napoleon, with 37,000, went up against Bl&uuml;cher's position, on the hill of Laon, with 85,000. (Marshal Marmont with a separate VI Corps was supposed to support the attack, but he was dispersed in a night combat.) Bl&uuml;cher wasn't feeling well and failed to pursue. One more battle was to follow (after two days for R&amp;R) and Napoleon won that battle: Reims, against St. Priest. So actually, he won two out of three.<br/><br/>Battles Simulated<br/> Craonne, Struggle for the plateau des dames, 7 March <br/>The chemin des dames runs the length of a continuous ridge from the N2 to the N44, the two main highways leading north to Laon. Bl&uuml;cher stationed Sacken and Woronzoff&rsquo;s infantry on the plateau just west of Craonne. Napoleon decided on a frontal attack up the chemin on what he believed to be no more than a 20,000-man rearguard. The Russians begrudgingly gave ground, gaining it back in a counterattack, and throwing Ney off the Plateau. Once the French Guard cavalry had stabilized the situation, the Russian right flank began to give way under combined pressure of infantry and cavalry. Napoleon directed 88 guns from the Guard artillery to destroy the Russian center and sent the Guard infantry to attack along the chemin to complete the victory. The Russians withdrew in good order.<br/><br/>Laon, Beginning of the End, 9-10 March <br/>Marshal Ney advanced on Laon in the morning snow. B&uuml;low with 17,000 men held the suburbs of Semilly and Ardon. On the plain west of Laon, Winzingerode was posted with 25,000 men; east of Laon at Athies, Yorck and Kleist held another 25,000 men; Langeron and Sacken were in reserve with 36,000; Napoleon attacked with fewer than 40,000. As the southern suburbs traded hands, Bl&uuml;cher thought that he was being attacked just by an advanced guard, but Napoleon threw everything into Ney&rsquo;s attack up until 6 PM. Marmont commanded a separate force of 10,000 which had managed to fight their way to Athies by 5 PM, camping for the night. At 7:30, the Prussian Yorck launched a combined arms attack that routed Marmont&rsquo;s entire camp. A small group of French Guardsmen managed to halt the pursuit. Marmont lost 45 guns, all his wagons, and 3,500 men. Bl&uuml;cher lost a chance to destroy his foe&rsquo;s small army.<br/><br/>Reims, A Quick Success en passant, 13 March <br/>On March 12th the Russian General St. Priest snatched Reims from its small French garrison. Hearing of this, Napoleon and his small force moved east on the 13th, beginning their attack at 4 PM, quickly driving out the enemy, and cutting communications between Bl&uuml;cher and Schwarzenberg at the same time. Only 10,000 French troops were actually engaged against 15,000 of St. Priest. St. Priest was killed along with 3,000 men while losing 23 guns.<br/><br/>Campaign Game, 6 -13 March<br/><br/>All three maps fit together to create an irregular playing area 44&quot;x68&quot; and covering an entire week of fighting.<br/><br/>&bull; Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps <br/>&bull; 560 die-cut units <br/>&bull; 100 playing cards <br/>&bull; Two rulebooks<br/>&bull; 15 player aid cards <br/>&bull; Game Box​<br/><br/>STANDARD TLNB-GAME SYSTEM:<br/><br/>&bull; scale: 480m (525 yards)/ hex;<br/>&bull; strength: 500-800 men/SP;<br/>&bull; turn-duration: 1 hour/turn<br/><br/>",

The game is played over the course of four years, each consisting of three markedly different seasons, two of which &ndash; the aptly named Mud and Snow &ndash; inhibit the use of some actions and units. The movement and its range is predicated on the current season, unit type and the ability to create and maintain a chain of units. The Germans have to either hold a set of objectives by the end of 1944... or capture the Soviet leader, Stalin himself.

Many become disillusioned, discontent even, and turn to pirating the prosperous trade routes between the five planets, much to the regret of the colonies' leaders, who have great need of the trade income in order to advance technologies and create jobs for the newly-arrived colonists.<br/><br/>Colonies is a game of resource management in the far reaches of space in which the players compete to dominate in trade, politics and technological development. Each player controls the administration of a planet with access to a unique resource. In order to win you need to collect the most colonial credits by trading resources, upgrading your technologies, keeping your trade lanes free of pirates, and perhaps pushing the council's decisions in the right direction.<br/><br/>At the begining of each turn, players receive an income of their own resource. The council meets each turn to vote on how to handle an occurring event. The outcome can reward those willing to put in an effort or punish those who are not. Players may do well to form alliances in order to sway the vote in a favourable direction.<br/><br/>The resource income and the colonists that arrive each turn &ndash; sometimes in large numbers, sometimes in small &ndash; are used to make advances in five areas: Community, Military, Commerce, Influence and Industry. Following the council's vote, players take turns to either upgrade these areas or activate one of them to grant asylum to pirates in exchange for resources or hunt them for bounty, sell resources for Credits, make trade agreements more beneficial, or produce additional resources. When everyone has had three such actions, the players receive and pay resources according to the trade agreements, and any colonists that players have failed to employ turn to piracy, preventing players from getting income from their trade agreements next turn unless preemptive action is taken.<br/><br/>Colonies lasts ten turns, with players earning victory points (VPs) from colonial Credits and technology advances. In the end, the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

You build your Soldiers, select your Gear, and then run your mission. Within 30 to 60 minutes you will have succeeded or failed.<br/><br/>The contents of this set includes 280 cards comprising:<br/><br/><br/>    9 Italian Player Soldiers / 3 Team Soldiers / 5 Non-Player Soldiers / 5 Squad Soldiers<br/>    8 Missions / 8 Objectives / 18 Locations<br/>    15 Weapons / 11 Gear / 1 Unarmed Combat<br/>    25 Skills<br/>    10 Situation / 4 Service Records<br/>    78 Action / 12 Location Markers<br/>    60 UK Hostiles / 8 Events<br/>    6 counter sheets with 516 counters<br/>    d6 and d10 dice<br/>    Mounted display board<br/>    Warfighter Universal Rulebook<br/><br/><br/>As with all Warfighter products, Warfighter: Mediterranean is compatible with all other Warfighter products, especially the Europe, Pacific and North Africa WWII core boxes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The action is fast and realistic; the system is easy-to-learn.<br/><br/>In War Stories you are the commander issuing orders to infantry squads and armored fighting vehicles. Each game presents a scenario using a map with terrain overlays that regulates movement and impacts combat in a unique system that does not require charts or endless modifiers. Players receive a secret set of instructions with hidden deployment and objectives. Unit blocks have a variety of information that regulates their ability to move, fight and remain cool under fire.<br/><br/>War Stories also offers &quot;rule breaking&quot; asset and event cards. These enable War Stories to have additional complexity with minimal rules weight: the rules and effects are on the cards themselves. Assets are special equipment, troops, and abilities that a player has access to during the battle, such as machine guns, infiltration units, and the ability to lay mines. Events are random things that happen and create memorable moments on the battlefield such as reinforcements arriving, a gust of wind that starts a wildfire, or a damaged vehicle suddenly brewing up.<br/><br/>ages 14+<br/>1-2 players<br/>(Note: there is no solitaire system; it is a normal 2-player wargame, but the publisher printed &quot;1-2 players&quot; on the box)<br/>60 minutes<br/><br/>GAME COMPONENTS:<br/>- 5 double-sided mapboards<br/>- 23 double-sided terrain overlays<br/>- 75 painted wooden blocks &amp; stickers to represent vehicles &amp; infantry<br/>- 109 counters (vehicle damage, battlefield damage, fog of war, unit, order and ambush markers)<br/>- 33 asset cards<br/>- 21 event cards<br/>- 24 combat chips and 1 cloth drawbag<br/>- 2 16-page scenario booklets (one German and one Soviet)<br/>- 2 player screens/aids<br/>- 1 20-page rule book<br/><br/>Also see the sister game released at the same time: War Stories: Liberty Road, set on the Western front.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Superfarmer, each player takes a role of the owner of the animal farm. The main goal is to breed, exchange and gather different animals (rabbit, sheep, pig, cow, horse and two kinds of dogs) and the winner is a person who can gather at least one of each kind (except the dogs). But be careful there are foxes around trying to snatch your rabbits and wolves which can eat all your other animals (that is why you need dogs to protect your herd).<br/><br/>The game was designed, and originally named &quot;Hodowla zwierzątek&quot; (&quot;Animal husbandry&quot;) in the occupied Poland during Word War Two by famous polish mathematician Karol Borsuk and his wife. In these hard times the game became very popular and there were many home made copies sold by the Borsuks family. Sadly during the Warsaw rebellion at the end of war all copies were destroyed save one that was in another city. After the war it was returned to the Borsuks family. Now one of the Polish publishers decided to release the game.<br/><br/>The turn of each player consists of two actions: first you have a possibility to exchange your animals according to the special table (e.g for six rabbits you get one sheep, three pigs for a cow) and then you roll two special 12-sided dice with the pictures of animals on the sides. You count the number of pairs of the animals on rolled dice (together with the ones on the farm) and this is how many new animals you get, divided by two. The trick is that there is a fox on one dice and the wolf which are eating your animals.<br/><br/>The game is mostly based on the luck factor (dice). But there is a little strategy to it. Do you go for more &quot;expensive&quot; animals (which have less probability of creating offspring) or you stay with fast breeding but &quot;cheap&quot; rabbits. Do you exchange your animals for an &quot;insurance&quot; (dogs) from the foxes and wolves or risk in order to catch up with others farmers?<br/><br/>Game was intended for children but surprisingly it is also fun for adults.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/><br/>    Have You Herd? (with simplified rules)<br/>    Rancho (with more complex rules!)<br/><br/><br/>",

Players will start many scenarios without units and just a handful of money.  By building units and capturing cites, players can raise new capital in order to build bigger armies.<br/><br/>If the design is successful, the possibility of incorporating armies from newer Advance Wars games will be considered.

Once the first player has added five cards to their lodge, all the other players get to take one final turn. After the crazy card swap, the players add up the points in their beaver lodges.

Each level is comprised of a dungeon that the heroes will explore in an attempt to find the dungeon's boss. The heroes must then defeat the boss in order to gain more Triforce Shards.<br/><br/>The game employs a form of deck-building to allow the players to level up their heroes.  Each deck starts with just some basic skill cards representing a hero's Power, Courage and Wisdom.  The heroes can add items and treasures to these decks to power up their abilities throughout the game.  The players will then play these cards to perform actions during the different phases of the game.<br/><br/>At the end of Level 4, the heroes will face the all-powerful Ganon in a final showdown to determine whether they save Hyrule and win the game, or whether Hyrule will be plunged into an era of darkness under the rule of a new dark lord...<br/><br/>",

What you will find in the box is a dice-and-card game in which you're challenged to compete multiple tasks on a card in order to claim it for points.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, shuffle the 28 task cards, then place fifteen of them face-down and remove the rest from the game. Place the five penalty cards (worth -1 to -5 points) in order with the -5 on the bottom. Give the starting player the five dice, then reveal the top task card.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player starts by rolling all the dice, then she has two choices:<br/><br/><br/>    Set aside at least one die, then roll any remaining dice.<br/>    Take one baby bug token and reroll all dice just rolled.<br/><br/><br/>After each roll, a player has these two options. She continues until either she sets aside all five dice or takes a fifth baby bug. (More on that below.) If the player has set aside all the dice and has completed one (or more) of the tasks on the card, she covers one task with a marker. If no tasks remain uncovered, she claims the task card, which is worth positive points, then the next player reveals the next task card and takes his turn.<br/><br/>If at least one task remains uncovered, the player can either take another turn immediately or pass the dice to the next player. If the player has set aside all the dice without completing a task, she takes two baby bug tokens, and the next player takes a turn.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has five or more baby bugs, that player claims the top penalty card and all players return all baby bugs to the supply. The game ends as soon as the last task card or the last penalty card has been claimed. Players sum their points, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to collect all three parts of the Elixir of Life.<br/><br/>Trouble is, no one knows the Elixir's secret formula when the game begins.  To discover it, you must experiment by brewing different ingredients together.  The gameboard includes three shops full of ingredients: Special Supplies, the Herbalist, and the Jeweller's.  During play, you move around the board, buy ingredients from the shops, and take them back to your lab to brew a potion.<br/><br/>A potion has at least three ingredients: 1 special supply, 1 herb, and 1 or more gems.  The result is either part of the Elixir or another potion that can help wizards during play.  For example, Speedy Soda lets you move around the board faster.<br/><br/>Beware of the street.  Every time you stop there, you meet a mysterious stranger.  Some are friendly.  But others will try to attack you!<br/><br/>The first player who has all 3 parts of the Elixir of Life at the end of his turn wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Buying castles in Scotland can turn out to be excellent business. Even more so when, at the same time, you can provide tourists with these lands attractions: natural beauties? Oh no, no, rather offering them scary ghost infestations!!! Some eccentric characters fight in an auction to be assigned castles and manors. This, in the hope that presences will not be too numerous! Even if a castle without ghosts may be found useless, on the contrary one which is too &ldquo;populated&rdquo; will end up terrorizing tourists and being valueless...<br/><br/>Every player, after having seen the various castles, can declare what was seen, by showing his signs &ldquo;picture&rdquo; or &ldquo;ghost&rdquo;.<br/>Were there gloomy presences or only old and powdery family portraits? But beware, not all declarations are reliable: many players could lie... or perhaps all of them?<br/><br/>In the first phase players must decide whether in that very turn they will lie or tell always the truth.<br/>Mrs Truelight could help everyone to find out actual results of such decisions, but she is greedy and therefore she will reveal precious indications only to best bidders.<br/><br/>Caution is vital: the ones who pay more money too early will turn out having less funds to offer in the second phase auction for castles. Shall we have enough money to steal best ones to our competitors? Every castle has a score according to the number of ghosts by whom it is haunted.<br/><br/>The player who succeeds in guessing where ghosts are and their exact number will achieve optimum business, becoming able to buy what he/she wants in a fairly relaxed mode and allowing himself/herself even the luxury to mislead adversaries with fake offers.<br/><br/>Ghost for sale is a clever deductive game, with a subtle bluffing component, for 3 to 5 players, suitable for all the families, but with a strategy component that will not leave indifferent even most experienced gamers. In the box there are 8 special cards to be used for &ldquo;special auctions&rdquo;, which constitute a set for playing advanced rules games and which, randomly combined to the various castles and manors, guarantee rounds which are always exciting and different.<br/><br/>English, German and Italian Rules available for download here<br/><br/>",

        "description": "German occupied Poland, 1944. Beyond the reach of Allied intelligence and bomber commands, the Germans establish a secret facility, where a terrifying weapon is being tested. V-2, Hitler's Wunderwaffe, a ballistic missile able to wipe London from the map and win the war, bringing Britain to her knees. But the deepest secrets of German war technology are revealed by the UK's staunchest allies - the Poles...<br/><br/>Czas Honoru: Operacja Most III &ndash; a.k.a. Days of Honor: Operation Wildhorn III &ndash; is a fast-paced, tactical card wargame for two players. The first player takes the role of the Polish commander. His goal is to collect fragments from rockets test-fired from the German missile base. The second player takes the role of the German commander and is trying to protect the secrets of the rocket testing area.<br/><br/>The game lasts four turns. Each turn begins with a missile test, which scatters new fragments of the rocket in the peripheral area surrounding the testing ground. Players alternately take turns during which they place their units on the table and perform actions. Players use scouts to collect missile fragments, but they need to be protected by soldiers and partisans because enemy contact can lead to combat. These actions are supported by elite units: Polish Unseen and Silent commandos and German SS Stormtroopers, who are able to penetrate enemy lines. In addition, players build a network of command and support units, which allows them to effectively carry out their actions.<br/><br/>Players also affect the course of the game during their opponent's moves, playing cards for immediate effects. And each side has a set of unique events, e.g., Germans can use their logistical advantages while Poles can hide, and even evacuate rocket fragments to England! To determine combat and exploration results, players each use a six-sided die, but they have many opportunities to modify the results, so a good plan should work even with bad luck.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with more rocket parts wins. This means the player successfully stole (Polish) or concealed (German) the secrets of the V-2 weapon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Hardest Days, designed by John Butterfield, is a purpose-designed solitaire wargame of intermediate complexity covering five critical days in the Battle of Britain, the five days that saw the heaviest air action in the sky over England in the summer of 1940. Each of those days is presented as its own scenario. THD puts you in control of British Fighter Command, responding to air raids launched by the Luftwaffe, which is controlled by the game system.<br/><br/>Each one-day scenario represents up to 14 hours during which the Luftwaffe launches raids against targets in southern England, defended by the squadrons of RAF Fighter Command. German raids include bomber Gruppen (groups), attempting to hit specific targets, and fighter groups protecting those bombers and attacking British fighter squadrons. The German goal is twofold: inflict damage on targets and destroy squadrons to gain air superiority in preparation for the invasion of England.<br/><br/>The game system controls German strategy and tactics. You use your fighter squadrons to respond to the raids in an attempt to destroy or turn back the raiders and prevent their effective bombing of their targets, while minimizing your own fighter losses. Your fighter squadrons and German fighter groups may participate in several raids in a given day, while German bombers, flying from distant bases, participate in only one raid per day. To track the passage of time, as measured by the sequencing of raids and the turnaround of squadrons and groups during each &ldquo;Raid Day,&rdquo; the action is divided into seven two-hour time segments, from 0600 to 1800 hours, inclusive.<br/><br/>One inch on the area map equals 10 miles. British squadrons are composed of 10 to 15 aircraft. German groups possess 20 to 30 aircraft.  Each time segment represents two hours. Each Air Action Phase represents 10 minutes. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. Raid Approach Phase<br/> 1. Raid Region Determination<br/> 2. RAF Patrol<br/> 3. Raid Effort &amp; Coast Crossing<br/> 4. British Detection<br/>II. Air Action Phase<br/> 1. Interception &amp; Combat<br/> 2. Targeting &amp; Bombing<br/> 3. Raid Movement<br/> 4. Squadron Movement<br/>III. Airfield Operations Phase<br/> 1. German Recovery<br/> 2. Time Advance<br/> 3. German Fighter Turnaround<br/> 4. Squadron Turnaround<br/> 5.

        "description": "A race game between eight fantasy monsters selected at random from a deck of 25 (e.g., medusa, cyclops, vampire, zombie, centaur, dragon, griffin, djinni).  Players get secret agendas, listing the order they want the monsters to finish according to colored mover bases for the cards.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, they move a monster toward the finish line. All monsters move forward a die roll but if you are moving a monster that doesn't score high for you, you can waste its movement by zig-zagging or wandering into non-native terrain.  Each monster must move once per round, so even those that no one likes will get moved (and present bluffing opportunities for clever players).<br/><br/>A monster can attack once per move -- a great way to slow down a monster you don't like is to beat it unconscious.  Each monster is rated for the number of custom attack dice (marked with just 0s and 1s) they throw to find damage.  Monsters also have special powers, some active all the time and others that only kick in when a custom &quot;wacky die&quot; shows sword or shield icons.<br/><br/>The game includes reversible mapboards with different terrain patterns (brush, rock, water, etc.) to create a wide variety of maps.  Monsters move into their native terrains as if they were blank squares and get a defensive bonus as well.  Some monsters can fly, ignoring terrain except where they land.<br/><br/>The race ends when three monsters have crossed the finish line.  Everybody counts up the points listed on their secret agendas for those three monsters.  Example: the dragon, doppleganger, and hare finish in that order. My agenda says dragon 8, doppleganger 5, and hare 3 so I score 16 points; the monsters I had listed for positions 7, 6, 4, 2 and 1 didn't finish.<br/><br/>Note that this description is for the 2014 edition of the game.  The original used regular dice, counters rather than cards, scored all eight finishers and had players set their own agendas (both of which stretched out the game considerably).<br/><br/>",

These regions are the Northeast, the Midwest, the Southwest, and the Far West. It is reminsicent of the works of Stafford Beer and Proyecto Synco.<br/><br/>Each game turn consists of five distinct rounds.<br/><br/>The first is the Production Round, which includes a basic production phase, a secondary production phase, and a mobilization phase. Second is the Trade Round. Third is the Consumption Round, during which a player expends food points, expends consumer points, calculates and declares social status, and provides military supply for any combat units under his control. Fourth is the Military/Political Round, which begins with the political placement phase, followed by initial military movement, secondary military movement, combat, and elections. The fifth and last round of the game turn is the Finance Round, which includes the political disassociation phase, the stockpile/labour reallocation phase, industrial investment phase, taxation, the industrial capacity adjustment phase, the industrial labour reallocation phase, and finally, the  depreciation and shrinkage phase.<br/><br/>In addition, immediately before the fourth and eighth game turns, the Population Growth Cycle occurs during which the labour population of each region increases by 10%.<br/><br/>Inside the Box:<br/><br/><br/>    Two 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; hard-backed hexagonal grid Map Boards (with Turn Record Track, Terrain Key, Four Regional Sets of Six Economic Sector Tracks, and Abbreviated Turn Sequence incorporated)<br/>    400 &frac12;&rdquo; cardboard Counters<br/>    One 8&frac12;&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; Rules Booklet (with Scenario Instructions included)<br/>    Four 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; back-printed, folded combined Charts and Tables Sheets (each with an Initial Resources Chart, Food Table, Secondary Production Costs Table, Trade Transport Movement Point Cost Chart, Strike Table, Political Control Table, Subversion Table, Terrain Effects Chart, Combat Results Table, Unemployment Table, Starvation Table, Stockpiling Cost Chart, Investment Chart, Corruption Table, Depreciation Table, Shrinkage Table, Research and Development Table, Tax Table, and photocopy masters for Tax Forms<br/>    Eight 8&frac12;&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; perforated, back-printed sheets of Game Money (144 pieces)<br/>    Two small six-sided Dice<br/>    One 20 compartment plastic counter tray<br/><br/><br/>",

(63 cards)<br/>2) a game that is multiplayer that you really want to play solitaire.<br/><br/>Time to play the game: Really depends on what you want to play. Expect to double the normal time for gameplay when using the system for the first time. This will shorten substantially after playing it a few times.<br/><br/>Concept:<br/><br/>The Solo System is not a game per se, rather it is a Artificial Intelligence system that provides an unpredictable opponent for your multiplayer games. With a few adjustments, this can make a wide selection of games capable of being played solitaire.<br/><br/>Short Description of the Mechanics:<br/><br/>The Solo System is heavily influenced by role-playing systems such as Mythic and The Covetous Poet's Adventure Creator, but is much streamlined to be played with board games rather than role-playing games. It only uses a deck of 63 cards to accomplish its task.<br/><br/>It works like this: You set up your game and play it the same way that you would a normal game. When it is your opponents turn, you use The Solo System to figure out how your opponent will play.  You will first flip a card and determine what personality/strategy the AI is interested this round. There is a good chance that the system will keep the same strategy as the last round. Then you will look at the board and figure out if there is a move that would match this strategy or flip more cards to give a little more direction as to what he is interested in.<br/><br/>At this point you will probably find several moves that the AI could take. Choose one and ask the game if it does take that move. Before you flip a card, determine what the probability of the AI is of taking that move: probably, probably not, or unsure. Then flip the card and determine the results.<br/><br/>Cards have multiple pieces of information on them and are divided into four different decks. One deck has 14 cards, and the other two decks have 20 cards. There are mechanisms for movement on maps, targets and objectives for its armies, selection of resources such as coal or gold, and auctions.<br/><br/>The system is not unlike playing a game two handed, but you are playing against an opponent. Plus using the card system gives you direction for how to play one of the players. This will assist when trying to play several opponents and keep track of their play style. The opponent may need handicaps to increase its challenge against you depending on how you want to play, and these rules will give you ideas as to how to implement these handicaps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Annual 2011 Issue<br/><br/>BEYOND WATERLOO is a two-player strategic level game of the Napoleonic Campaign of 1815. Players take the sides of France or the coalition of Allies. The game opens with Napoleon&rsquo;s arrival at Paris following his return from Elba, and includes his efforts to restore France to a war footing, the Allies&rsquo; struggle to revive their anti-French coalition, and the military operations that ensue. BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard that includes France plus relevant portions of the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.<br/><br/>Where most games on this period focus in on the famous Battle of Waterloo, BEYOND WATERLOO takes in the full scope of the politico-military possibilities inherent in the 1815 situation. The Allies must re-defeat Napoleon. The French must avoid that outcome.<br/><br/>BEYOND WATERLOO is a full strategic simulation encompassing military, economic, and diplomatic developments. It also introduces new design concepts for a game of this nature. Because of the complexities involved, these rules adopt a layered approach. Initially, the Combat Game introduces only the Battle Development Sequence, which affords a way to conduct combat in a strategic game that is nuanced for the Napoleonic era. This level of rules enables the player to learn the combat system using a scenario that covers only the Battle of Waterloo itself. At the next level, the Basic Game, rules introduce the full movement and administrative systems for a Napoleonic campaign. The scenario involves the military action, economic factors, and force mobilization in this last Napoleonic War. The Advanced Game adds diplomacy, strategy, political action, and emphasizes the mobilization for war. In this long-form, the game begins with Napoleon&rsquo;s return to Paris and the sides must prepare for war before conducting it.<br/><br/>BEYOND WATERLOO is played on a mapboard divided into areas that regulate the movement of game forces. Pieces represent prominent Commanders on all sides, and armies, corps, and divisions. The players accumulate Resource Points (RPs) and Victory Points (VPs) as the game progresses. RPs procure fresh forces. The VPs influence events in the Campaign of 1815, as well as determining the winner of the game. In the Advanced Game, players also engage in diplomatic and political activity intended either to prepare for war or shape the conditions that will affect the campaign.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Story: The small, friendly vampire Victor is in his huge castle, and has misplaced many of his items. Fortunately, there are many mirrors that can be used to find these things without him having to move in all there rooms.<br/><br/>The game box with a coverage forms the castle. On each side, there are three windows. One stays open, the others are filled with images of the items to find - but visible only from the inside of the box. There are also 4 mirrors which can be stuck into the box (at 45 degree angles), which make it possible to see any of the items when looking through the one open window into the castle. There's also a door (used with the advanced rules) that can block the view.<br/><br/>Players in turn roll a die, and move Victor along a track at the top of the box. The space he's landing on show what item he now has to find. He may move up to 3 mirrors, then peek through the open window. If the wrong item shows up, it's the next players turn. But when the correct item is seen, he gains one blood token; afterward, that item and the open window switch places.<br/><br/>The other players may gain a blood token, too. After the active player has set up the mirrors, but before he looks to the window, they may predict whether the correct item shows up. If they guess right, they gain a drop.<br/><br/>The player that first collects a set number of blood tokens (depending on number of players) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Everything Lost is a thematic solo game set in an apocalyptic world in which you are the hero.<br/><br/>One day, you wake up. Like always, the first thing you do is open your curtains to look outside......to find out this day is different. You are stunned. Everything is lost. Your town is destroyed. Roads are gone, rubble is everywhere. Most buildings which are still standing look like skeletons. A few people are out there, stumbling goalless between the chaos, like... zombies.<br/><br/>What is this? What happened? For how long have you been sleeping? You open your fridge. The smell! You close it fast. You feel a cold breeze. You look up. You notice almost half of your roof is missing. You&rsquo;re shaking. It&rsquo;s freezing. You start to feel a primal drift. You realize no one is here to help you. You have got to take care of things. Danger is out there. Instinctively you grab a tool from your toolbox and go outside.<br/><br/>A game of Everything Lost consists of 4 chapters. In every chapter you choose 1 (out of 2 or 3) missions to play. Each mission starts at your home, the centre of town. You explore the 4 sectors surrounding your home. When you survive all 4 missions, you win. Search for food, repair your roof, steal a bulldozer and ram a warehouse, save survivors from a mall, eliminate a gang of outlaws, etc.<br/><br/>Next time you may follow a different path, by choosing different missions.<br/><br/>On your map you draw the city with your pencil as the game progresses. Your 5 white dice represent your energy. Use them well. If you spend a lot of dice, your chances will increase, but you will run out of dice fast. When you do, you will need to rest to get them back. This is risky. The mob will grow and events will force you to make difficult choices.<br/><br/>Break in buildings to find useful things and weapons, search the rubble, fight zombies and look for  survivors. Convince them to join your team. Get more experienced and unlock new skills and actions. Eventually you will craft new weapons, climb buildings and attack the mob from above, or ambush them. Who&rsquo;s the boss now? But only if you are a real survivor. Will you earn yourself one of the 4 available nicknames? Good luck!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In an age when poetry and the arts reigned supreme, the nights of Kyoto were filled with romance. Gentlemen of the Imperial court, ordinary clerks and functionaries by day, went out at night to meet their secret lovers in furtive trysts. Writing by the light of the moon, each tried to craft the finest and most moving poetry in the form of the Tanka, a short verse composed of only five lines. The best poems evoked the scene, the season, and represented the depth of the courtier's knowledge of the fashionable themes at court. By far, the most successful such lover was a fictional one named Hikaru Genji, the Shining Prince. Genji was, for the ladies of the court, the symbol of the perfect lover. For the men of the court, he was the perfect example to emulate. <br/>In GENJI, players take the roles of courtiers out to woo fair princesses. Players score points for writing the finest poetry, or winning the most hearts. But beware: other courtiers will be waiting in the wings to steal those hearts away! Take your brush in hand, and set out on the night streets of Kyoto. The romance of the height of the Heian Period awaits you in GENJI.<br/><br/>From BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>&quot;Players in Genji try to learn from the historical figure of Genji and woo the ladies of the Imperial Court with their poetry. Twelve ladies, each bearing a symbol of one of the four seasons as well as one of three fashions &ndash; melancholy, nature, romance &ndash; are laid out in a circle, with a fashion card chosen at random to show players what type of poetry is in style.<br/><br/>&quot;In each of the four seasons, each player will travel from his &ldquo;home&rdquo; &ndash; a lady chosen at the start of the game that bears his marker &ndash; around the circle in either direction. A player moves 1-3 spaces each turn, then either studies new material (discards poetry cards and draws new ones) or woos the lady he is currently visiting. If he has no rivals who have previously presented her with poems, he can present her with a poem on one or two cards. &ldquo;Each poem card has the top or the bottom of a classic Tanka poem (5 lines, 5,7,5,7,7 syllables each, respectively),&rdquo; says Kirk. &ldquo;A poem can be considered either a top, a bottom, or a match of the two cards.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&quot;If another player has already presented a poem, then he can either complete the poem (assuming only a single card was played) or challenge it (by playing a poem card that increases the beauty of the poem, thus revealing the other player for the poser he is). In the latter case, you discard your contribution and the matching half, then add the remaining half poem to your hand to be used later. <br/>...<br/>&quot;The round ends once a player returns home and makes a final study or woo action. Players then score points if they have the most poems on the board for that season, have presented the most beautiful poem of the season, or pitched woo at the home of another player. Yes, being a scoundrel can pay off.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "鬥獸棋 (d&ograve;u sh&ograve;u q&iacute;), also known as Animal Chess in English (this English name is used when English text appears on sets) is a traditional Chinese game in which each player has eight animals that move about the board one square at a time, attempting to win by entering the opponent's den. Stronger animals can eat weaker ones, but the rat can defeat the elephant by crawling into its ear. Interest is added to the board by a river (navigable only by the rat, but the lion and tiger can leap across it) and pitfalls (which make all animals vulnerable to attack by weaker ones). Sets can be bought cheaply in many Chinese shops; some have rules in English. This is not a deep intellectual exercise, but a strategic game that can be enjoyed even by young children.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kaiserkrieg! (&lsquo;Emperor&rsquo;s War&rsquo;) is a Strategic level Solitaire wargame of the First World War of 1914-1918. As the player, you control the Central Powers (&ldquo;CP&rdquo;; Germany, AustriaHungary, Turkey and Bulgaria). The game&rsquo;s automatic systems direct the efforts of the Entente Powers (&ldquo;EP&rdquo;; France, Britain, Russia, Italy, Serbia, the United States, and their minor allies) who are trying to defeat you. As in many of my games, you play the &ldquo;bad guys.&rdquo; For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, Imperial Germany and its main ally, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, are usually treated as one political entity in the game. The flags on the &ldquo;City&rdquo; Tiles are for decoration. In contrast to my other games, space precludes the addition of many historical notes in this rulebook. If you run across a name or historical reference that is new to you, Google is your friend! The heart of the game is its depiction of the ground war, which saw the battlefield deaths of some ten million soldiers. Kaiserkrieg&rsquo;s treatment can be traced back to Darin Leviloff&rsquo;s inspired Israeli Independence (2008) and the &ldquo;States of Siege&rdquo; system it started. The evolutionary leap in Kaiserkrieg! is the shift from the old &lsquo;horizontal&rsquo; States of Siege model &ndash; where enemy forces converge on your central position along clearly defined lines of advance &ndash; to a new &lsquo;vertical&rsquo; model where enemy forces mass in separate regions around you, to eventually achieve an advantage in size that threatens your overall position. This adaptation allows Leviloff&rsquo;s original concept to more closely simulate the trench warfare realities of World War I on the continental level. The game also depicts the epic naval struggle of proGerman blockade runners trying to evade fleets of British cruisers. Many historians identify the failure to outwit the British naval blockade as the main reason for Germany&rsquo;s defeat in the war. The &lsquo;sideshow&rsquo; war in the Near East, where Germany&rsquo;s Ottoman Turkish ally was assailed by Russia and the British Empire &ndash; including a massive army of Indian troops &ndash; is played with a simplified version of the game system (12.0). This theater also includes East Africa, where a German-led Black African army (the Askari) held out against Indian and British Empire forces even after the Germans in Europe had surrendered! The game is an extremely strategic view of the conflict. Points are dramatically simplified to make it playable and to emphasize the &ldquo;cool stuff&rdquo; of World War I, like Zeppelins, trenches, and U-boats.<br/><br/>Kaiserkrieg! is not a detailed historical simulation, but a fun and challenging game covering the salient themes of the actual conflict while whetting the player&rsquo;s appetite for more detailed treatments of this fascinating war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PARKS Memories is a strategic matching game for two or more players offering simple and flexible gameplay. Parks are represented in tiles laid out in a grid across the table face down. Gameplay includes four simple steps: reveal two tiles; choose one of the revealed tiles and place it in front of you; add a new tile to the board; lock one of the tiles with the hiker token. Gameplay passes from person to person until one player or team has collected three sets of matching park tiles in front of them.<br/><br/>Memories captures a depth of strategy in player abilities which can be activated by finding matches of PARKS resource icons when you reveal tiles. There are a variety of ways to enjoy the game. Play a head to head game, or on teams. Expand the grid size for a bigger challenge, or simplify the game to a memory game without player abilities for younger gamers.<br/><br/>PARKS Memories: Plains Walkers is one of three editions of PARKS Memories, highlighting the national parks of the plains region of the United States. It features a uniques set of player abilities. Collectively all three editions showcase every US national park.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then each player plays another card - whoever played the lowest card may choose one of the cards from the previous rounds first, then second lowest player, etc. After everyone has taken a card, the cards from the current round are placed in the center. A player who plays their 13 takes all cards from the center. Cards you take count their point value as negative points, but if you get two of the same cards, you may discard them. The game ends when all cards have been taken. Lowest number of cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Draft your team, challenge your friends, become a champion!<br/><br/>ROBA is a fast-paced tactical game for two players. It can be taught in five minutes, but offers a challenge that will test the skills of even veteran gamers to their limit. ROBA pits a colorful and diverse cast of heroes against each other using a dynamic deck-drafting mechanic that offers rewarding depth and lasting replay value.<br/><br/>ROBA was designed by Jack Murray, and tested by a team of over one-hundred playtesters from all around the world.<br/><br/>Every game of ROBA begins with the draft, where you&rsquo;ll create your own deck by selecting heroes from a shared pool. You&rsquo;ll alternate drafting heroes with your opponent until you&rsquo;ve each assembled a team of three. Every hero brings an associated deck of ten cards &ndash; one of which will be that hero&rsquo;s powerful Ultimate ability. Shuffling your heroes&rsquo; three decks together will create a play deck of thirty cards, and this &ndash; along with the three heroes themselves &ndash;is what you&rsquo;ll use to play the game.<br/><br/>Every hero brings unique strengths to a team, and different heroes support different strategies, opening up unique paths to victory. There are many possible combinations to explore, but be wary of falling into predictable patterns! Each player also gets to ban heroes during the draft, removing them from the pool of available picks entirely. If your opponent&rsquo;s strategy is transparent, you can punish them with a crafty pick. But beware! They can do the same to you.<br/><br/>ROBA pitches you against another player in a contest of nerve, wits, and skill. The aim of the game is to defeat the opponent&rsquo;s deity, a powerful divine force that begins the game out of play, and must be forced to manifest before it can be destroyed.<br/><br/>To achieve this, you pit your team of three heroes against your opponent&rsquo;s, each of you wielding your heroes&rsquo; unique skills and abilities. The player who does this best &ndash; utilizing their heroes to the fullest, while exploiting the weaknesses of their enemies &ndash; will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>The battle takes place across three lanes, each of which holds two divine conduits &ndash; one belonging to each player. When all three of your opponent&rsquo;s conduits are destroyed, their deity will appear &ndash; bringing its divine might to bear upon the conflict. When a deity falls, the game ends &ndash; with victory going to the player who defeated it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Infinities: Defiance of Fate is a 4x-lite adventure game based in a cross-over setting of fantasy and science-fiction worlds connected by multiversal rifts. As these rifts open, factions from each world collide as their realities blend into one another. However, the cross-over doesn't end with the story. The game boasts a hybrid gameplay style, blending strategy card game and tactical 4x mechanics with narrative elements. A leader acts as your avatar in the game&rsquo;s worlds. Leaders are represented as a board with a set of actions, three attribute tracks, and a reaction track which holds resource tokens. The basic round structure begins with all players setting one action die matching their map tile, rolling 3 more dice (with an optional reroll), then spending dice to take actions one player at a time. Action dice allow you to play unit and action cards, attack enemies, and explore and control map tiles. Units and leaders add new twists with their own unique actions while in play. At the end of the round, all leaders reset their hands with new cards, a Rift tile morphs the worlds it is connecting, then players check for objectives and Influence.<br/><br/>Infinities offers two primary game modes: Story and Skirmish. In Story mode, two factions use a Story Guide to follow a branching narrative campaign with varied, asymmetric actions, objectives, and win conditions. Based on the events and outcomes within a chapter, players will proceed to one of many possible chapters and make a thematic change to the game's assets for the remainder of the campaign. These changes range from removing leaders, shuffling cards into other decks, or permanently increasing action dice. Additionally, each chapter may change allegiances, leading players through free-for-all, team, one vs. all, and cooperative engagements. This makes it quite likely that players will experience both sides of the story throughout a campaign. Also included in the Story Guide are solo quests for each of the game's leaders, offering scalable challenges with multiple endings.<br/><br/>In Skirmish mode, players strive to collect more points than their opponents from a set of objectives. Skirmish mode functions as an ideal way to learn, practice, and master the game in friendly or competitive matches.<br/><br/>With shared or separate decks, dice-based actions, shifting turn order, a player-created game map, optional unlockable powers, a myriad of dynamic victory conditions, and session-specific actions, you&rsquo;ll find that the possibilities in this game are infinite.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The land is corrupted. The silent Grayking, brooding upon his throne in the Tower of Ash, is a far-reaching shadow upon Lassadar. We feel his presence in each of our days. His servants grow bold, stealing into our cities, inhabiting the alleys and dark places of our streets. They jeer at us from our mirrors, shaming our reflections.<br/><br/>The books of the Council of Wardens, handed down to us across the years, say that the era of broken barriers is upon us. Omens tell us, by winter, the Grayking will break through the few defenses we have remaining, cross to Lassadar, and our lands will fall to despair.<br/><br/>We few who are left, who remember the Grayking&rsquo;s original imprisonment across the Barrier Planes, struggle to keep his power from growing further, but we have little time and far too few disciples. You are young but have proven to hold the strength of our teaching inside you. We have trained you in the arcane arts of ice, oak and flint magic and have taught you those powers are capricious and can damage your spirit if relied upon too much. We wish we had more time to train you further. We do not.<br/><br/>Go now into the wider world, with our blessings, and seek a means to defeat the Grayking. Find the three Warding Keys stolen by his servants and re-lock the gates to force him back behind the Barrier Planes forever. Our agents, spread thinly across places still untouched in Lassadar, will aid you in your quest as best they can.<br/><br/>Go now, and save us all&hellip;&hellip;<br/><br/>Shadows Upon Lassadar is a solitaire fantasy quest game. You play a young magic adept who has been charged with finding three lost keys to lock the gates between the Barrier Plains and prevent the Grayking from reaching the world of Lassadar. You will journey to different cities using a deck of cards; other cards list spells you learn during the game. Magic in Lassadar is, however, a two edged sword and if you use powerful spells you may end up corrupting your own spirit in the process and lose the game. Three specific cards lead to expanded battle maps where you fight the Grayking&rsquo;s servants for possession of the keys. The game uses a variety of AI mechanics to simulate an enemy that learns and adapts as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Needed to play:<br/>the 48 game cards + the 4 last battle cards<br/>9 six sided dice<br/>25 black eurocubes<br/>and 3 eurocubes: one each in red, blue and yellow.<br/><br/>This Print and Play game can be assembled as a deck of cards or as cards and a series of mini game boards.<br/><br/>There are several types of quests in the game that will need to be completed. These quests are encountered by turning over cards from the draw deck:<br/><br/>City Quest cards showing the name of the city you&rsquo;ve journeyed to, win and loss table reference icons and event instructions for the battle in that city. As you win battles in these cities you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles.<br/><br/>Council of Wardens Quest cards always have a white top. Their event instructions will help you gain spells and refresh your Mana and Spirit. These cards will always be placed on the Quest discard pile to be shuffled back into the game.<br/><br/>Three Warding City Quest cards, each with a colored band and a numbered Warding Key icon across the bottom will signal when you use the Expanded Battle Maps (wargame hexmap style). On the Expanded Battle Maps you will encounter AI driven servants of the Grayking. Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of these battles. As you win the battles in these cities, and gain the Warding Keys, you will remove these cards from the game. If you lose a battle in this city you will place this card on the Quest discard pile, to be shuffled back into the game.<br/><br/>Winning or losing the game:<br/><br/>Draw cards one by one working your way through the quest. If you gain each of the 3 Warding keys you may cast the Oaken Spell: Barrier Lock and lock the gates of the Barrier Plains. The Grayking is instantly drawn back to the Tower of Ash and you have saved Lassadar and won the game.<br/><br/>If at any time your Spirit falls below [1] on the Character Stats card, or if the Grayking reaches Lassadar on the Progress Track, you have lost the game.<br/><br/>2nd place in the August 2011 Solitaire Print and Play contest <br/>and was also awarded Best Art, Best AI and Best Horror Game<br/><br/>Tied for 1st place in The 2011 Print 'n Play Awards for Best Solitaire Game<br/><br/>2012 Golden Geek Awards Nominee - <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/864240/2012-golden-geek-awards-nominees-announced-vot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/864240/2012-golden-geek-...</a><br/><br/>",

The winner is the player who scores the most points at the end of the game.<br/>This is a breathtaking game, unfolding on an illustrated map of China and over 400 separate army pieces, covering over 40 separate countries and peoples, all of the major dynasties of Chinese history, the arrival of the European powers, both World Wars and the invasion of the Japanese, right up to the present day situation, with the Communists in Mainland China and the Nationalists in Taiwan. The game occurs over 24 turns, each about 100 years long, starting from 403 BC, during the &quot;Warring States&quot; period as China begins to rise from its feudal age.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players take turns to trade shares in 6 UK companies using information on share price movements available only to you. But every player has different information, hence decisions will be based not only on your cards, but also on the actions of the other players. This calls for guessing and bluffing. <br/>The game is played in a series of trading periods (called Bargain Periods). At the end of each, all players 'pool' their information and this forms the basis of the actual market price movements on each share. By gaining a larger percentage of a company's shares, a player can become Company Director or even Chairman and exert some personal influence on that company's share price. At the end of up to 10 trading periods, players calculate their total value to find the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Dragon/Green Crescent (RDGC) is a strategic-level, intermediate-complexity wargame, with operational undertones, covering hypothetical future conflicts around the southern and eastern peripheries of Asia. The timeframe is the near future, between 2013 and 2021. The game has been designed by Bruce Costello using the CSR Award winning system that first appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics no. 250. It&rsquo;s adaptable for two player, multi-player and solitaire play.<br/><br/>RDGC expands the original game into a two-mapper covering the Indian Ocean and Middle East, areas strategic to both the US and its allies and the Peoples Republic of China and its allies.<br/>In the game, Chinese forces that may be initially deployed into the Indian Ocean area are few, but they also have one solid ally at start: Myanmar. Besides Myanmar, there are other question marks for US planners. For instance, would Pakistan stand idly by if India allied with the US, given the existential threat they perceive of a US-Indian victory in a war with China? And what about Iran: if that country is ever to make a move to achieve dominance in the Persian Gulf, what better time than during a major war while its winners aren&rsquo;t yet clear? There&rsquo;s also the rest of the troubled Middle East (Egypt-Syria-Lebanon-Israel). That collective totality makes for a wonderfully varied gaming situation. Besides the main scenarios, there are numerous variants and options, adding new dimensions and giving literally hundreds of new possibilities for play.<br/><br/>Most of the ground units in RDGC represent brigades (&ldquo;brigade combat teams&rdquo; or &ldquo;BCT&rdquo; for the US). The exceptions are the Singaporean, Malaysian, Taiwanese, Philippine, and Yemeni armies. There is additionally one new corps of marines for the PRC. Aircraft are mostly represented by mixed-type combat-wings, though only one aircraft type is shown on each counter. Long-range bombers have their own mono-type units that can&rsquo;t combine operations with the other &lsquo;tactical&rsquo; air wings. Ship units mostly represent mission-oriented groups of vessels such as SAGs, subrons or individual capital ships.<br/><br/>Game turns represent varied amounts of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the &ldquo;operation&rdquo; presently being conducted, from one to three days. An entire match encompasses the first month of the wars being examined. Scenarios include partial and two-map games, some centered on the Korean peninsula, others on the Indo-Pakistan area, and others taking in the entire, huge, arcing region from the Red Sea to Alaska.<br/><br/>This special edition includes 2 maps (22x34 inches) and 352 counters.<br/><br/>",

One player controls the Communists, the other the Free World Forces. Each game turn equals one week, and each hexagon represents 25 miles. The units of maneuver for both sides range from battalions up through regiments, brigades and full divisions. The game includes one full-size (34x22&quot;) large-hex map and 280 half-inch, NATO-style, counters. All of South Vietnam, plus the border regions of Cambodia, Laos and North Vietnam are on the map, and the orders of battle include all the units of both sides that participated historically.<br/><br/>There are two scenarios: one short, with only five game turns in the autumn of 1965, and the other long, covering the entire period of the early American war with a full 20 game turns. The rules contain approximately 16,000 words, which works out to two experienced players being able to get through the campaign game in one long session of about six to eight hours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kharkov Battles uses the Fall Blau basic rules to cover the Second &amp; Third Battles of Kharkov.<br/><br/>Basics of the system are:<br/>Stacking is 3 units per hex and combat out of a hex is restricted. Large units (mainly German divisions and Soviet corps) have Combat Ratings which pull a strength chit for combat. Typically only one unit with a strength chit may combat out of a hex along with all smaller units. Movement and Combat phases with Mobile Assaults for mechanized units during certain situations of movement. CRT for combats keys off the defender's terrain and uses column shifts for extras like air support, combined arms, fortifications, etc. Combat results have some mandatory step losses, but the rest a player's choice on taking step loss or retreating. Advances after combat are along the Path of Retreat for non-mech units, but mech or cav units may deviate. Support Points are used to allow German supply to reach units for mechanized movement and attacks during turn. Support (for Axis attacks) is traced simply a number of hexes to a HQ and then a number of hexes to a road which leads to the source. Supply is just a general trace to a source.<br/><br/>Given the nature of the covered battles, this game has a shorter playtime and smaller space requirements making it an easier intro into the system used by Fall Blau. Included is a revised Terrain Effects Chart which should ease reference fatigue for either game.

Howard's works with other sources to follow in expansions.<br/><br/>The goal is to become King of Aquilonia.  Your version of Conan (each player will have one of their own) needs to gain renown by defeating enemies.  These foes come in varying strengths and attempt to flank your Conan card to inflict as many hits as possible.  If your Conan falls to 0 health, you lose.  The choice lies in heaving many weak foes at Conan, or 1 or 2 major enemies.<br/><br/>The combat mechanic involves the comparison of icons along the sides of the moves and maneuvers performed by Conan and his various foes.  These will determine hits, misses, and blocks.<br/><br/>The game features new artwork from Dark Horse artist Paul Lee, CCG artists such as Alex Horley and Patrick McEvoy, and legendary fantasy artist, Ken Kelly.  Some art is taken from current Dark Horse comics, as well as some old Savage Sword covers.<br/><br/>",

If Wellington's Anglo-Allied army could combine with the Prussians, the combined force would be larger than Napoleon's. Napoleon's strategy had been to cross the border into the Netherlands without alerting the Coalition and drive a wedge between their forces and subsequently to defeat the Prussians before turning on the Anglo-Allied army. Although the coalition commanders did have an overview of French pre-war movements, Napoleon's strategy was initially very successful.<br/><br/>The battle cost Ney 4,000 men to Wellington's 4,800. Although a tactical draw, the allies had been unable to send forces to the aid of the Prussians at the Battle of Ligny. Wellington's Anglo-Allied army, upon learning of the Prussian defeat, was forced to retreat north along the Brussels road further away from the Prussians, who retreated north-east towards Wavre.<br/><br/>There has been much debate of what would have happened if d'Erlon's I Corps had engaged at either Ligny or Quatre Bras. As he did not, Napoleon chose to follow Wellington with the bulk of his forces, and two days later met his destiny at Waterloo.<br/><br/>Quatre Bras is part of the Napoleon's Last Battles Quadrigame.  It was also sold separately as a folio game.<br/><br/>Folio version includes rules, a 17&quot; x 22&quot; map and 100 counters.<br/><br/>",

A &quot;what-if&quot; scenario on how to invade Norway. It ended up as a full-blown, multi-corps invasion on the event of Germany's attack on France. The Europa level invasion of Norway. The combined arms are also present. The unit and time scales are at Europa levels.<br/><br/>The Four Hour War:<br/>Germany invades Denmark. Will the Danes resist (that would make it a Five Hour War)? Germany used Denmark as a stepping stone to Norway. Germany had to have a perfect invasion of Denmark to ensure a chance of success against Norway. If you choose to play this scenario, as the Germans, good luck. It is an eye-popping special ops gamble. If you lose as the Germans, no easy invasion for Norway.<br/><br/>Northern Theater of Operations (NTO):<br/>NTO Combines Weserubung and A Winter War. It begins with the Soviet attack against Finland. The western Allies may intervene to aid Finland. To do so they must transit through Norway. Norway may disagree with this and the Germans may intervene to prevent the Allied intervention. Makes your head hurt, don't it? Ownership of A Winter War (currently available from Games Research/Design (GR/D)) is required for this scenario.<br/><br/>Invasion Sweden:<br/>No tour of Scandinavia is complete without a visit to sunny Sweden, right? Well, why would the Germans invade Sweden? To prevent them from helping Norway? Maybe. To ensure a flow of iron ore to Germany? Perhaps. Because they can? Why not. Germany decided against this invasion, but now you have the option of testing out such an invasion in this scenario.<br/><br/>(from back of the box)<br/><br/>",

The Stars Align is a two-player game of placing and manipulating patterns of stars on the 7x7 night sky map grid.<br/><br/>A play of The Stars Align begins at dusk. Players place their color stars onto the Night Sky Map. After dusk comes the Night Phase. More stars appear and those already in play start to flicker (twinkle)! When groups of stars align, they shoot across the sky and disappear!<br/><br/>The Stars Align is a tight combination of grid placement and pattern manipulation. In the Dusk Phase, each player will draw a constellation card on their turn and choose where to place their stars on the shared Night Sky Map following the pattern shown on the card. As the night draws on, more stars appear until a player draws a constellation card that can't be played. At this point, the initial board state is established and the Night Phase begins.<br/><br/>Placement rules shift when the Night Phase starts. Now parts of the constellation pattern may overlap stars already in play. Overlapped stars flip to their opposite side. Players take turns manipulating the Night Sky Map so that an entire row or column of seven stars align in their color. This is a shooting star. The stars in that row or column are removed from the board and a point is scored. The first player to score 5 points wins the game!<br/><br/>For an added challenge, experienced players can add a chess timer with five-minutes per player to spot their five shooting stars. The first to spot five shooting stars or still have time left on their timer when their opponent runs out of time wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You can nearly feel the faharn flowing through you as your call of fire is forming and see... your adversary plunging out of its flames... for this time.<br/><br/>The arrows fly and you can almost hear their heads exploding on your target's shield, an axe follows, surprising the shield bearer and this time.cutting through his shoulder pad...<br/><br/>After a Corunea fight, you could draw its story board very accurately, just by illustrating what happened.<br/><br/>Playing Corunea you don't deal with abstract armies or summons, you are on the front line, your blade cutting through the foes, your mind bending the elements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the far reaches of Santiiba, the Valley of the Hopeful, seers ply their occult trades.<br/><br/>Each turn in Die Seher von Santiiba, one player rolls the five dice, which correspond with five kinds of cards. The dice have 1-3 stars on three of the sides and the numbers 4-6 on the other three sides. Each other player then secretly selects a color, whether the color they think you'll choose or the color they themselves are interested in. You then name one of the colors, and if anyone else has selected that color, they reveal this information. If the matching die shows stars, they move their seer figure on the scoring track this many spaces, and if it shows a number, they take a card of this color. You either take the die (if it shows stars) or the card, placing this object in your &quot;area of uncertainty&quot;. You then continue your turn by naming another color or end your turn.<br/><br/>If no one choose your named color, then you pick either the die or card of this color, placing the object in your area of uncertainty. If you took a card when the die showed stars or took a die with a number, then you must continue your turn; otherwise, you can choose to continue or end your turn.<br/><br/>If all other players have revealed their color choices, then you lose everything in your area of uncertainty, receiving only a bowl card as consolation. If you end your turn &mdash; whether voluntarily or after successfully choosing four of the five colors &mdash; then you move all the cards to your oracle board and advance your seer a number of spaces equal to the sum of all the dice.<br/><br/>Players take turns in this manner until the first player reaches 30 VPs. Only then are the victory points on the cards counted as well &mdash; but the player who has collected the fewest cards of any particular sort won't get to count the neighboring kind of cards at all. If you have the fewest herbs, for example, then your amulets are worth nothing. Ties are broken in favor of whoever has the most bowl cards. Once you've determined which cards (if any) you must lose, you sum the value of your remaining cards and advance your seer. All players who reach the Cloud Castle of Wisdom on space 75 win; otherwise, whoever has advanced the farthest wins.<br/><br/>",

Everyone simultaneously tries to &quot;connect&quot; seven of their nine cards. Two cards are connected when they lay adjacent to one another with a pair of symbols on one card touching a matching pair of symbols on the adjacent card.<br/><br/>The first person to lay down seven cards in that manner shouts &quot;Ubongo&quot; and earns 10 points, while everybody else scores as many points as they have connected cards on the table. (If any player has made a mistake while placing cards, including the player who ended the round, that player scores zero points for the round.)<br/><br/>For the second round, players flip over their nine cards and use them. For rounds 3-6, players receive cards from two new decks. After six rounds, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

This extremely accurate and rigorously-researched game opens as the Western Interior Seaway shrinks, and with it the fortunes of once-mighty dino shipping magnates. But this paves the way for expansion by dino rail barons, eager to bring goods made at dino factories to emerging dino cities! But even these tyrannosaurus tycoons might find their legends eclipsed by dino airlines.<br/><br/>Hexagonal tiles are placed on water hexes to shrink the Seaway, and also serve as the timer of the game. Each player gets an equal number of turns in which they place a tile, buy one share of stock, and then take one action &ndash; building for a railroad, making a delivery, producing goods, establishing an airport, or recycling. Each industry works and scores a little differently, and with only a handful of turns, you'll need to invest and act carefully, with an eye toward incentivizing your fellow players to do the hard part for you. End the game with the most money, and you win!<br/><br/>The first game design by Hollandspiele founder Mary Holland, collaborating with veteran cube rails designer Amabel Holland (Irish Gauge), Dinosaur Gauge is a gleeful game about managing chaos, emergent alliances, and, most of all, how much Mary loves dinosaurs.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The card game L.A.M.A. Kadabra plays similarly to the 2019 game L.L.A.M.A., but with a few additions that complicate gameplay and your choices of what to do.<br/><br/>Let's start with the basics of L.L.A.M.A.: Each player starts a round with six cards in hand; the deck consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6. On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on top, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions. If all players have quit but one, that player can continue to play, but cannot draw more cards.<br/><br/>The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect chips based on the cards in their hand. Each different number card in hand gets you white chips (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black chip (worth 10 points). (You can exchange ten white chips for one black chip at any time.) If you played all your cards, you can return one chip (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round, in which the first player to play will be the one who emptied their hand or was the last one to quit in the previous round.<br/><br/>L.A.M.A. Kadabra adds four new elements to the gameplay described above:<br/><br/>&bull; Double cards: Some cards show two numbers: 2/3 and 4/5. You can play a 2/3 on a 1, a 2, or a 3, so they give you more flexibility, but if you end the round with one in hand, it counts as both numbers when you're collecting chips.<br/><br/>&bull; Action cards: When you play a 1, give one of your lowest chips &mdash; yes, including a black chip if that's all you have &mdash; to any player who hasn't yet quit. When you play a card with a rectangle on it, the next player to take a turn must draw a card, then take their turn as normal.<br/><br/>&bull; The magic chip: When you play a card with a star, claim the lone blue magic chip from whoever currently holds it. On a future turn, you can discard the chip to skip your turn. If you hold this chip (and no white ones) when you play a 1, give this to another player. If you hold the magic chip at the end of the round, it's worth 10 points.<br/><br/>&bull; The magic show: Whenever you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage. When the magic stage has at least five chips on it, the magic show begins. During a magic show, if you play a llama, place one of your lowest chips on the magic stage; if you can't or don't want to play a llama, take all of the chips on stage to end the magic show, then take your turn as normal.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the round where at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In those primitive times when men and dragons were enemies, former adventurers left their original guilds to serve a dragon. They protect him from the repeated assaults of adventurers attracted by his fabulous treasure, buried in the basement of the castle. What if there were more than gold to protect?<br/><br/>In the tile-collection game Dragon Keeper: The Dungeon, you embody these keepers and must capture the adventurers who invade the rooms of the dungeon &mdash; yet you must remain faithful to your guild by avoiding capturing its members. Once you have repelled the assaults, you give to the dragon as a tribute a part of the adventurers you caught&hellip;<br/><br/>In more detail, the game contains tiles in five different colors and different values. These tiles represent the adventurers who want steal the plunder of the dragon. You are responsible for removing these adventurers from the dungeon. Each turn, you take a tile for yourself and give another tile to another player. The choice of tiles depends on the position of the dragon (as the tile must be in its line or in its column). Then the dragon is moved to the location of the tile that has just been removed. Thus, each tile decision limits the choice of the next tile to take.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player receives a color that they keep secret, with this color corresponding to their original guild. Every tile of this color brings them negative points. Players stack their collected tiles by color, and at the end of the game, the tallest stack is removed. If this stack is the player's guild color, then the player must discard the next tallest stack instead. Players then sum the values of their tiles, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The set &quot;Showbizz&quot; contains historical events which are related to show business. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the Shwobizz edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MedFront details the conflict between the Allies and Germany during WWII from 1940-43, as well as the Spanish Civil War from 1936-39. Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to break the other side's lines and achieve victory.  The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Spain and North Africa printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is just one portion of the complete EuroFront series, which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>WestFront II: The War in Europe 1943-45 – Second Edition includes updated MedFront maps and some Spanish units; EuroFront: The War in Europe, 1936-45 – Second Edition has the updated MedFront rules (and the Spanish Civil War scenario and other Spanish units) for those maps.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45<br/><br/><br/>",

Collect furniture and deco items from the 1950s to the 1980s, and get the best collections, possibly stealing those items from other players! Color, type of items, and years will earn you points!<br/><br/>In Vintage, players place item cards face down to the side of their display case (a.k.a. their hands). This stack is known as a player's hoard. A player can look at their own hoard at any time, but may not look at other players' hoards. Players start with 1-3 cards in their display case and no cards in their hoards. On your turn, your perform three actions in this order:<br/><br/>1. Choose one item card from your display case and save it for later by placing it face down on top of your hoard. <br/>2. Then, either steal one item card from another player&rsquo;s display case and add it to your display, or salvage the top card from the face-up discard pile and add it face up to your display.<br/>3. Draw two item cards from the face-down deck, place one face up in your display and the other face up on the discard pile.<br/><br/>To score, lay out the 17 bonus cards and award each card to the player who has hoarded the most cards in the corresponding category.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wadi is situated in the heat and drought of the ancient Egypt desert. Water is scarce and you try to build your Shadoof (a sort of waterpump) as close to the Wadi as possible. A wadi, however, is a desert river. Water flows though it for only a small part of the year. The rest of the time it is dry. In the short wet period, you try to pump as much water as possible to the water reservoirs. Preferably in the vicinity of fertile land, because the more fertile the land, the better the harvest. And the better the harvest, the more points a player earns.<br/><br/>But... other players might have noticed the same good spot, where you want to build your shadoof. And when you build your shadoof there, they won&rsquo;t help you fill the water reservoirs. But if you hesitate too long, the other players might pump dry the Wadi. Or worse, the water streams down the wadi and the land close to your shadoof remain dry and barren.<br/><br/>There are a few scenarios for Wadi delivered with the game. They bring a lot of variety.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Players build their shadoofs on the land tiles. Each shadoof can pump water pawns from the river bed or from another land tile that lies in the vicinity of that shadoof (vicinity = water pawn lies on his own tile or on an adjacent tile). In his turn a player can carry out two actions. He can either:<br/>&middot; Build 1 shadoof first and then pump 1 water pawn (or vice versa)<br/>OR<br/>&middot; Pump 2 water pawns.<br/><br/>Round after round players build shadoofs and/or pump water pawns. At the end of each round, the water that is still in the river bed, flows downstream. This means, that all the water pawns in the river beds are moved downstream 1 river tile.<br/>When the river bed is completely empty, the game is over.<br/><br/>Players earn points per shadoof. Every landtile surrounding the shadoof (including its own tile) with a water pawn on it brings 1, 2 or 3 points, depending on the fertility of the land. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Players &quot;fight&quot; to get water pawns near their shadoofs and for the places to build their shadoofs. They also try to profit from water pawns that other players pumped on to the land tiles. Because of the placing rules (not explained here) this is not always as easy as it looks.<br/><br/>All in all Wadi is a quick, tactical game. With 2 players it is a bit more strategic.<br/><br/>",

Seeing their inevitable doom, the factions reached an alliance. Hundreds of years have passed in peace since The Great War. One day, The Aether Stone fell from the heavens. The Stone carried with it crystals filled with intense magical power. The crash spread these crystals throughout the land, but the majority of the crystals were concentrated at the crash site. Once the factions began collecting the crystals, they realized how powerful they were and what they could do with them. Peace had prevailed, but many sought after the power of the crystals, and power leads to corruption. Eventually, armies began to march on the crash site to hoard it's power. The struggle for conquest had begun. But not all were consumed by the crystals' powers. Some remained content working the land and building glorious cities, filled with monuments and workshops.<br/><br/>Which path will you choose to follow?<br/><br/>Rolling Empires is a fantasy empire dice building game for 2 - 6 players. Engine building and area control are some of the key features of this game. It features 6 factions, all with several unique creatures in the form of dice that can be recruited to build your engine.

Schmid under the title Dance of the Witches, this is essentially Pachisi but so that the playing pieces' identities are hidden, and after a while the game gets pretty chaotic with each player trying desperately to remember which of the witches belong to them and not help opponents or hinder themselves by mistake - it's even possible to drive opposing pieces home by driving them into your own base by mistake, in which case they will instantly teleport to the correct one. Also, pieces are not captured - probably because this would mean revealing their identity - but simply jumped back 7 spaces on the track and if that space is occupied, they're jumped back another 7, and so on. It is possible to make any one piece's identity public for a moment though, by rolling a 6, but that 6 cannot then be used for movement also.<br/><br/>Like Sagaland/Enchanted Forest - which the playing pieces will bring to memory - this is more of a family game than simply a children's game.<br/><br/>",

At the same time, you aspire to brew beer that's the best of the festival &mdash; but these two elements do not always go hand in hand.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s why players have to examine what the market expects from their beer, which styles are in current trend, and what festival critics like. As if that was not enough, the world in which we brew beer is alive! Shifts on the beer market change trends and critics taste. The market set-up is unique each time, so you need to manage your resources wisely and follow carefully the market and other players' actions.<br/><br/>Beer Empire is mainly based on a set-collection mechanism as players compose recipes using a variety of ingredients (resource tiles) like light and dark malts, hops, fermentation type (open or closed) and type of container (bottle, can, barrel or keg). Each of these components may add different effects and influence on quality of beer.<br/><br/>     Increase/decrease beer attributes  (aroma, color, taste)<br/>     Produce more or less bottle caps (market share)<br/>     Add extra points<br/><br/><br/>What ingredients we&rsquo;d use, thereby what effects in our beer we&rsquo;d get influence all game areas:<br/><br/>     Market (area control), represents what consumers expect from beer. Some prefer aromatic beer, some prefer to drink from bottles, other ones favor specific style (India Pale Ale, Bock, Pilsner). Players brew beer that meets several tastes thereby achieve points from different markets at the same time!<br/>     Beer Festival(bidding &amp; combo):  Here matters especially aroma, color, taste. These characteristics are assessed by the critic. He assign festival points and it&rsquo;s worth effort because only at the festival you can win rare brewing passion tiles!<br/>     Trends: In Beer Empire world there are few main beer trends (Pilsner, Bock, India Pale Ale, Lager and ALE). Brewing beer compatible to the trend gives you experience tile that opens new great possibilities for brewing!<br/><br/><br/>What is most important, it is up to you and your abilities of smart resource management (tile placement &amp; worker placement) and right recipes composing,  which direction you&rsquo;ll go. Would you accomplish goals in all fields or you&rsquo;d focus just on chosen elements?<br/>What we want to underline is that each of these elements influence on each other making every play one of a kind.<br/><br/>It seems it&rsquo;s gonna be a really hard work to build your Beer Empire.<br/><br/>(Espa&ntilde;ol)<br/><br/>Beer Empire es un juego competitivo para 2 a 4 jugadores que asumir&aacute;n el papel de due&ntilde;os de peque&ntilde;as cervecer&iacute;as que tendr&aacute;n que crear sus recetas, obtener recursos, ampliar su industria y construir su propio imperio de la Cerveza<br/><br/>Los jugadores se convierten en due&ntilde;os de peque&ntilde;as cervecer&iacute;as, aut&eacute;nticos entusiastas de la cerveza, que luchar&aacute;n ferozmente para hacerse con el mercado y competir por el reconocimiento de su habilidad artesana en los festivales de la cerveza.<br/><br/>Para poder conseguir sus metas, crear&aacute;n recetas de cervezas que elaborar&aacute;n asegur&aacute;ndose de que tenga los rasgos correctos.

Mars raid to capture the Web Mind Generator from a heavily defended area near Nix Olympica's massive caldera. The Webbie revolutionaries are deep in their tunnel complexes surrounded by strong points and infantry. The raiders will use infantry, laser tanks, lifters and the tunnel blasting BOAR drill. If they fail man's future may fall to the telepathic, religion/machine Web Mind of Mars.<br/><br/>OLYMPICA is the clever tactical creation of Lynn Willis. His future history of the Martian revolution of 2206 hinges on the crucial U.N. raid. The game is easy to learn, fast playing, and challenging. Like the other Microgames, it is ideal for beginners and fun for pros. OLYMPICA is the perfect game for those who've never tried science fiction games.<br/><br/>Components for the game include a 24 page rules booklet, play counters, and hex gridded map of the Nix Olympica region.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players will represent the Israeli and Arab high commands and maneuver their units and conduct combat in an attempt to attain the objectives of their respective nations.

Additional players can also be added to allow one commander for each front for the Israelis, air force commanders, or commanders for the various Arab allies. The ground game can be played without the air game, but it is recommended that the air game be incorporated into play as soon as the players are familiar with the ground rules, after two or three games, for instance.<br/><br/>(from rulebook introduction)<br/><br/><br/>Scale: Operational, Battalion-Regiment, 1 Day per turn, 3-6 Km/hex<br/><br/>Turn Sequence: 1.

However if their foraging is less than successful, finding some poor schmuck's meaty thigh is a viable substitute.<br/><br/>",

The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (50-foot glow worms, anyone?), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.<br/><br/>Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.<br/><br/>The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; and when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.<br/><br/>This game was remade into Monsters Menace America.<br/><br/>",

Give the blue to one player, the orange the other. Shuffle the black deck and set it face-down.<br/><br/>To start, the blue player places 25 bird cards face-up on the playing surface, in any design within an 8x8 grid. This is the &quot;Flock&quot; in which all cards must stay connected (share a side) at all times.<br/><br/>The orange player has first turn, and may play 1 fox on top of any bird to eat it, and remove it from play. Next, players take turns drawing 1 card from the black deck, which identifies the number of moves a player may make during a turn. Foxes may only move by pouncing on a bird and taking its place. Birds can fly, and therefore may move to an open place on the invisible 8x8 grid. If a &quot;Plus&quot; card is drawn by the orange player, he or she adds a fox to the game. If drawn by the blue player, he or she adds 3 more birds. During play no move may be taken that separates even one bird from the flock.<br/><br/>The orange player wins by eating all birds. The blue player wins by surrounding the fox(es) with 8 birds (on all 4 sides and 4 corners).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kampen om Norge (&quot;The Battle of Norway&quot;) is a strategy board game about the German invasion of Norway in 1940. Each player takes control of the armed forces of either Norway, The Allies, or Germany. Using plastic soldier playing pieces that represent armies, and cards that represent war ships, bombers, fighters and special actions, the players battle for control of the six victory cities on the board. Managing the resources you get from your playing cards is crucial to succeed.<br/><br/>The game is fast-paced and has a quick set-up, yet offers a wide range of strategic options and variations. The starting point of the game and the resources available to the different factions are based on the historical conditions, but the players have the chance to change the course of history. Kampen om Norge is suitable for 2&ndash;3 players (or teams) and is playable in 2&ndash;3 hours.<br/><br/><br/>Den 9. april 1940 overfaller tyske stridskrefter et n&oslash;ytralt og d&aring;rlig forberedt Norge. Felttoget i Norge er h&oslash;yt spill, men Hitler har bestemt seg for &aring; legge landet under jernh&aelig;len. Norske og allierte styrker mobiliserer og nekter &aring; gi seg uten kamp. Klarer de &aring; stanse det tyske storml&oslash;pet?<br/><br/>Dette er utgangspunktet for strategispillet Kampen om Norge, et spennende brettspill om den tyske invasjonen i 1940, som gir spillerne mulighet til &aring; ut&oslash;ve historiekunnskap i praksis. Tidenes f&oslash;rste norske strategi-krigsspill er lekkert utf&oslash;rt med naturtro brikker, realistiske spillekort og et detaljert kart.<br/><br/>Hver spiller p&aring;tar seg rollen som &oslash;verstkommanderende for de milit&aelig;re styrkene til Norge, de allierte eller Tyskland. Ved hjelp av brikker, terninger og spillekort utkjemper spillerne en kamp seg imellom p&aring; brettet, der Norge og de allierte sammen m&aring; fors&oslash;ke &aring; stoppe Tysklands frammarsj p&aring; norsk jord og hindre at Tyskland okkuperer alle de viktige byene. Spillerne m&aring; ta strategiske valg, forvalte ressursene p&aring; spillekortene, flytte sine bataljoner omkring p&aring; spillebrettet og kjempe mot motstanderen om landomr&aring;dene. Den som velger den smarteste strategien, har best sjanse til &aring; vinne, men det hjelper ogs&aring; &aring; v&aelig;re venn med terningene.<br/><br/>Kampen om Norge kan spilles i to vanskelighetsgrader.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Punic Island&rdquo; is the third volume in the Campaign Commander series and simulates the campaign for Sicily and North Africa during the First Punic War. The system takes away from Second World War and goes to Ancients. In 264 Roma was summoned to Messina by Mamertines mercenaries to help in their quarrel with Cartage, the main power in Sicily. Carthaginians count on Hiero the Tirant of Syracuse to help defeating the Mamertines. Here begins the First Punic War.<br/>Romans and Carthaginians fought for 22 year over Sicily and in North Africa. Rome emerged victorious and Cartage was obliged to quit his long standing presence in Sicily.<br/>The land campaign was a long string of Roman victories as city after city was subdued and every Carthaginian army was defeated in battle. Syracuse was forced to make an alliance with Rome and Cartage was left with only a few fortresses in the island.<br/>Anyway the war was won and lost in the sea. The war saw the emergence of Rome as a sea-power and a long string of naval victories allow Roman troops to menace even Cartage proper. Only to be saved by Xantipus and his mercenary army at the Bagradas Plains battle. Naval warfare played a prominent role in this war and will give Carthage Senate his las blow. Carthage tried to spend the Roman effort during the whole war. His strategy was of attrition and was unsuccessful; Rome never gave up a prize.<br/>The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map. It is designed for two players with one running the ROMAN forces and the other the CARTHAGINIAN forces -including Syracuse. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters. The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.<br/>The ROMAN player will be on the offensive during the whole game as he has to conquer the whole island to get victory. CARTHAGINIAN player focuses on spoiling Roman campaigns and plans with ambushes, sallies and bad weather cards. Also he has to recruit an army as he doesn&acute;t has any at the beginning of the game.<br/>The ROMAN player must plan his offensives carefully as he will need a new army and resources for each one. Also he will need to build a fleet his doesn&acute;t have at the start of the war. The sea contest will be evenly match and you better take into account bad weather as it sinks more ships than enemy action.<br/>Siege warfare takes a prominent role in this game as every city in the game map is a walled on with his own intrinsic garrison.<br/>Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward. Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience. We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- 1 80x60 cm map of Sicily and North Africa.<br/>- two ten-sided dice<br/>- 176 unit counters<br/>- 1 Rules Book for the Series &ldquo;Campaign Commander&rdquo; and Exclusive Rules of &ldquo;Punic Island&rdquo;; historical and designer notes.<br/>- 70 cards (divided in two decks, plus help cards)<br/>- 3 plastic bags.<br/><br/>",

The gardener must try to block the mole's moves and fence him in quickly, while the mole must dig as many holes as possible before being caught.<br/><br/>Essentially, the mole may move any direction, horizontally or diagonally from square to square, while the gardener places boundary sticks down along the edges of the square, which the mole may not cross.  The mole and gardener may either move or place down a boundary stick, and move alternately.  Eventually, the gardener will hem the mole in completely and the round is over.  In addition, if the mole can move into flower beds, extra points are scored.  By moving to the center, the mole may also tunnel deeply to any selected square on the board, thus escaping the (by then) rapidly closing trap of boundary sticks.  Depending on how many moves this took, more or less points are earned by the mole.<br/><br/>Once points are totaled up, the roles are reversed and another round is played.  The winner is the player who scored the most points as the mole.<br/><br/>",

As a player, you must command your German or Allied forces so as to capture the objectives on the board while keeping your casualties down (and your opponent&rsquo;s casualties high).<br/> Using a fresh take on the venerable wargaming system presented in the D-Day and Market-Garden series, Battle of the Bulge authority and game developer Randy Heller has brought Paul&rsquo;s system up in scale to handle the larger operations in this campaign and provides the great (but manageable!) gaming &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; that wargamers so enjoy when exploring history using a &ldquo;paper time machine&rdquo; like Paul Koenig&rsquo;s The Bulge: 6th Panzer Army.<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 7.5 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>",

The game uses the same basic rules used in an entire series on the battles and campaigns of the World Wars. Learning this simple game prepares you for playing games on almost every battle and every campaign of the Der Weltkrieg series.<br/><br/>The Historical Background<br/>Tannenberg &ndash; The Introductory Game covers the Russian invasion of German East Prussia in 1914, and the subsequent German counter thrusts.<br/><br/>The Russians plan to invade Germany from two directions at once, trapping the Germans in the middle. The Russians vastly outnumbered their foes, as the bulk of the German army is invading France at the onset of war. The Germans plan to conduct a fighting withdraw from East Prussia, but their commanding General panics.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s up to you to determine the outcome. Will your decisions produce Victory or Defeat?<br/><br/>The Tannenberg battle in this game is a smaller version of the Tannenberg battle in the 2-scenario box Tannenberg: Eagles in the East / Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron and the 6-scenario box The Eastern Front: 1914-1917. (The larger versions can be combined into larger scenarios or campaigns.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Simulation of the Seven Days' Battles which started Robert E. Lee on the road to glory.<br/><br/>The setting is the Union&rsquo;s Peninsula Campaign in the spring of 1862.  McClellan has formed and trained a large army, transported it by sea in an outflanking maneuver, marched it to the gates of the Confederate capital, and is poised to capture the city and probably bring an end to the rebellion.  On the Confederate side Lee has taken over the Army after Johnston was wounded.  Unlike Johnston, who was content to fight a largely defensive campaign, Lee gathered every unit he could get his hands on and launched his own offensive.  The Union had placed its army in an awkward position, with one corps north of Chickahominy River and the rest south of it.  Lee&rsquo;s plan, and the position of the units when the game starts, was to crush the Union Corps and then drive the rest of McClellan&rsquo;s army from the capital, destroying as much of it as he possible could.  With that accomplished he would have a free hand to turn north.<br/><br/>The system is a simplified version of two games, the last area-impulse Avalon Hill published, Breakout: Normandy, and MMP's Monty's Gamble: Market Garden.<br/><br/>The game features leaders who are rated for initiative and combat effectiveness. Another mechanism in the game is the &ldquo;advantage&rdquo; marker which can be traded to the opponent to do things like rally, conduct a combined assault, declare a heroic defense that turns a success into a stalemate, or receive additional replacements.<br/><br/>The victory conditions are based on territorial control.  For the Union that was Richmond.  For the Confederacy that was the Union supply heads &ndash; White House Landing and Harrison&rsquo;s Landing &ndash; and Malvern Hill.  A key decision for the Union player is when to shift his supply train from White House Landing to the more secure location at Harrison&rsquo;s Landing.<br/><br/>The unit scale is divisional including artillery and cavalry.<br/><br/>There is the campaign game, and a few optional rules.  Playing time should be under three hours between experienced players.<br/><br/>",

With the high cost for every bird you hatch, it probably won't be worth it in the end. You can't tell at the beginning of the year which of the six bird varieties will do best, and beware the birds with exceptional plumage! If they thrive, they can be worth big money &mdash; but if they go wrong, they can bankrupt your ranch.<br/><br/>In Emu Ranchers, a Decktet game for two players, each bird on your ranch is represented by a stack of cards. Cards in a single bird stack must all share a suit and must be in rank order. At the end of the hand, the value of a bird is determined by the total of the number cards in the stack. If the total is too low, then you can end up losing money on a bird. An Ace or Crown makes the stack worth more: more profit if you can cover expenses, but more loss if you can't. The object, naturally enough, is to raise profitable birds.<br/><br/>",

Each player then takes a turn in clockwise order to move their string and score, if possible. &quot;Moving the string&quot; means stretching your string across your board and through a slot on either side of the furniture that matches the card played. If the string touches the object on the floor, that player scores chip tokens.

        "description": "On October 6, 1973, Egyptian forces, lavishly equipped with the latest Soviet weaponry, launched a surprise attack in overwhelming strength against the 436 Israeli infantrymen and 200 tanks that were guarding the Suez Canal.  The Egyptian onslaught was spearheaded by seven divisions and over a thousand tanks - with another three divisions and 300 tanks in reserve around Cairo.  Despite these long odds, the Israelis believed they would be able to repel the assault with relative ease.<br/><br/>Within 72 hours, the assumptions that formed the foundation of the Israeli strategy - the defensive value of the Suez Canal, the absolute superiority of Israeli troops, and the decisive role of the Israeli Air Force - were proven to be shockingly, undeniably mistaken.  First of all, the Egyptians, displaying an unexpected mastery of engineering technique, built no fewer than ten bridges over the Canal by the end of October 7 - an achievement which enabled them to pour tanks and other heavy equipment across much faster than the Israelis had thought possible.  More shocking yet, every Israeli counterthrust had been thrown back, with appalling losses.  Those supposedly inferior Egyptian troops did not falter in the face of the immediate and violent Israeli counterattacks, but bravely stood their ground - knocking out better than 300 Israeli tanks in the first three days of the war.  Finally, when the Israeli Air Force was sent to the rescue of the hard-pressed ground forces, it ran into an almost impenetrable wall of antiaircraft guns and SAMs (including the hitherto unknown - and very deadly - Soviet SA-6s) that took a dreadful toll of the attacking Phantoms and Skyhawks.<br/><br/>History tells us that the Israelis managed to overcome the initial consequences of their own hubris and overconfidence, and reverse the course of the war, through a combination of sheer guts, brilliant improvisation, and superior technique in mobile warfare.  Yet, the outcome of the war along the Suez Canal was, to quote Wellington, &quot;A very near run thing,&quot; that might easily have ended in a humiliating Israeli defeat.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE    12 hours per turn<br/>MAP SCALE    2.5 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE    Battalion / Brigade<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One to four<br/>PLAYING TIME    Two to twelve hours<br/><br/>",

I chose Namibia because my little sister lived there several years and sent me a lot of information and historical maps. <br/>The main theme of this game is not complex railroad construction. The number of brown tiles is limited, so that there will be no useless delay in the end of the game (when everything has been decided). Many hexes of the plan probably won't be used, but this is realistic in view of the Namibian geography.'<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tute is an Italian trick-taking card game for two to four players. During the 19th century, the game spread in Spain, becoming one of the most popular card games in the country. The name of the game was later modified by Spanish speakers, who started calling the game Tute. The game is played with a deck of traditional Spanish playing cards, or naipes, that is very similar to the Italian 40-card deck.<br/><br/>The classic version of the game is Two-player Tute, while the most played is Tute in Pairs, where four players form two teams. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza (a pile next to a player that contains the cards that the player gets after winning a trick) and by declarations (holding certain combinations of cards). Due to its wide popularity, several variations of the game exist.<br/><br/>The game is played with a Spanish deck of cards, which is divided into four suits: Oros (coins), Espadas (spades), Copas (cups) and Bastos (clubs). The 8s and 9s of each suit are excluded, leaving forty cards in the deck. The object of the game is to score the most points in the baza and from declarations.<br/><br/>Tute in Pairs is played by four players&mdash;two teams of two players each&mdash;and every player receives ten cards (since there are 40 cards, this means that all of the cards in the deck are dealt). The last card to be dealt is shown to the rest of the players and becomes the trump. This card belongs to the player it was dealt to. The four people sit in a circle, with opponent players to the right and left of each player, and players sitting opposite their team members.<br/><br/>One person plays a card, and the player to the right of this person, from the opponent team, plays a card. As with Two-player Tute, if the second player has one or more higher cards of the same suit as the first player's card, one of these must be played. If the second player has cards of the same suit, but only ones of less value than the first card, one of these must be played. If the second player does not have any cards of the same suit but has one or more trump cards, one of these must be played. If the second player has no cards of the same suit and no trumps, any other card can be played.<br/><br/>Now, the next player to the right plays a card following the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or if this is not possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, then if possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played. The fourth player likewise plays a card following these same rules.<br/><br/>When all four cards of the trick are on the table, the pair that played the card with the strongest card wins the hand. The trump suit beats the other three suits, with the ranking of trump cards from strongest to weakest as follows: Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. The next strongest suit is the one the first player played, again with the card rankings being Ace-3-King-Knight-Knave-7-6-5-4-2. Cards of the other two suits always lose to trumps and the first player's suit. The winning team places the four cards from the trick into their baza. The rules for the declarations are similar to Two-player Tute, but it is mandatory to declare the cards after a player or the partner begins a baza. Only the scoring team can declare. To declare their cards, the opposing team has to begin a baza. Declaring cards in the plays that follow the beginning of a baza is not allowed. After the hand is over, the counting starts (see Scoring below). When the counting ends, and after the score is calculated, the cards in the bazas are mixed again in a single stack to be dealt at the start of the next round. The deal of cards rotates counter-clockwise during the subsequent hands<br/><br/>Tute games are played until an established number of game points is reached. Each time one of the competitors wins a round, one point is added to the total score of the player or pair. New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number is reached the player or pair wins.<br/><br/>The winner (or the pair of winners) of the round is determined by the total of round points each player (or pair) collects. These points are calculated as the sum of card values in baza, bonus points for declarations and the final trick bonus.<br/><br/>A player (or a pair), who wins at least one trick receives an ability to gain more round points upon declaring the card combinations. In Tute in Pairs the declarations can be performed until the end of round; in Two-player Tute this ability persists until only two cards are left in the deck.<br/><br/>The player, who collected all the four Kings, is entitled to declare tute (all), which automatically ends the round with a collector's victory. Having both King and Knight of the trump suit, one can declare las cuarenta (forty), scoring additional 40 round points. The combination of King and Knight of any other suit can be declared as veinte (twenty); it adds 20 round points to the player's score. If possible, a player can declare several combination. In such cases the declarations with the higher round point value must be made first. For example, after declaring veinte the player loses right to declare las cuarenta, though declaring another veinte is still allowed. In Two-player games the declaration order rule only applies to declarations between each trick is played, so the player can declare las cuarenta after veinte if the combination is collected by picking the previously missing card from the stock.<br/><br/>The total of the round points the player (or pair) has gained is calculated as the sum of values of the cards collected in the baza and the values of the declared combinations. The winner of the last trick also receives ten bonus round points. The total value of the deck (and thus the maximum amount of round points) is 230 points.<br/><br/>",

The choice of the equipment and the Brute unique special power determine how many cards the player can bring to the fight.<br/><br/>The cards let you attack the player or perform special actions.  The objective of the game is to defeat your opponent's Brute.<br/>A succesfully landed attack (not prevented with special cards, armours or shields) forces the target to discard cards from his hand, If the target has no more cards to discard he must draw a card from the damage deck. <br/>A damage card is often a bad thing (a wound a mutilation, or even a sudden death) but can give bonuses (like going berserk) as well.<br/><br/>Contents of the box:<br/>116 Combat cards<br/>20  Characters cards<br/>7   Special characters cards<br/>44  Gruesome Damage cards<br/>42  Special Objects cards<br/>24  Equipment minicards<br/>16  Mystical Invocations minicards<br/>12  Condition minicards<br/>6   Movement minicards<br/>20  Mocking Gods cards<br/>16  &quot;Ears&quot; minicards<br/>24  Special Abilities minicards<br/>1   Boardgame<br/>1   Game Rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "VOR is a science-fiction miniatures game that takes place inside a mysterious galaxy-sized anomaly (VOR) of unknown origin.  The anomaly randomly sucks worlds (and their inhabitants) through time-space and once in the VOR, all worlds drift toward the center (the Maelstrom) and their doom.  The inhabitants of the worlds pulled into the Vor are locked in a struggle with each other for survival.  Players fight as one of many races trapped in the VOR.<br/><br/>VOR is a squad-based wargame from FASA (beloved publisher of material for the well-known Battletech, Traveller, Fading Suns, and EarthDawn games).  It has an extraordinarily innovative ruleset from which other games have since borrowed and with perhaps one of the best movement systems of any of the squad miniature games.  The system supports a unit popping around a corner (out of cover), shooting, and moving back efficiently.  This game uses a hit and wound determination model much like GW's Warhammer 40K.  The rules allow you to put together your own units and characters to represent new civilizations drawn into the Vor.  Yes, you can use all those miniatures from all those other games you own!!<br/><br/>There are some interesting miniatures (such as the Growler race) included with the base game and you can purchase additional units (even some unreleased) from Iron Wind Metals and Ral Partha, but the game is now fan-supported as the original publisher is no longer actively releasing new supplements.<br/><br/>",

The emphasis is on commanding a multi-battalion force, and all game mechanics serve that priority.<br/><br/>Players command multi-battalion forces, using division-level tactics. Pre-game orders determine how units perform, with limited ability to change plans on the fly<br/><br/>No plan survives the first ten minutes of a battle. This truism is frequently misinterpreted and used by many to argue against the use of a restrictive command control system. Above all, it does not mean that a new plan can be extemporized to replace the faulty one. A commander adjusted as best he could, given the systematic limitations of his troops and the availability of reserves.

LOT was born while researching the concept of a simple piece-removal game mechanism that made loops impossible, but at the same time, produced potentially long games in a very small playing area. (The name LOT comes from &quot;Line Of Three&quot; and also from &quot;Lots Of Turns&quot;.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns, with the second player having the option of swapping colors after the first turn (pie rule). On a turn, a player does the following in order:<br/><br/>1. Lays out a thing on an empty space: Place a piece of your color on an empty space of the board.<br/><br/>2. Looks over that:  If at least one line of three or more pieces (not stacks) of your color in any direction (orthogonally or diagonally) has been created, then you must do the following in order:<br/><br/><br/>    Choose one of the lines of three that have been created and remove two pieces, but leave one there.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Add one level of tower, by adding another piece of yours to the single piece that you left in place during the previous step, thereby creating a stack.<br/><br/><br/>If at the end of the turn at least one line of three (or more) stacks of the same color has been created, the line's owner triumphs. If the board fills up before this happens, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>",

The game maps stretch from Vierville to St. Laurent and provide every draw, house, and German Stuetzpunkt (Strong Point).<br/><br/>The map takes the American landing from Dog Green to Easy Green, with the Dog White and Dog Red landing beaches in between.

German players will have something to say about all this as they attempt to coordinate fire from Strong Points Wn71 through Wn66.<br/><br/>A complete beach-landing presentation is provided, taking ATS gamers personally through a historical experience akin to the first 20-minutes of the seminal film Saving Private Ryan with the difference being their personal attachment to involvement in the action.

Froggis) is the German version of the game תעשו מקום (Make Room), published in 2020 by Shafir Games in Israel.<br/>In Fr&ouml;schis, you want to line up your cards in numerical order, eventually getting rid of your card row entirely.<br/><br/>The deck consists of cards numbered 1-8 with six of each, along with four frogs and eight trash. To start the game, deal each player a row of eight cards face down.<br/><br/>On a turn, take either the top card of the deck or the discard pile, then place the card in the proper place in your row &mdash; a 1 goes in the first spot, a 2 in the second spot, etc. &mdash; as long as the card you're replacing is face down. Reveal that face-down card, and if you can place it in your row &mdash; again, replacing only a face-down card &mdash; then do so. If you reveal a frog, it's a joker that can serve as any number. If, for example, you place a frog in the 4 spot, reveal a 6, then place the 6 and reveal a 4, you can place the 4, then move the frog to a different face-down spot. If you reveal trash or a number you already have face up, discard it to end your turn.<br/><br/>If you have eight face-up cards in a row, each other player takes one final turn, then you start a new round, and all players who completed their row are dealt only seven cards instead of eight. Now you have to get only seven cards in a row to win the round, but all 8s count as trash for you, possibly making it harder for you to do so. Keep playing rounds until someone gets down to a row of only one card, completing it with a 1 or a frog. That player wins when they do so, and multiple players can win if they complete their one-card row in the same round.<br/><br/>",

The German player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by isolating or capturing Moscow, or by seizing all the other key cities on map. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires that he prosecute local counterattacks.<br/><br/>Play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their offensive on 1 October 1941 and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objective. Play may end sooner than the historic termination time if either player concedes defeat prior to the official end of a game.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 7.5 miles (12 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with some brigades and one elite super-elite regiment. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout much of the campaign are built into the game's movement and combat rules. Each game turn represents a week. The game uses a derivation of the well received system from our boxed game Drive on Stalingrad, 2nd edition.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 7.5 miles / 12 kilometers<br/>Units: Brigades to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheet (352 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low-Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>Players need to supply One 6-sided die<br/><br/>",

If a player defeats all other opponents, they win!<br/><br/>Battlefold is a player-elimination game, but eliminated players can still participate via the &quot;ghost&quot; rule. When a player's character dies, the character becomes a ghost. Flip the character board to the ghost side and keep playing. A ghost player can gain spiritual energy by successfully attacking living characters, and if a ghost collects full spiritual energy before only one living character remains in the arena, then the ghost wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Tiles in hand or the bag are merely tiles, bribes and blackmail material which can be used to recruit agents.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT<br/><br/><br/>     1 hexagonal board (61 hexes)<br/>     30 Agents for each player (different types)<br/><br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>There are several ways to lose Sleepers:<br/><br/><br/>     Morale: a player is eliminated once ten of their agents are killed (the enemy spymaster flees the country).<br/>     Capture: a player is eliminated if they are surrounded by active militia (the enemy spymaster is captured).<br/>     Attrition: a player is eliminated if they cannot move (no more tiles AND no sleeper agents).<br/><br/><br/>There are also several ways to win:<br/><br/><br/>     Success: make a line of active agents joining any two opposite sides of the board (your network covers the whole country).<br/>     Liberation: create a doomsday device by making a line of 5 active Scientists (you destroy Germany and free France).<br/>     Elimination: eliminate all other players.<br/><br/><br/>",

The catch: there's only one pencil for the entire group to use when tallying up their taters.<br/><br/>The game starts with one person writing while the rest of the circle takes turns rolling the die. Most of the options rolled cause you to give everyone else a goofy gesture (a &quot;high-fry&quot; all-in hand slap, a &quot;mashed potatoes&quot; table drum roll, or a &quot;spud-bump&quot; simultaneous fist pound). But one of the die rolls will cause everyone to pass their potato-counting papers to the left, making the pencil-marker start where their neighbor left off, and giving someone else a big head start. And one of the die rolls will cause the roller to reach for the pencil and exclaim, &quot;Gimme That!&quot;<br/><br/>",

In Titans of Industry, you must invest in building factories and businesses in order to produce goods and sell them to gain victory points (VPs). Game play involves a delicate balance of money, production, and goals. The person who can best manage his buildings and meet his goals in seven years will win.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with four workers and $6,000. Every turn, players first buy buildings, then place workers on those buildings or on the board. Factories allow you to produce goods, while Businesses allow you to sell those goods for money or VPs. A good player needs to balance production and sales, and encourage other players to sell with them to maximize sales. Board elements allow players to take advantage of bonuses, such as extra production, building improvements, and Corporate Strategy cards. Corporate Strategy cards help give players additional goals and direction, by specifying additional ways to gain victory points.<br/><br/>Three times during the game &ndash; years 1923, 1925, and 1927 &ndash; upkeep will be due, and players must pay to maintain their buildings, or will need to take out loans. Players will need to sell enough goods before then to have enough money to cover the costs, as loans are worth negative victory points at the end of the game. After year 1927, whoever has the most victory points from combined sales, buildings, and Corporate Strategy cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Titans of Industry, which allows 3-6 players and plays in approximately 20-25 minutes per player, is a rich worker-placement/resource-management Euro-style game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lamb saddle? Tuna steak? Or maybe lobster with herb sauce?<br/><br/>TOP Kitchen is a delightful board game about managing the kitchen and menu in a gourmet restaurant for 2 to 4 players. Each player takes the role of a Chef and competes for the greatest prestige. To achieve the goal they prepare gourmet dishes, for which they need to acquire all the necessary ingredients and seasonings in an exciting rivalry for the best prices.<br/><br/>With all the groceries and additional helpful appliances ready Chefs must hurry to cope with incoming orders. Cooking is represented by joyful dice rolling to which you can apply certain modifiers. Thanks to the &quot;Action Deck&quot; cards each Chef can use instant bonuses to boost their own or meddle in the opponents dishes with unpleasant incidents. Some of these cards are simple improvements for your own kitchen. However you can also invest these cards for future profit. The chef who gathers the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>The game last 2 to 4 rounds, each divided into three phases. <br/>Phase 1 - Preparation - each player gets 5 randomly selected Action Cards (75 available), some guaranteed income and chooses 3 to 5 menu cards (60 available). Each menu card represents a dish which becomes part of your restaurant menu. <br/>Phase 2 - Groceries/Shopping - the players place their bids and the highest bidder gets to start the shopping. At this stage players acquire ingredients (represented by 90 colored d6 dice) necessary to prepare the dishes and special seasoning (15 cards), which are laid out on the market board. <br/>Phase 3 - the players use a small plastic frying pan as a dice rolling tray and the active player marker. One by one the players roll the dice representing different ingredients and try to achieve success. Incoming orders are being managed in the cooking table placed on the players board. If a player manages to successfully finish the dish he/she is rewarded with some money and most importantly prestige (much higher if one uses the spices).<br/><br/>",

In one game mode, the players co-operate to try to reach Grandma's house before the wolf can spot them; in the second game mode, one player takes on the role of the wolf.<br/><br/>During the first game mode, the players will help Little Red Riding Hood reach Grandma&rsquo;s cottage before the wolf gets there. In this mode, the wolf is managed by the game. To start, the youngest player flips over the first card of the Path card deck. Count the number of flowers on the card. Place as many face-down Gathering tokens on it as there are flowers. This will be the first card for Gathering. Then, this player takes the first turn of the game as explained below.<br/><br/>In the second game mode, a player plays the wolf. Unlike the first game mode, the Wolf chooses the Path cards, instead of players drawing them randomly from the deck. The other players play as the characters helping Little Red Riding Hood reach Grandma&rsquo;s cottage before the Wolf arrives.<br/><br/>",

Four of the rows are colored, and some squares have numbers in them. On a turn, the active player rolls two dice, then each player chooses the polyomino showing on one of the dice and draws this shape in their grid as if they had just dropped it into the grid from the top.<br/><br/>Each polyomino has a circle in one position while the rest of its squares have a large X in them. The active player chooses a polyomino before all other players, and if anyone else chooses the polyomino on this die, those players must place an X on their sheet instead of a circle. This is bad since if you can place a circle in the same location as a number, you score points equal to that number at the end of the game.<br/><br/>If you're the first player to fill in all spaces in a colored horizontal row, then you score 4 points; if you complete this same row after someone else, you score only 2 points.<br/><br/>The game ends once two players can't fit either of the current polyominoes into their grid. Players score positive points for completed rows and numbers circled, then lose 1 point for each space left uncovered, whether due to them creating gaps when &quot;dropping&quot; the polyominoes or just not being able to fit a polyomino in the top of their grid. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

The Echo is a faction led by a secretive cabal of humans with psychic powers, and the Soldiers of Light are humans who believe the fall of mankind was brought about due to a dependence on technology.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-player competitive play or solitaire play, and each set can be played by itself standalone, or combined with other sets to form a larger narrative. Players control characters from one of the game&rsquo;s six Factions.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play For What Remains: skirmishes and campaigns. Skirmishes are standalone games played for a single victory, with no lasting repercussions. Campaigns are a series of skirmishes linked together to form a larger narrative. For What Remains is a scenario driven game. Each scenario typically has multiple objectives, and combat between factions is usually secondary. Players win skirmishes by gaining victory points through accomplishing these objectives.<br/><br/>The game board is built from modular tiles which are themed to represent different environments. The default game board is a destroyed urban setting. Players build the game board with nine modular tiles, each of which are divided into a 7x7 grid. Characters use the grids for movement.<br/><br/>Each character is represented by a counter and has a corresponding character card and tokens. During campaign play, characters improve their attributes and develop new abilities as they progress from Recruit to Veteran and then Elite level.

The game board includes cut-out pieces, and you flip the areas related to the problems to show what ability &mdash; speed, agility, defense, or strength &mdash; is needed to solve the problem.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the movement die, then reveal a new card if the alarm symbol is visible on the die. Sometimes the cards introduce new problems in the city or a roadblock that cuts off your movement; at other times, Frozone shows up to solve a problem on his own, Edna Mode shows up to rescue Jack-Jack (who starts on the game board and is represented by a die), or Jack-Jack teleports somewhere in the city.<br/><br/>After resolving the card, you optionally move, then if you're on a problem, you roll your die to see whether you get the ability needed to solve it. If someone previously landed on Jack-Jack's space or Edna found him, then you roll the Jack-Jack die as well. Flip the problem card face down on the track if you solve it.<br/><br/>If an unresolved problem ever reaches the end of the track, then you all lose the game. If all of the current problems have been resolved (i.e., are face down) and Jack-Jack is with the family, then you all win!<br/><br/>",

The size of the miniatures is 8mm.<br/><br/>The two terrain boards are designed to be placed together on any edge, giving the potential for 16 different battlefields. The 1&quot; grid marked on the boards precludes the need for rulers to be used in the game.<br/><br/>The simple rules system should allow a game to played within an hour.<br/><br/>The two armies are generic Napoleonic forces of equal size and composition which make up three brigades for each side. There is a simple painting guide in case you which to enhance your armies and terrain boards.<br/><br/>",

Casper) Ryx written by a Polish writer Mariusz Wollny.<br/><br/>Players assume the role of gangs ringleaders, who fight for the title of the King of Beggars, the ruler of the Cracow underworld. The winner will be the one who at the end of the game will have the highest value of points of influence (respect). The players score points by performing tasks described on the objective cards which they are drawing at the start of each turn. Many objectives will require a capture of taverns, which will become bases of operation for players and will allow to take control over districts of the Renaissance Cracow.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into 4 phases. Income, Action, Objective phase, and Investigation. With the passage of time and the disclosure of new crimes conducted by players, both the time and investigation marker, which start at the opposing end of the time-investigation track, will move closer to each other. When they meet the game ends and the player who scores most points of influence will be the new King of Beggars.<br/><br/>A 2 players variant follows a somewhat different principles. The map of Cracow is limited to 6 districts, players do not use time/investigation track as well as the influence track. Instead they compete for fulfillment of the 4 explicit objectives drawn from separate &quot;duel deck&quot; set next to the board. Upon completion of a task, the player takes the duel card to his pool and draws new one to replace the one he took. The player who first accumulates 4 objective cards wins the game. Thanks to these modifications the game is as playable as the 3-5 players variant, but much shorter.<br/><br/>",

Its location on the Baltic and North Seas and on the trade routes between Scandinavia and the Frankish Empire led to goods from around the known world &mdash; such as the Baltics, Baghdad, and Constantinople &mdash; being traded here.<br/><br/>The subject of constant wars and changes of power, as well as the progressive Christianization of those in the north, Haithabu &mdash; known as &quot;Hedeby&quot; in English &mdash; had a rich history that ended in 1050 when the Norwegian king sacked and burned the town in a conflict with Denmark.<br/><br/>As Vikings, players trade with all the known world while also living through the changes and dark days at the end of the Early Middle Ages. In the game, players take turns performing individual actions on an action rondel, and what's most critical in the game is the timing of the actions because in each round each color of action can be selected only once. Players must react to market price changes and event dice that can cause complications.<br/><br/>",

The web is a spiral, you roll the die and move Auntie, then take turns to move one of your bugs towards the exit space. Initially, Auntie is in a good mood, if she runs into a bug or bugs, they go back to her larder. But as soon as someone escapes, she loses her temper and kills anything she catches! The game has a scoring track, and each time a bug is caught or escapes, a marker moves up, also adding a number to the die roll. So Auntie runs around the web faster and faster. Players can share some spaces, but most of the time, bump each other back and forth. Naturally, nasty bugs push others into Aunty's path to certain death!<br/> Slightly confusing when you start, this is actually a really simple game, easily as good as any D&amp;F game. The original set had wooden pawns for the bugs, but D&amp;F issued a series of neat rubber bugs, which do add to the games' style.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On a cold February morning, you find yourself trapped in the professor's manor, faced with the results of his experiments with time itself. Can you break the loop and escape?<br/><br/>The Groundhog Gambit, title #6 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an 18-card escape room experience for 1 or more players, and takes two sessions of about 60 minutes to solve cooperatively.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required and the game is otherwise non-destructible. So while you can&rsquo;t play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We receive a certain pool of resources, determine which action will be active and (in solo mode) what the consequences will be (that is, the actions of the automata).

Will an aggressive Dick Garnett recklessly charge everyone in sight, seeking to regain his lost honor; will a cautious Stannard sit and watch, or will an unreliable Iverson hit the bottlc instead of the front line?<br/>     Artillery Barrage, simplified Ammo rules, sp&eacute;cial rules for Green units, and an optional Fatigue Rule that really places an emphasis on careful unit usage.<br/>     A remarkably simple Shock Table that features Continuous Attack - you can roll up the enemy&rsquo;s flank in one massive charge.<br/><br/><br/>Time Scale: 20 minutes per turn <br/>Map Scale: 125 yards per hex <br/>Unit Scale: 50 men per strength point <br/>Players: One-to-Six<br/><br/>(from the back of the box)<br/><br/>This is the first game in the Great Battles of the American Civil War Series from GMT.<br/><br/>Using an innovative initiative and activation system the game unfolds across the fields of southern Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>Units are regiments and individual artillery batteries. <br/>Several scenarios and the replay of the entire battle will provide hours of game play.<br/><br/>(BGG user's description)<br/><br/><br/>",

The cosmic faculty of the Technical Academy of Creation is delighted to welcome you to your Civolution, the final exam in Civilization Design!<br/><br/>For this occasion, we prepared a humanoid scenario on an isolated continent. Here, each of you holds the rank of a local deity which is closely linked to its very own civilization and must lead it to success over the other civilizations. Your developmental possibilities are endless and reach from cultural and technical progress to evolutional adaptations. For example, what would you consider more beneficial to your tribes: inventing the wheel or growing wings? Demonstrate your ability to operate your civilization console and show us how well you can adjust to changeable environmental conditions and mild creational chaos.<br/><br/>When the exam ceases after four eras, whoever managed to gather the most success points will not only pass the exam but will become a full member of the Technical Academy of Creation and garner the opportunity to be promoted to the next instance.<br/><br/>Civolution is a medium heavy to heavy euro-style game that utilizes a dice selection mechanism to trigger actions on a tech tree-like structure. As you figure out how to best use your dice and put your unique cards into play, tons of strategies and paths to victory emerge, though each time you play, you will only explore a fraction of the possibilities that the game&rsquo;s system and many cards provide.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fortunes change at a stroke in this exciting game of betting and bluffing! Play your cards right and you'll be on a winning streak --but give too much away and you'll find your opponent's horse piping you at the post. Tension's high from the instant the horses leave their starting stalls. You keep the horse you've backed secret until you judge the moment's right to reveal it --cunning players will push other horses forward to create a &quot;false scent&quot;, then try to come through the field with a last minute burst and take the race at the winning post. If you back for a place, you play safe...But the stakes will be low. If you try for a big win...You could lose your shirt! This exciting race game keeps everyone guessing --and trying-- till the very last moment, and whether you win or lose it will provide hours of fascinating family fun.<br/><br/>Contents: Felt playing area, 42 horse movement cards, 12 betting indicator cards, money, six plastic horses in different colors, starting stalls and grandstand. In the Canadian edition, the felt became a standard board, and the starting stalls and grandstand are gone as they were just chrome (theme elements not employed in the game).<br/><br/>For each of the eight races the cards are thoroughly shuffled and dealt out to each player. The different cards (5 per horse) advance each horse at various rates (2 to 4 spaces) in the race and there are also 12 cards that affect any horse in the race (backwards 2 or forward 3). Players secretly bet on a horse to either win or place (take first or second place); you can also bet the jackpot (which is made up of all losing bets from previous races), which is like betting for a win except the minimum stake is higher and the payout is handled differently. Betting on a horse actually means taking one of its movement cards out...until you decide to play it, revealing your bet --one of this game's numerous subtleties.<br/><br/>During the race, the players play their horse cards in turn, maneuvering the horses as needed --horses have very limited sidestepping and could be blocked during the race. If a player &quot;loses his shirt&quot; i.e. goes broke, he just continues the game playing cards but not betting.<br/><br/>It can be best described as a cross between Win, Place &amp; Show and Undercover (a.k.a. Heimlich &amp; Co.).<br/><br/>",

While also the black market lures with attractive prices, the inhabitants of the island have a say in the matter as well.<br/><br/>Expedition Sumatra leads the players into the dense primeval forest of the Indonesian island. By cleverly flipping and rotating the path tiles they have to build new roads through the jungle, track down rare animals and load them onto their ships, which circle around the island.<br/><br/>Like the vegetation in a jungle the board of Expedition Sumatra is constantly changing its appearance - old paths vanish, new ones appear, while the players are searching for animals hidden in the forest. And each tile that is flipped raises the question anew: Will the hunt be successful or will there be only deserted paths or might there even be a native lurking, ready to take the hard-won animals back to the jungle?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Sumatra - Insel vieler seltener Tierarten<br/><br/>Im Auftrag namhafter Zoologischer G&auml;rten machen sich mehrere Teams von Gro&szlig;wildj&auml;gern daran, zum Nutzen der Nachwelt einige der selten gewordenen Tiere im Dschungel von Sumatra einzufangen. Zwar lockt auch der Schwarzmarkt mit guten Preisen, doch die Inselbewohner haben ebenfalls noch ein W&ouml;rtchen mitzureden.<br/><br/>Expedition Sumatra f&uuml;hrt die Spieler in einen &uuml;ppig wuchernden Inselurwald. Hier gilt es, durch geschicktes Klappen und Drehen der Wegepl&auml;ttchen Pfade durchs Dickicht zu bahnen, seltene Tiere zu entdecken und auf das eigene Schiff, das die Insel umkreist, zu verladen.<br/><br/>Wie die Vegetation eines Urwalds ver&auml;ndert sich bei Expedition Sumatra best&auml;ndig der Spielplan - alte Wege verschwinden, neue entstehen, w&auml;hrend die Spieler auf der Suche nach im Dschungel versteckten Tieren die gr&uuml;ne Wildnis durchk&auml;mmen. Bei jedem Klappen eines Wegepl&auml;ttchens stellt sich erneut die Frage, was sich darunter verbirgt - wird einem das Jagdgl&uuml;ck hold sein, st&ouml;&szlig;t man nur auf verlassene Pfade oder lauert einem gar ein Eingeborener auf, der wom&ouml;glich die m&uuml;hsam gefangenen Tiere wieder zur&uuml;ck in den Urwald bringen will?<br/><br/>",

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.<br/><br/>At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!<br/><br/>To this basic game, Star Wars Labyrinth adds one twist &ndash; a Darth Vader variant in which a Vader token starts the game on a designated tile. Whenever a player has a card that includes a small Darth Vader icon, that player needs to reach the desired symbol with Vader instead of his own token. As a result, multiple people might be trying to move Vader at the same time. Who wields the Force with enough power to bend Vader to his will?<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/><br/>    Labyrinth<br/><br/><br/>",

A long and bloody siege affair.<br/><br/>&quot;Storm Over Madrid&quot; uses a modified version of the well-known area-impulse wargame system. The modifications to the original system are many and carefully considered. Besides a new morale points system that highlights the intrinsic febrility of the Republican side, support points that oblige players to plan ahead and event chits, our combat system has several new concepts: defensive fire and counter-attacks, automatic losses depending on the intensity of the battle... Attacks are never free and the actual decision to attack must be thought through carefully.<br/><br/>One game turn represents a week and the game runs from 9 October 1936 to 21 January 1937 (15 turns). 2 short scenarios and a campaign game allow you to play the battle from start to finish, with each scenario requiring a different style of play.<br/>Units are for the most part battalion strength.   The Nationalists have the (Spanish) Legion and Moroccan troops, while on the Republican side there are anarchists, communists and the International Brigades.<br/><br/>An interesting 2 player wargame, one that is fun to play and historically correct.  It&rsquo;s a game that allows you to understand the ins and outs of this asymmetric siege by revisiting a game system that has already proved its worth.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Lose all of your spectators, and you can't win!<br/><br/>Each player in Kyudo takes one of the four role cards and a scoring sheet that depicts the central target, five flags (one in each of the five colors on the dice), and twenty spectators. The starting player takes the four dice, and other players mark off 1-3 spaces on flags.<br/><br/>On a turn, roll the four dice up to three times, re-rolling dice as you wish. The dice show five colors (that match the flags and the colored rings on the target) and an arrow. For each arrow, you can assign it to a color that you rolled, then mark off a space on the central target. With two arrows, one blue, and one red, for example, you can mark off two blue spaces, two red spaces, or one blue and one red space. Once you've marked off all the spaces in a colored ring, any additional &quot;hits&quot; on that color cause your opponents to lose spectators &mdash; because you're clearly far more awesome than they are!<br/><br/>If you roll two or more dice of the same color, you can mark off an equal number of spaces on the flag of that color; when you mark off the final space in the corner of a flag, you receive that flag's bonus, such as marking off any two spaces, or taking a token that lets you change a die to the face of your choice, or taking a different token that allows you not to lose spectators during a turn of your choice.<br/><br/>If you roll four arrows, all opponents lose four spectators, and if you roll four different colors, you use the special power of your role, such as forcing others to use only three dice for a round or adding a green or blue circle to opponents' targets.<br/><br/>If you lose all of your spectators, you're out of the game. If you're the last archer in the game, you win! Alternatively, if you've marked off all the spaces on your target and you have the most spectators, you win.<br/><br/>",

Hire your workers carefully, keeping in mind that members of the same family help each other reach success faster!  Dollars are useful, but victory points (VPs) are like pure gold! At the end of the year, the player with the most VPs wins the game and becomes the new Mayor of Capital City! Bring home a little piece of the wild west today!<br/><br/>In more detail, players have four rounds represented by the seasons of the year to expand their Wild West town! First, they bid for player priority order for the current season. Next, they choose character cards from the train to put to work, then purchase building cards to form Main Street. Then, players attach character cards to the building cards to earn dollars or VPs!  Attached characters are workers that provide bonuses to the current player and other players with characters from the same family! At the end of four seasons, the player with the most VPs wins!

        "description": "At the turn of the 16th century in Japan both the Emperor and the tycoon lost control of the country &ndash; the time when pushy and ambitious daimyos to subdue islands, the time for strong warriors to demonstrate their boldness and great warlords to show their art, the time when cunning secret agents decided a battle of the clans.<br/><br/>In the tactical card game Shinobi: War of Clans players will take on the role of secret agents of the most powerful clans of feudal Japan. The aim of the game is supporting your clan with military advantage; the clan which has the most troops at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player gets a clan card which shows what clan the player will belong to and four troop cards from the deck. The area before the player (his table) presents one of Japan&rsquo;s provinces, so the more players the more provinces. The players take turns clockwise from the starting player. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of the following orders: the troop deployment order, the troop movement order and the attacking order. During his turn the player must place a card from his hand on any province except his own one. If by the end of his turn in his province he raised the army (some troops of the same clan) which is stronger (more numerous) than any other army in any other province, the battle is unavoidable. It will be impossible to stop the warlike samurais from attacking but there is an opportunity to direct them to the proper side.  Once there are no more cards in the deck players take a final turn and come in true colors (reveal their secret cards). Clan cards are summed up and the player with the most cards of his clan in all the provinces wins the game.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s feudal Japan without ninjas! Without them no game about Japan can be complete. The ninjas&rsquo; function is obvious &ndash; to shorten the number of warriors from the enemy clans.<br/><br/>From 3 to 5 players can take part in the game. The tactics of the game changes depending on the number of players. You will need careful calculation to win in a five-player game; fans of bluff and &quot;psychological&quot; game will like the game with three participants. The game seems simple at first sight, but believe or not, keeping your clan in secret, guessing which clans your rivals play for and making them to play into your hands is not simple at all.<br/><br/>",

Motion cards let you move the given (color or wild) turtle 1 to 3 steps forward or back. Moving means you place your turtles above other turtles and possibly move whole stacks(turtles on top of turtles are also moved). Do not move further than the front or end of the row. Shaking cards let you drop all turtles from the back of the selected turtle (place them behind the turtle). Lettuce cards are placed in front of the turtles. Game ends as soon as the third lettuce appears on the table. The player whose turtle is in the lead (or on the bottom of the stack if tied) wins.<br/><br/>In the advanced game variant, the first two turtles are taken out of the race and the remaining ones take part in the next race. You separate the turtles in the stacks by placing them in a row behind the turtle at the bottom in the same order as they were in the stack, with the lower ones first. The advanced game ends as soon as two turtles of the same color have finished the race.<br/><br/>Part of the &quot;backpack games&quot; series from Egmont Polska.

Complete your Dungeon Drop story with Tavern Tales, as you and your companions compare mighty deeds in a strategic game of boasting and one-upmanship!<br/><br/>In this raucous card game of set collection and subtle bluffing, 2 to 5 heroes scheme their way to becoming the most renowned hero of epic legends!<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Tavern Tales plays over a variable number of rounds. In each round, player take turns as follows:<br/><br/>STEP 1: Using your hand of hero cards, stake your claim. Select one of the locations in play and identify which treasures you claim to have found or how many monsters you slayed there.<br/><br/>STEP 2: Dispute your companions. Other players may now use their hand of hero cards to dispute your claim and attempt to take the glory for themselves.<br/><br/>STEP 3: Turn your stories into legends. After a bit of one-upping and strategic bluffing, a final victor for the claim is declared. That player collects the disputed treasure or monster cards and score points based on how many of those identical cards they have previously collected. Through this set collection aspect, players are incentivized to remain in the lead on one or several types of claims in order to prevail.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has achieved enough fame to become the most renowned hero of epic legends!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SGK Veto 2ed is the second edition of this title and the first Polish CCG game set in the historical times of the 17th century. Basically this game is a duel, but the rules introduce also other ways to win - dimplomacy, intrigues and using military force. At once up to 5 sides - factions - can play.<br/><br/>The plot of the game is settled in the historical reality of the 17th century, Poland's heyday, the times of the gentry, covering Europe and Asia. The designers also referred to the Polish historical and contemporary prose, like Henryk Sienkiewicz (Nobel prize winner) and Jacek Komuda.<br/><br/>In 2009 Kuźnia Gier became the publisher of the game. This new publisher reprinted the basic decks designed by Wydawnictwo Imperium and added a new starter deck of Osmanowie (the Ottoman Empire - this faction was introduced by the Casus Belli expansion in boosters). Kuźnia Gier released their first own expansion in 2009 and further two in 2010. The line is constantly expanded with new products.<br/><br/>Veto CCG has now seasons of the game (each season starts with releasing a set of sarter decks and contains next three expansions), which is connected with rotation of legal cards in the organized tournament system. So far Veto has had three full seasons: basic season (Veto 2ed, Charakternicy, Casus Belli, Ogniem i Mieczem), Warchoły i Pijanice (eng. &quot;Dipsos and Troublemakers&quot;, inlcuding Ogniem i Mieczem (partly), Do szabel, Rębajłowie, Krwi) and Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci (&quot;Spies and Dimplomats&quot;, including W niewoli, Spiskowcy, Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo). The current season is called Czarty i Upiory (&quot;Devils and Ghosts&quot;) and will introduce a supernatural element to the otherwise historical game.<br/><br/>In July 2014 Historical Games Factory became the new publisher of the game.<br/><br/>In Veto 2ed. there are 5 factions - decks (in the first edition there were only 4):<br/><br/>- Awanturnicy<br/>- Dworscy<br/>- Radziwiłłowie<br/>- Wiśniowieccy<br/>- Osmanowie (added by the Casus Belli expansion and fully present in the game until Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo, now illegal in most organized tournaments)<br/><br/>SGK Veto 2ed. has also several expansions with brand new cards:<br/><br/>Basic season:<br/>- Veto 2ed.<br/>- Charakternicy<br/>- Casus Belli<br/>- Ogniem i Mieczem<br/><br/>Warchoły i Pijanice:<br/>- Do szabel<br/>- Rębajłowie<br/>- Krwi<br/><br/>Szpiedzy i Dyplomaci:<br/>- W niewoli<br/>- Spiskowcy<br/>- Kr&oacute;lob&oacute;jstwo<br/><br/>Czarty i Upiory:<br/>- Cmentarzysko<br/>- Danse Macabre<br/>- Malleus Maleficarum<br/><br/>Potop:<br/>- Initium Calamitatis Regni<br/><br/>",

Were we to become English, French or Native American?<br/><br/>A French wilderness empire stretches across vast tracts of the North American forest, along its rivers and the Great Lakes. It is growing, pushing further south and east. They have embraced and supported a Native American empire in the western wilderness. Both depend on each other for commerce and protection. Both are threatened by British expansion from the east. Both have aligned themselves together to stop it. Then a small skirmish on their frontier ignites a world war that engulfs them all and changes their empires forever.....<br/><br/>Wilderness Empires is a point to point Strategic level  board-wargame of the French and Indian War. Players take the roles of the French and their Native American allies or the British and their American Provincials. Game play is fast and fun with clean mechanics and short rules. Wilderness Empires uses event cards to bring the detail and rich history into the game and showcases this important time in American and European history.<br/><br/>",

Locals have taken to the services of anyone who will help &ndash; for a price of course. You are a bounty hunter seeking fame and fortune, but beware as other hunters will try to swoop in and claim your target as their own! Press your luck against other hunters in search of fame and fortune!<br/><br/>Hunters of Arcfall is a quick-playing dice and card game for 2-6 players. You start the game with players choosing a bounty hunter to play as. Players then take turns rolling dice to capture bounties; these bounties are shared amongst hunters so only the hunter who deals the final hit will capture the bounty. Only bounties that have been claimed are worth any points. You can claim bounties by ending your turn or continue the hunt and try to capture even more at the risk of losing anything you've earned. Each bounty is worth Fame and Fortune. You need Fame to win the game, but fortune will net you currency to purchase much needed Item Cards that help you manipulate the odds in your favor. Use your hunter's special ability to gain an extra advantage and press your luck if you think it's safe &ndash; you never know what lurks around the next corner.<br/><br/>A typical game of Hunters of Arcfall lasts between 20-30 minutes depending on the number of players and the point limit.<br/><br/>The expansion Tools of the Trade was initially planned as a separate item, but through Kickstarter funding, every copy of the game now includes this expansion. With Tools of the Trade, Hunters can purchase tools and items to help capture bounties or hinder their competitors.<br/><br/><br/>    Note: All copies of the game display 1-6 players on the box, however this is a printing error and the game only supports 2-6 players.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "from Schloesser session report:<br/><br/>This is a  trick-taking game, but with enough twists to give it a very different feel. Before each hand, players bid, one at a time, to determine three factors which will affect the hand:<br/><br/>a) trump colors (primary &amp; secondary) <br/>b) most or fewest tricks <br/>c) whether zero is considered 'high' or 'low'<br/><br/>Bidding is done by playing cards face-down from your hand. Players must bid 1 - 3 three cards on each of these categories. Once all three factors have been determined, players tally the value of the cards they played during this bidding process. The player who played the least value receives 4 (or 5, depending upon the number of players) victory points, with each other player receiving less points depending upon their total. Then, players must discard three of the cards they used in the bidding process, with the remaining cards being returned to their hands. This is usually a tough choice as often the conditions in effect for a particular hand turn out to be different than what you had hoped. This means that many of the cards you played may no longer be useful to you; indeed, they may be a detriment. So, deciding on which cards to keep and which to discard can be tough.<br/><br/>After this procedure is complete, A standard trick-taking game ensues. Points, however, are rewarded based on whether the goal was to take the most or fewest tricks. The player finishing with the most (or fewest, depending upon which goal was in force) receives 8 points (or 10 of playing with 5 players), the next player gets 6 points and so on down to 2 points. After a hand is completed, the entire process is repeated, including the bidding phase. A number of rounds equal to the number of players is played, with the player accumulating the greatest number of victory points being the victor.<br/><br/>",

With two armies of equal strength, victory requires careful planning, precise maneuvers, and exact timing to take advantage of the opportunities offered by unexpected events. Will the British player be able to pounce on a fleeting French blunder to win the day (as happened historically), or will the French be able to simply bludgeon his opponent into submission? In Arapiles 20, the outcome of this famous battle is in your hands.<br/><br/>Hans von Stockhausen's Bail&eacute;n 20 (July, 1808) showcases the stunning triumph of General Francisco Casta&ntilde;os&rsquo; Spanish army over French General Pierre Dupont&rsquo;s Corps d&rsquo;Observation operating in the mountains of Andalusia. This game challenges both players: The Spanish must struggle to coordinate the actions of their large and enthusiastic but mostly untrained army, while the French must decide whether to try and hold against superior numbers or conduct a fighting withdrawal back to Madrid. With Spanish guerrillas, a baggage train full of looted treasure, and treacherous Swiss mercenaries who might change sides in the middle of the battle, Bail&eacute;n 20 offers players plenty of military adventure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Partizan is a two-player, intermediate-complexity, historical simulation of the struggle between the Communists and the Axis occupation forces for mastery of Yugoslavia from 1941 through 1944. It starts with the first uprisings against the Axis in Bosnia, Serbia and Montenegro in late 1941, and ends in late 1944 just before the Soviet Army entered the country. The game is won by the Partisan player by waging an aggressive guerilla war: harassing the occupiers and destroying infrastructure that may be of use to them: warehouses, fuel dumps, bridges, dams, depots, railroads, viaducts, motor pools, etc (each represented by variably placed counters). &ldquo;Resource hexes&rdquo; represent strategic mineral deposits, such as bauxite, copper and chromium, which the Axis player must protect, along with routes from them back to Germany, while also guarding possible invasion beaches along the coast.<br/><br/>During the game, the exact strengths of Partisan units are mostly unknown by the Axis player (via &ldquo;tried&rdquo; and &ldquo;untried&rdquo; counter-sides). He must attempt to head off Partisan operations while never certain exactly where they&rsquo;re headed. The Partisan player must select his targets carefully in order to disrupt the occupation enough for him to win the game, while avoiding becoming surrounded and destroyed by the Germans in the process.<br/><br/>The counter-mix includes the full German, Italian, Hungarian, Croatian, Bulgarian, and Ustashi orders of battle, as well as all the Partisan forces and Marshall Tito himself (the Chetniks are handled abstractly). The Partisans may even expect support from the Anglo-Allies if the guerilla war against the Axis is going well, including possibly an amphibious invasion by the Anglo-Americans (&ldquo;Operation Armpit&rdquo;). In fact, most of the main Axis' operations in Yugoslavia historically pertained to the protection of their coastal flank. Their primary anti-partisan offensives were intended to clear the guerrillas from the coastal areas where an Allied invasion was possible. In game terms, the &quot;Allied Landing Scare&quot; rule simulates the reality of German strategic fears in the Balkans.<br/><br/>Axis forces, especially the Germans, are generally stronger than the partisans, but the partisans are elusive and difficult to catch, often forcing the Axis player to spread thin his forces. Partizan has been designed by Javier Romero (Triple Alliance War, Spanish Civil War) and developed by Eric Harvey (AETO, APTO &amp; AOI). It contains one 34x22&rdquo; extra-large-hex map and 228 iconic and NATO-style counters. Units of maneuver are brigades and divisions. There is one grand campaign scenario, which can be completed by two players in about five or six hours. Solitaire play is doable.<br/><br/>",

In turn order, every player play an instrument card on the board, choose an instrument and place its note discs on the choosen instrument. Each instrument plays a fixed number of notes and has two kind of abilities: an ability always-on, and another that is activated only if the instrument is placed in the proper location for its acoustics.<br/><br/>2) During the  Symphony Phase, the so arranged orchestra plays the music score, which is modular, and therefore different in each game. The orchestra is divided into 5 columns, and each column plays in a specific part of the score (for example, column A plays in the first 2 bars, column B in the second, third and fourth, and so on). When a column of instruments has finished its notes, the next column plays, and so on. Within a column, the lower instrument start playing a note, then the instrument immediately above plays a note, and so on, upward. Once at the top, the lower instrument plays again, and so on, until all the notes of the column are played. Obviously the player who has their note disks on the instrument controls is it, and decide where to place the related disks to score VPs. In this way, the game is not subdivided in player tyrns, but rather into instrument turns.<br/><br/>The main aim is to play better than their opponents (= score more VPs), so it is not important to play many notes, but play them properly. First, each note provides VPs according to the Voice that is placed on (1-3 VPs). Secondly, there are extra VPs for the Sheet note majorities (at the completiion of each sheet) and Voice note majorities (at the end of game). Also, different areas or notes on the music score are Scoring Areas, and grant you to advance on corresponding Scoring Tracks to score extra PV at the end of the game. Finally, some notes, as well as the placement of the initial instruments, provide yous Bonuses, that can be placed on your instruments (max 1 for Instrument) to potentiate their effects. So, to play better in such melodious context requires a careful strategy and good tactics.<br/><br/>Type: Eurogame<br/>Target: soft gamers (Base mod.) / hard gamers (Advanced mod.)<br/>Modalities: Basic and Advanced<br/><br/><br/>Porta la tua compagnia sul palco, e fonditi con le altre, a formare un'Orchestra!<br/>Drafta gli strumenti migliori a disposizione in ogni partita, piazzali nella posizione ideale per la loro acustica, ed infine suona ... la Sinfonia (cos&igrave; da totalizzare pi&ugrave; Punti Vittoria)!<br/>Ogni strumento suona in un modo diverso, ogni Spartito &egrave; diverso, ogni partita sublime!<br/><br/>Ogni partita a Symphony &eacute; divisa in 2 Fasi: la Fase Orchestra e la Fase Sonata.<br/><br/>1) Durante la fase Orchestra, l'Orchestra viene formata disponendo le carte Strumento, ed i giocatori, gradualmente, prendono possesso degli Strumenti che preferiscono, piazzando, a turno i propri dischi nota, sullo Strumento che scelgono. Ogni Strumento suona un numero prefissato di note e dispone di due abilit&agrave;: una sempre attiva, e l'altra che &egrave; attiva solo se lo Strumento &egrave; piazzato opportunamente, in una posizione appropriata per la sua acustica.<br/><br/>2) durante la fase Suonata, l'Orchestra cos&igrave; formata suona sullo Spartito, che &egrave; modulare, e quindi diverso in ogni partita. L'Orchestra &egrave; divisa in colonne, e ciascuna colonna, suona in una parte specifica dello spartito (ad esempio, la colonna A suona nelle prime 2 battute). Quando una colonna di Strumenti ha terminato le proprie note, suona la colonna successiva, e cos&igrave; via. All'interno di una colonna, suona prima una nota lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, poi una nota quello subito sopra, e cos&igrave; via, a salire. Arrivati in cima, riparte lo Strumento pi&ugrave; in basso, e cos&igrave; via, fino ad esaurire le note della Colonna. Chiaramente il giocatore che ha i propri dischi su uno Strumento, lo controlla, e decide dove piazzare le relative note per ottenere i PV. In questo modo il gioco non ha una normale suddivisione di turni dei giocatori, quanto piuttosto una suddivisione in turni degli Strumenti.<br/><br/>Dato che lo scopo &egrave; suonare meglio dei propri avversari (ovvero realizzare pi&ugrave; PV), non &egrave; importante suonare tante note, ma suonarle opportunamente. Innanzitutto ogni nota fornisce PV in base alla Voce su cui &egrave; piazzata. Secondariamente, vi sono dei PV extra per le maggioranze di Foglio (al termine di ogni Foglio) e di Voce (a fine partita). Inoltre, diverse aree dello Spartito sono Aree Punteggio, che fanno avanzare su appositi Tracciati Punteggio e forniscono PV extra a fine partita. Infine, alcune note, cos&igrave; come il piazzamento degli Strumenti iniziali, forniscono dei bonus Musicista, che possono essere piazzati sui propri Strumenti (max 1 per Strumento) per potenziarne gli effetti. A causa di tutto ci&ograve;, prevalere in un simile contesto melodioso richiede un'attenta strategia ed una buona tattica.<br/><br/>Tipologia: Tedesco                                               Target: soft gamers (mod.

No one will ever believe you. Vampires aren't real. Right? Well, tell that to the bloodsucker that's been hunting you. Tell that to your friend who wandered off into the forest with him.<br/><br/>In Nyctophobia: Vampire Encounter, you attempt to outrun and outsmart a vampire who is hunting you. The forest is a dark and lonely place. Players must blindly navigate it while wearing blackout glasses, trying to find and rescue their friend &mdash; &quot;the familiar&quot; &mdash; who the vampire has kidnapped and hidden in the forest. Only the vampire can see what's going on around them. The hunted players have the navigate the board through touch and memory only!<br/><br/>Nyctophobia: Vampire Encounter differs from Nyctophobia in that the hunter player takes on the role of vampire instead of the axe murderer or mage in the original game. The vampire can control the familiar and the player who is leading them out of the forest, leading to tricky situations for those in the dark. The game includes two pre-set maps for players to work through while they're trying to rescue the NPC familiar and return them to the car without anyone dying.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Most authors relegate the Battle of White Plains to a short paragraph when recounting the New York Campaign of 1776. As the last field battle of that campaign, however, it deserves closer study. Volume 10 in GMT&rsquo;s award-winning Battles of the American Revolution series by designer Mark Miklos provides such a much-needed analysis.<br/><br/>The game includes three scenarios: the historical fight for Chatterton Hill, an October 31 scenario that explores what might have occurred if Howe had pressed his grand assault that day as planned, and a full four-day campaign game spanning 42 game turns beginning with the arrival of the British army on the field on the morning of October 28 and culminating at 5:00 pm on October 31.<br/><br/>Each player has 26 Opportunity Cards subdivided into three decks to enhance play and add elements of variability and historical flavor. As with previous games in the series, some special rules represent the unique circumstances of this battle. Among these are rules governing American sortie restrictions and tactical doctrine, rain game turns, restoring army morale, scorched earth, and additional handicaps for American militia, American fieldwork construction, and an off-board movement mechanism for Tarrytown on the Hudson River, seven miles away where British ships lay at anchor. Even Washington&rsquo;s own combat prowess at this early stage of the war is randomized.<br/><br/>In Volume 10 of the Battles of the American Revolution series, players command two titanic armies: Washington, desperate to salvage something from the otherwise disastrous defense of New York, and Howe seeking a coup de gr&acirc;ce against the &ldquo;Old Fox.&rdquo; You will have to manage your forces over the span of four days with lots of inclement weather to contend with. Can you, as General Howe, break through the American line to deliver a decisive blow and end the rebellion? Can you, as General Washington, hold your own on superior ground, hampered as you will be with some 6,700 militia of dubious quality&mdash;fully 46% of the total American force?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Coerceo is a strategic board game that is played between two players. The objective of the game is to win from your opponent by enclosing the opponents pieces and thus removing them from the board. Coerceo has only a few basic game rules that can be mastered in just a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>The Coerceo board consists of 19 board tiles, each tile having 6 sides (hexagonal shape). A tile has 6 alternating black and white triangles marked on them. The 19 board tiles placed against each other make up the Coerceo modular game board. Each player starts with 18 identical game pieces which represent them on the board. Each game piece is a tetrahedron (i.e. shaped like a three sided &lsquo;pyramid&rsquo;). All game pieces have the same playing capabilities, which are moving and enclosing pieces from the opponent.<br/><br/>The Coerceo board gets smaller during the game when tiles are taken away from the board. This means that the opponent is never far away.<br/><br/>",

Joseph worked mightily to update/consolidate the rules, add individual and campaign scenarios, and add a half sheet of new counters (otherwise, the map and counters are from the original print runs).<br/><br/>The four wargames are: Trajan, Roman Civil War, Caesar in Gallia and Germania. Redone rules and tables, along with a new tactical &quot;Battle Board&quot; option, are included.<br/><br/>Additionally, this expansion presents 140 new counters, along with 11 new scenarios played on all four maps as one huge monster game. Among the new scenarios are: &quot;Year of the Four Emperors,&quot; &quot;Marcus Aurelius,&quot; and &quot;What If Caesar Hadn't Been Assassinated?&quot;<br/><br/>Each turn represents one to several months; each map hexagon is 46 miles across, and the main units of maneuver are legions and barbarian warbands.<br/><br/>Game components include four maps, over 1,000 die cut counters, a rules book and player aid cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players in Donburiko (ドンブリコ) need to grab acorns while staying out of the ponds, as acorns don't appreciate spending lots of time in the water. (The game's setting comes from the children's nursery song &quot;Donguri Korokoro&quot; (どんぐりころころ), in which acorns roll down from the hills into the ponds, first excitedly playing with the loaches &ndash; a type of freshwater fish &ndash; only to then pine for the mountain left behind. The last line of the song: &quot;He cried and the loach didn't know what to do.&quot;)<br/><br/>Each player starts with a few chips, each worth a point. The 16-card deck &ndash; which consists of two loaches (worth 0), four ponds (worth -1 or -2) and ten acorns (worth 1-5) &ndash; is shuffled, then a number of cards equal to the number of players are laid face-up. Each player receives a hand of 3-4 cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either places a card from his hand into one of the columns or claims one of the columns. When placing a card, he can lay it face-up (taking one chip from the bank) or face-down (placing one of his chips on the card); when taking a column, it must have at least two cards and at most six.<br/><br/>After taking a column, the player sums the cards in that column, with a loach turning the negative ponds positive and with two of the acorns worth either 1 or 5 at the player's discretion. If the column's sum is between 0-6, the player takes that many chips from the bank; if more than 6 or less than 0, he pays the difference to the bank. This player is then out of the round, while the others continue to play cards or take columns.<br/><br/>A round ends when no columns remain, columns with only one card remain, or someone scores 6 chips from a column; in the latter case, the round ends immediately, and no one else scores anything. Players then start a new round. When the bank empties or a player has 20 or more chips, players complete the current round, then the player with the most chips wins!<br/><br/>",

In order to achieve their aims, players have to bribe (via an auction) colonial government officials who control access to the interior and to the ports.<br/><br/>1884: First sources of various commodities have been discovered: gold, silver, copper and diamonds as well. The colonial government has issued concessions to enterprises which shall build up the necessary infrastructure to deliver the commodities and transport them to the coast. Who will place their rigs in the right place? Who will be able to sell the commodities for the highest price? The game board shows a map of Namibia with a hex grid.<br/><br/>Access to the interior allows a player to develop the country&rsquo;s rail infrastructure which is required to move commodities to ports in order to sell and make money. And money buys reputation, which gets more expensive to acquire as the game goes on. Players also need to construct and complete their mines and prospect for ore.<br/><br/>However, too much bribery leads to a decrease in reputation which affects a player&rsquo;s position at the end of the game, but limited access to the transport and shipping infrastructure will seriously impact a player&rsquo;s ability to make money.<br/><br/>Selecting the right time to ship and sell is the key, because the market can be manipulated by other players. The winner will be the player who can make loads of money while keeping a good market reputation. The player with the highest reputation wins.<br/><br/>This is the second game of the &quot;Edition Bohrt&uuml;rme&quot; (after 'Schwarzes Gold') that uses the game pieces of 'Giganten' (Kosmos). It is the winning titles in the categorie &quot;more complex games&quot;.<br/><br/>",

They are here to compete for acceptance amongst the general public and gain admiration and respect from fellow writers.  Success within these circles requires extreme levels of merit, however Lope de Vega has organised a public competition, in honor of San Isidro, so that novice poets can rub shoulders with the greats and perhaps even earn a place amongst them.<br/><br/>In El Soneto players take the role of these novice poets who aspire to win Lope de Vega&rsquo;s competition. In order to do this, each player must choose letter cards that are displayed within the famous gossip mills of Madrid, and with them they must create words for three rounds whilst respecting the grammatical rules that each of these rounds permits. Prestige will be given in a number of ways to players for their words: direct points for the number of letter cards used; favor of the benefactors if the word begins with one of the three letters that the benefactors have asked for; support of the writers if the word has employed one or more of the permitted literary devices; or they can advance on the Soneto marker if their words rhyme.<br/><br/>The literati and the benefactors that each player has earned throughout the game will be awarded additional prestige points at the end, in addition to the level reached on the rhyme marker. He who achieves the most prestige points is declared the winner of the competition.<br/><br/>Description in Spanish:<br/>En su Viaje al Parnaso, adem&aacute;s de a Lope de Vega, Quevedo o G&oacute;ngora, Miguel de Cervantes fue reclutando a otros muchos literatos para luchar contra los malos poetas; &iquest;te habr&iacute;a gustado formar parte de semejante grupo?

Vigilante brings social deduction, action management, and tableau-building into a unique combination that leaves you with many different paths to take to accomplish your goals, new strategies and synergies between heroes, and a lot of tension!<br/><br/>There are a variety of scenarios (game modes) depending on player preferences. The game plays in rounds, where players have 4 actions to either fight (and imprison) villains, recruit new heroes, search for equipment and other helpful cards, or heal. Afterwards, players secretly roll their dice and contribute one of them, which sometimes will help the group but usually hinders them.<br/><br/>In Brought to Justice, each player gets a secret role. 'Good' players represent the majority and must imprison 7 villains per good player before the end of the game (i.e. if there are 2 Good players, they need a combined total of 14). 'Evil' players are trying to foil their plans, and Neutral players have independent missions which generally throw a little chaos into the mix.<br/><br/>Shifting Allegiances takes Brought to Justice and creates even more uncertainty by only guaranteeing one 'Good' player, while the rest of the mix could be any combination of 'Good', 'Evil', or 'Neutral' players. Even though there's a possibility that all players are good, it will take time to gain each other's trust, and you could end up sabotaging your own victory!<br/><br/>",

Players each add the same tile to the grid each turn, slowly creating (if all goes well) a winding labyrinth inside the pyramid. When a player places a tile that shows one or more scarabs on it, he can choose to place a treasure marker on one or more scarabs. By the time that the third tile is placed, each player must decide which entrance to the pyramid his figure will take.<br/><br/>The game ends once the 5x5 grid is filled. Each player counts the length of the corridor that extends from his starting point, scoring one point for each space in this path. In addition, the player scores two points for each treasure that's surrounded by four walls as long as at least one of those walls abuts the corridor walked by the graverobber. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Das Labyrinth des Pharao includes rules for solo play as well as an advanced variant in which treasures are worth 1-3 points depending on their color, with this point value then multiplied by 1-4 depending on where its shared wall meets the corridor. The deeper the treasure along the path, the more points it's worth.<br/><br/>",

Always seeking new thrills and challenges, he decides to organize an unforgettable event during the &quot;Fiesta Nacional&quot;, a competition open to all wannabe-chefs in the world to cook for him the most intense hot sauce possible! Whoever wins the contest will receive enough money to open their own restaurant!<br/><br/>In order to be able to cook their sauce, though, the participants in Buurn have to get the best ingredients in ruthless auctions called &quot;top-downs&quot;. Cooks will collect different ingredients sold at these auctions to create the hottest sauce ever created. Everything is allowed in this savage contest! Trying to obtain the best ingredients by being friends with the organization or even stealing ingredients from your rivals are classic ways to win the prize!<br/><br/>At the end of the contest, El Gobernador's jury will taste all the hot sauces, then assign victory points to each cook, based on the type of ingredients they used and the bonuses they obtained. The one who receives the most points wins the competition and their very own restaurant, paid by El Gobernador!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If you decide to play Reglamentacja: Gra na Kartki (&quot;Rationing: The Card Game&quot;), a difficult task awaits you. You will be going back to the Communist era during the winter of 1983 to fight for ration cards for meat, sugar and other goods. Your goal is to buy the goods on your shopping list before your guests arrive.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the goods in stores are rationed, and the number and kind of ration cards distributed rarely corresponds with what you need. Instead those cards might land in the hands of other players. You soon realize that success depends on how clever and smooth you are in exchanging ration cards with players standing in the same queue &mdash; but you need to hurry as the clerk will finish her tea in just one minute and start selling the goods.<br/><br/>As with all IPN publications, Reglamentacja: Gra na Kartki was created as an educational tool to remind the world of why the Communist economy fell. The richly illustrated booklet includes a historic overview of the last decade of Communism in Poland and the principles of distribution of controlled goods.<br/><br/>",

Peace is a service that can be bought...for tribute to the Assyrian King&quot;.<br/><br/>The Assyrians were the innovators of siege warfare. All siege techniques like rams, towers, undermining city walls have been developed to mastery by the Assyrians. Typical Assyrian is the shield bearer with oversize shields protecting the masses of bowmen from enemy fire.<br/><br/>Set in ancient Mesopotamia, Assyrian Wars (722 to 605 BC) covers the ruler period of the last four great Assyrian Kings and the decline and fall period resulting in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the defeat of their Egyptian Allies.<br/><br/>In 722 BC, Sargon II becomes King in Nineveh as new &quot;King of the World&quot;. A couple of problems threaten the strongest and most effective Army the world has seen so far.<br/><br/>In the West an Assyrian Army is inflicting a hunger siege on Samaria in Israel. Will the Egyptian Pharaoh interfere?<br/><br/>In the North the rampaging Uratu Kingdom is threatening the Assyrian borders.<br/><br/>In the South Mardukkapallidin has become King of Babylonia. He started a revolt against Assyria, the mighty Elam in the Southeast joined him.<br/><br/>In the East the innumerable Mede tribes become a growing threat. The first signs of a large migration from the North consisting of Cimmerian and Scythian tribes become visible. And all those minor state tribute refusers who need to be punished!<br/><br/>Will you as the Assyrian King maintain your Empire? Or will you as Babylonia, Mede, Elam, or Egypt free the world from Assyrian Tyranny?<br/><br/>Assyrian Wars is a multi player game, but with the Assyrian player against all others. Temporary Alliance changes possible. Conflicting trade interests may cause minor conflicts.  It can, however, be played solitaire as well.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents the ruler period of one Assyrian King, the last turn decline and fall. Turns are divided into impulses. Follow the order of states on the impulse track each card played represents an impulse.<br/><br/>Assyrian Wars is a point to point game.  Assyrian Wars gives an easy entry for beginners.  Still the game provides complex games situations depending on players strategy. Every game is different for nobody knows which random cards a player gets in addition to his fixed home cards.<br/><br/>For the experienced players there are challenging specials like Heavy Infantry, Light Infantry, Bowmen, Heavy Cavalry, Light Cavalry, Horsebowmen, and Chariots.<br/><br/>Assyrian Wars allows detailed siege warfare. 66 cities on the map are waiting for you to take them. Can you overcome the massive city walls and water your horses at the Rivers of Babylon? The decision is yours to make.<br/><br/>",

Should the Axis player assign his few support assets to his best divisions to form powerful strike groups, or should he use them to augment his light units desperately defending the ridges?<br/>Patton&rsquo;s First Victory portrays all the elements of the actual campaign. The terrain is historically accurate; every town and airbase is precisely correct, and every unit is rated with precise combat factors. You will see why the 10th Panzer Division was so formidable, and how Patton was able to defeat the vestige of the famed Afrikakorps.<br/>The entire Tunisian campaign can be played in a couple hours, yet Patton&rsquo;s First Victory remains a game requiring operational skill. The Allied player must maintain the momentum and keep pressure on the Axis, fighting for a breakthrough to capture enough of the important Tunisian harbors to win the game. The Axis player must manage his scant yet potent army and air force to repel the attacking Allies, all the while watching for opportunities to counterattack and throw the throw them back in disarray.<br/>Patton&rsquo;s First Victory is a quick and easy game of the 1943 campaign between Allied and Axis forces in North Africa during World War II. It&rsquo;s spring 1943; the Allies have arrived to liberate Tunisia from the Axis, but the Axis soldiers are experienced and commanded by some of the best generals of the war. If Axis forces can hold on in the Tunisian mountains, they can delay the progress of the war in the west indefinitely. If the Allies can capture the Tunisian harbors, they will cut off the Axis from all supply and escape.<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>17 x 22 (43 x 56 cm) terrain map<br/>114 die-cut counters<br/>One Rules booklet for this series<br/><br/>",

Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.<br/><br/>More specifically, Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.<br/><br/>Yomi Starter Set: Grave versus Jaina features two character decks, allowing players to face off immediately.

After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card.

If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.<br/>     Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck.

While the universe expands, you can also cause orbits, eclipses, hyperspace, or even the mysterious and almost unknown dark energy. Your goal? Align celestial bodies while a cosmic clock is ticking the passing of time&hellip;in millions of years!<br/><br/>In more detail, the game is composed by hexagonal pieces: 48 celestial bodies of four types (planets, stars, asteroids and comets), with four colors (yellow, orange, red and blue) and three backgrounds (empty space, stars and galaxy). There are astronomical phenomena pieces (supernova, black hole and wormholes) and special actions (orbit, eclipse, hyperspace and dark energy). Finally, a cosmic clock will tick the passing of time and players' turn.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, each player takes two hidden objective cards: a celestial body type and a color. During the game, the player scores victory points by aligning three or more celestial bodies consecutively of their own type or color.<br/><br/>The game starts at moment zero of the universe 13.7 billion years ago, with someone placing the first piece: the Big Bang! On a turn, the player has to place one of the four available pieces below the cosmic clock. Two rules are mandatory to place a piece in the universe:<br/><br/><br/>    The piece must be adjacent to at least two pieces and at least one of them has to be a celestial body.<br/>    The celestial body has to have a common characteristic with all the adjacent celestial bodies: same type, same color, or same background.<br/><br/><br/>Once the game runs out of available pieces and all of them are placed in the universe, the game ends. The players reveal their objective cards and count their victory points based on the alignments according to their two objective cards. Whoever has the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player who is the most behind on the cosmic clock &mdash; that is, the one who has invested fewer millions of years &mdash; wins.<br/><br/>",

So getting it correct early scores you loads, getting it late scores the Reader loads. The board has a scoring track and there is an element of beating the Guesser too.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grab your capes and party hats, &rsquo;cause we&rsquo;re going to Gielinor! RuneScape Kingdoms: Shadow of Elvarg is a cooperative campaign board game inspired by the record-breaking video game universe with over 280 million registered users worldwide.<br/><br/>Gather your group of 1-5 players and step into a sometimes epic, often irreverent fantasy world where your goal is simple: Become the wealthiest, most skilled, best-geared adventurer there is! Or, just enough of all three to succeed together. Or spend the whole time collecting eggs and let your friends do all the work. It&rsquo;s cooperative, after all! (Still, who doesn&rsquo;t enjoy a little friendly competition?)<br/><br/>Either way, Gielinor needs capable folk to help its inhabitants and keep monsters and nefarious cults at bay, and that&rsquo;s where your group steps in. One minute you&rsquo;re slaying a vampyre that&rsquo;s been terrorising a village. The next, you&rsquo;re helping Gertrude find her beloved cat!<br/><br/>Like chapters in a book, your tabletop adventure is split into campaigns, each one inspired by an iconic boss quest from the video games. Campaigns are made up of two phases:<br/><br/>First is the exploration phase, where you&rsquo;ll explore the kingdoms of Asgarnia and Misthalin from above on a game board styled like a fast-travel map. Every location gives you different things to do &mdash; whether that&rsquo;s gathering and sharing resources, levelling up skills, or drawing from the exploration deck for that region to see what unexpected thing you&rsquo;ll need to handle next!<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t get too distracted, though: The exploration phase has set quests you&rsquo;ll need to complete to keep your group moving forward. Spend too long gathering cabbages or engaging in goblin diplomacy, and the escalation track will rise, making the world around you more dangerous until you finally take on the boss&hellip;<br/><br/>&hellip;in the boss phase! Here, you&rsquo;ll zoom in for face-to-face fights on dedicated game boards that bring the bosses &mdash; and their environments &mdash; to life!<br/><br/>The story woven through the campaigns will immerse you in the fantasy world of RuneScape, while the optional side quests, exploration decks, vault deck, and event deck will change your experience each time you play. And because it&rsquo;s an open world, you can play your way!<br/><br/>Even your adventurer starts as a blank slate. There are no fixed classes in this game! You choose what skills to max and what gear to craft. Use those skills and gear to pass tests and complete quests to help your group win the day, then take what you&rsquo;ve learned and earned on to the next campaign. Gain XP (even when you fail!) and rewards, and level up to earn your all-important cape!<br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s not all capes and capers. At the end of every campaign waits a boss that&rsquo;ll take all the skills of your group &mdash; yes, even cooking &mdash; to defeat. Pulled into face-to-face combat on unfamiliar terrain, your group&rsquo;s shared health pool is all that stands between you and Death (and he wouldn&rsquo;t be pleased to see you!). Roll the dice on your melee, defence, and magic to strike, protect yourself, and push the boss back. Use your wits to plan ahead and influence the flow of combat to throw the boss off balance. And don&rsquo;t expect them to take your onslaught lying down. They, too, have ways to keep you on your toes&hellip;<br/><br/>",

MLB takes you to the front lines in both historical and hypothetical conflicts ranging from the Arab-Israeli Wars to the present day.<br/><br/>This new game features armor, infantry and artillery vehicles from 7 different nations: USA, USSR, UK, China, Israel, Insurgent, and Arabian Multinational. This gives you the forces you need to play out battles during the Cold War, Six-Day War, Iran-Iraq War, Vietnam War, Lebanon War, Yom Kippur War, Falkland Islands War, and Gulf War.<br/><br/>The game system maximizes player decision making to make every turn exciting. At the start of the game, you get to select a nation's ground forces to command. Then, you get to select the specific armor, infantry, and artillery forces that you think is the best battle force. Once selected, you'll get to battle the forces selected by the other players in order to capture and secure vital objectives!<br/><br/>",

After 'The Little Prince' comes this year's The Little Ghost, based on the book by Otfried Preussler. The game picks up the storyline about the players, on the stroke of midnight, spending the witching hour flitting through the dark halls of Castle Eulenstein with the little ghost. Whenever the great clock in the city hall marks the passing of another hour, a picture shows up in one of the viewing windows. Whatever is shown on the picture is what the children must now find behind the closed doors of the castle. They accomplish this with the help of a mysterious magnetic set of keys that, as if through the hand of a ghost, opens the doors of the old castle. For each correctly-opened door one receives a gleaming cannonball. How many of these balls will be required for victory is decided only by the final dexterity game in the knight's hall.<br/><br/>Ages 5 and up<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As legendary warlords meeting in the fabled arena of Ortus to decide who is superior, both players command a band of handpicked warriors, all schooled in one of the prime elements. The Ortus arena is believed to be the origin of all things, the place where the prime elements were fed with the raw energies to shape the world as we know it. How true this is can be debated, but this is the only place where energy still flows freely in its purest form. Players must harvest these energies and channel them to their warriors as fast and unpredictable Wind warriors, clever positioning of supporting Fire warriors, and devastating blows from lethal Water warriors will all be necessary to claim victory.<br/><br/>Ortus takes place on a hexagonal board, with each player starting with eight warriors (two of each element) on the back row (the &quot;Haven&quot;) in an order of their choice. Ortus is played in rounds, which each consist of four stages:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect energy: Each warrior on an energy well generates energy, which flows into the player's general pool.<br/>     Maneuver warriors: Players can spend 1 energy per hex to move warriors to better locations or attack opposing warriors.<br/>     Return the fallen: When the active player returns his fallen warriors to his Haven, his turn ends.<br/>     Defend: Energy remaining from the maneuver phase can be used to defend warriors against incoming attacks; more specifically, each attack has a certain power, and if the defender is unable or unwilling to pay energy equal to this power, the warrior falls.<br/><br/><br/>When a player occupies five energy wells at the start of his turn or has removed all eight opposing warriors, he wins.<br/><br/>Ortus has a gentle learning curve, starting with the Basic game, which can be taught in around eight minutes. From there, players can introduce the special rules for each of the elemental warriors one at a time to learn the full Advanced game. Each warrior has two unique skills that differentiate it from the others. Being able to move all of your warriors on the board gives an enormous amount of tactical options. The excitement of the game lies in the careful planning of your attacks, knowing when to advance and when to withhold Energy as well as knowing whether to save or sacrifice your warriors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "publisher's description<br/><br/>Breaking the Chains (BtC) simulates a hypothetical future military conflict over the South China and East China Seas around the year 2021. Conflicting claims of sovereignty have roiled those &quot;near seas&quot; since the Cold War. After decades of patient diplomacy, Beijing's new navy could offer military options for finally asserting sovereignty over prizes within the First Island Chain - that string of islands which runs from the Ryukus south through Taiwan, the Philippines and then curls back to the mainland via Malaysia. BtC presumes that China comes to blows with a Southeast Asian country in a conflict that could expand to possibly include: Australia, India, Japan, the United States as well as a variety of Southeast Asian nations. However, beyond China and one South East Asian nation, the exact composition of opposing coalitions is not predetermined but rather a function of the decisions players make as the game unfolds.<br/><br/>Two or more people play BtC with two reference cards, dice, and about 350 counters on a 22&quot; X 34&quot; map where each hex spans about 70 nautical miles (80 land miles) and each turn represents one day of real time. Players alternate maneuvering air, ground and naval units for up to 14 nations to resolve battles with a universal &quot;strike&quot; mechanism that applies across all types of combat; missile defense capabilities are central to survival. Air units represent from 30-90 aircraft each, most ground units are regiments, and naval units are small groups of surface ships/submarines or individual aircraft carriers. Specialized chit play simulates black ops, cyber warfare and various political developments.<br/><br/>BtC is solitaire friendly. The naval operations which dominate play are based on a roll-to-evade model rather than search-to-find model. That means, owing to a battle space awash in electromagnetic emissions, enemy positions - except for motionless submarines - are assumed to be known unless a last-minute dice roll determines a potential target has evaded detection. So there is no &acirc;hidden movement&acirc; to stifle solitaire play; and the &acirc;hidden placement&acirc; of submarines can be forgone. Finally, the special chits that govern black ops can be played at random to further enable solo game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Korona (Finl.) and Couronne (occasionally also Koronn, Swe.) is versions (with very minor differences) of Carrom played in Finland and Sweden and to some extent in the other Nordic countries. The game is considered to have evolved from American Carrom early in the 20th century.<br/><br/>As early as the 1930's regular competitons were held at famous departement store Nordiska Kompaniet (NK) in Stockholm, but since the war (WWII) no Couronne contests took place until they were revived in early 21st century in the Swedish provinces of Scania and J&auml;mtland. The former being student activities (often at Blekinge nation - a student organisation with very old roots); the latter being an un-official world championship.<br/><br/>Like in Carrom, there is a wooden square shaped board usually less than 1 meters wide. The idea of the game is to hit small round pieces with a bigger piece into corner pockets. In this Nordic version you use cue sticks to hit the big stone instead of using your finger which makes Korona / Couronne even more similar to billiards than the Carrom.<br/><br/>The pockets are typically larger than in Carrom but there's some space between the pockets and the edge of the board. Therefore it's possible for a piece to go behind the pocket which can sometimes cause some extra trouble.<br/><br/>In Finnish Korona, during the setup, the pieces of each player are placed in a tight row against the wall on the opposing side of the board instead of a pattern in the center. There's no bonus pieces in this game. Because all the pieces are separated according to their color, it's possible for a skillful player to put all the pieces in a pocket with only one strike.<br/><br/>Each player in a three or four player game may play with their own colors instead of forming teams with opposing players.<br/><br/>The Swedish version Couronne is similar in that it typically has space behind the pockets and uses cue sticks, but the pieces (usually 15 of each colour) are initially placed in the middle.<br/><br/>Minikorona is a space-saving version of this game.<br/><br/>H-ring spel is a Dutch version that has similarities to this game.<br/><br/>",

In addition to building new tunnels, you'll play cards to give yourself equipment, place monsters in front of others, discover who's actually on your clan, and reveal the exit before trudging all the way there. As soon as you leave the mine, you reveal your true identity, with any gold you have going toward your clan's total.

Using special class skills, unique weapons, and a few items, you must work together to defeat monsters intent on destroying the civilized world. This fully cooperative game will require your party to tactically dismantle each enemy in a different way before all of you are out of options. Whether casual or hardcore, Wrathborne Champions is the perfect game for all those brave enough to face the monsters' wrath.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned a deck of cards comprised of their specific class abilities, a series of attacks specific to the weapon they are using this game, and a few personally selected items. These decks control not only the moves available to players, but also their life total, with damage being applied directly to the deck itself.<br/><br/>Player fight against one or more giant monsters printed on 10x10 miniboards placed in the center of the play area. Unlike most &quot;big bad&quot; games, the Monster Cards in Wrathborne Champions have set attacks and actions performed each round. This &quot;AI code&quot; lets players predict a great deal of how the monsters will act, allowing them to make tactical choices during their turns to increase the likelihood of success.<br/><br/>",

Players each start with three cards in hand, and the overall goal of the game is to collect 3-6 goal cards, with the exact number possibly changing during play.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws one card, plays one card, then moves one space, with all of those values being subject to change during gameplay; depending on what's currently allowed by the rules, you can also use movement points to rotate or move tiles in the play area. If you have a piece on each icon shown on the topmost goal card in play, you claim that card and are that much closer to winning. Players can also claim goal cards they have in hand by, again, placing their pieces on the appropriate icons. Other cards in the game allow players to change the rules, the game board, the ownership of player pieces, and so on.<br/><br/>",

Relieved, both of them laugh at each other after seeing that the sea lion doesn't have any feathers after all.<br/><br/>In Manimals, players compete to find as many animals as possible with a certain characteristic. To start play, shuffle the animal cards, then spread forty of them on the table so that everyone can see them. Flip over one card, see the characteristic identified on this card, then race to pick up all animals that feature this characteristic. Once everyone has finished picking up cards, check all the cards collected to see whether anyone made a mistake; if so, that player must return the mistaken card and one correctly collected card.<br/><br/>Players repeat this process six more times, first laying out three more cards from the deck each time, then they see who has collected the most cards and won!<br/><br/>Manimals includes rule variants that allow for play with children as young as four.<br/><br/>",

Game marker placement is shown on the game board. Command orders and cards are used to shorten the rules. Developed for solitaire play, this game requires you to make great decisions based on good strategy, keeping your wits about you when orders do not turn out well, and pressing on to victory.<br/><br/>Game play is centered around using Field Commands to issue orders by the Athenian and Syracusan commanders to defeat each other. Either side can be defeated by their morale falling too low. The game allows you to play either side against a solitaire opponent that has 3 levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>Pick the side you want to be, Athenian or Syracusan, and then shuffle the solitaire card deck for your opponent. The card mix used by the solitaire opponent differs from game to game so no two games play alike.<br/><br/>Each commander (solitaire or player) can issue one order per game turn from their Commands available.  Your order is carried out based on your strategy and current situation faced.  Your choice can cause multiple actions and reactions with results that cause troop eliminations, morale reductions, and events to occur.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN THE GAME<br/><br/>Any time one side's morale reaches zero during a turn, the other side wins the game.<br/><br/>Each game includes:<br/>    Box<br/>    Hard Mounted Game Board<br/>    2 sets of troop markers (one set per army)<br/>    2 sets of solitaire cards (one set per army)*Only 1 set of solitaire cards in 414BC Syracuse<br/>    Command Decision Cards<br/>    2 Field Order Books (one per army)<br/>    Rule Book<br/>    Custom plastic storage tray<br/>    Dice<br/><br/>Complexity: 3 of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 10 of 10<br/>Playing Time: 30 to 60 minutes<br/>Players: 1-2<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PASS is a ladder-climbing game in which each cards has a potentially upgraded side with another value.  Players may pass their turn to take a PASS token and use it in a later round to turn a card to its upgraded side.<br/><br/>More specifically, cards are dual-indexed, with different values on each half of the card, with the 65 cards having possible combinations of the numbers A-K.  During set-up, the cards is shuffled and dealt into decks.  Each deck will have exactly 13 cards. Players randomly choose a deck as their hands. Whoever has the card &quot;START 2&quot; will be the first player to play a set of card(s).<br/><br/>During their turn, the active player takes one of two actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Play: The active player chooses card(s) in their hand that comply with a type of defined set in the game, and then plays this set of cards to the table.  A player can only choose to play if i) the table is empty (as if he/she is the first to play) or ii) the played set is ranked higher than the set currently on the table.  A set is considered to outrank previously played set if it were a same type of set with higher value.  A player may also outrank the previously played set with a same type of set having the same value by exhausting one PASS token.  The next player may do the same, however, by exhausting even one more PASS token.<br/>     Pass: The active player takes a PASS token.  The pass token can be used in a future turn to augment a played set, or to turn one of the cards in a played set to its upgraded side.<br/><br/><br/>The plays who plays all his/her hand first will gain a victory token and all cards will be reshuffled and dealt again.  Whoever has 3 victory tokens first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each round consists of four phases during which players will take turns bidding on caravans, influence, and customers; collecting goods from caravans; trading and negotiating with each other to collect sets of goods; and selling their goods for maximum profit. Goods are divided into five categories, with five different items in each category. Players can see which categories of goods their opponents are holding by the symbols on the backs of the cards, but do not know the specific item the cards represent in those categories.<br/><br/>This isn't your typical trading game and player interaction can get raucous and intense as players get creative with their haggling!

        "description": "7 is a simple war game for two players based on the mechanics used in the boardgames 111: Alarm dla Warszawy and 303. The game takes us back in time to the Polish-Soviet war in 1920. One of the players is the commander of the 7th Fighter Escadrille &bdquo;Tadeusz Kościuszko&rdquo; (combined mostly by American pilots) defending Lwow during the Battle of Lvov in the middle of August 1920. Polish player has access to three Ansaldos A-1 &bdquo;Balilla&rdquo; fighters trying to push back waves of Soviet cavalry. He uses special dice to attack soviet units and bombs that he can refill in three airbases. Every time the cavalry is hit the unit spreads and loses turn. Soviet player is the commander of 1st Cavalry Army, he uses ten cavalry units to reach his goal of taking Lvov and spreading the communism throughout Poland and then as the next step whole Europe. The cavalry has limited options of attacking aircraft although by using on movement he can defend during the attack and fire one shot at attacking Polish fighters, with a little bit of luck he can even destroy it. Polish Air Forces mission is to defend Lvov  by delaying the attacks of cavalry till the end of  18th August when the Soviet Army decides to withdraw and continue their attack towards Warsaw. The game ends when the Soviets are out of time or they managed to capture Lvov. The name of the game &ldquo;7&rdquo; evokes one of the escadrilles, which pilots where mostly American airmen, lead by Merian C. Cooper&mdash;the man who later created the iconic &quot;King Kong&quot; movie&mdash;volunteering to serve and protect Poland during the Soviet war. This makes &ldquo;7&rdquo; the prequel of 111 and 303, showing the beginning of Polish Air Forces.<br/><br/>The game includes two variants: basic game and additional rules for intermediate and advanced players, allowing tallying of points and comparing scores.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Justinian is a strategic level board-wargame game set in the early 6th century, after the collapse of the Western Roman Empire and the burgeoning of the Byzantine Eastern Roman Empire.  The Byzantine Emperor, Justinian I, has started his reconquest of the Western Roman Empire, and the game attempts to simulate his endeavor for players to emulate.<br/><br/>One player takes on Justinian's role, the other coordinates the Barbarian faction (basically the non-Byzantines); the designer also said the game can be played solitaire.  The two factions' design are asymmetrical.  Each turn, the Byzantine has to manage its finances, gaining income by taxing its controlled provinces and spending the money to raise and maintain its armies.  Then the Barbarian and Byzantine factions alternate with each other to take actions (one at a time).  They can raise more armies, move the troops, or do nothing.  Whereas the extent of the Byzantine faction's orders are certainties, most of the Barbarian faction's are random; i.e. dice rolls sometimes determine how many armies join the Barbarians and whether these armies join the Byzantines instead.  Both sides conquer territories by moving their armies into the lands.  If two armies meet, combat occurs, which is resolved by dice rolls and cross checking the results with tables.  The game features mutinies, naval actions, and random events.  The latter throws up revolts, removal of generals and plagues.<br/><br/>The game ends after 10 turns or after a second plague has erupted.  The Byzantine faction has to control a certain majority of the empire by that time to win.  The game also ends if the reconquest was accomplished much earlier.  If the Byzantine faction is unable to win when the game ends, the Barbarian faction is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>JUSTINIAN is a game covering the reconquest of the Roman Empire by Justinian I, Emperor of Eastern Rome (Byzantium). Justinian&rsquo;s reign represents Byzantium&rsquo;s high water mark; his conquest of lands is exceeded in Roman history only by that of Augustus and Trajan.<br/><br/>Players. The game may be played by two players, or solitaire.[...]<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

On 21st July 1944 the Americans would return to retake the island and drive the Japanese invaders off; a day that is still celebrated as 'Liberation Day'.<br/><br/>There were many reasons why the Americans decided to invade Guam not least of which was the fact that the station of the trans-Pacific cable and the naval radio station at Agana made it a focal point of the communication network in the Pacific. It also had the best anchorage in the Marianas, 2 airstrips and, of course, it was an American Protectorate.<br/><br/>The only beaches suitable for an invasion are located on the south-western side of the island. The Japanese knew this as well and had prepared accordingly. Another thing unique to the planning was that the 2 landing beaches chosen would be 7 miles apart. It was unprecedented for two landing forces to land with such a wide separation.<br/><br/>Guam &ndash; Return to Glory will be the second game to utilize the Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 4 maps.<br/><br/>The game will come with 6 scenarios and 1 campaign game:<br/><br/>W-Day &ndash; Fortune favors the bold &ndash; This is the first day of the Invasion on the northern beaches. 3rd Marine Division must land against Japanese defenders dug-in on a ridge overlooking the beaches.

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade must land and fight their way north towards Orote Peninsular to join up the to beachheads. Single map and 8 turns long.<br/><br/>W-DAY - This is the first day of the Invasion on the both beaches. The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade must land and fight their way north, whilst the 3rd Marines fight their way south and the two forces try to join up the two beachheads near Orote Peninsular. Two maps and 8 turns long.<br/><br/>Orote Peninsular &ndash; The first 8 days of the fighting saw the Americans expand their beachheads and join up so as to cut off the Orote peninsular with it's important airfield. Once it was cut off, the Americans, then, had to force their way into the heaviest defended area on Guam not knowing that the Japanese were preparing a Sake fueled Banzai charge. Two maps and 72 turns long.<br/><br/>Into the Jungle - This scenario covers 3rd Marine Division's drive north of the beachheads to take the town of Agana and the airfield at Tiyan. One map and 27 turns long.<br/><br/>Santa Rosa - This scenario covers 77th Infantry Division's attack to isolate the area around Mount Santa Rosa . One map and 27 turns long.<br/><br/>The Battle for Guam &ndash; The full historical campaign from 21st July- 10th August (188 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Guam in 1944, from the first invasion at Asan, in the north, and Agat, in the south through the vicious fighting in the thick vegetation at the south end of the island and the final Japanese stand in the north.<br/><br/>Complexity: 6<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability:8<br/><br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 hours<br/><br/>Map Scale: 1 hex = 500 meters<br/><br/>Unit Scale: Companies and below<br/><br/>Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 4 players as well as solitaire<br/><br/>Playing Time: 2-35 hours<br/><br/>Series Designer: Adam Starkweather<br/><br/>Game Designer: Ross Mortell<br/><br/>Developer: Adam Starkweather<br/><br/>Artist: Antonio Pinar Pe&ntilde;a<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>4 maps<br/><br/>6 countersheets<br/><br/>1 series Rulesbook<br/><br/>1 game specific rulesbook<br/><br/>7 player aids, charts, tables cards<br/><br/>2 ten-sided dice<br/><br/>1 Box and Lid set<br/><br/>",

Each player has a unique set of campaign cards generating movement, combat bonuses, historical events, and reinforcements. Playing the right card at the right time lets one side concentrate the forces needed to win that great victory against all odds, or perhaps go down to inglorious defeat.

Each player or team uses its own set of drawings, and the goal is to find as much stuff as possible in the drawing being used by each player &mdash; but first you need to know which stuff to find!<br/><br/>The game includes rules for three levels of players, depending on their ages. In level one, players look for items in one of thirteen categories, with the category being chosen by the spinner included in the game. Sample categories include something edible, something made of wood, something fragile, and something round. One player flips the sand timer, then everyone tries to find matching items in the drawing, covering those items with colored tokens. After time runs out, everyone reveals their answers, and for each correct answer, the player places one of her tokens in the center of the table. Players then choose a new drawing, each using the same one, and start a new round. The first player to get rid of all of her tokens wins.<br/><br/>In level two, players use the letters on the spinner (instead of the categories) and now look for items that start with the chosen letter. Otherwise gameplay is the same, with players trying to rid themselves of tokens.<br/><br/>In level three, players choose a letter, then write down answers that they find in the drawing. Each player scores one point for an answer that someone else also found and three points for an answer found only by her. Whoever has the most points after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

The new vacancy could be really appealing, but only one person will be needed to fill the position of the deceased superintendent. It is the best time for a secret confrontation to begin. In Ucho Kr&oacute;la (a.k.a. King's Ear), the deceitful courtiers will do everything they can to pin back their competitor's ears and improve their position in the eyes of the King. No holds barred! Each struck at opponent's delicate place, every plot and prompt to the right ears will bring you closer to the coveted goal. Every sarcasm, irony or cutting retort to someone's machinations should cut like a rapier to pave the way to even bigger riches. The title of superintendent will provide unlimited access to the King's treasury from which something may disappear...not only for satisfying the King's needs.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to get most prestige points by weaving intrigues, ruining the authorities of other players and demonstrating tact and good manners.<br/><br/>",

You learn to fly the great airplanes of the period much in the same way the Aces did &ndash; rig in the cockpit using control stick, throttle and rudder pedals.  Each kind of warplane included in the game has been carefully researched to present the same strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncrasies it demonstrated in real life.  Once you have learned the tricks of your aircraft, you can dare to risk all in a dogfight.  Air combat is conducted in a series of maneuvers as each pilot tries to position his plane for the killing run.  With experience, new and more complicated maneuvers become available so that the ace can barrel roll and loop rings around the novice.  Your success will depend upon your ability to master your plane and to exploit the weaknesses of your enemy's.<br/><br/>Some Features:<br/>- Your Abilities to improve with experience, An Ace can react quicker, aim his gunfire more accurately, and undertake more complicated maneuvers than a novice can.<br/><br/>- Each kind of airplane in the game has been designed to perform just like its real-life counterpart.  Rates of climb and dive, maximum and stall speeds, and turning abilities all compare favorably with test flight results.<br/><br/>-You guide your airplane on the gameboard using real controls.  You adjust speed with the control stick and the rates of dive and climb with the throttle.<br/><br/>- Special attention was directed, during the design, to develop a simple method of allowing one plane to tail another.  The reflexes of both airplane and pilot are a crucial factor in this procedure.<br/><br/>- With the wide choice of airplanes included, a practically unlimited variety of dogfights may be staged.  Many of the greatest warplanes are there the Sopwith Camel, SE 5a, SPAD, Nieuport, Bristol Fighter, Fokker Triplane, Fokker DVII, Albatros, Pfalz, Roland and more.<br/><br/>- Special solitaire scenarios have been created to restage attacks against Zeppelin airships and two-seater warplanes.<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>Each game contains:<br/>- A 22&rdquo;x32&rdquo; full-color gameboard depicting a section of trenchline on the Western Front.  Actual battlefield photographs were consulted during the construction.<br/>- Hundreds f die-cut playing pieces representing all of the airplanes and various markers needed for record-keeping.<br/>- Six sets of maneuver cards.  Each card contains a diagram of a specific maneuver just as it was actually flown.<br/>- A set of Airplane Performance Cards.  A different card has been prepared for each airplane.<br/>- Three six-sided dice<br/><br/>",

It is a set building game, normally played with four people in two teams.  It typically uses four or five regular poker decks including the jokers.  Each player starts with two piles of eleven cards.  One pile is their hand, the other, their foot.  The players draw two cards a turn, playing some if they choose and then discarding one at the end of each of their turns, except if they want to go out, when they will have to play every card.  Once a player has played all the cards in their hand they will pick up their foot.  Sets are comprised of 7 cards of the same number.  Sets may have wild cards in them, jokers and twos, but then the set is no longer clean, it would then be considered dirty.  A team needs two clean sets and two or three dirty sets to go out.<br/><br/>Hand and Foot is also commonly known as clean and dirty.<br/><br/>",

Variants for more are easily devised (last wizard standing, teams, etc.).<br/><br/>The two opponents perform 6 magical gestures with their hands to cast spells - each spell created by performing a specific sequence of gestures.  As gestures for the 2 hands are written secretly, then revealed simultaneously, there is ample ground for feinting - starting a sequence leading to a certain attack, then switching to a different sequence, hoping your opponent doesn't call your bluff.<br/><br/>The 40 different spells allow you to attack, defend, summon monsters, enchant your opponent (limit her play in different ways), and more.<br/><br/>To win, you need to make creative use of the many options, and keep an open eye towards your opponent's schemes.  This is a game of almost pure skill.<br/><br/>The inventor wishes to state that he has never been involved in a magical duel but would be interested to discover how realistic the game is for those who have been involved in such a bout.<br/><br/>",

(A player who earns too many points may also lose a life.) The game ends when one player has lost all of their lives.<br/><br/>The cards in the game are made up of 4 suits, and the point values range from 0 to 20 points.  The trump suit is referred to as the &quot;nightmare&quot;, and is determined by the suit of the first sluffed card (e.g. the suit of the card played the first time someone is not able to follow suit.)  The ranks and points of some cards of the &quot;nightmare&quot; suit will change.<br/><br/>Excerpt from the Developer's Message in the rulebook:<br/><br/>Somnia is a transcription of Mittlere Jass (aka Middler) and Molotov Jass, which are Swiss traditional trick-taking games. Mittlere Jass is for 3 players and Molotov Jass is for 4 players. Rules are quite close to original ones, while allocation of card points and card ranks are simplified, with a great help of fantastic art works and readable graphical design.<br/>The 2-player rules are our original variant, an homage to the traditions.<br/><br/>",

Each card represents a type of building that the players may add to their cities.<br/><br/>The active player rolls three dice, chooses one number to keep, then passes the remaining dice clockwise for other players to select. The active player may then negotiate with opponents to trade dice, in order to build up certain combinations of numbers, which represent different kinds of resources. These combinations are then spent to purchase cards to be added to the player's tableau.<br/><br/>The game ends either when one player reaches a total of 20 points or when the last &quot;Mercantile House&quot; card in the supply is purchased. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls one or more ships, each of which have a &quot;Ship Systems Display&quot; (a la Star Fleet Battles or Car Wars).  The game contains statistics for most major classes of ships from Destroyer to Battleship from 1901 through WWII for several navies worldwide.  Ships are moved in impulses and may fire one or more weapons each impulse.  Hits are determined by dice, followed by checking armor penetration (which falls off by range).  If a hit penetrates, random ship systems are destroyed (rolled on a Damage Allocation Table).  Victory is by scenario.<br/><br/>Battlewagon was originally released as a &quot;Pocket Game&quot; in 1981.  It was later released in a &quot;Folio&quot; Second Edition in 1984 with some development work.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a budding marine biologist, you&rsquo;ve traveled across the globe exploring the hidden wonders of the underwater world.  It&rsquo;s been your lifelong dream to study the vibrant ecosystems of the coral reef, and now you are about to start 3 days of uninterrupted underwater exploration!<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s only one problem, the day before you arrived, a typhoon hit the reef.  All you can see now is one tiny coral, but hey&hellip;at least it&rsquo;s a start!  Most of the reef&rsquo;s residents seem to have sought safety from the crashing waves out in the Open Ocean. They are just waiting for the waters to calm before returning home.  Can you coax them back, and rebuild the reef into the vibrant ecosystem it once was?<br/><br/>Open Ocean is a card drafting and placement game for 1-5 players.<br/><br/>The goal is to create the highest scoring combination of colorful creatures in your Reef! Each turn Players:<br/><br/>PICK a card from their current hand<br/>PLAY the card they picked into their Reef<br/>PASS the remaining cards clockwise to the next player<br/><br/>Players are competing to collect creatures as they are passed around the table, and to attract additional creatures from the Ocean (as shared pool of cards in the center of the table)before their opponents do.<br/><br/>Players can use special cards to snag specific fish from the Ocean or an opponent&rsquo;s reef and turn the tides in their favor.<br/><br/>At the end of three rounds players score points and earn bonuses for the type and placement of creatures they collected over the course of the game. The player with the highest scoring reef wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designer Inc's latest video game title Black Souls has achieved international success! Hailed as one of the toughest digital games ever, it has attracted millions of hardcore gamers. The secret behind this huge success lies not in just making an extremely difficult game. Anyone can do that. The true challenge lies in balancing it to be as difficult as possible, but still fair enough that the very best players can survive to the end. Alas, the game studio is heavily short staffed and the management is looking to hire one more Game Designer for developing more content in Black Souls.<br/><br/>You have been given a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be hired by Designer Inc as a level designer, an integral part of Black Souls' development team! As one of the finalist candidates, you must prove your designing skills under the judging eyes of your future employers in an 'Early Beta Access' trial to create a level that best reflects the spirit of Black Souls - a very difficult, yet fair game. A group of seasoned playtesters will be sent to try out your carefully designed level, and provide feedback on whether they like or dislike it at the end of the run. If the level is too easy, they would not feel challenged at all. If it is too hard, they would all be killed and find it unfair. Who will be the final candidate to be inducted into the ranks of Designer Inc?<br/><br/>This is a uniquely themed game - A game about designing a game!<br/><br/>How To Play:<br/><br/>All players begin the game with the same mix of party, randomly generated from a deck of Party Cards. The game is split into two phases - The Design phase, followed by the Gameplay phase.<br/><br/>Place all tiles (also known as Assets) into the drawbag, then randomly take out an amount of Assets equal to the number of players and place them in the middle of the play area. This will be known as the Asset Pool. (Minimum Assets drawn from bag is 3, even if it is only 2 players)<br/><br/>Players then secretly select one of their 6 Bid Cards (valued 1 - 6) and reveal them at the same time. In descending order with highest bid value first, players take turns to pick an Asset from the Pool. Players must immediately place their newly acquired Assets onto their own individual player boards. They can choose to place the Asset on any of the 3 available levels. When placing on levels 1 and 3, the Asset must be placed in the leftmost empty space of that level. If the player decides to put it on level 2, the Asset must be placed in the rightmost empty space of that level.<br/><br/>On each Bid Card, there is also a secondary effect that will occur. Much of the game's strategies revolve around cleverly using these effects at the right time. The value 1 card allows a player to place a Tavern on the newly acquired Asset, while the value 2 card allows a player to immediately add 1 party member with the type based on a card draw from the Party deck. Value 3 allows one to take back all his previously played Bid Cards, including that card itself. When value 3 is played, all other players must place their newly acquired Asset face-down! Value 4 allows one to add one more Asset from the drawbag to the Pool when it is his turn to pick, and value 5 allows one to swap the positions of two previously placed Assets. Value 6 allows a player to place a Shrine on the newly acquired Asset. On a tie (more than 1 player playing the same value Bid Card), both players go last! (Even if they both played a 6) On top of that, their Bid Cards' secondary effects do not trigger too! Value 3's secondary ability will always trigger, even if tied.<br/><br/>All players do have a Hack skill they can each use twice per game, which allows them to avoid losing the effect of secondary abilities during ties as well as keeping their bid numbers instead of going last. Between the tied players, the play order follows the previous turn. If player A and B tied, and player B had her turn before A in the previous turn, she will continue to have her turn before A in this new turn. If players tie in the first turn of the game, the play order ascends from the youngest first.<br/><br/>It is important to note that Assets belong to three types - Cave, Dungeon, and Outdoor. Players will gain bonus points if they can chain and connect more Assets of the same type together.<br/><br/>After 12 turns of Design phase, all players' boards should be filled completely with 12 Assets each. The Gameplay phase will then begin. This is when all players' parties start from their leftmost Asset on the first level, and work their way forward until the last Asset on the rightmost space of level 3. All Assets in the game have 4 values - The first value shows how many fighters will die in that Asset, the second shows how many mages will die, the third shows how many healers will die and the fourth shows a rating of how difficult the Asset is. Players choose to resolve only ONE of the first three values.  Clever decision making is important to minimize death across the various classes in each party.<br/><br/>To win the game, you must ensure that your party survives throughout the entire level to the very end (yes, the same level you designed earlier) Then you will gain bonus points for your dungeon's difficulty, as well as for every 3 dead members. Hence, the best players are the ones who can design very difficult levels but still get their party to the end. It is VERY common for entire parties to be completely wiped out though - afterall, this is Black Souls!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players represent collectors attempting to gather sets of valuable properties and artifacts ... coins, antiques, miniatures, etc. These sets are worth handsome sums at game's end. Individual pieces of a set are worthless at game's end, but are able to be sold during the course of the game in order to provide a cash-flow.<br/><br/>These 'properties' are represented on cards. There are 12 different types of properties, varying from 3 - 6 pieces per set. Naturally, the sets containing six pieces are much more valuable than the sets containing only three pieces as it is much more difficult to complete these larger sets.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt six cards and given a starting 'fund' of $2,000. The top 'property' card is revealed and a bidding ensues. The winner pays the bank and takes the card into his hand. The player then has the option of selling 1 - 3 properties to the bank. The idea here is to rid yourself of properties that you do not wish to collect and provide a source of income.<br/><br/>There is danger, however. The sales price is determined randomly via the roll of two dice. The price can vary from 25% - 100% of the listed worth of the item. Further, if a '0' is rolled on one of the dice, then the item is NOT sold outright, but rather an auction takes place amongst the players. This can result in a substantially reduced price to the seller, or a higher price, depending upon the demand for the item. Further, it is quite possible that no one desires the item, so the seller must take the item back into his hand. There is also the possibility that the player will earn a $200 bonus if the proper digit is rolled on one of the dice.<br/><br/>When a property is sold, it is placed on the appropriate section of the 'board' - 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100% (there really isn't a board, just a card holder that indicates these sections). After a player sells properties, he may surrender one of the special 'buyer' cards and purchase from 1 - 3 cards from one of these markets. The player must pay the indicated price (based on the particular percentage market where the property is located) and take the property into his hand.<br/><br/>Again, there is a decision to be made here. Buyer cards are very valuable, as they can be used in a number of fashions:<br/><br/>1) Purchase properties, as described above;<br/><br/>2) Used as a 'wild' card to complete a set; or<br/><br/>3) Valued as $500.00 at the end of the game.<br/><br/>So, a player has to weigh the advantages of each of these options and play accordingly.<br/><br/>Buyer cards are purchases at auction in conjunction with a property card. When a Buyer card is revealed, another card is then revealed, and both cards are then auctioned together. The auction is a 'sealed' auction, however, so the stakes are often high as these cards carry tremendous advantages.<br/><br/>The game continues in this fashion until the property deck expires or a player calls an end to the game. One can only do this, however, if he has a total value (property sets plus cash) in excess of $5,000. Even then, a player should only do this when he feels he has more assets than any of his opponents.<br/><br/>As High Bid, this game was published for the 3M Bookshelf Series and 3M Gamette Series.<br/><br/>",

Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of where all the dice rolled are placed, and what they mean.  <br/><br/>     Enemy Contact- Your Squad encounters an obstacle or enemy that needs to be dealt with.<br/>     Salvage- Some of your Squad forages for supplies and ammo.<br/>     March- Your Squad moves along your path towards the next Check Point.<br/>     Stealth- Your Squad attempts to move slowly and avoid detection from an Enemy Contact.<br/>     Engage- Your Squad readies for combat! Lock and Load!<br/>     Command- Can be used as an additional die during each of the Salvage, March, Stealth and Combat phases. They can also be used to re-roll any single die on the Salvage, Combat, Injury, Recovery or Supply Shortage tables.<br/><br/><br/>The drama of the story unfolds by balancing the lives of your squad with the risks and combat you are willing to get into, as well as ensuring enough resources. Each turn brings you closer to the next checkpoint, where you will need to rest, restock, and heal up. The game ends by reaching the fourth Zone's Checkpoint where the extraction Chopper is waiting to take what's left of your squad back to safety. Victory conditions are calculated by a simple number of Squad members survived, or a slightly more involved scoring system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Results of the 2020 Solo PnP Design Contest for Get to da Choppa!<br/><br/>Best Overall Game: 19th<br/>Best Easy to Build Game: 9th<br/>Best Original Artwork: 10th<br/>Best Game Designed in Contest Timeframe: 5th <br/>Best New Solitaire Designer: 8th<br/>Best Push Your Luck/Survival: 3rd<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of Councilors on the Black Hole Council. Each Councilor has been paid off by shady organizations, and so has a secret agenda card they're trying to fulfill. During six negotiation rounds and three deductions rounds, players attempt to achieve their agenda and guess the goals of other players.<br/><br/>During negotiations, a leader chooses whether to settle, tax, mine, conquer, or &quot;black hole&quot; five different planets while the other Councilors attempt to influence the leader's decision. This happens while a two-minute sand timer is running, and after it runs out, all players except the leader vote on the proposal. If it passes, all players advance (or not) on the influence track, depending on how well they did during the negotiation.<br/><br/>During deduction rounds, players attempt to guess certain goals held by the other players. Correct guesses earn influence coins for you, while incorrect guesses earn coins for your opponent.<br/><br/>The more players can negotiate to achieve their agenda and deduce what other players' goals are, the more likely they are to advance on the influence track and become the new de facto ruler of the Council.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, priced slots in the center of the board are filled with the goods: these slots are emptied and filled as goods are bought as raw material and sold as finished goods.

If you&rsquo;re  just tuning in, my name is Johnny Atom-Bomb, your humble host broadcasting live from Old Line Radio, the Tri-State Wasteland&rsquo;s only radio station, excepting derelict government civil defense broadcasts or other dubious transmissions. The wasteland may not look like much, but she&rsquo;s all we got, and I&rsquo;m here to help you see another sunset.  So load your gun, turn up that dial, and stay tuned.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;Old Line Radio Opening Sign-on Announcement<br/><br/>The rules of TNT could be used for any post-apocalyptic world, but the official setting begins in the heart of the Tri-State Wasteland, a part of the old Mid-Atlantic States of Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia.  <br/>The core rules include, from website &quot;This is Not a Test uses 10-sided dice, referred to as D10 in the rules, and occasionally standard six-sided dice, labeled D6.<br/><br/>Two types of dice roll mechanics resolve all actions: Opposed and Stat tests.<br/><br/>Opposed tests are used for resolving direct actions between figures, mainly close combat. Both players roll a D10 and add the appropriate stat and any applicable modifiers. The highest score wins. Ties always go to the defender.<br/><br/>Stat tests are used when a figure is trying to accomplish an action, usually something unopposed by an enemy model.  Examples include opening a locked door or climbing a ledge. The player rolls a D10, adds the relevant stat and any applicable modifiers, and checks to see if he rolled equal to or higher than the required Target Number (TN).  The TN is specified by the type of action, as are the results of success or failure. Unless otherwise specified, all stat tests have a TN of 10. Specific types of tests are discussed further under stats.<br/><br/>Additionally, several dice conventions are used.<br/><br/>Critical Hit: A natural roll of 10 on the D10 indicates a lucky bonus.  Should a Critical be scored the player may roll a D6 and add the result to their original D10 roll.<br/><br/>Fumble: A natural roll of 1 is always bad, but does not result in any penalties.  However, 1s cause additional problems, such as weapon failure or ammo depletion, which are described later in the relevant sections.<br/><br/>D3 &ndash; Some rules require the roll of a D3.  To get a result roll a D6, where a score of 1 to 2 = 1, 3 to 4 = 2, and 5 to 6 = 3. Rolling a D3 never results in a Critical or Fumble.<br/><br/>Scatter &ndash; Scattering means to determine a random direction, usually to represent a misplaced grenade or errant entity.  To determine this direction simply roll a scatter die, or if that is unavailable, roll D10 and use the direction the top of the die is pointing, or some other agreed upon method.<br/><br/>Rerolling Dice &ndash; Some abilities allow players the opportunity to reroll their dice in the event they are unhappy with the first result.  The second result cannot be rerolled even if it is worse.  You may not reroll a reroll!&quot;<br/><br/>The game will offer random encounters to give the play a different feel.<br/><br/>&quot;In This Is Not a Test your warband&rsquo;s problems don&rsquo;t just start with your opponent, the wasteland itself can be just as danger.  TNT offers rules for both hazards of wastes as well as a bestiary of wasteland denizens.   At the beginning of each battle, players roll to determine if any hazards are present.  There roughly a 50% chance something bad will occur.  The point was to offer something a little different without over burdening the players with too much going on.<br/><br/>&quot;Hazards are natural, and unnatural, phenomena that pervade the wasteland.   Earthquake, ash storms, unexploded ordinance and other dangerous events.  Below are just two examples taken directly  from TNT.&quot;<br/><br/>",

You take your place, ready to prove yourself and build the most prestigious Chiefdom.<br/><br/>In Chiefdom, you are tasked with building up your own Chiefdom from scratch. The game begins with an empty plan, and it's up to you to carefully choose what icons to draw and how to draw them based on the dice rolled on each turn.<br/><br/>With a roll of the dice, the game begins. You choose your actions simultaneously with the other players, using the values rolled to determine what icons you will draw and how to place them. Will you draw a lake or a forest? Will you give your people jobs such as fishing, woodcutting, or building? Every decision must be carefully thought out to ensure a balanced Chiefdom that can provide for its people.<br/><br/>But the competition is not just about building a functional Chiefdom. As chieftains from different tribes, you are vying for prestige and recognition. You want to create the most impressive Chiefdom, one that will be remembered for generations to come. As you work to build up your Chiefdom, you must also ensure that your people are fed, sheltered, and employed.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, tensions rise, and you must remain focused to outmaneuver your opponents.

        "description": "Bank Heist  is a social deduction game for 5 - 8 players with an explosive action phase. The game sets itself apart from other popular social deduction games by not allowing player eliminations until a secondary phase of the game.<br/><br/>Players are randomly dealt a secret identity card that could read Agent, Rival, or Crew. Agents get to know if they have a comrade as do Rivals. Crew usually have the numbers advantage but are always in the dark.<br/><br/>The game is played in 2 primary phases: The Robbery and the Getaway. During the Robbery players try to load cash into the truck before the police arrive at the bank. Players draw and pass cards to observe what the receiving players do with those cards in order to figure out who they can trust. Crew must place cash bags into the truck. There is one Crew member that has &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; and must keep cash bags even though they win or lose with the Crew. Agents try to stop the Robbery by keeping cash bags. Rivals need a successful robbery, but will try to eliminate the others before the end of the game. Not all cards are cash. The deck is filled with items such as Adrenaline, Zip Ties, Knives, and more.<br/><br/>As the Robbery moves along, players also flip over Alarm cards which cause instant actions to happen such as checking other players Identity card for a Crew Tattoo or showing your hand to a player you trust. Additionally, there are Attribute cards such as Martial Skills or Gun Jammed which can enhance or hinder player abilities.<br/><br/>If the Robbery is successful, play moves to the Getaway. During this phase players will use the information and items they collected during the Robbery to eliminate those they don't trust before the truck reaches the Hideout. Each faction has different abilities during this phase that will help them achieve their specific win conditions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Part of TSR's minigame series.  From the rulebook...<br/><br/>&quot;They've Invaded Pleasantville&quot; minigame is a two player wargame of secret invasion by Space Invaders.  One player, the Alien player, moves the Alien-controlled and uncontrolled pieces, and the other player, the Town player, moves the Town-controlled pieces.  There are 12 game turns in this game. In any given turn, playing pieces representing various townspeople will be moved across the gamemap, which is a map of Pleasantville.<br/><br/>The Alien player will try to keep the whereabouts of the Alien-controlled townspeople a secret, while he or she &quot;takes over&quot; more unsuspecting townspeople and builds up strength for the final showdown with the Town player.  The Alien player, in short, will try to create a large army of townspeople-zombies, eliminate any opposition, and occupy Pleasantville as a base of operations.  The Town player will try to convince the townspeople that there is an alien menace in the town, and will attempt to fight any Alien-controlled townspeople encountered.  With luck and careful play, the Town player hopes to defeat the Alien-controlled&quot;zombies&quot;, locate the Alien Headquarters, and destroy the Alien Sub-Commander.<br/><br/>The game mechanic involves use of two identical sets of carboard chits - one set having a star on the back indicating alien control. Each turn, the alien player may use misdirection and bluffing to fool the town player as to where the alien mind control is taking place. Real townspeople are &quot;swapped out&quot; with alien controlled ones and the town player must stop the spread of control sooner than later. A fun game for two players who enjoy bluffing and like simulating the action of classic movies like Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Invaders from Mars. Especially entertaining is the random Townsperson Movement table that simulates the day to day migration of unsuspecting townspeople as they go about their business in Pleasantville.<br/><br/>",

Davignon, Belgian Minister for Foreign Affairs:<br/><br/>2 August 1914<br/><br/>Very Confidential<br/><br/>Reliable information has been received by the German Government to the effect that French forces intend to march on the line of the Meuse by Givet and Namur. This information leaves no doubt as to the intention of France to march through Belgian territory against Germany...<br/><br/>The GUNS OF AUGUST simulates the first three months of WWI in the West, when mobility reigned and the fate of France hung in the balance. Game mechanics compensate for players&rsquo; 20/20 hindsight to encourage historically accurate play that makes &ldquo;sense&rdquo; in game terms while avoiding a &ldquo;straight jacket&rdquo; of special rules to force irrational play. Players maneuver corps and divisions through 9-mile wide hexagons in turns that span three days each. Chit pull activation, along with modest movement point allowances, generates a highly interactive game. Combat uses artillery and rifles to reveal the comparative strengths of the opposing armies. Optional rules for variable set up and fog of war counters shroud the game in uncertainty and increase replay value.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The lamps are going out all over Europe.

Each player represents some &quot;truth&quot; that's trying to be preserved for posterity by diligent book-copying monks. Players place and copy book tokens in monasteries, then pick up stacks of books and spread them around France. Each turn, a monastery will burn down, and the books in it may be destroyed. After the monasteries have burned down, players can move through them, so travel on the board gets faster as the game progresses. When scoring chips are drawn, each player whose ideology dominates a region scores points. The first player to score 100 points wins, becoming the dominant truth as the Dark Ages end.<br/><br/>",

Using the appropriate side of the map either 2 or 3/4 players can join as the characters from the movie: Alex, Gloria, Marty or Melman.<br/><br/>Each field generates a specific resource from the game theme: Wood, bags of sand, popcorn, wool or nice juice cocktails. Each player starts with two circus tents on a specific spot on the island, and they can use the resources they acquire to build tents, wagons or get help from the Pinguins. By setting up more tents, they can expand their network; the more tents they build, the more resources they may receive. Just watch out for the controlling Zoo keeper!<br/><br/>Be the first player to set up all of your seven circus tents, and you win!<br/><br/>",

Each senator watches over his personal agenda, increasing its value through projects that favor it. The senators will propose bills that will be put to a vote, being able to buy votes through blackmail, bribes, lies and tricks. Any resemblance to reality is pure coincidence.<br/><br/>The main objective is to modify the value of the Departments and gather the most valuable Projects in the Secret Agenda. Each turn, the Senators will propose Project cards from their Secret Agenda and relocate the Public Officials of the board. These proposals are put to a vote, so it will be necessary to buy the votes of the opponents. With each new Project, the number of Officers per Department will change, increasing or decreasing their value. At the end of the game, a Table of Values will be formed according to the number of Officials in each Department. With this Table, common to all the Senators, it is calculated how much the Projects of the respective Secret Agendas are worth.

To that end, he had sent Ney's 2nd Corps and 3rd Cavalry Corps to block the Allied army at the crossroads of Quatre Bras on the same day, so that it could not proceed down the Nivelles-Namur road to bolster the right of the Prussian position.<br/><br/>The Prussians had deployed along the Ligny Brook. They held all the farmhouses and a good defensive position, with most of their advance forces under cover. In fact the Prussian three army corps' positions were so good, that Napoleon at first was deceived into thinking there was only one army corps. However, Bl&uuml;cher had overstretched his left flank, and exposed his right to French artillery.<br/><br/>Included in the Napoleon's Last Battles Quadrigame.  It was sold separately as a folio game.<br/><br/>Folio version includes rules, a 17&quot; x 22&quot; map and 100 counters.<br/><br/>",

This particular village is plagued by silly yet somewhat historically accurate catastrophes. From foreign invaders to highways in your yard, from Chernobyl to communism, who knows what destiny will throw your way? Fortunately, the Fate cards have your back, giving you powers to make villagers Musicians, improving wedding chances, cause Bar Fights to eliminate your competition, or simply make (and drink) traditional moonshine liquor! Survive the Hard Times and become the richest Boyar of the land!<br/><br/>Gameplay: You earn money from working the Land, but you also get new babies that turn into villagers that need feeding. When villagers produce too many kids, you should try to marry them off to turn them into productive couples, or risk selling Land to pay for their food and ultimately starve to death.<br/><br/>Marriage is consensual: roll the dice to see if the villagers want to get married, and use Fate cards to improve your odds (example: Bad Eyesight - improve wedding chance), or reduce them on your competition (example: The Village Idiot - reduce wedding chance). Various Fate cards also have interesting, highly interactive effects on the game: players must congratulate you by paying money when you play the Just Married card, other times they can Steal The Bride, and even break couples using the Trouble In Paradise card. If you make enemies, you can Unleash The Dog to eliminate a villager from another player (or yourself when having trouble feeding them...), and the Village Preacher will gain some income everyone someone dies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Leading the first of those campaigns was the great general, Flavius Belisarius. Belisarius&rsquo;s War is a two-player game of the Vandal War, in which the Eastern Romans reconquered North Africa. One player commands the Romans, the other the Vandals. Both players maneuver units representing elite regulars, tribal warbands, fleets and militia. The point-to-point map covers North Africa as well as the islands of the Western Mediterranean.<br/><br/>In Belisarius&rsquo;s War each player has a unique deck of Campaign Cards. They generate recruits, movement abilities, special bonuses for combat, and historical events. Some of the cards include: Naval-Land Campaigns, Organize the Exarchate, Ambush, and Procopius.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved via a quasi-tactical procedure. Each side has unique advantages, with fierce Vandals pitted against disciplined Roman heavy cavalry. There are special rules for Huns, rebellions, morale and leaders such as Belisarius. Having the right commander at the right battle can mean the difference between victory and disaster.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To maximize the concert feel, pictures taken at real concerts are used on the cards and guitar picks are the player pawns!<br/><br/>While Ready to Rock! is a pure card game, it also uses mechanisms of placement games. The rockers play their route cards, which represent the audience, then they move in different directions through the crowd so that in each match rockers will reach the front row through different paths.<br/><br/>Moreover to advance in every gig, rockers must obstruct other players' progress, perhaps pushing others back by using a special card or blocking their way with a wall card. What creates walls at a concert? Obviously the Mosh Pit, the Hell's Angels, and the Headbangers! A rocker once blocked should not despair as he can always change the direction of the crowd to open up new paths to move in other directions. In addition, Body Surfing might help you pass the obstacle and run toward the stage!<br/><br/>In the game, each rocker starts with four cards and can draw one card each turn. During his turn, he can play at most two cards. Cards are divided in three types: routes and walls &ndash; which have already been explained &ndash; and instants. The latter are bonuses he can use for himself (e.g., if you get &quot;beer&quot;, then you can draw two cards, or with &quot;flashing tits&quot; a player can use three cards in a turn) or against one opponent, such as &quot;ear plug&quot; (which makes him skip a turn), and &quot;smashed beer&quot; (which makes him discard two cards). There are also &quot;Ready to Rock!&quot; card, special cards that activate one of the stage cards to generate unforeseen effects on all rockers: &quot;special guest&quot; forces every rocker to draw one card, while &quot;shitty weather&quot; makes everyone discard one card and &quot;fire explosion&quot; muddles everything up by rotating all the path cards 180&ordm;.<br/><br/>Ready to Rock! is a game with a unique real setting and is easy to learn, although some strategy tips are essential to win the game. Given the content of some cards, the game is not suitable for children: for instance, in &quot;lots of beer&quot; there's a guy drinking two beers at once and in &quot;flashing tits&quot; a girl shows her tits to the entire stadium. It's perfect, however, by the age of 14!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Piquet is a very old trick-taking card game for 2 players, reportedly invented by a M. Piquet during the Court of Charles II. It was well established in a form very similar to that used today in 1650 and remained the most popular game in France for many centuries, similar to Cribbage in the UK.<br/><br/>A 32-card deck ranking from ace to seven in the four suits is used (known universally as a &quot;Piquet Deck&quot;). A game consists either of 6 deals called a partie (in the Rubicon version) or to 100 points in the &quot;Cents&quot; version. Each player is dealt 12 cards, with 8 left as a talon.<br/><br/>Play consists of three distinct stages: (1) the exchange, (2) the declarations, and (3) trick play.  Winning requires skill at all three.<br/><br/>In the exchange phase, players may exchange one to five cards with the talon to improve their hand. Each player's discards are visible to them for the remainder of the game.  The declaration phase involves revealing melds for points (done in a formalized manner so as to reveal some but not all of one's cards). Declarable combinations include: the most cards of one suit; the longest run in a suit; and sets of the same rank, e.g. 3 kings, 4 aces.  The trick phase involves playing out the hand, with no trump.  Bonuses include taking most tricks, taking all the tricks, and scoring 30 points before the opponent declares.<br/><br/>The small deck combined with the large hands combined with the revealing of each other's cards gives Piquet play a different feel than many card games, somewhat more akin to a board game.  Part of the strategy of piquet is about controlling information: skillful players carefully determine what they will exchange and declare in order to keep secrets for another phase of the game, at the cost of points in another phase.<br/><br/>",

Several of such parties have been planned, but only certain monsters have been invited!<br/><br/>There are two times three types of monsters in the game (fat vs thin, red vs blue vs yellow). Each player receives fifteen tiles. Each tile shows a monster on one side, and another monster on the other side (each possible duo of six monster types once). Each round, a card is drawn, that graphically shows which monsters have been invited to the party, such as: &quot;exactly two large red monsters&quot;, &quot;at least one small blue monster&quot;. In higher difficulty levels the tasks are fuzzier, such as &quot;more yellow monsters than red monsters&quot; or &quot;just as many blue as fat monsters&quot;.<br/><br/>After revealing a card with the task description, all players attempt to flip their tiles in real time, so that the invited monsters are shown. The first player that succeeds in doing so collects the most valuable diamond. Other players can still score, too, if they manage to complete the task within the alotted time, started by the first player who (thinks he) fulfilled the task.<br/>After nine rounds, the player who collected best-scored diamonds is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game comes with six difficulty levels, each level having 18 tasks on the cards.<br/><br/>",

Be careful not to end up on a boat with the wrong animal, or you'll end up as its lunch! Use your feral cunning to trap your prey on the same boat for a tasty treat while you cross the river. The player who scores the most points by crossing the river, eating their prey, and avoiding being eaten themselves wins!<br/><br/>In more detail, Ravenous River includes seven animals, with each animal (e.g., horse) having a predator (bull) and a prey (hound). At the start of each round, each player secretly receives an animal card, and they want to feed that animal and get it safely home. Shuffle seven animal cards, then place them face down in a row on the riverbank. Place two boat cards near this bank; each boat can hold at most two animals. Deal each player two action cards. On a turn, a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Places an animal: The player looks at animal card, then either places it face up on a boat or discards an action card and places it face down on the riverbank again.<br/>    Moves an animal: The player discards an action card, then either moves an animal from a boat to the bank or from the bank to a boat.<br/>    Plays an action card: The player discards an action card and performs that action.<br/><br/><br/>If a player has no cards in hand at the end of their turn and both boats are full, players simultaneously vote on whether to end the round or not. If they do end it, players first see who eats whom on the riverbank, then who eats whom on each boat, then they unload the animals at home on the far side of the river, then again see who eats whom. Each animal scores 1 victory point (VP) for each animal eaten, unless it was eaten in turn in which case the point passes to its predator. Surviving animals score 1 VP on the bank and 2 VP at home.<br/><br/>If a single player has 6 or more VP, the game ends and that player wins. If no one has more than 6 VP or multiple players are tied with 6 or more VP, then the game continues for another round.<br/><br/>",

Apart from the board, the necessary material comprises seven shooters and a sufficient number of black and white stones.<br/><br/>Both players control a number of neutral red pieces and shoot stones of their own colour from them. In order to win, a player must claim a majority of neutral pieces by having them surrounded by larger groups of their own pieces than their opponent's.<br/><br/>This game won (along with Four) the BoardGameGeek Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game of 2013 Award.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. The size of a group is the number of stones in it. Stones on top of shooters are not part of any groups.<br/><br/>A trapped shooter is a shooter that cannot make any legal move in the current position.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayThe first player begins by placing three shooters and one black stone on empty squares of the board. The second player then chooses which player will be Black and which will be White. Next, White places the remaining four shooters and one white stone on empty squares of the board. In both cases, no shooters can be placed on the perimeter of the board. This restriction does not apply to the rest of the game.<br/><br/>From then on, the players take turns, starting with Black. On your turn, you may (but are not obliged to) move a shooter to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over any stones. Then, you must place a stone of your color on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the shooter was moved (or from any shooter, if none was moved), with no stones in between along that line. This is called shooting. Claimed shooters (see below) cannot move or shoot. Note shooters can move and shoot over claimed or unclaimed shooters.<br/><br/>After shooting, if there are any trapped shooters on the board that have not been claimed before, each one of them is claimed by the player who owns the biggest group orthogonally adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of each color are the same size, the shooter is claimed by the opponent. Claiming a shooter is indicated by placing a stone of the corresponding color on top of it. Claimed shooters remain unchanged for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has claimed the majority of shooters, i.e. at least four of them. That player wins. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSmaller versionsFor shorter but still reasonable games, the following variants are suggested:<br/><br/><br/>     7x7 board with three shooters. The first player places one shooter, and White places the other two. Whoever claims two shooters wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     9x9 board with five shooters. The first player places two shooters, and White places the other three.

        "description": "Storm Weavers is a unique combination of a classic gamebook with an element of tactical combat taking place on the board. <br/>As a dwarven warrior, you undertake a journey across the vast land of Midgard to find and rescue your friend. To achieve your goal you must overcome a sinister adversity. As you travel from location to location, you have to face strong orcs, clever goblins, bloodthirsty wolves, ice giants, all migthy gods, cowardly wizards, greedy merchants, bad people, good people ... can they stop you from reaching your goal?<br/><br/>Storm Weavers is a story driven game for one person. The player reads the situation in the book and chooses his action, which leads him to another section of the story. You roam the world drawing the map and exploring various locations. Sometimes your way will be bloodthirsty enemies. Then a confrontation begins, which is a tactical part of the game and is carried out on the board, with the participation of battle maps, minis, and dice.<br/><br/>The game mechanics is based on 2 six side dice. Facing difficult situation you will be asked to roll against one of your attributes. The result leads you to appropriate text section, but don't worry - the story gives you a lot of possibilities to increase your stats.<br/><br/>The combat is most often resolved on the one of nine battle maps. First Thymin moves and attacks. Then each of the enemies moves and attacks.  The greater the difference between the attributes of the attacker and the defender, the greater the chance of hitting and the amount of damage. You can also use special combat actions, weapons, items or take advantage of the terrain.<br/><br/>Exploring the world you consistently develop your character, which helps you to win the battles, resolve quests and finally reach your goal.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Huge war machines tower over the battlefield, their super-heavy weapons blowing apart even the most heavily armored tanks and cutting bloody swathes through the enemy ranks. Aircraft scream through the smoke-palled skies, making devastating bombing runs or landing to unleash a horde of bloodthirsty fighters.

        "description": "World War 2 was the largest and most violent extended naval war in history. From September 1939 until the surrender of Japan, the high seas were a global battle zone filled with mighty battleships, nimble cruisers, silent hunters, and flat-tops bristling with planes. Before our eyes, we witnessed the changing of warfare on the high seas as the thunderous old guard fell to air power and submarine Raiders prowled the open waters and the carrier showed its true diversity and adaptability.<br/><br/>Seas of Thunder not only allows players to re-create the Atlantic or Pacific theaters of the war but to see how challenging the entire picture was for their leaders. How do you protect a globe from German raiders? How desperate was it for Britain when France fell and they were left to fight Germany and Italy alone on the high seas? What is the right balance for the Soviet fleet split between four distinct fronts (Baltic, Black Sea, Arctic, and Pacific)? If the Mediterranean force weakens for the allies, from where do they draw ships? Does Japan strike quickly or play for attrition when they arrive on the halfway point? Will America fight in two fronts, three, or four?<br/><br/>In Seas of Thunder, players will experience the tension of too much sea to cover with too few ships, the frustration of being caught unprepared, or the intensity of a vital stand contesting a high-value sea area. Victory is neither sudden nor guaranteed. In each battle, a flight of Catalinas, the lack of ASW, the improper distribution of air power, or even a missing minesweeper could be the difference between success or failure.<br/><br/>What's in the Box<br/><br/>Seas of Thunder may not have every ship in the conflict, but it has the ones you know.<br/><br/>1 Mounted Map (Double-Sided with pre-Pearl Harbor scoring on one side and post-Pearl Harbor scoring on the other)<br/><br/>1200+ Combat Ship counters (Capital ships down to Destroyer Squadrons, Submarine Grops, and Mine-sweeping Flotillas)<br/><br/>132 Convoy &amp; Utility counters<br/><br/>14 Port Cards (1 per side for each of 7 scenarios)<br/><br/>Combat Sequence Cards for tracking combat<br/><br/>Plus sundry dice, rules, scenario details...the usual.<br/><br/>Seas of Thunder is every bit a full-force strategic-level representation of the conflict on the high seas during World War 2. Players have to manage a global disposition of their warships with frequently too much ocean to cover and not nearly enough ships to cover it.<br/><br/>Each nation has access to the historical ships that sailed in the conflict. Each country's fleets have advantages and disadvantages that are unique to them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nature of the Beast Farm vs Forest is a witty, gritty expandable card game that focuses on recruiting animals and strategic control of your playing field.  The first player to gain control of their entire field wins.<br/>  <br/>Players recruit animals, promote leaders, purchase equipment, find locations, enlist legendary animals, and befriend human allies.  Players also keep track of two tallies during the game: Favor and Fury.  Favor indicates how much 'pull' you have with humanity.  Fury indicates how much of a threat humanity sees you as.  Fury is gained by attacking your opponents.  Gaining Fury can allow you to take advantage of sinister 'Dark Nature' cards, but gaining too much can eliminate you from the game.<br/><br/>This Battle Box features two 70-card faction decks: Farm and Forest.<br/>Farm animals are well-balanced and know how to take advantage of Dark Nature cards.  Forest animals have little interaction with humanity, but are very capable fighters.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Nature of the Beast: City vs. Suburb<br/>    Nature of the Beast: Prairie vs. Polar<br/><br/><br/>",

The designers' intent is to provide fast-playing rules which capture the spirit of ground combat.<br/>Units of both sides move in random order (determined by playing of cards), with each person able to perform two Actions per turn. Morale rules allow for fanatics, cowards and heroes, and Gut Checks are required before characters can perform highly risky acts. Rules cover artillery, engineers, armored and infantry combat.<br/>A generic squad organization is provided, and generic hit locations for tanks and halftracks. Seven scenarios are designed to allow players to gradually learn the rules.  Later supplements added new unit types, nationalities, and scenarios.<br/>The rules are written to use Easy Eight's 28mm miniature line, but conversion charts are included for playing with 20mm and 15mm figures.<br/><br/>",

Guess what the others are making to collect all the letters in B-I-L-D-E-R and win the game.   <br/>Everyone takes turns being the bilder. That's when you get to use wooden bilding blocks to bild something as the other players guess.<br/><br/>First, you draw a What card. The 'What' card gives you 2 choices of things to bild, could be anything. The letters and colors represent the category. There are six in total: <br/><br/>     Category Beings is for biological bodies, be it human being, beast, or botanical. Examples could be a lumberjack, or conjoined twins.<br/>     Category Imagined indicates invented ideas and implausible imaginings, including Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster or the Tooth fairy<br/>     Category Locations lists lots of places and landmarks, local or less closeby,  like the Berlin Wall or the Garden of Eden.<br/>     Category Devices designates doodads and doohickeys. The domain of designed objects, like a jetpack or a game boy.<br/>     Category Events entails epic or everyday encounters and experiences, for example a rocket launch or an alien abduction<br/>     Category rest is a random ragbag of everything that remains outside the reach of previous categories, like Wheel of Fortune or a witch burning.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect all 6 letters, which conveniently spell out B-I-L-D-E-R.<br/><br/>You earn cards by guessing whatever the bilder is bilding. The Bilder, however, can only score a letter by choosing one of 3 revealed HOW cards. <br/><br/>     Most HOW cards make bilding harder by adding an extra rule<br/>     Some HOW cards make it easier, by allowing extra hints<br/><br/><br/>Challenges are wildcards that change the game rules. Not just bilding something, but a test of skill that you must pass to earn this card. It&rsquo;s also a joker that can be used as any letter.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We Were Brothers is the ultimate WWII infantry warfare board game and the first cross-over wargame. The game covers thirty historical missions for U.S., Wehrmacht, British and Italian armies from the three landings theaters in Italy: Operation Husky, Operation Avalanche and Operation Shingle.<br/><br/>We Were Brothers is a cross-over wargame because it effectively blends elements from several game categories. From the wargame it shares historical, technical and tactical accuracy. Every wargamer, from the newbie to the expert one, will be delighted with the level of detail and all the classic elements as LOS, covers, scattering, different weapons, roles, suppressive fire, opportunity fire, off-board artillery support and Clos Air Support, etc. However, the original lean game mechanics Alea Struggle System allows does not use any table, ruler or other complicate measurement method, making the game fast, deep and easy to learn, yet challenging to master.<br/><br/>Between each scenario the random mission generator allows recreating your own historically accurate scenarios in order to complete your personal day-by-day race to Rome: you can generate your soldiers and squad, each one with his own skills and background, put them into battle and see how they evolve in terms of skills as they survive from mission to mission.<br/><br/>The miniatures inside the box and the whole game system is in 1:72 scale. In this way, any add-on to the game in terms of sceneries, vehicles, miniatures and props can be easily purchased by any model store, such as at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wbsgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.wbsgames.com</a><br/><br/>Each player leads a team of four men, including one specialist, and fights against the opponent, in cooperation with other teams to form a Squad. The Combat and movement system is very lean since you don't need rulers, tables, charts as the usual wargames, yet it is very historically, technically and physically accurate to be enjoyed by hardcore wargamers. For its mechanisms, the game concentrates on suppression fire/moving and cover to cover maneuvers, simulating the real WWII tactics as well as assaulting impulse.<br/><br/>We Were Brothers is a game system that will be enriched by the Armoured Combat expansion and other operation theaters.<br/><br/>",

There are three phases to the game. The Operational Phase is the heart of the game and represents a seven-day cycle, with a Strategic Phase being referred to at the end of each Operational Phase to resolve situations occurring during the week just passed and a Tactical Phase representing a variable number of hours being referred to each time the British carry out an assault.<br/><br/>Game Boards:<br/><br/>HILL OF DOVES is played on three boards simultaneously. These are the Strategic Board, Operational Board and Tactical Board.

Each animal is represented by a cardboard cutout that has a raised, second level to identify the animal's mouth.

The player scoops up some amount of food from the supply (which has a mix of red and green tokens), reaches out their hand, and tries to place the food in an animal's mouth. Any food that falls out or doesn't match the animal's needs is placed in the giant's intestinal tract. The die roll might let other players give advice (&quot;Move left! Pull your hand back!&quot;) or allow the player to recover one bit of food or otherwise receive aid during the round.<br/><br/>",

Each week, the players take turns playing minion cards from their hands to their avenues to gain influence, take districts, and thwart the other player's plans.

Mission Impractical is the party game about not knowing your limitations and forgetting all about the laws of physics.<br/><br/>In more detail, four mission cards are placed on the table. The active player draws a number to see which mission they have to fulfill, then selects four out of sixteen available item cards to give clues as to what that mission is. Each other player tells a story that explains what they think the plan might be, then the active player reveals the real plan. For each player that guesses correctly, both the guesser and the active player receive a point. A player who guesses correctly before the fourth item is chosen receives a bonus &mdash; but only one such point is available per round, so be quick!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ab in die Tonne, which was republished as Ocean Limbo, players are throwing away their garbage &mdash; but in a contest of sorts. Each player has the same items to throw away and they'll throw them away in the same order; whoever packs their trash best wins, but you want to keep your hands clean, so no rearranging is allowed once something drops below the rim!<br/><br/>Each player has the same fifteen pieces of garbage: a coat hanger, an old cooking pan, a slice of pizza, and so on. Each player also has a cardboard garbage can that consists of a flat playing area with a raised border that is tilted to create a slide of sorts. The top of the garbage can has a vertical series of numbered lines used to calculate a player's score.<br/><br/>The start player chooses one item, then each player takes that item, places it above the green line on their garbage can playing board, then &quot;drops&quot; the item into the can. The next player then chooses one of the remaining items, and everyone drops this item, too. Players cannot touch trash in the can.<br/><br/>Once all the items are in the bin, a player's score is the largest numbered line covered by some portion of the trash. After two more rounds, now with special chewing gum rules(!), the player with the lowest cumulative score wins.<br/><br/>",

Be the player with the most souls by the end of the day or be doomed to serve Mephisto for eternity!<br/><br/>Mephisto is played with a single deck of cards &mdash; making it incredibly easy to set up and begin playing. Players will need to manage their hand of weapons, items, spells and monsters as they explore the dungeon for souls to collect. Cards are multi-use, meaning that any card in your hand can be used as a resource or for its printed ability. For instance, a monster in your hand may be spent to equip a powerful weapon or it can be summoned into the dungeon for you to fight on a later turn. Weapon and item cards have durability that degrades over time, requiring smart play to maximize their potential.<br/><br/>",

All cards are dealt to the players, who are on two teams of two.<br/><br/>Due to there being two of each card, the first card played is the high card (if the Ace of Spades is played first, it would beat the other Ace of Spades if it was played during the same round).<br/><br/>Unlike Euchre, where there is a turned-up card that dictates what is trump (trump being a suit that beats all other suits, with the Jack of the suit being the highest, the other like-coloured Jack being second highest, then Ace, King, Queen, 10 and 9), each player bids how many tricks he/she thinks they can take and the what they want as trump. Valid bids are suits and no trump. No trump means that there is no trump suit and Aces are the high card for each suit. Each player bids once, with the person to the left of the dealer starting and the dealer ending the bidding round. Whoever has the highest bid starts the first hand.<br/><br/>Play starts with the starting player playing one card face up. Following players must follow suit if they can, otherwise, they can play any card they want. High card takes the trick and dictates who starts the next hand. Play continues until all cards have been played (each player will have 8 cards).<br/><br/>Each team counts the number of tricks they took during the round. The team that won the bid must have at least the number of tricks they bid to score. Otherwise, they lose the number of points bid (if they bid 4 and only took 3 tricks, they lose 4 points). It is possible to have a score in the negatives. The non-bidding team scores a point for each trick they took.<br/><br/>Teams can bid lone hands, requiring them to take all 8 tricks. If they do, they can score extra points. If they don't they will lose those points.<br/><br/>After each player has dealt twice, the game is over. The team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Such an object is so valuable that even the Daleks cannot agree how best to wield it, and have split into renegade armies, each as cunning and determined as the next.<br/><br/>In Risk: The Dalek Invasion of Earth, you'll play as one of five different armies, either classic (black, bronze or silver) or New Dalek Paradigm (red or yellow) as you invade Earth seeking the ancient weapon. Only once all opposition has been wiped out can you begin the search. Will you be the last Dalek army left? Watch out for the TARDIS sweeping round the board to defend Earth!<br/><br/>As you fight for supremacy, the Doctor will do his best to stop you, bringing peace to a different territory each turn, and if your army is not victorious by his eleventh regeneration, then the battle is over and all Daleks must retreat as the Oncoming Storm saves the Earth.<br/><br/>With special power cards to boost your forces or destroy your opponents' plans, and special missions to defeat other invading forces, this game of Risk is an epic battle for control of the Earth...and the universe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disciple Detective is a deduction game for 2-5 players. Each player begins with a handful of Disciples that only the other players can see. Individuals must use their deduction skills and intuition to determine what Disciples they have. Players may take notes on the back of their cards with a dry erase marker to help determine which disciples are in their hands.<br/><br/>The cooperative version of Disciple Detective has the group trying to deduce all of the Disciples in the deck before running out of Clue Tokens.<br/><br/>At the start of a player's turn, the player must decide which of these three actions to take:<br/><br/>1.  Give a Trait Clue <br/>2.  Order Players&rsquo; Hands<br/>3.  Guess a Disciple<br/><br/>When giving a Trait Clue, the player looks at the other player's hand, selects a Trait such as which disciples have a known origin, and then touches each card having that trait.  For ordering other players' hands, the player orders each other player's hand by selecting the cards in chronological order.  To guess a disciple the player raises one of their cards and tells the other players what disciple is in hand.  If correct, they discard the disciple and draw a new one.<br/><br/>Some disciples have quirks, special rules that must be followed when giving clues, and these Quirks will make it more difficult to deduce the disciples in a player's hand.  For example, James and John always want to be first and second when ordered. Peter, on the other hand, will run to the end of the line when ordered.  Judas will just lie about his traits.  Bartholomew will remove the quirks from the other disciples in a player's hand, but that is actually not that helpful.<br/><br/>A Clue Token is used up every time an action is used, unless a player correctly guesses one of their disciples in which case the player may either take a free action or take back a Clue Token.  If at any time the team runs out of Clue Tokens, the players all lose.<br/><br/>In addition to the cooperative version of Disciple Detective, there is also a competitive version where each player has their own group of Disciples to deduce before the other players deduce their own.  Players actions are similar to the cooperative version except clues are received instead of given.  The first player to deduce their starting group of disciples wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For everyone who doesn't like the sport, but is in the game. 45 minutes of great excitement for 2 players. Legendary players from all times are waiting to score Goals again.<br/><br/>During the game you have almost all to do as in real match, but with all the strategy of Board Games. Choose between players with different abilities, pass the ball, move your player's tiles and try to score goals. Dices, Rules, Tiles and of course, a Ball!<br/><br/>At the beginning, choose your team, the 11 soccer players and place the tiles on the board that is divide by spaces. During his turn, the player has 3 actions to do. When he does not have more actions, the opponent&acute;s turn starts and he has also 3 actions to do.<br/><br/>Tiles have indicate how many spaces you can run with your player, and it is an action that you can do. To pass the ball, you will use a rule. The rule will show you if you can pass the ball to another player. Better players have a longer pass, and a pass is also an action.<br/><br/>When kicking to goal, check 2 things. How good your kick&acute;s player is, and where in the board you are. If you are too distant from the Goal, you will lose precision of the kick. <br/>Subtract the deficit from the kick, it is indicate in board, and then you will have the total number. Roll the dice D12 and see if you get this number or less. And... it&acute;s goooooal!<br/><br/>To win the game, score more goals than your opponent in 45 minutes. Or you also can choose a 2 goals match. Who else score 2 goals first, win the game!<br/><br/>",

The game-ending floe is shuffled among the bottom four ice floe cards, and each player receives a hand of twelve penguin cards.<br/><br/>Each round, the active player reveals an ice floe card from the deck, then places one or more penguins of the same color (plus jokers) on the table to bid for the card. Other players can increase the bid using the same color or pass. Once everyone but one person drops out, that player discards his bid and collects the ice floe. All other players have the option of discarding their penguins or keeping them in a face-down pile. Players then draw 0, 1 or 2 cards to refill their hands based on the number of cards they played: 0, 1 or 2+.<br/><br/>When the game-ending floe is revealed, the game ends and players discard their hands. Players then compare their ice floe total with their penguin points (the cards collected face-down). If the totals match, the player's score is the sum of penguin points. If the player has more floe points, he subtracts the difference from his penguin score; if he has more penguins than floe, he subtracts twice the difference from his penguin score. High score wins, with the number of floe cards in hand breaking ties.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's the year 2442, and Earth is facing complete destruction. The sea level is irrevocably rising, and the vast depths of the ocean now lie above the former land areas. Inspired by Jules Verne's visions and equipped with the latest technology, a deep sea city &mdash; &quot;New Eden&quot; &mdash; is being built, with the main dome standing on a &quot;White Smoker&quot;, a spring at the bottom of the sea from which hot water flows at up to 300 &deg;C.<br/><br/>This current forms a basic supply for the inhabitants (represented in game by coins), and from there, the station is constantly being expanded and enlarged with useful modules from the last mega-factories on the coast of Mount Everest or from the black market in order to receive further resources, points, and lucrative advantages. Many of these well-intentioned actions can damage &quot;New Eden&quot;, however. Will the station withstand this damage, or will it collapse in on itself? Only those who keep an eye on the balance between progress and destruction can collect points in the final scoring. Whoever has built the most points and thus the safest and most livable station wins &quot;New Eden&quot;.<br/><br/>In more detail, New Eden lasts three rounds. Each round, first reveal the module cards and place them in four rows. Players take turns buying a card from the display, using oxygen to take an action with a diver on a module, or passing. When you buy a card, the cost can vary from 10 coins + 3 repaired damage to 1 coin + 1 damage. When a row is empty, all cards drop down one level, making them cheaper, but potentially damaging. Discard all cards on display once everyone has passed.<br/><br/>Once all players have passed, enter the black market phase. Each player takes three cards from the black market deck, with remaining cards placed in rows on the display. Pay for any cards with coins and damage, then place the remaining cards in a row of the display.<br/><br/>Players then bid on a row in the display, with each row having a combination of discard black market cards and empty spaces, which allow you to move a diver and activate a module. Once all four rows have been auctioned, players have a brief scoring and clean-up before the next round.<br/><br/>After three rounds, if your level of damage exceeds the meter on your board, you score no endgame points, keeping only those points scored during play. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Explore far-away planets.  Discover what resources and surprises they hold. Be the first to set foot on a new planet and claim it as your own. Collect resources to gain fortune and fame. All of this comes courtesy of: the Jump Gate.<br/><br/>Players are spaceship captains that are competing to be the best at claiming new planets and collecting the resources found at those planets.  Points are scored at the end of the game based on the number of planets they scanned and claimed, and their combination of resources collected.  Each type of resource has a different method for being scored -- so, collecting sets of the same resource is encouraged ... and disrupting other players&rsquo; collection plans is good strategy.<br/><br/>Gameplay Summary (1st &amp; 2nd Editions)<br/>Eight planets are set in a circle around the Jump Gate and Black Hole Boards.  Resource cards are distributed:  1 face-up to each player, 1 face-up to each planet, and the rest are distributed face-down amongst the planets.<br/><br/>Players are each given 5 NavComp cards and the rest of the NavComp cards are set as a draw deck in the middle of the table.  Each NavComp card contains 2 codes (used to take some of the standard actions) and possibly a special action.<br/><br/>Players take turns around the table.  On a player's turn, he/she takes 2 actions in any order, and may select from the following actions:  Research (refill hand), Fly (move to neighboring planet), Jump (use the Jump Gate to move to another Planet), Scan (reveal a resource at a planet), Land &amp; Claim (claim a planet and reveal all resources there), Harvest (collect a resource), and Special Action.  Special actions include being able to scan a far-away planet, harvest extra resources, swap locations with another player, etc.<br/><br/>When players &quot;Jump&quot;, they add one of their markers to the Jump Gate Board.  The player with the most markers on the Jump Gate Board at the end of the game gains an extra 5 points.  If a player collects a Resource that has a &quot;Black Hole&quot; icon on it, a marker is added to the Black Hole Board.  If too many markers get added to that board, the game ends and the player with the most markers on the Black Hole Board loses some of his/her collected Resources.  The game can also end when all non-Black-Hole Resources have been collected from all of the planets.<br/><br/>Scoring is done at the end of the game, and players are awarded points for Scanning and Claiming Planets, as well as for the combination of Resources they had collected.  Each type of Resource has a different method for scoring -- but all encourage a player to collect as much of that Resource as possible.  The player with the most total points is the winner.<br/><br/>3rd Edition Gameplay Changes<br/>The 3rd Edition, published in a smaller box with artwork and player component updates, also included a number of design changes:<br/><br/>    Max. Players is reduced to 5<br/>    New &quot;Sand&quot; resource replaces the &quot;Nothing&quot; cards from earlier editions<br/>    Setup changes include giving players two or three hidden resource cards (as opposed to a single face-up card) and not every resource getting used in the game<br/>    In-game changes include cleaner, more thematic scanning and harvesting rules<br/>    The Black Hole only has 7 marker spaces on it, and triggering the end game via the Black Hole results in the player with the most markers on the Black Hole losing their hidden resources they received during setup instead of randomly-chosen resources<br/>    No points are scored for scanning or the Jump Gate ... only the resources collected and Planets claimed<br/><br/><br/>",

The row contains the digits 1-6 in a random order, and each player should have a different sheet from among the twelve designs in the box.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls the six colored dice, one for each of the colored rows. If they don't like the results, they can re-roll all six dice once. After the final die roll, for each die, each player can choose to mark off the leftmost available number matching the die result, skipping over any intervening numbers. Skipped numbers cannot be marked in the future. Thus, on each turn, each player makes 0-6 marks on their player sheet. The active player then passes the dice left.<br/><br/>The final three columns on a player sheet are designated the &quot;target area&quot;. If any player marks two spaces in a single row in the target area, that die is removed from the game at the end of that turn. When the third die is removed from play, the game ends.<br/><br/>Each player then scores each row and each column on their player sheet, losing 5 points if only one mark is present, scoring 0 points for zero or two marks, and score 5+ points for 3+ marks.

The suspects are a bunch of incognito babies who try to sneak them out of the mansion. Can you expose your opponent's secret identity and hide yours? Retrieve five bottles of milk and win the game.<br/><br/>Baby Clues is a deduction game. Every turn you have to expose a little bit of your identity to plan your escape. Every player receives a secret identity as well as an object they hate. For example, the vampire baby doesn't like garlic, the robot baby doesn't like water, and the dirty baby hates soap. On your turn, you have to pick up objects, but you can never pick the object you hate. Choose your items wisely because every card you collect discloses valuable information about your secret identity.<br/><br/>During the game, you constantly have to try to find the balance between unmasking your opponents and picking up all the objects you need to escape. Both give you the opportunity to score points. If somebody tries to unmask you, but they make a mistake, you also score a bonus point, so a little bit of bluffing can also come in handy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Anagrams is a game where players reveal letter tiles one at a time, claiming any word as soon as they can make it. Once a word is in front of someone, other players may steal it by making an anagram of it which introduces other letters from the pool.<br/><br/>Reimplemented as Snatch and Scrabble Scoring Anagrams. Published during the same time frame as the 1877 Word Making and Taking. A version of this game using the word &ldquo;anagram&rdquo; in its title was published by Thomas Whittaker in New York on or before 1875 and was called &ldquo;The Game of Anagrams&rdquo;. With Parker Brothers and McLoughlin Brothers both releasing Anagrams games in 1890, this likely reflects the expiry of the 14 year patent period that existed at the time.<br/><br/><br/>Many editions of the game have been sold and exact rules vary, but one version runs as follows:<br/><br/>The players shuffle the letters in the &quot;pool&quot; thoroughly. Each player, in turn, draws a letter tile from the pool and places it face up on the table. These letters are available to all players on their turn.<br/><br/>Before starting play it should be decided that either 3-letter, 4-letter or 5-letter words are to be established as the basis of play.<br/><br/>Then the first player draws a letter from the pool. Keeping it hidden, he tries to form one word of 2 or more letters with the letter in his hand and with at least one or more of those letters face up on the table. He may also form the word with only the face up letters and not use the letter in his hand. Whenever a player forms a word, his turn ends.<br/><br/>If a player cannot form a word, or if he forms one but doesn't use the letter he has drawn from the pool, he must discard this letter at the end of his turn. The letter is discarded by putting it face up with the other turned up letters on the table. Then the next player moves.<br/><br/>When a player forms a word, he places it in front of him facing it to the center of the table. This is done so the other players can easily see it. It gives them the chance to steal words. As the game continues and players gather words, they may steal the words from one another. This is done by taking all the letters of another player's word and adding one or more letters to it to completely change that word's meaning. The letters added to a word in &quot;stealing&quot; may be the one drawn by the player from the pool or one or more of those face up.<br/><br/>Adding S to make a word plural (or ED or ING) does not change the meaning of a word and cannot be used to &quot;steal&quot; a word. Any letters at all, however, can be used in &quot;stealing&quot; a word if the new word formed is entirely changed in meaning.<br/><br/>Players should make their own words harder to steal by adding letters to them and making them more complex. This counts as a complete turn and is as important as forming new words.<br/><br/>When all of the tiles have been drawn from the pool, players, continue in turn to try to form words using the face up letters. The game ends when there are no more face up letters, or when no player is able to move using the remaining face up letters. Each player counts the number of tiles in all of the words he has formed in front of him.<br/><br/>The winner is the person who has first obtained eight (8) words. The game is not over until ALL players have had an EQUAL number of turns.<br/><br/>If at the end of an equal number of turns there is more than one player with eight (8) words, count the number of tiles in those 8 words. The player with the most tiles wins. If the number of tiles in the 8 words is equal, then the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "18PA is an 18xx game roughly covering the area of Pennsylvania. Designer David G. D. Hecht describes it as gentle, and fairly short game.<br/><br/>18PA includes 16 companies, including local companies, land grant companies, and public companies with different rules for managing them. Rules include merger of small companies to NYC, mining city with mining rights, public companies acquiring local companies, and land grant companies profiting from building of tracks.<br/><br/>(DGDH edit, 22 January 2014)<br/><br/>The game now has seven major companies, of which six start as 5-share companies and the seventh--the NYC--forms as a 10-share company by merger at the start of phase 4. The land grant rules have been almost entirely eliminated, except that four of the six companies available at the start have a doubling token, similar to the ones in Bill Dixon's 1850.<br/><br/>There are also nine smaller companies which are a hybrid between privates and minors. Three of them are the predecessors of the NYC, and the remaining six can merge with any connected company, again after the start of phase 4.<br/><br/>",

Fighting in the trenches of World War 1, of course!<br/>Many recall the stalemated trench lines opposing each other for years of futile mass-assaults, but there were daring and heroic action to be found in the small unit trench raids led by rising young officers such as Erwin Rommel. Crossing &quot;No Man&rsquo;s Land,&quot; cutting the barbed wire, and sneaking in under the cover of darkness while a box barrage guarded the raider&rsquo;s flanks, small parties of soldiers would risk all in an effort to keep the enemy off-balance and prepare the way for future actions.<br/><br/>These quick raids of maneuver and destruction caused panic and pulse-pounding excitement for their brief durations, serving as the stuff of heroic legend for a generation whose nations fought so tragically. Can you lead or defend against a surprise raid among the trenches? Can you keep steady as troops arrive and nerve-wracking bombs go off seemingly from nowhere?

This can be a squirrel, a wild boar, a hedgehog, a bunny, a magpie, or an owl. Each animal is looking for something specific and must try to be faster than the others.<br/><br/>In each of the four seasons, hide the cute little &quot;Woodys&quot; such as leaves, mushrooms, minerals, trees, herbs, and tree fruits. For example, if you got the magpie, you have to try to find four different minerals. However, always try to keep your identity secret from the others! Strategically and cleverly place your cards on your collection spot and use the extra powers on the Woody cards to get to your goal. But be careful as fierce weather and mean fellow players will put obstacles in your way. Who is who? And what are they collecting? The game remains exciting until the end, and you will soon find out. The winner is the player who completes their task first!<br/><br/>Tiny Woodys is normally for 2-5 players, but in expert mode it's playable with up to six players.<br/><br/>",

It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the actual battlefield, A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units that took pare in the historical conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the involved units are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this ways (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the historical objectives set forth in the rules. The final outcome of the game can be very different from the actual historical result. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game - just a little ingenuity and common sense.<br/><br/>One of four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.  The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system.<br/><br/>",

Grant's campaign of 29 April through 4 July 1863 that culminated in the capture of the capture of Vicksburg and the splitting of the Confederacy. The Union forces are powerful but initially weaker than the total rebel strength, yet forced to take the offensive. The two Confederate armies are widely separated at first, but can form a decisive mass if they can link up.<br/><br/>The game map depicts the theater of operations in the central Mississippi. It is divided into areas, stretching from Bruinsburg to Jackson. Each map area serves to regulate movement and combat and represents a fourteen mile square of terrain. The two campaign game scenarios cover the period between 29 April and 4 July 1863 using two day turns. A smaller scenario covers the key maneuvering and combat that took place at Champion Hill. Special rules cover the weather, Union gunboats and rebel shore batteries, the siege of Vicksburg, among other things.<br/><br/>Game contents include one 17 inch by 22 inch full-color game map, 240 die-cut game counters, one standard rules book, one exclusive rules book, one battle board, one game card, two army display sheets, and one die.<br/><br/>",

What they're looking at on the table is a 6x6 grid of cards, with half the cards numbered 1-14 and the other half bearing mathematical operators. To set up the game, these cards are placed randomly checkerboard-style, with numbers and operators placed adjacent to one another.<br/><br/>Everyone plays simultaneously, with players trying to find a five-card formula that results in the number shown on a goal card, with goals ranging from 1 to 40. The solution must consist of orthogonally adjacent cards, though not necessarily in a straight line, and a player can't use a card twice in a formula. If a 12 is turned up as the goal, for example, one might find &quot;8+4x1&quot; in the grid, then shout out &quot;Got It!&quot; Players can mentally insert parentheses into a formula, so &quot;7+2x3&quot; can result in (7+2)x3 (=27) or 7+(2x3) (=13).<br/><br/>The first player to shout with a correct formula &ndash; and the grid might contain many &ndash; claims the goal card. The player who collects the most goal cards wins!<br/><br/>An easy version of Got It! can be set up for younger players, with a 5x5 grid that contains only the numbers 1-9 and only addition and subtraction as mathematical operators.<br/><br/>",

The performance of your 'mech will degrade as damage is received but you get the opportunity to repair in between enemy waves.<br/><br/>There are currently 13 weapons to choose from, with 4 mounting points on your 'mech so there is plenty of variety to be found - you can also beef up the armour on your legs and torso but watch out for your overall weight!

        "description": "From publisher:<br/><br/>What is it?<br/><br/>In Septikon we have tried to re-create a retro-futuristic atmosphere which was popular in games like Fallout and BioShock. The players take role of the owners and leaders of orbital mining battle stations, which are hunting for rich uranium deposits in an asteroid belt.<br/><br/>Since there is not enough uranium for everyone, the players have to fight with other space explorers for every asteroid. By using a rich armory of defensive and offensive measures and a loyal crew of their own clones, the player will have to survive a terrible battle and do everything to be first to put the other player out of action.<br/><br/>This game is completely unique. Imagine a turn-based game in the Tower Defence genre, where you must not only protect your own prosperity, but also send waves of attackers in your opponent's direction!<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/><br/>The station is not automated, which makes it much more reliable but at the same time requires a crew for manual operation. The player rolls a die, which determines the distance that one of his obedient clones can travel to the required section, to activate a piece of equipment or a weapon which is installed there. The choice of clones and the goal will depend on the current situation and the player's long-term strategy.<br/><br/>The station is completely autonomous. The player can mine and process resources, carry out repairs, defrost new clones to increase the size of his crew &mdash; but it's not that easy when you are being attacked by your opponent's entire battle force, and you want to teach them a lesson...<br/><br/>The player wins when he puts the other player's station completely out of action.<br/><br/>Why should I play Septikon?<br/><br/><br/>    It's original. Are you looking for something new? We can guarantee that you have never seen a game like this one!<br/>    It's well developed. Like a good brandy, our game was in development for 12 years &mdash; that's 12 years of constant testing and thousands of matches played.<br/>    It's dynamic. Sid Meier said, &quot;A game is a series of interesting choices.&quot; Septikon will not overload or bore you into a stupor. Of course, the player has something to think about every turn, but he has only a limited number of optimal choices. That means that you won't spend too much time waiting your turn.<br/>    It&rsquo;s multi-faceted: Consider a whole range of strategies that all deserve to be tried out:<br/>        Burning. Burn through the opponent&rsquo;s battle station with your lasers, cutting him off his supplies, ammunition and oxygen.<br/>        Suppression. Destroy his battle sections and maintenance modules, block his shooters and stop him from recovering.<br/>        Landing. Attack your enemy with a squad of fully armored and equipped BioDrones. Let them rip through his defenses.<br/>        Exhaustion. Destroy your opponent&rsquo;s strategic resources with quick targeted attacks and sneaky diversions, and while he is trying to recover, create an invincible army.<br/>        Massacre. Focus your entire production on creating nuclear charges. Suppress the opponent&rsquo;s defenses and drown him in a nuclear fog.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>What's in the box?<br/><br/><br/>    24 clone figures (in two different colors). Each one of them will obediently carry out all your orders and activate different station modules.<br/>    160 wooden cubes, representing resources which will be needed to run the station and keep it safe: Oxygen, Metal, Rockets, BioMass, Energy, BioDrones and &mdash; obviously &mdash; Uranium;<br/>    4 nuclear Rockets for those who like it hot;<br/>    8 satellite tokens and 8 Energy Shield tokens &mdash; efficient measures for launching your own space-to-space grid;<br/>    80 damage tokens &mdash; during the space battles stations will take a lot of damage, and many sections will be competely put out of action;<br/>    1 huge game board with two stations and some space between them;<br/>    2 six-sided dice, which in this game are called Random Number Generators. A single roll at the beginning of the turn will determine the &quot;time period&quot; which the player can use this turn.<br/>    2 books &mdash; One, consisting of just 2 pages, contains the Intro Game Rules, the other, the full rules (8 pages).<br/><br/><br/>How did the game come to life?<br/><br/>Igrology is one of most successful Russian board game developers. We have created 18 products, many of which are constantly being re-published. In 2011, we have sold over 100,000 copies in total in Russia.<br/><br/>Now we are facing a new task, to bring unique ideas to the international games' market. Septikon is the first and very important step for us in that direction.<br/><br/>Septikon was created by the Russian game designer Konstantin Seleznev and polished by 12 years of work and thousands of matches. In 2011, Igrology noticed this original game at the Moscow Games Convention &quot;Igroteka Avtorov&quot;, where all other publishers did not pay a lot of attention to it due to its very unusual concept and seemingly complicated game board.<br/><br/>The Igrology team, together with the game author, spent almost a year creating a setting, fine-tuning game rules, and polishing the design. Now, we have the pleasure of bringing it to all board game fans.<br/><br/>During the next year we will be releasing the first expansion, as well as an iPad version of Septikon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Little Wars was first published in 1913, but has been published many times since then, including editions from MacMillan publishing and Dover Press.  The rules portion of the book can be read for free online at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gardenwargaming.com/wargame/sitemap.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gardenwargaming.com/wargame/sitemap.html</a>.<br/><br/>The full book includes a fairly extensive history of the game and socio-political discussion of wargaming.  Wells (the famous historian and science fiction writer) was a pacifist, and the book makes for interesting reading, as wargaming was his favorite hobby.  He considered the generals he played with to be reckless buffoons, and was worried for his country should war break out.  (WWI broke out the year after the book was published, and given the massive casualties of WWI, he seems justified in his opinions.)<br/><br/>The rules themselves are fairly simple, as miniatures games go.  There are rules for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, terrain setup, prisoners, etc.  There are three types of units: cavalry, infantry and artillery.  The toy soldiers of Wells' day were fairly large, so the movement factors are also large, and it's made to be played on a floor.<br/><br/>Ranged combat results are entertaining, but hard to recreate in today's world.  In Wells' time, toy cannons fired little pellets and were actually tooled to be quite accurate.  The game calls for aiming the cannons and firing them, and any figures you knock over are casualties!  The best recreation I've seen was at a convention where we used toy pistols that fired plastic disks: the player had to place the butt of the pistol on the floor next to his artillery and fire from there.<br/><br/>Melee combat does not use a randomizer.  (In the book Wells discusses how he started with a coin flip but was turned against it when one soldier won over twenty battles!)  Instead, compare sizes of units, add in &quot;supporting&quot; units (within a certain distance), and each side takes casualties proportionately.  The remaining smaller force is then taken prisoner and may be escorted to the rear lines - or freed on the way by a rescue attempt.<br/><br/>Although modern miniatures rules are more complex and realistic, this is still a very fun game to play, and is a big hit at conventions.  It's also free online!  It is best played on a floor with one-foot tiles for ease of measurement.<br/><br/>Stand alone expansion of Floor Games<br/><br/>BGG Microbadge -- <br/><br/>",

Their goal is either to gain 10 VP or to destroy all SkyNet units and factories. Victory points can be gained while exploring, by locating human survivors in pacticular.<br/><br/>And one player takes control over SkyNet forces. They have to either destroy all resistance units or to find and kill all survivors (which are usually found by resistance itself). SkyNet can also explore territory just to find anything usefull for Resistance and destroy it for nothing.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, one random map token is placed for every map area hidden. Later these tokens can be explored with different results. One SkyNet factory and a few units placed in one of six ruined cities. Resistance starts in 3 different random cities. Human units are generally weaker than SkyNets' (both sides have 4 types) but better for exploration and interception.<br/><br/>Movement, exploration and other actions can be done by playing action cards from hand. Cards also can be traded for new cards.<br/><br/>Combat can be initiated either using specific cards or when units of one side enter area with enemy forces (interception takes place if defender desires). In both cases initiator gets first shot using dice, then remaining units fire back once.

        "description": "This page covers the 2018 World War I Deluxe Edition boxed game, as well as the 2015 release in Strategy and Tactics #294.  This game has a map that also includes North Africa and part of Asia, many more terrain types, more than twice as many counters (228 double sided counters), and a more detailed rules set than the original 1975 game that appeared in S&amp;T #51. The earlier ones may be found here World War I: 1914-1918.<br/><br/>World War I originated in a combustible mix of dynastic ambition, nationalism, and misplaced confidence in a short war. Europe was an armed camp with mass armies formed by conscription and national reserves. Antagonism, fear, and suspicion drove nations into a lacework of alliances. Sarajevo provided the spark that set it off, and in a matter of days the continent was at war, with empires in the balance.<br/><br/>The map covers the entire war zone in Europe (36 miles per hex) and the Middle East (at a slightly larger scale). Terrain includes key cities, certain cultural and religious sites, primary railroads, and sea zones connecting it all. Counters represent field armies, with some specialized corps and a few markers. Six month turns keep the game playable, while multiple movement and attack phases allow for operational nuance.<br/><br/>Mobilization Points are used to build new units, absorb combat losses, and purchase campaign markers allowing additional activity in chosen sectors. They are always in short supply, increasingly so as economies shrink over the course of the war. Neutrals, wooed by diplomacy, may bring fresh strength to bear.<br/><br/>The main scenario covers the entire war from 1914-1918 in ten turns, while short scenarios handle the opening phase of the war (two turns) and the final great battles (four turns). Options include free setup in 1914 and an extension of the war into 1919. Victory comes from wearing down an opponent, either by capturing essential places or by exhausting mobilization points.

On your turn, you draw a card, place a piece of junk into play from your hand, and then activate one of the abilities on your junk or use your character's ability.<br/><br/>All junk is worth something. In the Junkpile, there is one card that is the most coveted of items called The Crown. Once a player draws that card, the game is over and everyone adds up the points displayed on the pieces of junk they have found or hoarded. The player with the most points wins the current round. The game only takes about 15 minutes to play, and is designed for multiple rounds of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Demonworld is a hybrid miniatures and hex style wargame. The basic game comes with a 140 page rulebook, reference sheets, unit recruitment cards, 4 hex maps, and card stock counters representing a small orc and human (Empire) army.  The maps are generic terrain maps with light woods and small hills.  They may be combined in different ways to create different battlefields.  If you enjoy the game you can invest more money in it by purchasing the different 15mm regiment packs.  The game supports several races typical of the fantasy genre (elves, dwarves, orcs, dark elves) and adds a few unique ones as well (Thain[Norse], Isthak [chaos-like]).  The regiments generally consist of 8 to 10 counters.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Players are free to set their objectives for each battle, though some simple scenarios are provided to get you started.  Players spend points to add regiments for their armies.  Armies are set up on the edge of the mapboard and maneuvered to contact.  Orders are selected for each unit for each turn indicating whether it will skirmish (move and fire), attack (move to contact), move (move long distance), or hold (defend and fire at incoming attackers if missile equipped).  Use of ordered formations help a unit fight and move.  Combat bonuses are given to units who are able to hit their target in the flank or rear, use terrain to advantage, and use weapons that confer advantage in special cases (ie lance from a charging knight).  Morale rules determine whether a unit is going to hold their position, rout, or in some cases become 'impetuous' and aggressively continue an attack without orders to do so.<br/><br/>As a player you assume the role of General of an army.   <br/>The game begins by recruiting an army. Each army is made up of several units. A unit is a group of soldiers who fight together in an organized fashion. Most units have 40 foot troops or 20 mounted models on ten individual hex bases. Sometimes a unit might be a single large creature like a dragon or war machine such as a catapult. Every unit has a points value and when you create an Army, both players will have an agreed upon amount of points to spend to create their army. This is most often 1200 points, the amount used for tournament play. For your army you may also want to recruit special heroes, commanders or wizards. Every unit in the Demonworld game has its own recruiting card which is included in the army book. These handy little cards make recruiting an army easy because they include all the information about a unit including its points cost.<br/><br/>Once both players have spent all their points and created their army, it is time to create the battlefield. Demonworld is played on a large flat surface like a table. This could be a kitchen, dining room, or work table or even the floor. The Demonworld game is great because the battlefield consists of four or more of the Demonworld maps. You can also augment the maps with model trees, buildings or hills. This is not really necessary however, because the maps look great. Using the maps makes setting up a game really fast. Four of these maps are provided with the basic game. If you would like more variety several additional map sets are available.<br/><br/>Once the maps are laid out each player will deploy their units on the battlefield. Where you place your units is crucial to the success of your army. Try to take advantage of the terrain. This could mean creating an ambush by hiding a unit in the woods. Or putting a unit on a hill where your opponent will have to fight uphill to attack them. If you can, also try to imagine what your opponent will do and then you may be able to set a trap for them or otherwise create a plan to defeat them.<br/><br/>Once both armies are deployed (put on the table) play begins. Demonworld uses a simultaneous turn sequence. In each turn both players will have an opportunity to move all of their units and shoot missile weapons like bows, engage in hand to hand combat, or cast spells. The rules on how to perform these actions are in the Demonworld rule book. The army books have extra rules for special units which only that army may recruit and special spells which only that army can cast. As the turns progress each player will try to move their units to a position of advantage and eliminate the opponents units. Sometimes people play a game with a specific set of objectives. These games are called scenarios. In scenarios achieving your objectives is often more important than destroying your opponents army or preventing your own losses. Once one side has achieved its objectives or destroyed the opposing army, they are the winner and the game is over. Most games take about three hours. Experienced players play much faster than novices and can handle larger armies.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from ATO website :)<br/><br/>Guns of the Askari (GoA) recreates the imperial struggle for East Africa during WWI. This often overlooked campaign featured classic land battles, naval engagements between lake flotillas, cruiser duels at sea and finally hit and run guerrilla engagements. It opened with conventional force-on-force battles dominated by infantry, machine guns, and trenches. But the low troop densities and wide open spaces enabled a war of movement spearheaded by South African cavalry that broke the stalemate in mid 1916. This left Von Lettow-Vorbeck a choice between surrender or guerrilla war. He chose the latter and dragged his weary pursuers through a series of running battles in Portuguese East Africa.<br/><br/>Designed by WWI game specialist John Gorkowski, Guns of the Askari features 280 half-inch full color counters that represent forces as varied as rifle companies, armored cars, naval units for oceans or lakes, and the supply units on which both sides depended. There are even artillery units back-printed with the other side&rsquo;s colors, so that they can be captured and used again.<br/><br/>The game offers four different scenarios, from the complete campaign to the 1918 guerrilla operation and two periods in between. Combat mechanics change as the nature of the conflict evolves, and each turn has a variable end point.<br/><br/>The game can be played by two OR THREE players, giving the option for German, British, and Belgian players, and making it possible for the &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; Portuguese to (perhaps) join the German side!<br/><br/>Can you, commanding greatly superior numbers, do better than the Allied commanders? Can you, commanding a mix of Europeans and native troops (including sailors from a scuttled German cruiser), manage the right balance of caution and audacity to keep your foes off-balance and elude destruction?

This civil war opposes, in a first conflict phase, protestants- otherwise known as Huguenots- to catholics, then royalists to League members after the accession of Henri IV to the throne in 1589.<br/><br/>The art of war during this period of the Renaissance is rapidly changing. The great feudal landlords, steeped in morals, fight alongside mercenaries motivated by sole cupidity. The diversity of the weapons that are used offers great tactical possibilities, based on impact and fire. Gendarmes, cuirassiers, reiters, harquebusiers, lansquenets and Swiss mercenaries confront each other in a merciless fight.<br/><br/>This is a classic game system ; &laquo; I go, You go &raquo;, of average complexity, including, during the active player's phase, a sequence of reaction from the passive player, such as fire, counter-charge or tactical backstep. The maps are whith areas from 300 to 500 m by side. A color code allows to easily determine the costs of movements and the line of sight. The scale of the game is one unit for 100 to 500 soldiers or one or two guns. One game turn represents a duration of 20 to 30 minutes. A corps represents either a vanguard or a rearguard, or the main body called battle.<br/><br/>The combats allow to simulate charges &laquo; in wall &raquo;, the merciless shocks between pikemen, the artillery fire and highlight, by a support system, the combination of iron -shock- and fire -shooting. The optional rules- caracoles, orders, lost children, looting- add even more realism to the era's battles. The rules and the five battles offered are based on a thorough bibliography and researches made into books written by (non???) contemporary authors, specifically Fran&ccedil;ois de la Noue for the Protestants and Blaise de Montluc for the Catholics, and also on precise topographical plans of each battlefield that is still accessible, except for Saint-Denis... Are you ready to put on the Prince of Cond&eacute;'s, the admiral of Coligny's, the constable of Montmorency's, Anne de Joyeuse's or Henri of Navarre's armours and to fight your enemies &laquo; By Shot, Shock and Faith &raquo; ?

Each sport has its own rules for playing cards, so sometimes you'll want to sit out an event to conserve your strength, while other times you'll push yourself to the limit to win the gold.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with six cards, each card having a number and color. On a turn, you'll play one or two cards until you cannot &ndash; or don't want to &ndash; play any more cards. The first player to drop from the event receives more cards for next time, while whoever remains in the event until the end wins the gold medal (i.e. points).<br/><br/>Whoever has the most points after nine events wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Regine is a card game of betting and bluffing, designed by Dani G&oacute;mez and Josep M Allu&eacute;, the author of games like The Color Monster, Castellers!, and Dragons &amp; Chickens.  It is illustrated by Bea Tormo.  It&rsquo;s for 2 to 4 players ages 10 and up and games last around 30 minutes.  Regine brings us back to the European courts of the end of the 16th century and the goal is to be the first player to reach 31 points.<br/><br/>Watch your backs&hellip;because the daggers are flying!  In Regine the interaction among players is constant and the majority of the effects of the cards affect the hands of your rivals.  As the game progresses, each player tries to get the best combinations to score points but they don&rsquo;t always have control over their hands.<br/><br/>The intuitive card design makes it quick and easy to learn how they function.  And if you know how to play Mus, some of the rules will seem familiar.  Rounds are structured in 3 phases:  hand construction in which players try to get the most favorable card combinations, a betting phase where they bid on the best hands, and point resolution.  To start, put the 4 scoring cards in the middle of the table alongside the betting chits.  Shuffle the remaining 40 cards, deal 4 face down to each player, and put the rest in the middle of the table.  You&rsquo;re now ready to start the first phase!<br/><br/>In a turn, a player can do 1 of 4 actions.  The first is change one of the cards in their hand for the top card of the deck.  The second is to announce &ldquo;no changes,&rdquo; which blocks the rest of the players from changing cards from the deck.  The third is play a card either face down or face up on the table.  If a card is placed face up, it may trigger an action.  The jester, for example, negates a &ldquo;no changes&rdquo; declaration previously made by another player.  The peasant forces a player to play a card face up on the table and use its effect.  The assassin eliminates a card that has been played on the table, the courtesan forces a player to reveal a card that has been played face down, the herald lets one look at the top card of the deck and the knight forces one to change a card from their hand.  Finally, each player can also pass and when all players pass, all remaining cards are placed face down and the betting phase begins.<br/><br/>Be sharp and observant, because it&rsquo;s now time to bluff!  Taking turns, the players will bet on the scoring cards.  They&rsquo;ll bet on the highest number of queens and jesters, on pairs and trios of cards, and for the total value of their cards.  It&rsquo;s not always necessary to have the best hand in order to score points!  You can always trick the other players into thinking you have better hand than you really do.  In the last phase, the resolution, all cards are revealed and points are awarded.  Rounds continue like this until a player reaches 31 points.<br/><br/>A good memory and a big dose of shrewdness will be your best allies in Regine, ensuring quick games and hours of fun.  Families and friends, young and old will enjoy this game (try playing with your grandparents or card playing in-laws and they&rsquo;ll quickly get the knack).  So move with caution among the knights and courtesans and don&rsquo;t get caught with the wrong cards!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The U.S. Army had its first exposure to combat in the European Theater, while fresh British forces joined the veteran Eighth Army against the Axis. French troops fought first against the Allies, then with them. Inside the shrinking perimeter, German and Italian units continued to offer fierce resistance.<br/><br/>An Army at Dawn is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these battles.  The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with many others in the Panzer Grenadier series (and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too).  There are 517 playing pieces: ultra-thick, scorchless, sootless laser-cut. You do not need any other game to play any of its 40 scenarios. Design is by Mike Perryman, creator of Liberation 1944 and Kursk: Burning Tigers among other titles.<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt a hand of six cards from a special deck, and then try to collect two card tricks, using the card values to bear off the pieces. Points are awarded for bearing off pieces in various combinations, such as 2 on each of three turns, or the legendary Marrakesh itself, when all six pieces are borne off on the same turn. Defensive points are earned for keeping the opponent from removing many pieces from their board. Play continues for 12 rounds, which goes by quickly. This game is long out-of-print, but well worth it if you can find it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dragon Face, you must capture the opponent's Emperor to win. Each player starts the game with one Emperor (which moves like a King in Chess), six Ambassadors (which move like a Queen) and seven Governors (who move straight or diagonally forward one square at a time).<br/><br/>Players alternate turns. If you jump an opponent's piece, you capture it, flipping the piece so that it shows your color. That piece now belongs to you and can be moved by you on subsequent turns. Capture the opponent's Emperor, and you win. (The playing area is a 9x7 space with the pieces starting in the back two rows on each side. You can move a piece into the &quot;Sacrifice Zone&quot; &ndash; the exterior ring surrounding the playing space &ndash; in order to make a capture. Governors that do so remain out of play for the rest of the game, while an Ambassdor can be brought back into play by moving a Governor to the opponent's back line.)<br/><br/>",

First installment in Moments in History's &quot;T3&quot; series, which has subsequently become the &quot;Schwerpunkt&quot; series for GMT Games. Hallmarks of the system are ease of play and the &quot;fog of war&quot; element.<br/><br/>Contrary to the playing time above this game takes about 6 hours to play unless their is an earlier sudden death decision.<br/><br/>Features C3I points used to generate the number of units that can be activated to move and the number of attacks that can be made during each segment.  There are three segments per turn in which each player must begin by deciding whether they will move and then attack or attack and then move.  Not only is combat strength compared but also a unit's tactical rating when resolving combats.  The side with the higher tactical rating gets to draw more random chits most of which have beneficial drms for that side. To a limited extent combat losses can be converted into retreats and enemy retreats can occasionally result in an additional advance for the attacker.  Occasionally, extreme die rolls allow additional spontaneous activities.  ZoCs are hard except friendly units allow tracing supply through them.  Loss of supply reduces unit effectiveness and can result in attrition.  Victory is determined mostly by units losses but also the Soviet control of objective cities and the presence of even one friendly unit on the other players side of the Donets river provides a healthy number of VPs.  Both players begin with units in this position and so cancel each other out.<br/><br/>All in all it is a tense game.  The Russian player with the benefit of hindsight can avoid many of the hazards of the original campaign by not over extending himself.<br/><br/>Republished in Command Magazine Japan #56.<br/><br/>",

Proper allocation of the limited air and naval support is just as important as deciding manpower assignments. Both sides have opportunities to make numerous decisions affecting the outcome of the campaign. For the Allied commander, deciding where and when to commit the small but powerful BEF in 1940 is a choice as difficult as that facing the Axis commander concerning his limited panzer forces in 1944.<br/><br/>Units are Corps, Divisions, and Brigades.

Can you solve all the mysteries?<br/><br/>One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the perpetrator, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.<br/><br/>As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone.<br/><br/>You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day. You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Kiwara, two groups of animals compete for space in the savanna, claiming points when they dominate a territory, but the value of a space depends on who's in it!<br/><br/>The game board features six territories &mdash; two each of three, five, and seven spaces &mdash; with rivers dividing all of the territories. Each player has fifteen animals tokens in their color. One player places the totem on a space outside the 6x5 board, then players alternate taking turns. On a turn, a player:<br/><br/>&bull; Places one of their animal tokens in an empty space in the row or column adjacent to the totem.<br/>&bull; Moves the totem 1-3 spaces clockwise. (If all spaces in these rows or columns are full, the player moves the totem to the first row with an empty space.)<br/><br/>If a lion is placed orthogonally adjacent to zebras or gazelles, then the zebras are turned face down (yum!) while the gazelles are returned to their owners. If a player must place a zebra or gazelle adjacent to a lion, these tokens are placed face down.<br/><br/>If you place a crocodile across the river from a gazelle, you can exchange these tokens. (The crocodile attacks, and the gazelle bounds to safety.) You can swap the location of a crocodile many times this way.<br/><br/>Whoever places the token that fills the first savanna claims the Okapi card, which is worth 5 points at game's end. Once the board is filled, determine who has the most tokens in each territory; face-down tokens are counted to determine majority. Whoever wins a territory scores points equal to the value of all face-up animals in this territory: zebras 6, gazelles 2, elephants 5, lions 1, and crocodiles 0. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>While the base game of Kiwara is the same as the earlier Dr&ocirc;les de Z&egrave;bres, the game includes a double-sided game board. If you use the &quot;free play&quot; side of the board, to set up you use the river sticks included to create six territories of sizes 3, 5, 7 or 9, thereby creating a fresh layout for each game.<br/><br/>Instead of using the Okapi, you can shuffle the ten-card reinforcement deck and give the player who completes the first savanna a random card; the player can use the bonus action on this card at any point during the game. With players of differing skills, the more inexperienced player can start with a card or two at random to level the odds.<br/><br/>",
