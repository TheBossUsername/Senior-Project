        "description": "Porto Seguro was specifically designed to learn about the Belgian social security system. A system where everybody obligatory contributes taxes to a fund that redistributes that money to those who need it most.<br/><br/>The game mimics this system as players start out at different wealth-levels and have to contribute, by sharing their wealth with other players. Players who do so get rewarded, players who don't get punished.<br/><br/>The game is designed so that when you're wealthy you have more options, but you have to contribute more. When you're poor you have fewer options but get supported by the game's system.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn players receive their income in the form of cards. Some of those go into the social security system to support the less fortunate players.<br/><br/>Players can trade the remaining cards with each other. Those involved in the trade can perform the action on the card. Actions involve moving up or down on the social ladder.<br/><br/>The cards have differently colored background and the final goal is to get seven cards of the same color.<br/><br/>The game is lightened up by using a theme that is not directly related to the matter. Players are boat owners with boats ranging from a luxury yacht to driftwood.<br/><br/>",

The series' aim is to utilize the techniques of boardgaming whilst retaining the flavour of miniature gaming.<br/><br/>Road to Berlin simulates actions in the Second World War on the Western or Eastern Fronts during the final two years for forces up to Corps or Army levels.<br/><br/>The basic units in the game are tank and mechanized infantry platoons, infantry companies, and artillery batteries. Aircraft may be in flights or squadrons, Logistics and engineers are fully covered.<br/><br/>A Corps level assault can easily be played on an 8' x 6' table, whilst the rules are ideal for campaign games where the action is spread across a number of tables.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Schnelle Schnecke (Fast Snail) is a racing game game that is best described as a mathematician's Chutes and Ladders. The board shows a circular track as the body of a snail, and players start at the head and try to be the first to get their piece into the end space in the center, by way of 45 spaces. Some of the spaces have arrows that point to other spaces.<br/><br/>Each player gets three sticks, and each turn both players will put a number of sticks (or none) into one hand secretly. Both hands are revealed, and the active player moves that number of spaces forward. The key, of course, is to try to get your piece to spaces with helpful arrows (or no arrows) while pushing your opponent into spaces with arrows that send them backwards.<br/><br/>The pieces are very nice, with real shells for the player pieces and a well-sized roll-put board.<br/><br/>",

The rules and examples of play are in the files section.<br/><br/>In the Age of Sail there was the development of the Battle Line to have a combat effectiveness as high as possible. In particular the British Royal Navy laid this doctrine down in the Fighting Instructions and adhered to them in a stubborn manner. This led in the second half of the 18th century to many undecided battles which could have been won with a little initiative. The Navy had to wait for an Admiral Nelson to change this.<br/>In Piecepack Seabattle each player tries to destroy the opposing battle line with his own battle line. During manoeuvring you can achieve an advantageous position. During the fighting you need luck as it was in all sea battles.<br/><br/>",

You start with 1 floe card in the middle of the table.<br/>On your turn you may play a penguin card if the number of floes on the penguin card and the floes of the cards in the middle exactly matches the number on your penguin card. Since the floe cards in the middle are on a row you can access them from either the left or the right. How many floe cards are needed to add up to the number on your penguin card is free. As long as it matches exactly. If possible you can also play your second penguin card.<br/>Then you always play a floe card on either side of the line. So even if you can't play any penguin card you still add floes to the line to hopefully collect in your next turn (if they aren't scooped up by the other players).<br/>The last thing you do is fill up your hand so that you again have 2 penguin cards and 3 floe cards.<br/><br/>The game continues until either the penguins are all played or until it's no longer possible to play the remaining penguins.<br/>At that point all the numbers on the penguin cards are added up.

        "description": "Quest for the Orb is a Board Game designed as a first step into fantasy role-playing, with enough chance to make it interesting but enough self-determination to keep it exciting. It can be played alone or by up to five adventurers, keeping track of the health and possessions of the characters in play right on the board. With only a couple of charts to consult, the game is very easy to learn and ready to play within minutes. Players must cooperate as a team to rescue the Orb from the Kingdom of Dark before they run out of food, or get killed by all manner of nasty foes and unfortunate events along the way. The event cards and a pair of dice determine the challenges to be faced; the player(s) determine how to use their set of skills and supplies to best meet those challenges to succeed (or die trying).<br/><br/>",

The objective is to either build your city to a strength of 15 or to pummel your enemy's city to a strength of zero. Each player holds two &quot;decks&quot; of cards - a resource and action deck. Action cards may be played if the player has the corresponding resource cards to spend. Actions include strenghtening your city, hiring a champion to defend your city, deploying spies and thieves, and attacking the enemy city or champion.<br/><br/>Though intended for two players, up to four may play at one time by adding one deck for each additional player; this may add more dimensions to the game as alliances and cooperatives may be formed and broken.<br/><br/>The play is not too intense, though planning a few turns ahead is essential to success.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A charming little childrens game for 2 to 4 players in which each player competes to be the first to cover their individual playing board with 6 puzzle pieces. Each turn a letter of the alphabet is chosen using the spinner provided. Players race to find a part of their picture which begins with that letter. The first player to do so and call out their answer places a piece of their puzzle over the identified picture element. The game balances nicely as players have less to look at than others if they are closer to winning. The 4 different pictures on the playing boards are very appealing to children with a whimsical light-hearted artwork. They contain a lot of detail which keeps the game from becoming too repetitive.<br/><br/>",

Each round these dividends get influenced by dice roles. This can even lead to a bankruptcy of a company and the loss of all shares for the players who have bought them. Furthermore there can also occur an external takeover if the majority of shareholders agree.<br/><br/>There is also a second board which shows the value of the shares. Each round the value gets determined by demand and supply for a share. The orders of the players take place simultanously and sectretly and are then resolved according to priority markers which the players can choose.<br/><br/>After ten rounds the game is over. Before the game ends players should try to sell their shares since only the amount of cash determines the winner of the game. However bonds have to be payed back before the money is counted.<br/><br/>free translation of publisher blurb<br/><br/>Bull or Bear?

        "description": "A game produced around 1980 by Milton Bradley, it was largely a standard children's roll-and-move game with a couple of twists: part of the board was a raised platform to give a 3D effect, and there was a lazy-susan under the game board that (when it worked correctly) would move pawns from one part of the board to another.  The player pawns, like the cover, featured Scooby Doo and his beloved nephew, Scrappy.<br/><br/>",

As you groggily rise to your feet, you notice a sword, a scroll, a rope, and a lock pick have been laid out next to you.  Dazed and confused, you pluck the scroll off the ground, hoping it will explain things.  No such luck.  It appears to be a magic scroll, used for summoning a wolf spirit.<br/><br/>You hear a clattering behind you, and the hairs on the back of your neck prickle.  You turn to see a crazed-looking goblin shuffling towards you with a rusty scimitar in its hands.  Quickly, you snatch up the sword.  The goblin lunges at you.  You clumsily block its attack, then thrust forward and impale the foam-mouthed creature.  It slumps to the ground, dead.<br/><br/>You have no idea how you got here or why you are here.  But you have a few tools at your disposal, and you are going to find a way out.&quot;<br/><br/>Dungeon Shift is a print-and-play solo dungeon-crawling card game.  The player begins the game with four cards from the Equipment deck and must use those cards to overcome the various challenges presented by the Rooms, Monsters, and Traps in the Obstacle deck.  Cross chasms, pick locks, disarms traps, and fight monsters, all the while hoping to not run out of equipment as you try to escape from the dungeon!<br/><br/>Once you have drawn all the cards in the Obstacle deck, you win.  You may also complete a Victory condition presented by the Obstacle cards, but be warned, these Victory conditions are extremely difficult.  If you run out of Equipment or become &quot;stuck&quot; with no way to advance, you lose!<br/><br/>While expanding on the concepts of Dream Shift, Dungeon Shift is not simply a re-themed version of the first game in the Shift series.  It adds introduces new concepts and further explores the potential of the Shift design space.<br/><br/>",

To win, a player needs to own all the resources (natural, human and capital) of two organizations. The first player to do this is the winner.<br/><br/>Players gain resources by either landing on an unowned resource and buying it from the bank or by trading with other players. The enterprising nature of Gumption is encouraged by deal-breaking squares on the game board and by risk cards. The playing pieces are familiar New Zealand icons which players use to move around the game board.<br/><br/>The game comes with a booklet that highlights each of the organizations depicted on the board.<br/><br/>Each denomination of the money used in Gumption profiles an invention that has started a New Zealand business.<br/><br/>There are three different kinds of cards in the game:<br/><br/>Risk Cards<br/>Players take a Risk card and follow its instructions. Many Risk Cards can be traded with other players.<br/><br/>Resource Cards<br/>Every resource shown on the Game Board has an associated resource card. This card shows the income that is payable when another player lands on the resource. It also shows the income payable if all three resources are owned and if the player has Future Technology. The resource cards can be traded with anyone except the bank.<br/><br/>Future Technology Cards<br/>Players can invest in research and development and buy Future Technology, which will increase their income. This is done once players own all the resources of one organisation. There are Risk Cards that allow players to buy Future Technology without first owning all three resources.<br/><br/>",

A player can use ships or planes to move from one continent to another, with a ship moving her to an adjacent continent and a plane moving her to any continent (after first moving three spots on the runway).<br/><br/>The player takes an action where she ends her turn:<br/><br/>&bull; Qwiz - The player rolls the size (large or small) and topic (weight, age, size, number of young) dice, then selects which of the three top animal cards for that continent best match the values rolled, such as &quot;Which of these three lives the longest?&quot; If correct, the player keeps the card and adds it to her hand; if not, she returns all three cards.<br/><br/>&bull; Match - The player names one of the topic categories and largest or smallest, then each player reveals a card in their hands. Whichever player or players have the best showing in this challenge receive an animal card from the continent where they are currently located. The winner(s) place the winning card on the table, putting it out of play until after the next match.<br/><br/>&bull; National Park - The player can swap a card in hand with any of the cards by the side of the game board. She places her card face-down in the display and adds the other card to her hand.<br/><br/>The player who first collects one animal card from each of the six continents while also having one animal of each of the five types (mammal, amphibian, reptile, bird, fish) wins the game. For a shorter game, the only winning requirement is to have one card from each continent.<br/><br/>",

Chess Dungeon applies the orthodox game language of Chess to an emergent playing space.  It has no &quot;board&quot; as such - the playing area and the pieces that may be played are determined by custom, collectable playing cards. Each card may serve as either tiles of the &quot;board&quot; (&quot;Land&quot;), or be tabled (&quot;Declared&quot;) to place the Chess pieces upon a Land card.  Two cards are played per turn until players' cards run out.  In this way players determine the size of the game (thus its approximate duration) by agreeing to how many cards may be played in a game.  Players may also agree to different piece limitations and so forth.  The aims are: be the last player alive (not checkmated), avoid stalemate, and win cards from other players in order to gain points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Zillions-of-Games:<br/><br/>Kharbaga belongs to the Zamma family. It is an African checkers variant played on a special pattern that is different from the well-known Alquerque pattern. Whereas the Alquerque pattern reduces the number of diagonals, the Kharbaga pattern reduces the number of orthogonals. The result is a different game dynamic. It is a very attractive checkers variant, not the least drawish. Although the number of squares is only 42, the many movement freedoms of the pieces make it a complex game.<br/>Counters are obliged to follow the pattern on the board. The pieces can step in the three forward directions, and capture, by the short leap, in all directions. Goal is to capture all the opponent's counters. Counters are promoted to Mullahs (Sultans) at the last rank. If the counter, during a capturing sequence, makes an intermediate landing on a promotion square, it does not promote to Mullah. The Mullah moves and captures in all directions. It can move any number of squares, like the King in international draughts, and land anywhere behind a captured piece. Capture is obligatory. Two types of variants have been implemented, one in which captured counters stay on the board until the capturing sequence has ended, and one in which counters are removed instantly. Note that one must always choose the line with the most captures.<br/><br/>A counter moves to an empty adjacent point.

The primary game mechanic is a &quot;Move/Effort&quot; system, in which 2 eight-sided dice are rolled, and one is used for movement and the other for actions. Higher numbers are better for both, but be careful. Every time you roll doubles, you are one step closer to defeat.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to completely remove the dark forces by closing all the gates and destroying all the monsters.

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>The classic Monopoly with constructions and other elements of Bodensee, in Germany.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.<br/><br/>The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.<br/><br/>Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "British card game, described as a game and a puzzle.<br/><br/>Any number of players from two upwards can play. The cards are dealt round in the usual manner, faces (pictures) downwards. The players must not look at the face side of their cards. The player left of dealer leads and turns his or her top card face up in the centre of the table. Each player plays a card in turn Each successive card should be quickly played so that a &quot;body&quot; is fitted to the &quot;Head&quot; on the last card played. The title line &quot;Grandfather's Whiskers&quot; on the back of each card indicates the half containing a &quot;body.&quot;<br/><br/>Lots of combinations of head and body will be created to the amusement of all the players, but when Grandfather's Head appears on Grandfather's Feet, players must call &quot;Out&quot; or &quot;In&quot;. This is because his whiskers might be under the eiderdown on the card or poking out from under the eiderdown. The first player to call correctly takes all the cards in the centre. If a wrong call is made, that player must give every other player a card from his hand.<br/><br/>The objective is to be the last player with all the cards.<br/><br/>THE SIX JIG-TYPE PUZZLES<br/>The backs of the cards comprise six different jig-type puzzles. The cards numbered from 1 to 8 constitute a quite simple puzzle, for the picture is formed merely by placing the cards in a certain order with their edges touching. In the second puzzle group (numbers 9 to 16) the cards overlap.<br/>The remaining groups, numbers 17-24, 25-32, 33-40 and 41-48, become successively more difficult. The last group (41-48) in which Grandfather and his Whiskers are depicted, is the most advanced puzzle of the whole series.<br/><br/>",

The first part of the game is about recruiting team mates of which there are 27 unique ones; which are available and in which order varies. Each player has an attack value, a defence value, some special effect, how fast they run, where they hit the ball etc. In the second part, players use the team mates and the training cards they've collected to play out the baseball match; which includes comparing the different numbers and special powers on the team individuals, and using some hand management to play the right card at the right time.<br/><br/>Translated box back blurb:<br/>Players of all colours and with next to superhuman powers amass on the field, the devil curbs swirve through the air and the baseball bats burst out in fire!!!<br/>This is a game based on such baseball comics.<br/>With all the quirky rules of baseball, and using the characters' special powers, you can taste the charm of pitching and hitting in an easy way.<br/><br/>It's time to PLAY BALL!<br/><br/>",

It requires a double-six domino set, five uniquely distinguishable pawns, five corresponding dice, and a one-minute timer.<br/><br/>The playing area is made by laying all twenty-eight dominoes face up into rectangle of 7x8 squares. Other than the double-blank, no blanks can touch the edge of another blank. Pawns are set on any five of the blanks, dice are rolled, and the timer is flipped.<br/><br/>Players examine the board and call out bids. When the timer ends, the high bidder must move the pawns to spaces with a sum that meets the bid. (There is also a special bid for landing all five pawns on matching spaces.) Meeting the bid wins the stake. (The publisher suggests candy or beer, but scoring one point would suffice.) Failure pays an equal stake to every opponent!<br/><br/>Pawns move orthogonally the number of spaces indicated by their corresponding die. They are not allowed to cross the same space twice nor any occupied space.<br/><br/>",

Of course, some members enjoy more hugs than others, and then there are SOME things you want to avoid hugging altogether. But will you be able to tell the difference?<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has one of four actions to choose per turn: To place one of their colored HUG counters, remove a family token from the board, peek at other tokens on the board, or draw a token from the &quot;Token Pool&quot; and place it face-down on the board.<br/>Not all tokens are good to hug, and some family members are worth more points than others! When all pieces from each player have been placed, each counter is flipped over and the points are counted where their HUG counter connects with any character tokens.<br/><br/>A great little kids game that the whole family will love, give some HUGS to you and yours today!<br/><br/>",

With the realization of infinite resources came infinite greed. What is the point of difficult compromise and drawn out negotiations when strength could gain anything a nation, corporation, or unaligned military force could desire? What need for a minority population to bend to the will of the majority when they could just as easily forge a nation of their own on a virgin world?<br/><br/>Human space is dominated by intense nationalism, rampant balkanization, and brutal competition. Only the Watch keep man from tipping into a new dark age and utter self destruction.<br/><br/>And man is not the only predator in space...<br/><br/><br/>Alien War is a game of ground combat for 28mm (1/56 scale) models set in the year 2260. The rules are designed to give you an authentic feel for future warfare including unpredictable events &ndash; sudden rushes, explosions, ambushes, and malfunctioning weapons &ndash; that challenge your strategy and tactics as a tabletop general. The terrain can be as elaborate or as simple as you like; but the game is best played with lots of cover (buildings, trees, rocks, downed landing ships, etc). The playing area can represent anything from a futuristic cityscape to an alien forest to a Bug-infested hive!<br/><br/>Each player controls a Force that can be as small as a squad (6-15 models) up to a platoon or even a company in size (40-100 models or more). Some Forces may involve more models than others since they consist either of less skilled human troops (like colonial militia or poorly armed and trained conscripts) or aliens whose strength lies in their overwhelming numbers. As players become more experienced, they can control larger numbers of troops as well as vehicles and incorporate more advanced rules for future warfare. At its most basic size (squad level), a game of Alien War should take an hour or less to play.<br/><br/>",

Have the most at the end of the game and you win!<br/><br/>Event Cards (Yellow): When you draw an event card its effect takes place immediately and you reveal the card and follow the text.<br/><br/>Actions Cards (Green): An action card is held in your hand until you wish to play it.<br/><br/>Tremor Cards (Red): Tremor cards are revealed and stay on the field.<br/><br/>The game is played by shuffling and dealing the entire deck of cards on to a play surface face down. Then on each of your turns you have two options, Search the Mine (pick up a card form the playing field), or Play an Action Card. Keep in mind, that some Actions Cards allow you to search as well!<br/><br/>This continues until 3 Tremors are caused by either revealing them in the mine or using the &ldquo;Jack the Hammer&rdquo; tremor causing card, the game ends immediately and a winner is determined. Add up the values of all your treasure cards. The player with the highest is crowned the winner.<br/><br/>",

It's played with trapezium-shaped pieces on an initially empty square board. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored red; the left and right edges are colored blue. The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 9x9.<br/><br/>All pieces are the same and only differ in color. They can be placed in any orientation, but always with the front side up. Thus, when playing on a physical board, the back side of the pieces should be marked so as to distinguish it from the front side. A square can accommodate four pieces, and no piece can be placed in a way that makes this physically impossible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTwo pieces are point adjacent if they share nothing more than a vertex, and edge adjacent if they share at least part of a side longer than a vertex.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayRed plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place one or two pieces of his color on empty spaces of the board. On his first turn, Red can only place one stone.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, for any two point adjacent, like-colored pieces there must be at least one like-colored piece edge adjacent to both.<br/><br/>Passing is not allowed. Players will always have a move available and must make one.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of edge adjacent pieces of his color touching the two opposite board edges of his color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAcknowledgementsThe featured placement restriction was first used in Corey Clark's Slither. Asymmetric, variable orientation cell division was first used in Mark Steere's Tripen.<br/><br/>",

Victory points may be gained though activities such as trading, destroying an opponent's planet, or saving another player's forces from destruction. As it is never clear who the victor will be until the very end, tension builds and builds until a fast and furious finale - a no holds barred, guns blazing, fight to the bitter end!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>Each turn consists of 5 phases:<br/>1. Discard (down to 10 cards)<br/>2. Produce (planets produce resources of their color, draw 2 cards)<br/>3. Trade (cards in hand, resources, etc., with other player(s), or 3 of the same color resource for 1 of any color to the bank)<br/>4. Diplomacy (read: ATTACK!!!)<br/>5. Industry (put into play Troops, Developments, and Planets)<br/><br/>A player wins the game by gaining 10 Victory Points, or by having the last surviving Homeworld.  A player can win a victory point in one of five ways:<br/>1. Destroy a planet<br/>2. Trade with another player (Until player has 9 VP's, then no VP's for trading)<br/>3. Defend a planet<br/>4.

Many of these cards will go directly in play and will form the bulwark of your fleet on your voyage. These are called Voyage cards, they have defensive abilities that will protect you against your opponents machinations, or be powerful enough to steal or destroy your opponents Voyage Cards.

This is meant to keep the game quick and cut throat to force you to think on the fly!<br/><br/>Kickstarter Link<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1640472770/pirates-booty-the-card-game-of-plundering-your-fri?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1640472770/pirates-booty...</a><br/><br/>",

Each card has an achievement and a reward for completing that achievement. All game pieces move as normal and all rules are the same as Chess, though you no longer worry about check and checkmate. Your opponent also has five achievements, so you must be quick to complete yours before they complete theirs.<br/><br/>",

Players draw a Penalty roll, with the results ranging from losing just one card, to losing everything and having to start from scratch.<br/><br/>There are Event Cards like &quot;Switch places with another player&quot; or &quot;Take a Hike&quot; where everyone leaves their cards and moves over one place. These are great for messing with the other players.<br/><br/>And there are Unruly Cards, which players can use at any time, when they catch another player doing the behavior or action listed on the Card, forcing the other player to make a Penalty roll.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re kept on your toes 100% of the time.  You always have something to do, even when it&rsquo;s not your turn.

The game is over and you are victorious once your opponent can not make any matches whatsoever...even if they tried really really hard or their side of the board is full.<br/><br/>To add some ball'n variation to the game there are different characters to play as; each with their own special ability that is triggered whenever that player makes a match of its color. There are also white game pieces and black game pieces that will help you and hinder your opponent when drawn.<br/><br/>There is also a 2v2 game mode.<br/><br/>",

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Warfare in the Age of Madness is a game of company-level battles in a dark near future. Designed for 15mm figures, opposing forces fight to survive by scavenging supply caches from the battlefield, stripping enemy casualties of their gear, and raiding the enemy field camp. Features include easy to learn rules, small armies of just a few dozen 15mm figures (about 10-12 elements/stands) and a few vehicles, and a flexible force creation system. Create a completely custom force representing anything from a former regular rifle company (and now your personal war band!) to a hardened civilian militia from your hometown. The game uses only standard 6-sided dice and can be played on the average dining room or kitchen table.<br/><br/>The game is available in electronic and hard copy formats.  Players can use 'extra' 15mm figures they may have lying around or simply reuse miniatures they have for other games to create post apocalyptic warbands with minimal cash outlay.  Players build customized forces and are able to tweak stats, weapons loadouts, morale and other factors to both optimize and personalize their force.<br/><br/>",

Two players face off against each other in sparkling combat in order to defeat the other and capture their gems so that their rival cannot transform. Decks span from a number of themes including Nightmares, Daydreams, Sweets, Flowers, the Constellations, and even in the Internet. Playtime is under 20 minutes, which is more than enough time to show your rivals what true (sparkling) pain is.<br/><br/>The object of the game is score three of your rival's gems. Gems are gained when a RIval's Magical Girl's HP reaches zero. To do this, players using a series of spells and abilities (and sometimes a little roleplaying) must engage in battle. As battle is happening, Magical Girls have a limited supply of magic they are able to use. If their magic is drained to zero before their hit points are, they are safe from being defeated. Some Magical Girls will be able to become Grand Magical Girls, which are very powerful for only a short amount of time. The game ends to be short but action packed.<br/><br/>",

However, instead of simply moving the distance rolled, you choose one of two code cards you draw and obey its instructions.  Most cards refer to the die roll you made and will move you.  Advanced cards involve simple loops and conditionals.  The cards are expressed in Java code, so the act of deciding which of the two cards to use requires you to parse simple Java.  The board has features (trees, rivers, rocks, etc) that have a normal meaning, and which can be referred to by conditional cards.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>codingFarmers is the first ever board game to introduce kids to real programming. It is created exclusively by three high school students (Kikhil, Vineet and Anika) who are very passionate about programming and wanted to spread the awareness among kids. In this game, you are the coding farmer. After a long day at work, you decide to race to the barn with your friends. Since you code, your tractors operate on code cards.  You have to strategically decode and use the correct set of cards to reach the bard first. This game provides two sets of cards. Action cards have instructions in English as well as Java code.  code cards have instructions only in Java code.<br/><br/>",

Devil players can play blue &quot;succeed&quot; mission cards to avoid suspicion and Angel players can play red &quot;fail&quot; mission ones to draw suspicion.<br/><br/>Players each then select who they think joined the Devil team.<br/><br/>Angels score if the mission succeeds, they managed to select a Devil or if they successfully drew suspicion upon themselves.<br/><br/>Devil players score if the mission failed and if they avoided suspicion.<br/><br/>Neutral players always score, but only 1 measly point.<br/><br/>First to an agreed number of points or most points after x rounds played wins.<br/><br/>",

Holmes was walking heavily around the room, complaining quite arrogantly about the lack of crime in this world. <br/><br/>Have you thought of my Christmas gift yet?' I asked him politely, interrupting his rather disturbing topic. 'No' he said as he looked down the window. 'But it looks like i'm getting mine early this year.' Few moments later we heard a knock on our door. 'If i don't open, will turn back and come later?' he asked. 'Certainly not, considering the situation i am in.' said a voice from outside. 'Good' said Holmes, 'Then do come in, it's open.<br/><br/> Lestrade walked in with a look of quite serious anxiety on his face.<br/><br/>221B is a paragraph card game, where you control the duo of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson to solve interesting cases in Victorian London. In this game, you may travel to different locations and deduce information from different suspects, the way they talk, the way they dress. Conduct experiments on important pieces of evidences, research crucial information and solve the case before time runs out.<br/><br/>Inspired from games like Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective and T.I.M.E Stories, the game consists of a base game deck of basic locations. I will upload with that several case decks where each case will have story cards and other cards to mix with the base deck. Sherlock Holmes and John Watson will have different actions like travelling, interrogating, examining they can do each turn.<br/><br/>Within a few turns the game will end. You can check your theory and accuse suspects. If you are right you win. But if wrong, you can chose to play the case again. Each game plays in roughly around 40 minutes.<br/><br/>",

And how far is the distance from K2 to Mount Everest? When was the first ascent to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro? How far must you descend from the Matterhorn to get to the next-highest mountain? Which is longer: the Nile or the Amazon? And which of these two rivers has a larger drainage basin? Which lake has the largest volume world-wide and which one is the deepest? These and other questions about the world's major mountains, rivers and lakes have to be estimated in the 12 categories of Geo Facts.<br/><br/>By using different jokers, additional excitement, entertainment and tactics come into play. Another special feature of Geo Facts is its internationality. Via translations of all terms into five languages, global topics and the frequent use of symbols, Geo Facts overcomes the usual focus of quiz games on just one language and culture.

Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>",

During the game, players have a number of question cards in their possession and can answer only those about Austria as a whole and those about the region of the country in which their game figure is currently located. Thus, you might want to trade cards with others, offer them cash, move to new locations, or pay to return cards that are too difficult to answer. Too pay too much, though, for in the end the first player to collect a previously agreed upon sum of money wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Over ten thousand workers swarmed to become garimpeiro (gold prospectors in Portuguese) and make their millions.  The greed filled desires of the garimpeiro and their patrons bored deep holes into the earth like an inverted pyramid, and the once lush jungles were quickly stripped naked, giving the name of Serra Pelada to the dig site - &quot;the Naked Mountain&quot;.<br/><br/>In Garimpeiro, each player becomes a patron of the garimpeiro (gold prospectors) who will lead them to seek fame and gold ore through various actions, in order to become the greatest man or woman in Serra Pelada.  It is a full-fledged worker placement game that simulates the excitement of gold prospecting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monopoly is a roll-and-move game where players move around the game board buying or trading properties, developing their properties with houses and hotels. When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>From the rear of the box:<br/><br/>Howden, originally Heaffudene, grew at a crossing point (Bridgewater) along the Old Derwent (Hailgate) after Lake Humber had started to silt up.<br/><br/>The town has a history that starts before the Domesday Book and has several royal connections, King Edgar gave his first wife Howden Manor, William the Conqueror gave the church (later developed into the Minster) to the Bishop of Durham and King John gave Howden the right to hold an annual horse fair.<br/><br/>Howden was a coaching town and although it does not have a railway, it is the M62 that brings people here today.  AVisitor can enjoy the Georgian architecture around the Minster, shops and cafes around the Market Place, a community venue in the Shire Hall, a walk around the nature reserve of Howden Marsh or recreational time in The Ashes.<br/><br/>Local firms have helped to bring Howden MONOPOLY to fruition to celebrate The Ashes 90th anniversary.

        "description": "Can you be the Archmage&rsquo;s favourite by conjuring the most powerful mythical creatures? Use their unique abilities to bolster your magical powers or hinder your enemies in this game of luck, strategy, magic, and creatures of legend.<br/><br/>Trick or Treat sees 30 brand new cards that focus on &quot;take that&quot; mechanics and the addition of Gloom creatures. It also contains all the reworked and play tested Halloween expansion cards, which were requested the fans!<br/><br/>The Gloom cards are a deck of cards which are shuffled and three are dealt to the table. Anyone can Conjure these cards and use them to their advantage. Each one has powerful endgame changing effects - some modify the VP of Burned creatures while others have wholly more malevolent powers designed to allow you to put those Archmage cards to good use! But be warned, the power of Gloom is powerful and unpredictable and it can easily be a double-edged sword. Gloom magic is recommended for advanced Ember players.<br/><br/>The creatures you collect will allow you to mitigate the &ldquo;luck of the draw&rdquo; and to further your chances of conjuring more powerful creatures (by drawing more cards that you need or stripping your enemies of their creatures' powers). Trick or Treat capitalizes on that giving you even more chances to attack your enemies, to weaken their creatures and to strengthen your hold over the game. It's all out war in the Halloween expansion!<br/><br/><br/>     It's got a slew of new art by a fabulous all-female art team.<br/>     It's all about the endgame. Now you can really shake things up with a single Archmage card.<br/>     It makes the final score that bit more uncertain. Now you can manipulate the final VPs of Burned creatures. If that wasn't enough, some of the new creatures are reactionary: when a player does something - you get to do something. It means you can wield absolute power in each game, BUT you might pay a high price for such blatant use of magic. <br/><br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, Van Helsing will be investigating the monsters and hunting them when he can.<br/><br/>Each monster card has two sides. The front includes their ability to persuade other monsters and a special power. The backside shows their Christmas lesson and how nervous they are to teach it. The Dr. Jekyll card is slightly different - he doesn't teach a Christmas Lesson. Rather, he turns into a Mr. Hyde. Mr. Hyde can still be used, but he's far more clumsy and less efficient than Dr. Jekyll.<br/><br/>The monsters will roll dice to try and convince each other to teach Franky his Christmas lessons. Each monster has distinct success values, making each roll in the game unique. Some monsters may instead use a special power to distract Van Helsing from his investigation or give other monsters a benefit. How the monsters use their actions is entirely up to you!<br/><br/>Each turn has 7 phases.<br/>1. Roll Random Event - This will usually move Van Helsing further along in his investigation or give the monsters better luck in their attempts to teach Franky.<br/>2.

Check to see if Dr. Jekyll transforms into Mr. Hyde.<br/>5.

        "description": "The Phoenix expansion for Wyvern introduces two new types of Action cards:<br/><br/>Hidden Action<br/>Play under a face down card during an Action Phase. The Hidden Action card tells you whether to play it under one of your cards or under an opponent's card. The Hidden Action is not revealed until the card it is placed under gets turned face up during the normal course of play. You may not look at any Hidden Actions placed under your cards by your opponent until your card comes face up during play. Place the Hidden Actions sideways as a reminder of this. As soon as a card with a Hidden Action under it comes face up, check to see if the Hidden Action applies to the card it is under. If it does not apply, it is discarded and has no effect. If it does apply, follow the instructions on the Hidden Action card. The Hidden Action card remains attached to the card it was under for as long as that card is in play, unless it is removed by a game action.<br/><br/>Intercept Action<br/>Play immediately after your opponent has chosen a dragon to use for attack, and has announced which card he is attacking. If your opponent is attacking a face down card, you play the Intercept Action before the card is turned face up. If the Interceptor has a base strength, the attacking dragon must kill the Interceptor before reaching the intended target of its attack. The attacking dragon and the Interceptor fight a normal battle with the Interceptor counting as a dragon in the row attacked. If the outcome is anything other than the Interceptor being killed, the Battle Phase ends immediately. This means that the Interceptor could lose the battle but survive with a Golden Apple or Fountain of Youth, and the Battle Phase would still end. If the battle is cancelled, the Battle Phase ends. If the Interceptor wins the battle, the losing Dragon dies and the Interceptor is discarded, ending the Battle Phase. If the attacking Dragon does kill the Interceptor, it then immediately attacks the card it originally intended to attack. If the Intercept Action does not have a base strength, follow the instructions on the card. Intercept Actions are always discarded after use.<br/><br/>",

It is possible to play in competitive or cooperative mode.<br/><br/>In the competitive version each player takes turns in the role of host and secretly assigns the identities to 5 unknown people, choosing among the 8 available. The other players bet on the identity of the current unknown, also using the available clues.<br/>Who guesses gains the value of the unknown, but if everyone has made a mistake, the host loses the value of the unknown. The host, therefore, must be careful to choose an identity that is neither too easy, otherwise all others earn money, not too difficult, not to lose them himself.<br/>After having unveiled the identities of the 5 unknowns, the proof of the mysterious relative takes place: the host draws another unknown and chooses which of the 5 initial unknowns is his relative, also assigning clues to the degree of kinship and the 2 unknowns to be excluded. Who misses the mysterious relative loses 50.000 &euro;: also in this case the host must be careful because if nobody guesses, he will lose 50.000 &euro;. After everyone has played the role of the host, whoever has the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>In the cooperative version all the players collaborate to earn as much as possible. Contrary to the previous mode, the host must try to help the players as much as possible.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The tribe is making this pilgrimage to remember the Ancestors - and if the Descendants fail in their journey, the Ancestors will be forgotten for all eternity!  The Ancestors must work together to help the tribe survive.  The players win the game together if they manage to bring at least two Descendants to the mountaintop alive.  Any fewer than that, and the players all lose.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds (5 to 20 max) which represent &quot;days&quot; of travel.  (Increasing duration increases game difficulty.) Each morning, the Shaman of the tribe rolls dice to interpret an Omen: resources that day will be Safe (neutral), Blessed (collect +1), or Cursed.  Taking cursed items will result in additional Danger for the Descendant who disobeyed the Omen!<br/><br/>Randomized terrain cards provide opportunities to forage for various resources - food, medicine, firewood, and crystals for banishing hostile evil spirits.  The Ancestors decide how best to match Descendants' skills to the resources available in any given location.  The more lucrative places also contain the greatest likelihood for danger! A player rolls once for each Descendant who forages during the day.<br/><br/>Each player's role gives them a special power to intervene on behalf of the Descendants.

        "description": "Common player comment, &quot;This is not the game I thought it would be.&quot;  It may look like a kids game but it defies labeling.  It may be perfect information but it is not an abstract...<br/><br/>Apex Portal presents Lost Plateau, inspired by the 1912 classic novel, The Lost World, by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  On this secret plateau, dinosaurs roam a land of volcanoes and treacherous cliffs.  Expeditions navigate stampeding dinosaurs while chasing and delivering eggs.<br/><br/>Dinosaurs! At Apex Portal we love primal physical mechanics.    We evolved Lost Plateau for over 10 years. This design strived for 2 goals to produce primal tension.  First, to have dinosaurs with an elegant set of behaviors (stampede, defensive facing, double dino combinations) to spawn eggs and eliminate opposing dinosaurs.  Second, to balance the influence of the 2 entities, the expeditions and the dinosaur packs, so both are always in consideration for their way of scoring and to maximize the interaction between them.  Each player controls a pack and an expedition.  The dino behaviors are truly predatorial for the fun tactical side of the game.  When will your expedition feel safe to run the gauntlet of opposing dinos for the eggs?  That question and getting your packs into safe but threatening areas of the plateau is the strategy side of the game.<br/><br/>Game Description<br/>   This is a physical primal game.<br/>   A player turn is 2 actions &ndash; may do the same action twice.<br/>Move Expedition Action &ndash; Pick up and deliver eggs to the Safe Camps by moving 2 spaces per action.  Or use the in-game Trail Blaze expansion to allow unlimited movement on established trails -- that can be co-developed between competitors.<br/>Move Dinosaur Action &ndash;  Dinos stampede dinos and opposing expeditions.  The dino is moved and then given facing to prevent stampede from one direction.  If both actions are Move Dino then sly double dino stampedes appear out of the mist!  This encourages dinos to stay within reach of pack mates and maximizes a true predator mind set &ndash;  you always see opportunity, but often don't see the other pack coming after you.<br/><br/>Winning the game&nbsp;- Score 6 total eggs and/or dino captures.<br/><br/>Two unique team versions for 4 to 6 players.  Can play as team mates or as competing &ldquo;pack mates&rdquo;.  Pack mates control and share the points scored by their pack, but don't share in egg scoring by their private Expedition.  The team games are unique for the speed of play.  A 6 player game runs!<br/><br/>Trail Blaze Expansion. The in-game expansion adds a 3rd action, for experienced gamers.  Each player or team has 20 blazes.  The Blaze Action is the placing of 5 Blazes on any spaces of the board.  On move Expedition Action, the player may move the tent into any space that is adjacent and has at least 2 Blazes and at least one is of the player's color.  May move up and down connected trails with out limit on each Move Expedition action.  This adds deeper strategy in avoiding opponent dinos and adds co-opetition to jump in on other player's developed trails with your own Blazes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Valkyrie is a strategic, high-stakes social deduction game themed after the historical plots to remove Adolf Hitler from power by high-ranking conspirators within the German military.  Unlike some social deduction games, OV relies less on logical deduction and more by varying degrees of confidence, forcing players to lean on their intuition.<br/><br/>Each player will be either a Conspirator working for the Wehrmacht (German Military) or a Loyalist working for the Gestapo, the Nazi secret state police.   The Conspirators know who each other are but members of the Loyalists are unaware of anyone&rsquo;s identity but their own.  Each round, each player will be assigned as an Operative, an Agent, or the Gestapo Chief.  Operatives have been ordered to meet Hitler in a high-level meeting and contribute to a mission.  Agents will investigate Operatives in an attempt to ascertain their motives by way of Suspicion cards.  The Gestapo Chief&rsquo;s primarily role will be to scrutinize Operatives and detain those who are particularly suspicious for additional interrogation.  In their assigned roles, Conspirators will attempt to undermine Nazi operations without raising suspicions and secretly plot the F&uuml;rher&rsquo;s assassination.  They must leverage luck and opportunity to manage perceptions, sustain alibis, and evade suspicion long enough to successfully execute Operation Valkyrie.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A game that will expand your vocabulary and bring out even forgotten words from the depths of your mind. The aim is to create Latvian words from the most valuable syllables, thus accumulating as many points as possible.<br/>On each card, there is one syllable that, when put together during the game, forms words. The rarer the syllable used, the more valuable the word is created. Each syllable has been assigned points depending on the frequency of use of syllables in Latvian. With this game you can make more than 2000 words. These include nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Words can be formed in basic forms and inflections - either. They can be both serious and a little unserious.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BoxOff is a solo abstract strategy game. It rises above the level of a mere puzzle because of its random set-up and user-defined board size.  The random set-up makes it like a playing-card solitaire game.<br/><br/>The game is played on a rectangular board of any size, as long as it has an even number of squares.  7x8, 8x12, and 12x15 are common sizes.  The board is filled with stones or marbles in various colors.  For an easy game, use 3 colors.  For a game of medium difficulty, use 4 colors.  For a difficult game use 5 colors. There must be an even number of each color, because they're going to be removed in pairs.  Typically you would use an equal number of each color.<br/><br/>A pair of stones of the same color may be removed from the board if the pair define opposite corners of a rectangle that contains no other stones.  They could be in a line (a 1xn rectangle) or diagonal corners of a non-linear rectangle.  The goal is to remove all the stones.<br/><br/>This game was first described in Games Magazine in 2013, and later in the Abstract Games magazine in 2020.  There have been electronic versions for iOS and Android.  BoxOff is now being published by NewVenture Games in three versions: a board game, peg game, and travel-size.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First game in the The Glory and Empire series.<br/><br/>Glory and Empire is a fresh look at grand tactical command, maneuver and combat during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Period.  The system is focused on command, maneuver and combat that is fast playing, yet accurate and rich with detail.<br/><br/>The game is 125m per hex. Units are battalions and companies for infantry, regiments and squadrons for cavalry and companies for artillery. Each strength point is 100 men for infantry, 50 men and horses for cavalry or  one section, or 2 guns, for artillery. Counters are 5/8&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules consist of a Soldier's, Battalion and Brigade rules set. Players can learn the basics with the Soldier's rules, move to a full fledged simulation with the Battalion Game and pick and choose rules from the Brigade Game to suit their tastes. Or players can jump right into the Brigade Game and understand how grand tactical maneuvering was practiced on the battlefield during the 18th and 19th centuries.<br/><br/>The Soldier's Game gives players new to the era an introduction to foundational concepts of tactics in the horse and musket era. In the Soldier's and Battalion Games there are the usual Line, Column, Square and skirmishers.  The Battalion game has two types of Skirmishers, introduces important concepts for maneuvering forces on the battlefield and has more detailed close combat procedures. The Brigade Game adds close columns, attack columns, closed square, Austrian division masses.  Artillery is simplified for the Soldier's and Battalion Games, but the Battalion Game adds artillery ammunition. The Brigade Game adds bombardment zones, bounce through, howitzer fire and separate ammunition tracking for round shot, shell,  canister and shrapnel. The Brigade Game also gives players more tools to react to enemy moves.<br/><br/>The piece de resistance of the Brigade Game are the command rules. Players choose to form their brigades into Grand Columns or Lines of Battle. To deploy for battle the player must decide which evolution to use to form Line of Battle and shake his men into fighting order.  To cross a bridge or move through a defile in the face of the enemy will take careful planning to avoid being embarrassed by the enemy when the columns emerge on the other side. Keeping the troops in good order is all important if  the day is to be won.<br/><br/>The system will make its debut with Lock 'n Load publishing, featuring Wellington's first victories against Napoleon's forces in the Peninsula,  with the battles of Roli&ccedil;a and Vimeiro. If all goes well we'll follow it up with Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro and Salamanca.<br/><br/>Play Glory and Empire and learn the trade of fighting a Napoleonic period battle and earn your marshal's baton.<br/><br/>Facebook Page<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dreams, strategy and action ... this is how an Empire is created. Invest in properties and companies, accumulating wealth and doing business around the world, with this strategy game that will make you a millionaire.<br/><br/>Imperio (&quot;Empire&quot;) is a board game, in which each player will try to build their own business empire. Inspired by the market economy, Imperio proposes to simulate the economic growth of people in the real world, through the purchase of goods in any of the 34 cities of the planisphere.<br/><br/>You will be able to acquire houses, buildings, restaurants and hotels or set up your own factory to sell products all over the planet and manage them by moving with your own plane. You can even have your own casino, while increasing your economic power. These goods can be purchased in any of the 34 cities in which the planisphere is divided, while you move along the path of the board with your avatar. Your profession can also help in this exciting enrichment career. The acquisition of new cities will allow you to increase the number of goods at your disposal, giving you greater chances of winning the game.<br/><br/>Although the objective is common to all players, the strategy is their own, so taking into account market conditions, at any time during the game, you can change your strategy to win the game. The first player to meet the goal of $ 1,000,000 wins the game.<br/><br/>The players move along the track and advance to the position indicated by the dice. Once the city is acquired, the player has the right to collect a rent for it and can additionally invest in different goods to increase the rent. Investments can be real estate such as houses, buildings and towers with a different value for each one, both for the purchase and the income obtained. Another type of investment can be in businesses such as hotels and restaurants, which have a variable income or a casino that, being the most expensive, can be acquired when there is already capital, but the profit obtained is quite high when the players fall into that town. And finally another type of investment is the acquisition of factories that allows players to buy inputs and sell products to the rest of the players.<br/><br/>Market conditions may vary throughout the game and may make it necessary to modify the strategy. Likewise, these changes also allow obtaining high dividends for those who can take advantage of them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is at this moment that you need to be as careful as possible, because you can often understand from the card back which mushroom or plant is hiding on the back. It can be a valuable mushroom or berry or a poisonous mushroom can be caught, which will take away victory points from you at the end of the game, or it can be nothing at all.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been picked up, points are totalled and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/>Настольная игра Ура, это гриб! &ndash; это игра на внимательность для самых маленьких игроков (впрочем, это не значит, что взрослым будет скучно или неинтересно). В ней игроки попадают в волшебный лес и, как настоящие грибники, пытаются найти как можно хороших грибов.Подготовить &laquo;Ура, это гриб!&raquo; к игре очень просто: нужно разложить карты рубашкой вверх посреди стола. Как именно они лежат не важно &ndash; в лесу тоже ничего не бывает аккуратно, а горка карт в этой игре и правда выглядит как лесная поляна.<br/><br/>В свой ход в настольной игре &laquo;Ура, это гриб!&raquo; игрок может взять любую видимую карту. Именно в этот момент нужно быть максимально внимательным, ведь по рубашке часто можно понять, какой гриб или растение скрывается на обороте. Это может быть ценный гриб или ягода, может попасться ядовитый гриб, который отнимет у вас победные очки в конце игры, а может и вовсе ничего не попасться.<br/><br/>Настольная игра &laquo;Ура, это гриб!&raquo; &ndash; это простая и увлекательная игра, которая помогает развивать внимательность и мелкую моторику. Правила объясняются всего за минуту, а сыграть в неё можно везде &ndash; лишь бы хватило места разложить карты.<br/><br/>",

Depending upon the player count, some cards are played face down, and others face up, but it is a &quot;must-follow&quot; game, and the highest ranked card of the lead suit will win.  However, in keeping with the theme, if two or more cards of the same rank are played, they are removed from consideration.<br/><br/>The winner of the trick collects any remaining cards into a score pile.  All cards start at -1 points, but each rank has a unique scoring or play affect.  For instance, if you have at least three cards of rank 1, each of your rank 1 cards is worth +2 points instead of -1; each rank 5 card is worth +7 points if you have no rank 6 cards.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the number of players; at the end, the person with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each round, every goblin takes a turn pulling a loot token from the town's treasure pile. These tokens might represent useful tools or valuable treasure like fireworks, dogslicers (goblin knives), or shields. Unfortunately, the tribe's most fearsome beast, a pig called Squealy Nord, is also hiding in the treasure, bringing mayhem and chaos to any who draw his token from the pile. You never know what you might get.<br/><br/>Fighty goblins can choose dogslicers and just steal from their neighbors instead of raiding the village. Smart goblins will take some shields to defend themselves from their peers. Crafty goblins with leadership qualities may choose instead to take the badge of leadership, the Pickle Token, signifying for all their prominence and importance as well as the right to pick first next time.<br/><br/>After 10 rounds and one last free for all opportunity to steal from each other on the way back home, one goblin is declared the &quot;bestest goblin of the raid&quot; and basks in glory and the admiration of their peers.

You display the Kakemono board and take the six buttons for you chosen character. Depending on the number of players, you use more or less  fabric cards and accessories.<br/><br/>Each card has a number and a pair of signs (Animal, vegetal, or three marks of the draper) which will be used to make combinations and scoring points. Cards are displayed at the center of the table, alongside the Kakemono board, in a 4 lines x 4 cards or 5x3 disposition for 2/4 players and 3 players respectively.<br/><br/>The main phase of the game is called the Market phase. All the fabric cards and accessories will be displayed at the centre of the table, but only those matching the selected colours.<br/>In the draw phase, a player must draw one card that is on the extreme right of any line of their choice.  Players must draw them in their turns in order to make combinations, which appear on the Kakemono board a the center of the table. That's is the way a player can score points on this game.<br/><br/>For example, in an attempt to make a Katyou Fugetsu kakemono player 1 will need 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 cards with the Animal mark on them. Player 1 can use 2 cards with the same number (for example 2) with the animal mark on it, and, as marked on the Kakemono board, he will score two points. Player 1 must put the button on the Kakemono board in the matching combination and no other player can make that combination again.<br/><br/>The end of the game arrives when each player has drawn 12 cards. In this phase, players gain points for each combination made, also if they used the 12 cards they drawn there is 2 extra points for those players. Each accessory card is equal to 1 extra point. Finally, players score how many kinds of fabric they used as listed on the kakemono board. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lonely Ice is a solo game in which 60 colored pyramids of three different sizes are distributed randomly across the playing board, which consists of 20 cards placed at 90-degree angles to one another. The goal is to move pyramids across the cards such that each card contains exactly three pyramids of the same color. Movement is restricted via two factors: the size of the pyramids and the angle of the playing card on which they sit. In order for the board state to change, a pyramid on one card must &quot;attack&quot; (trade places with) a pyramid on a neighboring card. This swapping of places will only be successful if the pyramid initiating the attack is at least as large as the pyramid that it's attacking. In addition, attacks can only occur from the short sides of the card toward the long sides of the card.<br/><br/>There is also an advanced version of the game in which 25 playing cards are used to create the board, and one extra color's worth of pyramids is used (meaning 25*3=75 pyramids for the advanced game.)<br/><br/>There are also two Extra Challenges. In the first, the win condition is increased to having each row only allowed to contain one color; and the win condition is further increased to requiring exactly one pyramid of each size on each card (with the row restriction still in place).<br/><br/>",

Players take turns playing their cards, with the value of the card determining how far they may move a pawn. Certain cards have special possibilities (a King or an Ace may be played to get a new pawn into play, while a four moves you back instead of forward). A few spaces on the board have special properties as well, requiring certain cards to be played to enter or leave them. If more than two players are playing, they play in teams, devils vs. angels. When you have brought all your own pawns to your safety zone, you must move your partner's pawns (without conferring with each other).<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     game board<br/>     32 playing pieces (marbles)<br/>     requires deck of cards to play (not included)<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player lines up three of the nine in front of themselves. (It's best if possible to use 3 different colours.)<br/><br/>Play begins by one player pressing the coop down, which starts the timer. The aim is then for that player to as quickly as possible throw the die and if it matches the colour of a chicken in his row, throw that chicken quickly into the coop. Grab another chicken for the row of three and roll again until the die doesn't match any chicken in your row. You then pass the die to the first player on your left who does have a matching chicken and their turn begins.<br/><br/>When the coop jumps up and chickens go flying the player with the die must gather them and collect three. The rest go out of play. Play continues until one player gets rid of all their chickens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This chess variant was developed by David Reynolds after reading a reference to chess being played on a circular board in medieval times.  Imagining how it might have played, he developed such a version.<br/><br/>His board consists of four rings (files) and sixteen radii (ranks) with a large, unplayable center circle.  Mr. Reynolds would often adorn the center with the crest of the city of Lincoln, U.K., thus the design is often referred to as a &quot;Lincoln board&quot;.<br/><br/>A standard set of chess pieces is used.  However, each player gets two ranks of pieces surrounded by two ranks of pawns.  The king and queen are placed on the innermost file (ring).  Movement mimics standard chess, allowing the rooks and queen to move fully around a ring.  Castling and en passant capturing are not allowed.<br/><br/>This variant is distinctly different from the Circular Chess variant designed by Alan and Martin Mattlage, in board layout, starting set-up, and rules.<br/><br/>This variant does use the same board as Byzantine Chess, but there are rule differences.<br/><br/>",

Twelve turns have elapsed when the pawn returns to the upper-left space. The red, green and blue coins can help Thrag battle against the beasts of a particular wizard.<br/><br/>When Thrag fights a blue foe, he can only flip a blue coin, and so on. The pawns of these colors represent three special weapons at Thrag&rsquo;s disposal.<br/><br/>The dice are used to randomize strengths on both sides of the battle. Aces count as 1s, Nulls count as 0s.<br/><br/>The black coins track Thrag&rsquo;s hit points. At game start, three of the coins are in use while the other three are in a face-up Healing Pool.

        "description": "Src:Card is a standalone 1-2 player (2-4 with expansion) card game that challenges players to build their own super robot core while attacking their opponent by writing code. Make your robot core as formidable as possible while creating code to attack and anticipate changes to your opponent's network. Src:Card is made for anyone interested in programming who has a love of gaming.  Birthed from a love of German style boardgames, computer strategy games and too much time programming, Src:Card incorporates real coding concepts that are challenging for experts and easy to learn for beginners.<br/><br/>In Src:Card players have statement (method, bug and structure) cards and cybernetic core cards in their hand throughout the game.  At the beginning of a turn a player will draw a new card. A player has the opportunity to harden the core of his/her robot's cybernetic core by adding nodes and firewall components.  Each player must balance increased strength attributes against the vulnerabilities that new core cards present. Each player desires to harden his/her robot's core as much as possible while delaying the eight card &quot;boot-up&quot; threshold.<br/><br/>At the same time, players are creating code using actual programming items to defeat their opponent's super robot. The placement of different loops, varying conditional statements and a multitude of functions allows each player to create dynamic, ever changing instructions of attack against their opponent. All components can be nested and with the addition of expansion packs, new functions and additional players are added to the game.<br/><br/>When a player has passed the 8-card &quot;boot-up&quot; threshold, their robot is alive and is open to attack from its opponents. Should an opponent defeat your robot, they will be victorious. However should you do the same, you will neutralise the threat of that nation&rsquo;s super robot and claim victory for your realm!<br/><br/>",

The first player to reach FINISH wins the game.<br/> PEOPLE:  Entries in this category may be living or dead, male or female, real or fictional.  Animals with personalities, such as Arthur and cartoon characters, like Bugs Bunny, are in the PEOPLE Category.  This category includes groups of people, such as The Beatles and The St. Louis Cardinals.  Occupations, such as fireman and plumber also appear in PEOPLE.<br/> PLACES:  Geographic locations such as oceans, countries, rivers and planets are in the PLACE category.  Man-made and natural places are also in this category.<br/> THINGS:  Objects that are not alive, items that do not belong in the other categories, and concepts (gravity and The Equator) are THINGS.  This category also includes animals, holidays and literature.<br/> YEARS:  The years in this category are those in which well-known events took place, like 1776; or recent years since 1990.<br/> Rules of Play<br/><br/>1.      The youngest player goes first, by selecting a card and saying, &ldquo;I am a ______(Person, Place, Thing or Year)&rdquo; as shown at the top of the card.  This player becomes that Person, Place, Thing or Year for this round, and is known as the Reader.  Readers should not show their cards to any other player.<br/>2.      Each card has clues numbered 1 through 20&mdash;there is one Person, Place, Thing or Year on each card.<br/>3.      The player on the Reader&rsquo;s left announces a number between 1 and 20, then covers that number on the board with a red chip.<br/>4.      The Reader reads the clue with the same number that the player on the Reader&rsquo;s left chose.<br/>5.      After listening to the clue, the player has 10 seconds to guess the Reader&rsquo;s identity.  Players may only guess on their turn, and must choose a clue before guessing.<br/><br/>    If the player guesses correctly, the player and the Reader determine their score (see Scoring, below), and move their playing pieces.  The player on the Reader&rsquo;s right becomes the new Reader.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If the player guesses incorrectly, play continues in a clockwise direction &ndash; the next player on the left chooses a number, covers it on the board with a red chip, listens to a clue, and guesses.  Continue until a player correctly guesses the Reader&rsquo;s identity.  There is no penalty for incorrect guesses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>6.      At any time, players may request that the Reader read all the clues already chosen.<br/><br/>Scoring: <br/>Each 20 Questions card has a value of 20 points.  All 20 points are divided between the Reader and the player who correctly guesses the Reader&rsquo;s identity.  The Reader receives 1 point (moves forward one space) for every number that is covered with a chip.  The Guesser receives 1 point for each unused chip.<br/><br/>Special Clues:<br/><br/>     When the Reader reads &ldquo;One free guess anytime,&rdquo; the player guesses immediately, and then takes a Free Guess Chip.  Players with Free Guess Chips play them before the start of another player&rsquo;s turn, and then guess.  After playing a Free Guess Chip, players return it to the edge of board.<br/>     &ldquo;Lose your turn&rdquo; means that play passes immediately to the next player &ndash; the current player may not guess.<br/>     Players move their pieces after hearing &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go back&rdquo; clues, then guess.  No player may be moved back from Start.<br/>     Players who receive a &ldquo;Choose a player to move&rdquo; clue may move any player&rsquo;s piece except their own.<br/>     &ldquo;Guess now and pick another number&rdquo; allows the player a free guess, before choosing a clue.  After the free guess, the same player chooses another number, listens to the clue, and guesses again.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Bonus Round: <br/>Any time that players end their move on a Bonus Space they may play a Bonus Round.  To play a Bonus Round, the Reader chooses a card from the deck and identifies it as a Person, Place, Thing or Year.  The Bonus Player announces 5 numbers, one at a time, which the Reader reads as they are chosen.  The Bonus Player may guess after hearing any of the 5 clues, but may only guess once during the Bonus Round.<br/> If the Bonus Player correctly guesses the Reader&rsquo;s identity after just one clue, the Bonus Player moves ahead 10 spaces.  If the Bonus Player needs more clues, scoring is as follows:<br/>2 clues = 8 spaces<br/>3 clues = 6 spaces<br/>4 clues = 4 spaces<br/>5 clues = 2 spaces<br/> When players land on a Bonus Space during the middle of a turn, the Reader continues with the card in play until a player guesses correctly, then starts the Bonus Round.  The Bonus Round ends if the Bonus Player chooses the &ldquo;Lose your turn&rdquo; clue.  The Bonus Player moves on &ldquo;Go Ahead&rdquo; and &ldquo;Go Back&rdquo; clues, then the Bonus Round continues.  The Reader does not move during a Bonus Round.<br/> Winning the Game:<br/>The first player to reach Finish wins the game.  Players need not land exactly on Finish to win.<br/><br/><br/>",

That card is then placed, face down on the table in front of them.  From there, players go back and forth playing one or two cards to raise their attack value above their opponents.  When someone finally passes, the owner of the last card played scores a successful attack.  The winner of the face-of then chooses one of their opponents cards and scores points equal to the number of paw prints.<br/><br/>After several face-offs, points are tallied and the player with the highest amount wins the battle.  The first player to win 3 battles sees his family come out on top.<br/><br/>",

Each one needs to buy 1 melon, 1 pizza, 1 carton of milk and 1 packet of cannelloni.<br/>One of the four will have the luck of the dice to help them be the first to bring home all the goods on their list.<br/><br/>Modern times have arrived for children from 4 years. The animals living in the village have ordered their shopping and are waiting for their deliveries from up to four distributors from the town. The deliveries should come quickly with their lorries.<br/>Unfortunately, it is rather difficult to find your way through the village. Take care not to lose your way - otherwise the pizza will be cold and the milk sour when you finally find your customer&acute;s house.<br/>Sometimes the distributors are distracted by the wonderful things on sale at the bakery and take long breaks instead of delivering their goods.<br/>With the help of Mrs Piggy, the dice and a good memory though, the distributors will find their way to deliver the goods to the waiting customers.<br/><br/>The high quality contents include:<br/>1 round game board &Oslash; 44 cm, 4 cars, 6 melons, 6 cartons of milk, 6 pizzas, 6 packets of cannelloni (pasta), 4 shopping lists, 12 door cards, 1 point dice, 1 symbol dice, instructions&quot;<br/><br/>",

The cheering Mexican soldiers, along with the accompanying bugle call of the &ldquo;Deguello&rdquo;, soon betrayed the surprise attack. Within an hour and a half, the entire garrison of 182 to 225 volunteers had been &ldquo;put to the sword,&rdquo; and General Santa Anna had won his victory at the cost of some 311 of his brave officers and soldiers. Even more, he created an American myth that began with the &ldquo;Deguello at Dawn&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dennis Bishop uses area movement, facing, ranged fire and melee combat to recreate this famous event in American History. Leaders play a big role in the game and rules for Col. James Bowie to determine if he's healthy and able to take part in the battle.<br/><br/>A unique twist on casualties is also used as the game has a large map (17&quot; x 22&quot;) and uses over 400 double sided unit counters (some that are 1&frac12;&quot; x &frac12;&quot;) as well as about 8-10 pages of rules and various game player aids.<br/><br/>Deguello at Dawn was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Balanko is touted as a &quot;new classic from the very first turn&quot; by its designer.  It is a straightforward manual dexterity game created by Canadian designer Jamie MacKinnon.<br/><br/>The game is mounted upon the box it is packaged in and consists of a rail upon which a steel ball rolls, a second tethered steel ball, ten scoring bins (50, 100, 150, 200 respectively), and two scoring tracks.<br/><br/>One player begins by releasing the steel ball from its holster, allowing it to roll along the rail.  The other player then attempts to knock said ball into one of the various scoring bins using the tethered ball; if that player misses, the other player may catch the swinging, tethered ball and immediately try their hand at knocking the rolling ball into a bin.<br/><br/>Play continues until one of the two players succeeds in scoring.  The object is to accumulate 1500 points (though any total works nicely).  It's harder than it sounds!<br/><br/>Balanko is wonderfully simple and accessible to almost anyone regardless of age (a suggested age of 3+ is more because of reasonably small pieces than anything else).  As it mounts directly onto its packaging, it's easily stored when not in use.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Deathtrap Dungeon card game came with some copies of the PC version of the Deathtrap Dungeon computer game by EIDOS. The cards themselves feature a whole host of nasties, including Skeletons, Orcs and Bloodbeasts. The game is actually based on an ancient Chinese card game called &quot;Zheng Shang Yu&quot;.<br/><br/>The goal of Deathtrap Dungeon is to 'kill' all the monsters by discarding cards, all of which have a creature on them. The quicker you do it the better. All the cards are dealt out and the player who gets the 'Exploding Pig' starts by discarding the Pig and another card.<br/><br/>Players arrange their cards into sets, e.g. Orcs, Skeletons, Bloodbeasts etc, and the first player puts down any number of cards from the same set, face up. The next player can then play if they can put down the same number of cards, but with a higher value. Therefore Four Skeletons, which are worth 3 each, could be followed by Four Warriors, which are worth 5 each. If a player cannot do this, they pass and play moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>The winner of the hand is the last player to put down the set with the highest value. This person then starts the next round. A note is made of the order the players finish in, and they are then ranked:<br/><br/>Winner = The Big Hero! <br/>2nd place = The Hero <br/>2nd to last place = The Wimp <br/>Last place = The Total Wimp!<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and re-dealt for the second round, but before the game begins again, The Total Wimp must hand over their 2 highest cards to The Big Hero and the Big Hero gives back any two of their cards. This also happens with The Wimp and The Hero. The game continue until 4 rounds have been played.<br/><br/>There are also Special cards in the deck. Also included are Chaindog and Red Lotus, two player characters from the computer game, and can be used to add to any set, however played on their own they have a value of 0. The Killing Machine, which can be played on its own at any time, stops a hand, the player that used it begins the next hand.<br/><br/>",

In the introductory game, the sharks circle around the outer board, attacking each other when they catch up or from the Circle or Attack spaces.  After each fight, the winner takes 5 prey tokens from the loser.  &quot;Starve&quot; and you lose a turn.  Other spaces make you lose or gain prey tokens, and the Feeding Frenzy space causes a fight royale.<br/><br/>In the full game, the inner part of the board represents the prey population; when your movement allows, you can &quot;dip&quot; into and out of this part of the board to eat prey.  Prey reproduces periodically, replenishing the inner board.  Whoever fed the most after 10 to 20 rounds (depending on the number of players) wins.  But if you're too greedy and you wipe out all prey, all sharks starve and everyone loses!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brain Baseball simulates America's favorite pastime with a special deck of cards.<br/><br/>The pitcher pitches the ball by playing a card.  The other players swing at the ball in turn by playing a card lower than the pitch and higher than previous swings.  The last player to play a card is the batter.  The other players try to catch the ball by playing a card higher than the ball and higher than previous catches.  The ball is scored by whoever catches it, or by the batter if nobody catches it, or by the pitcher if nobody hits it.  Cards are worth standard values, except aces are worth 15 and deuces are worth 14.  All batting and fielding cards are discarded and the player who scored the ball begins the next round as the pitcher.<br/><br/>Brain Baseball was originally released in August 1998 as a limited-edition game.  It was made with leftover bid cards from a poorly sorted print run of Give Me the Brain!, and contained four sets of Bid cards ranging from 1 to 15.  Brain Baseball was included in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jacksonville: the Beaches of Doom is a hypothetical &quot;what if?&quot; depiction of an invasion of the USA. in 1997, following a major War in Europe by about 15 years, according to the game description. Published in JagdPanther magazine which was renamed BATTLEFIELD as of this issue #15, OCT 1976. This was also the final issue of the magazine.<br/><br/>Game Equipment consists of the following: a game Mapsheet-17-inches by 28-inches; a RULES section; a large double-sheet pull-out; 2-Sets of thin Game Counters; while players will have to provide their OWN 6-sided DIE.<br/><br/>The Mapsheet is overall WHITE with BLUE water features and BLACK print for other terrain. The Game Counters are Light BLUE &amp; Light PINK with Darker Color silhouettes for each of the various Unit types such as: Tanks; S.P. Artillery; Towed Artillery; Helicopters; Cruise Missile Launchers; Naval Units; Air Units; and Infantry Types. Altogether, there are 44 different types of units, including Hovercraft (Soviet), IL-44 Medium Bomber (Soviet), US Army XM-2 Tank (M1-Abrams?), Soviet Aircraft Carriers, and even the U.S.N. Battle cruiser TEXAS! The pull-out Sheet has the Terrain Effects Chart, Base Attack Table &amp; explanation, Anti-Ship Bombardment Table &amp; explanation, Summary of Sequence of Play, Combat Results Table, Anti-Aircraft Table, Air-to-Air Combat Results Table, Bombardment Table, and Strategic Display with nearby bases of Pensacola, Atlanta, Montgomery, Georgetown, U.S. &amp; Soviet Rear Areas, Havana, Bermuda, a Beachhead area and Soviet Fleet Carrier displays.<br/><br/>The RULES are very detailed and concise for being only 4 pages long, Front &amp; Back printed. We ended up making our own &quot;crude&quot; Strategic Rear Area/Fleet Display in order to increase its size for game play. Game length is 18 turns representing 6 days and each Player Turn consists of 15 Phases (including Advanced-Air) so if you exclude the AIR game, the turns will proceed quicker.<br/><br/>The BATTLEFIELD (formerly JagdPanther) magazine was a variant filled production from a team that would go on to found Task Force games. The magazine featured contributions by Alan Emrich, Robert C. Smith, James Frediani, James Simms, Howard Anderson, Mike Smith, Hershel M. Sarnoff, David Kopel, David Curtis, Andy Webber, David Jameson, John M. Astell, Paul F. Stevenson, John Mischon, Michael Forbes, Eric Kyllo, John Berry, plus many others. Thanks to all of THEM for their many informed and added game play contributions. This issue has been rereleased in PDF format by Amarillo Design Bureau.<br/><br/>",

The most recent mission went awry and now you know there are others vying for the Captain&rsquo;s ear. You must expose these others before they expose you. Use your guile and wit to &lsquo;take care of&rsquo; the other spies until you are the only spy left to win.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>Deal each player an identity card. The identity cards will have a name and 2 roles on it. The roles allow you to do take actions (See role cards for list of actions). You may also bluff to take the other actions, but if another player calls your bluff, you are exposed and you lose (see bluffing on next card).<br/><br/>Bluffing: When you use a role, someone may call you a liar. If they do, reveal your card to them. If the used role is one of the two on your card, they lose and reveal their card. If you bluffed and got caught, you lose and reveal your card. You cannot lie about whether an assassin or accuser correctly guessed your identity.<br/><br/>There are 3 green and 3 blue roles. Each identity has 1 green and 1 blue. There are no repeats of combinations. When cards are discarded, discard them facedown. When the draw pile runs out, do not reshuffle the discard pile. When the draw pile is empty, powers that require drawing a card cannot be used.<br/><br/>Each turn you may take any action on the roles card. Everyone has access to black actions (they are always safe). If players use a green or blue action, their opponents may call their bluff. When an opponent is the target of a spy or assassinate, they may use the sentinel or facade actions to counter them. These 2 blue actions do not require an action to use (though they can still be bluffs).<br/><br/>When you think an opponent has sentinel, be sure to accuse them  because they will block an assassination attempts.<br/><br/>Roles:<br/>Accuse (Black) - Guess a player&rsquo;s identity. If you are right they die, otherwise you die.<br/>Invent (Black) - Discard your identity and draw a new one.<br/>Assassinate (Green) - Guess a player&rsquo;s identity, if you are right they die.<br/>Spy (Green) - Look at another player&rsquo;s identity.<br/>Disguise (Green) - Draw a new Identity then discard one.<br/>Sentinel (Blue) - Prevent Assassination.<br/>Facade (Blue) - Prevent Spy.<br/>Scour (Blue) - Look through discard pile or draw pile (shuffle draw pile after).<br/><br/>In the Mace Exclusive version of Exploit!, all the green keywords are red!<br/><br/>",

The player needs to find where they are hidden and catch them before anyone else can, and whoever collects more elves on his cards wins.<br/><br/>How do the elves hide in your house? They get a little help from the players. In the basic game, the cards have one, two or three elves on them, and these cards are split evenly among the players. The players then go into different rooms in the house and hide the cards, with the one elf cards being fully visible, the two elf cards being half hidden, and the three elf cards being completely hidden. Players then start from a central location and hunt for cards, staying away from the room in which they hid cards since they already know where to find those elves!<br/><br/>La Chasse aux Lutins includes a variant that uses cards with mischievous elves. These are hidden along with the other elf cards, and if a player finds at least three of these cards, he scores an additional three points that's added to his elf score. If he finds only one or two of these cards, however, he scores no bonus and must throw away one of the elf cards he collected!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ancient Egyptians hid treasures in their pyramids, and protected them with dangerous traps. Each player picks a pair of colors, and either gains or loses coins based on where those researchers land. Support your team colors and delay the others to win!<br/><br/>Unlike other games, you do not play a single color in Pairamid.  Each player always plays in two colors, and these are indicated by Pyramid Markers placed in front of each player.  You might share Pyramid colors with another player.<br/><br/>The first player rolls all the dice, and selects one die to place on the board -- the die does not need to match your own color!  The player places the die on the matching square on the board, then moves the matching researcher the number of spaces indicated on the die.  The player then passes the remaining dice to the next player.<br/><br/>When moving a researcher:<br/><br/>- Spaces occupied by another researcher are jumped over and are not counted.<br/>- If the researcher reaches a space with either the White Scarab or Black Scarab, they stop on that space.<br/><br/>The White Scarab will always be in a white chamber, which will have a positive score listed on the board.  When a researcher is moved to a space with the White Scarab, all players with a Pyramid Marker matching the color of the researcher receive the number of Treasure Tokens indicated on the board.  Similarly, the Black Scarab will always be in a black chamber, and all players with a Pyramid Marker matching a researcher in a chamber with the Black Scarab will lose the number of Treasure Tokens indicated on the board.  In both cases, this causes the Scarab to be moved to the next chamber matching its color (from +1 to +2 to +3 and so on for the White Scarab, and from -1 to -2 to -3 and so on for the Black Scarab).<br/><br/>The Great Chamber may be used as a shortcut by one researcher at a time.  It is also the final room for both Scarabs, counting as +7 as well as -7.  When a researcher enters the Great Chamber after a Scarab has been placed there, that color is scored as normal (+7 or -7 for the matching color), and the game ends.  The player with the most Treasure Tokens wins!<br/><br/>WHAT THEY'LL LEARN: Working in Teams, Planning Ahead, Evaluating Options<br/><br/>",

A competitive atmosphere is in place as the players bid to prove their worth on the journey by accomplishing Duties and navigating through whirlpools.<br/><br/>A network of arrows make up the routes from start to finish.  Each player equal numbers of counters (of all colors); they move the raft up to 3 arrows (and only along their direction) on their turns by using up counters of the same color as shown on the last whirlpool traversed (the initial departure from Peru can use counters of any color).  When the raft moves onto a whirlpool, it must stop there.  The active player receives a Navigational Certificate and changes the direction of the whirlpool's arrows and its color.  Aside from these certificates, players can receive Duty cards if they land the raft on an arrow that is connected to the Duty tiles placed on the board.<br/><br/>The game ends when the raft reaches the island of Raroio.  The players sum up the points given for their Navigation Certificates and sets of Duty cards.  The winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

According to Bård Gamnes, one of the designers, the difficulty of questions are meant for &quot;those who are about to start with their higher education&quot;.<br/><br/>The questions on the cards are divided into six different terms:<br/><br/>     Power and Forces<br/>     Chemistry and Biology<br/>     Computers and Gadgets<br/>     Experiments and Explosions<br/>     Numbers<br/>     Engineer Mix<br/><br/><br/>GAME:<br/>After each player or team has placed their token in the middle and thus &quot;outside&quot; the primary playing area (much as in Pachisi), the players take turns rolling the die and moving their token onto the orbital game area, starting on one of the six rhombic fields of choice. Now and on each following turn every player may choose which way he wants to move his token on the orbital playing area. Each field the player stops on, except one that gives the player allowance to re-roll the die, is linked to a category, which another player asks him by reading from the top card from the question-card deck.<br/><br/>There are six fields that are obligatory to visit to collect point cards, one for each category. After that the player must try to stop on of the six rhombus shaped areas to access the middle area again, where they started. Now the player is challenged in two different and randomly chosen categories, and he needs to answer correct on both two win.<br/><br/>The game is for 2 - 4 teams or players.<br/><br/>",

The deck of cards &ndash; which contains nine each of elephant, cat and mouse, along with three marmosets &ndash; is shuffled and placed in front of the dealer, a position that rotates each round.<br/><br/>In a round, the dealer deals three cards face-down to different players (except when only two are in the game). Players reveal these cards simultaneously, then they must quickly determine which animal is victorious among those revealed &ndash; elephant, cat, mouse, &quot;no winner&quot; &ndash; and grab the correct coconut. If a player does so, he claims the cards revealed; if he goofs, he receives a penalty point. Collect three of these, and you're booted out of the jungle.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, the game ends. Players score three points for each marmoset collected, one point for each other animal and negative one point for each penalty. High score wins.<br/><br/>The game includes two variants: In one, six &quot;disguise&quot; cards are mixed into the deck, and when a disguise is turned up, then for that round all cats are instead mice (or elephants are cats, etc.) In the second variant, the disguise cards are used along with defense cards, such as an elephant depicted with cheese; in this case, the cheese distracts the mice, so the mice will lose to elephants.

        "description": "Atmosfear: The Ultimate Conflict combines Atmosfear: The Harbingers with Atmosfear: The Soul Rangers, for the ultimate challenge. A VHS tape is used to time the game, but the timers have a greater challenge than time itself.<br/><br/>Your first challenge is to defeat the Gatekeeper, guardian of The Other Side, and host of &quot;The Harbingers&quot;. He plays dirty, and plays to win. Players build the game board and race to choose their Harbinger and gain powers, and then fight to collect six keys which will allow them to face their greatest fear. Those who fail to become Harbingers in time will become Soul Rangers, who can only steal keys from other players.<br/><br/>After defeating the Gatekeeper, you can flip the reversible board over and meet your new host. The demented dentist, Dr Mastiff, leader of &quot;The Soul Rangers&quot;. The Dr. now challenges you to lose all your keys and make your way back home. But the only way to lose your keys is to give them to the other Soul Rangers by duelling them.<br/><br/>Each game is complete within one hour, and no game is ever the same twice...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shootout! The High Noon Card Game casts you and your friends as cowboys in the wild west. The most dangerous duelist is the one who makes the best hand possible. Once you've got the best weapons, the most impressive title, and familiarized yourself with your foe, you'll want to pick a fight with someone else at the table- If they don't come looking for trouble before you're ready for 'em. Experience tense, high-stakes western duels as players square off one by one until the last gunslinger standing wins. It is best suited for 2-6 players ages 9 and up and a round takes about 5 minutes per player.<br/><br/>To begin every player is dealt five cards. Each turn a player reveals a card, draws a card, and discards a card before the turn passes to the next. The heart of the game is the information a player gives about what they are already holding by what they choose to take and what they discard. Using this information (or misinformation, at the highest levels of play) allows you to improve your chances by reading your opponent and evaluating your options-- It's basically the super-exciting high-stakes game of poker that only exists in the movies.<br/><br/>The lean, 88-card deck has been balanced to a very deliberate point to make it an ideal family game. Special cards are very clear and provide their entire ruels explanation on them in order to keep the fun moving along. The elements of chance allow children, grandparents, and those totally unfamiliar with games to still have a fair chance of turning things around and winning in the end without leaving the outcome purely to chance like many other family games. This game was built from the start to provide fast, clear, fun gameplay that rewards investment without demanding any from the player. The game is light on text and appropriate for all ages.<br/><br/>",

Alternatively, if a player can collect five cores before their mech is destroyed, they win the game.<br/><br/>Within the 72 card Outchasers starter pack is everything 2 people need to play the game; 6 Pilots and 6 Mechs to combine however you choose, 5 of 10 Cores randomly placed into each game, and 48 Equipment cards split between each player.   With multiple strategic formats of varying difficulties, every single head-to-head match offers the perfect balance of strategy and luck to make sure each game is a unique experience, all brought to life by the amazing art of Brett Nienburg.<br/><br/>",

Czekacie aż piąty gracz wyjdzie z łazienki lub wr&oacute;ci ze sklepu, byście mogli w końcu zacząć grać w grę już rozłożoną na stole? ;)<br/><br/>Wyciągnijcie &quot;Takie Życie!&quot;<br/><br/>Jeden z Was dobiera losową kartę.<br/>Czyta kr&oacute;tką, acz niezwykłą historię, ale wsp&oacute;łgraczom ujawnia tylko wskazany kawałek.<br/>A teraz wsp&oacute;łgracze zadając pytania muszą dojść do tego, co tak naprawdę się wydarzyło!<br/>Oczywiście nie jest to proste, bo historie, mimo, że wydarzyły się naprawdę to są czasami naprawdę niewiarygodne! Dlatego każda z nich ma kilka kluczowych pytań zaznaczonych na karcie, kt&oacute;re, jeśli zostaną zadane przez odgadujących, nie tylko dają im punkty, ale przede wszystkim pozwalają im zrozumieć, że podążają właściwym tropem!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Become the richest billionaire alive! Bluff your way to keep your assets and outwit your opponent to bankrupt them while you're ahead.<br/><br/>Each turn in Bluffing Billionaires, the active player must play an asset card from their hand face-down to the table, claiming to be the richest billionaire with the highest card on the table. If the active player has a previously played face-down card, discard that card face-down to their own discard pile. If there are no other face-down cards on the table, the turn then passes clockwise and the next player on the left becomes the active player. If there are any other face-down asset card(s) on the table, the owner(s) of those cards may approve or challenge the active player by performing agreed gestures simultaneously, such as thumbs up or thumbs down.<br/><br/>Approve (Thumb Up) : You believe the active player played a higher card than yours, and therefore did not wish to challenge them. If all other players approves unanimously, the turn passess clockwise and the next player become the active player.<br/><br/>Challenge (Thumb Down) : You DON&rsquo;T believe the active player played a higher card than yours, and therefore wish to call their bluff. More than one player might challenge the active player simultaneously.<br/><br/>Challenge<br/>When a challenge occurs, all challengers flip over their last played Asset cards to compare the value individually with the active player who then will also flip over their card. Two outcomes are possible:<br/><br/>If the active player&rsquo;s card is not higher than a challenger&rsquo;s card, hence falsely claiming to be richer, the active player lose against that challenger.<br/><br/>If the active player&rsquo;s card is higher than the challenger&rsquo;s card, hence proofing his claim, the active player wins against that challenger.<br/><br/>The winner of a challenge then take a random card from the loser&rsquo;s hand, placing it face-up on a separate Bonus pile as a compensation that will be scored at the end of the game as bonus Points. Additionally, if there is only one challenger, the winner of the challenge also take the loser&rsquo;s revealed card, placing it face-up on the Bonus pile.<br/><br/>The active player might have mixed results in a challenge, winning against one challenger, but losing to another, which is completely normal. Resolve each result in clockwise player order starting from the active player.<br/><br/>After a Challenge had completely resolved, discard all cards revealed this turn to their owner's Discard pile and the play then passes to the next player on the left of the Target player.<br/><br/>End Game &amp; Scoring<br/>When an active player plays the last card from their hand, the game immediately ends and scoring begins.<br/><br/>All Asset cards still held in hands scores as many Points as their listed face-value. Plus, count all the Coin symbols from other player&rsquo;s cards that you keep in your Bonus pile as bonus Points.<br/><br/>The player with the biggest Points is the winner and become the new Bluffing Billionaire. In case of a tie, the player with more sum of Coin symbols wins. In case of further tie, all tied players share the victory or play again to determine the real winner!<br/><br/>",

Each player has a limited amount of time to build a criminal empire and build up their cash reserves so that they can out bid their opponents for the coveted diamonds. <br/>Each player will take on the role of Kingpin, Fence, Pickpocket, and Corrupt Politician to prove that they the are the best at being bad.<br/><br/>Game play <br/>As soon as the dealer is ready, they start the timer. They do not have to wait for the rest of the players to be ready. As soon as the timer is started the dealer begins drawing cards one at a time from the Crime Card deck and either giving it to the player to their left or adding it to their hand and giving the player to their left a card from their hand. This continues with cards being passed around the circle this way until time runs out. <br/>Once time runs out, starting with the dealer each player takes a turn biding for one of the diamonds. One at a time each player states the value of their bid and places the cards that they are using for their bid face down in front of them. Each bid must consist of only one type of Crime Card. You cannot have a mix of cards with different values. Once all the players have bid, the player with the highest remaining bid wins and takes a diamond from the middle pile. The first player to accumulate five diamonds wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(&quot;Edycja Rodzinna&quot; is Polish for &quot;Family Edition&quot;.)<br/><br/>Like in other games from this series, to win you need more than knowledge. You have to know your opponents well in order to predict how they will answer their questions. In the family edition of iKnow, this factor is more important than it was before, because you will not only bet if your opponent answers correctly or not, but also you will have a chance to outsmart your rivals. In this edition, you choose one out of four answers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nines is a simple game that uses two decks of standard cards with jokers included, and is based almost entirely on luck.<br/><br/>Players are dealt nine cards each, and they proceed to line them up into three vertical columns (3 cards per column). They each then turn over two cards that are in different columns.<br/><br/>The goal of Nines is to have the fewest points at game end by getting columns with matching cards (e.g. three 4's in one column). Matching cards in a column essentially &quot;cancels out&quot; that column and the total value of those three cards is zero.<br/><br/>After all cards are dealt, a single card is flipped over from the top of the draw pile. Starting to the left of dealer, a player's turn consists of drawing a single card either from the discard pile or the draw deck. If the player takes a card from the draw deck, they may look at it and either discard it or replace one of the cards in their current play area (can replace either face up or face down). If they choose to replace a card, they have to discard the one they replaced. Taking a card from the discard pile means they have to replace one of their cards, and then discard the one they replaced.<br/><br/>The game end is triggered when one person has all of their cards turned face up. Then, every other person gets one more turn. On this final turn, players do get the option of turning one of their own cards over.<br/><br/>After the game is over, the players turn over any face down cards. If a face down card matches the face up cards in its column, that column of cards counts as zero points. All points are then tallied.<br/><br/>The cards all have different values. Jokers are worth negative three points, aces and kings are both worth zero points, jacks and queens are ten points each, and the numbered cards have point values equal to the number on the card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bad Decisions introduces a new line of party card games from Diamond Dust Dreams Inc., the creators of Kitsune: of Foxes and Fools. Because of the MadLibs-inspired storytelling twist to this game, each prompt (Story) card can set up literally hundreds of different situations. The judge (called the Bard, in keeping with the storytelling theme) plays cards for whichever of the categories (Fool, Crisis or Bad Decision) come up in the first two blanks on that Story card; the other Players complete the story by anonymously playing a card from their hands to fill the final blank. The Bard chooses the winning Story ending, and passes the role of Bard on to the next Player to the left.<br/><br/>Because you can't make the dumbest stories up, the cards in the core set have themes of bad decisions in headline news and technology, the latter being decided on by a vote of the kickstarter backers. Both themes are populated by hilariously wrong cards drawn from news stories and anecdotes researched from various online and print sources, or sometimes personally related to the creators of the game.<br/><br/>",

This is a stop-gap game in the sense that is provides exciting passtime activity for children above ten and even adults. The point is that the game enables you to re-play four campaigns of the 16th century /they took place actually/ with a relatively high degree of faithfulness to reality. This game is not the usual simple one you play with dice, it requires brains, tactics and good strategic ideas. If there are two players, one is the commander-in-chief of the Turkish army the other one is that of the Hungarian one. They take steps on the battlefield /the table/ which is authentic both historically and geographically.<br/>While stepping forward - in line with their strategic ideas - they fight each other, protect or storm fortresses. In case of more players the countries may be divided among them, e.g. the players can be commanders of a Northern Hungarian castle or that of a Transdanubian fortress respectively...()<br/>We sincerely hope that this short piece of information arouse your interest in this type of game outstanding also in its design, and being the first of its kind - since historical strategic games are just about to be spread in Hungary...()<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Buntu Circus was independently published by a group of UK gamers calling themselves The Buntu Circus. It is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The board is divided into a 14 x 14 grid. Each square has a combination of one of eight colours and one of twelve symbols, arranged in a symmetrical pattern on the board.<br/><br/>A deck of cards has one card per square on the board, matching colour and symbol. Each player gets a hand of eight cards and a set of counters and rubber hoops in their own colour. These are metallic colours, distinct from the board colours.<br/><br/>In turn each player draws and then plays a card from their hand, placing or removing a counter on one of the appropriate squares on the board - each colour and symbol combination appears in two places on the board, and has two cards which can match.<br/><br/>The idea is to get a number of linked rows of five counters in your colour, orthogonally and/or diagonally. The target number of rows depends on the number of players - five in a two player game and less if there are more players. Once a row has been formed, it is designated by placing hoops over each of the counters in the row.<br/><br/>There are couple of further wrinkles. Most importantly are the &quot;power&quot; colours. At the start, each player has power in a single board colour, determined randomly. This allows the player to use a card of that colour to move an counter on the board (their own or another player's) either to an adjacent square of that colour or from a square of that colour to an adjacent square. Creating a row of five gains the player power over the colour of the middle square of the row - this is marked by removing the central counter from its hoop and placing it on one of the power colour markers to the side of the board. In this way players gain power over new colours. If another player already has power in that colour, their power is removed - but the player who gained power merely displaces them - they do not gain power in the colour. Gaining power over a colour in which you already have power reinforces power in the colour. The player &quot;hoops&quot; the power counter and this prevents any other player from gaining a row that would give them power in that colour. In effect they have a &quot;lock&quot; on that colour. A final wrinkle comes with the discard piles. Played cards can be discard to one of four face-up piles. Once one of the four &quot;draw&quot; decks is exhausted, the adjacent discard pile is turned over - but not shuffled. This allows long-term strategies of &quot;stacking&quot; the deck with particular colours or symbols.<br/><br/>The quality of the components is superb. The board is big and colourful, the symbols clear and distinct. The player's counters are chunky plastic discs which come in little cannisters like pill-boxes. The hoops are rubber-like rings which come in individual cloth bags. Very satisfying to &quot;hoop&quot; your rows with.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "M&uuml;ckenstich is a trick-taking card game with four suits, with each suit having cards numbered 1-12 (with two 12s) and three mosquitoes; a mosquito has no number but is the highest card in a suit.<br/><br/>Each round, players start with a number of cards in hand, then discard two of those cards face down. For the most part, M&uuml;ckenstich follows traditional trick-taking rules. The active player lays down a card, then each other player follows by playing a single card, following suit, if possible. Whenever a mosquito is played, that player declares one color to be trump. (The game starts with no trump color.) A mosquito or 12 played later in the round is considered higher than one played earlier. Once all players have laid down a card, the highest trump card (if any) wins the trick; with no trump, the highest card in the suit led for the round wins the trick. Players keep track of tricks won, and the winner of a trick leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>Once all tricks have been played, the single player with the fewest tricks names one suit to count double during scoring, then the single player with the most mosquitoes names one of the three remaining suits to be worthless. Then players tally their points: The first mosquito in a suit is worth -5 points, while all other mosquitos are worth 0. Suited cards are worth 0-2 depending on whether they are worthless, scored as normal, or doubled.<br/><br/>After a number of rounds equal to the number of players (or twice as many rounds with three players), the player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/><br/>In Danger, players draw numbered and colored cards, trying to collect as many points as possible in each color each round without exceeding the limit of 15 points.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck and places it in front of her in a row for cards of that color; some cards are multicolor, and the player chooses in which row to play these cards. After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.<br/><br/>If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.<br/><br/>If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.<br/><br/>Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/><br/>Zwickern is a public-domain card game of the fishing variety, in which the game starts with a pool of cards on the table and players try to claim these cards for points by using the cards in their hands. Most cards have a single number in the corner to show their value when being played, while some cards have two numbers (e.g., 2/12) and cards like these can be either value when played or when lying on the table; each card also has a victory point value.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player plays one card from her hand and either:<br/><br/>    Buys cards from the display (using an 8, for example, to buy a 5 and 3, or an 8, or all three cards)<br/>    Builds a pile of cards (by adding or subtracting the card played with a card or pile already on the table, or vice versa)<br/>    Plays to the table (making the card available for piles or buys on future turns)<br/><br/><br/>After players play out the few cards in their hand, they receive a few more cards. After a certain number of rounds, the game ends and players sum the points of the cards they've collected, earning additional points for collecting the most cards and for buying all cards on display during a turn. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Challenge: The earth is our Planet A. It is worth the effort to protect it, because there is no Planet B. Rising CO2 emission and a plastic torrent overwhelm our sensitive ecosystem; climate change and species extinction arise with all consequent changes. Strive against that and save our blue planet. In the process, ecological calamities and forever outdated political parties get in your way. Do not give in. We save the earth step by step - as long as everyone contributes.<br/><br/>Solution: By the use of 105 different cards about sustainability , the players face up with all kinds of environmentally friendly everyday items and ideas. With realistic tasks and practical ideas, the game throws a bridge into the real life and is thought-provoking. Playfully learning with a lot of fun plus making the world a bit better.<br/><br/>Description of the game: All players have to fulfil a secret task: either to collect certain thematic cards in their hand or to help the team Planet A get a collection in the middle of the table. Whoever accomplishes three tasks at first wins. Ecological calamity cards, environmental hero cards and environmental activist cards whirl the game and encourage discussions on sustainability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

No background knowledge is needed to enjoy Legendary Showdown: Presidential Edition or plan your epic victory.<br/><br/>Each player controls a line of presidents. At the end of each round, the presidents at the front of each player's line will engage in battle. The victor continues battling, and the rest are removed.<br/><br/>To ensure your president's victory, there are numerous underhanded strategies you can employ.  You can give your presidents special bonuses that increase their strength, or you can give your opponents terrible bonuses to put them at a disadvantage.<br/><br/>You can also play cards to rearrange the order of your line, allowing a stronger president to compete, or rearrange the order of another player's line, forcing them to use a weak president.<br/><br/>Facedown cards can be employed to give your president a secret point bonus or ability, so you can never be sure which player is in the lead.<br/><br/>Action and instant cards allow you to mess with another player's strategy or swap your weaker presidents for stronger candidates.<br/><br/>The round continues until all players but one declare they are ready for battle by passing on their turns instead of playing cards. Players can gain a strategic advantage by delaying their actions until later in the round, but waiting too long might cause the battle to start before you've made your move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board is composed of 25 rooms joined by many doorways.  Some of the doorways are blocked by barrels.  Each turn, a player rolls a die to determine the number of steps to move from room to room.  For each step, the player moves her marker one space, may then reposition one barrel, and then must move the ringmaster one space towards herself following the shortest path.  Players can't move through barrels or into occupied rooms.  The ringmaster can't move through barrels (or reposition them) but may move through other players.  If the ringmaster 'catches' the active player, the game ends and all other players win.<br/><br/>Stumpy the Cave Boy was originally slated for release as CAG 012 in October 1997.  A last minute decision removed it from the production schedule.  The game was retooled as Escape from Dork Tower and published in John Kovalic's Dork Tower in 1999.  Stumpy the Cave Boy became a celebrated martyr of Cheapass Games, and stock number 012 has been retired.  It was finally published in Chief Herman's Holiday Fun Pack.<br/><br/>",

The military function of each letter is connected to its pronunciation. In the Advanced version, 51 Kanji ideograms are introduced. These represent the technological progress of the player's nation. Adjective Kanji enhance the powers of the Hiragana, while Verb Kanji give the player more actions to take. In the Full version, 49 new Kanji are introduced, as well as the Katakana alphabet. With the noun Kanjis come cities which add valuable infrastructures such as Forts, Factories and Railroads.<br/><br/>As the game goes from simple to complex, your Japanese goes from nothing to 192 characters.<br/><br/>",

Will you be the fastest to react once the right combination of the chillies is shown?<br/><br/>A fast-paced observe-and-act card game for the entire family, where the situation is continually changing. The player with the highest number of cards wins.<br/><br/>How to play?<br/>Put the three double-sided cards with tasks (coloured edge) within easy reach of all players in the middle of the table.<br/>Shuffle the remaining cards and deal 12 (16) of them to each player. Players keep their cards face down in a drawing pile in front of them. <br/>The active player turns their top card and puts it on their discard pile, face up. If one of the conditions shown on the task cards is met, the players try to be the fastest to cover the corresponding task card with their hand.<br/><br/>The conditions of task cards:<br/><br/>     All cards are showing 6 different kinds of chillies (some of them can be represented multiple times but each of them MUST be represented at least once).<br/>     At least 5 identical peppers are being shown.<br/>     Exactly 2 pairs (2 peppers of one and 2 peppers of another kind) are being shown.<br/><br/><br/>If multiple conditions are being met at the same time, the first player to cover the highest priority task card wins the round. The player who wins the round chooses and takes any of the discard piles with one of the cards helping to meet the condition on the top. He places these cards at the bottom of his drawing pile.<br/>The game ends when a player discards the last card from their drawing pile. The player with the highest sum of cards in their drawing pile and their discard pile(s) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sack Armies is a fantasy-based battle game for 2-6 players with strategic, operational, and tactical elements.  It was released several years ago, but implemented many innovative mechanisms (at the time) and an well-designed elegant system.<br/><br/>It was marketed as a Collectible Token Game; however, the &ldquo;collectability&rdquo; aspect is almost completely mitigated by two factors: 1. A clever army construction mechanism and 2. The fact that there was only one big edition published.  This game is NOT an example of whoever-spends-the-most-money on starters and boosters wins, but rather whoever is the better general wins.  It is probably still worth noting that the game tokens come in Starter (aka Army) packs and Booster (aka Reinforcement) packs.<br/>  <br/>There are the usual suspects in any fantasy game (orcs, goblins, elves, magic, etc.); however, this game is not about questing and adventuring, but rather about the field of battle.  The key to winning is strategic planning, achieving operational objectives, and tactical execution.  A player wins by capturing all the opponent&rsquo;s battlefields or eliminating all the opponent&rsquo;s units.<br/><br/>",

Being part of the gang you&rsquo;ll have to take as much money as possible from the safe till the sheriff comes. But, as you know, a gangster riding a single-seated bike-plane hybrid can&rsquo;t be trusted since you can get into a shootout and try to steal all the money for yourself. Load barrels, check parachutes &mdash; it is going to be epic.<br/><br/>Sky Heist is a fun card game that requires fast reaction. Each turn players discard cards into a loot deck using combinations. Besides they can play different special cards and also put the cards from their hands into a &ldquo;revolver&rdquo; area which limits their opportunities during the game but helps in the final duel. There are several sheriff cards inevitably causing the duel in which the card combinations that are put into the players&rsquo; revolvers are very important. As a result of the duel all the cards from the loot deck are shared as victory points among players. The game lasts for several rounds and the one who has got the most victory points becomes a winner.<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn, they choose an opponent who doesn't have the most cards on the table in front of them and challenges them to a bout of either strength or speed. Each player chooses a card in hand, then reveals them simultaneously. If your card overcomes the value that your opponent played, then you win the bout automatically &mdash; unless you each overcame the other's number, in which case the bout is a tie.<br/><br/>If no one overcame the other, then you compare the values of the cards themselves. In a strength bout, whoever played the higher value wins; in a speed bout, the lower value wins; in a tie, the bout is a tie. If a single player played their victory card, then they automatically win &mdash; unless the other player did the same, in which case you tie.<br/><br/>The winner of the bout returns their victorious card to hand (except for the victory card, which is a one-shot effect), while the loser places their card face up on the table in front of them. The winner receives a championship belt token, then the next player in clockwise order chooses an opponent.<br/><br/>In a bout, before both players reveal their cards, they count to three, and while they're doing this, a third player can interrupt by playing one card against one of the cards in the bout. If the interrupting player overcomes that player's card, they win the bout and receive a championship belt token, returning that card to hand. If they don't overcome the card, they place their card face up on the table, then the bout resumes.<br/><br/>When one player has three pairs of card values face up in front of themselves (e.g., 1/1/2/2/3/3), then the game ends. This player loses, and whoever has the most championship belt tokens wins!<br/><br/>",

The game details ten of these events, eight of which are playable out-of-the-box (with two others requiring &quot;Direct Hit Battle&quot; accessories, which are sold separately).<br/><br/>The ten events are:<br/><br/><br/>     Direct Hit Battle: Shoot at each other from across the arena, trying to disable your opponent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     B-Daman Blast : Shoot knock-down targets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Hard Target: Shoot marbles through a five-arch gate at the five pins standing on the other side.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     B-Daman Invasion: Knock a sliding puck across your opponent's goal line.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     B-Daman Assault: Similar to B-Daman Blast, except that now your opponent is also trying to hit the knock-down targets from the other side of the arena.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Shoot the Gap: Shoot your marble between pins without knocking any down.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     DHB Havoc: Shoot marbles through two-arch gates, attempting to disable your opponent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Battle Hammer: Drive the sliding puck for distance.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     B-Dachallenge: Set up a free-form obstacle course and challenge the other player to make a trick shot.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Ultimate Strike: Six-pin bowling.<br/><br/><br/>For tournament play, a spinner chooses which events will be contested. The player winning two out of three events is the tournament champion.<br/><br/>",

There are three games that can be played: Costly Tricks for 2 players, Buddy On Your Left for three players and The Third Man for four players.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>Costly Tricks: a trick-taking game for 2 players in which you must pay for your tricks!<br/>The players see the entire deck after it has been dealt out to themselves and their &quot;invisible partners&quot;. They take turns playing cards for themselves and their partners with trump shifting when they cannot follow suit. Cards are worth their face value (0 to 10), but tricks cost 20 points! Thus they want to take the valuable tricks and make their opponent take the costly tricks.<br/><br/>Buddy on your Left: a game for 3 players where each player's score is his own plus that of his left hand neighbor!<br/>A card is led then players in turn play cards either higher or lower than the lead card. As long as the played cards are lower, the pile continues to grow. As soon as a card higher in value than the initial card is played, that player sweeps the entire pile. Cards from 1 to 6 score their value, 7 to 10 are worth nothing. After the last card is played, you score for the cards you collected plus the cards your left hand opponent collected. Highest score wins.<br/><br/>The Third Man: an outrageous bidding game for 4 players<br/>The game consists of a series of auctions, for each of which the house puts up a prize fund of 10 points. Highest bidder gets the 10 points, less the number he had bid (ex. if he bid 9, he earns 1). The second highest bidder loses the full amount he had bid (ex. if he bid 7 he loses 7). Whereas the third highest bidder receives from the house double the number he had bid (if he bid 5, he pockets 10!). Therefore in each auction your objective is to be third--and in any case not second<br/><br/>",

Place a tile wherever it matches and claim the points.<br/>I introduced the variant of providing each player with a counter, so they can claim one bug as their own to be finished later, like in Carcassonne. That way, players are not exposed to be stolen their bugs and encouraged to build longer bugs.<br/><br/>It turns to be quite fun due to the pictures and also when any child by mistake place two heads or two tails together....

There is a racing line that each driver must find which is quickest by 15% but this can be hard to find if you are caught up in a race long battle!<br/><br/>Movement is via two SLIK Moves dice (6 sided but with numbers only from 3-6) to ensure close racing. There are red and blue cards that can bring good or bad luck. These have to be acted upon immediately. Red are for entering corners and blue are for exiting corners.<br/><br/>You can dictate how many laps to run around a really nice and detailed board. The idea is to reflect real racing where passing can be difficult as you may have to go off the racing line and and make it stick! So, essentially it is a mixture of skill, luck and good dice throwing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game comes with short rules, a pad of scoring paper, and five dice.  The dice show the characters from the comic book Knights of the Dinner Table: 1 = B.A., 2 = Bob, 3 = Dave, 4 = Sara, 5 = Brian and 6 = Hoody Hoo!<br/><br/>The theme is RPG characters dividing up treasure after defeating a dragon.  The score sheet lists 11 items, with six &quot;voting&quot; blocks for each item.  Most of the items are positive points; some are worth more to certain characters than to others; one gives negative points and one is neutral, but grants a special ability the second and third round.<br/><br/>Each player takes on one of the roles and has his/her own score sheet.  It's an interesting Yahtzee variant, where you roll the five dice three times on your turn, keeping any faces you want.  You then assign the faces on your own score sheet.  Once a player is done, the next player takes his turn, etc.  When all have gone, start a second round.  The first two rounds are public knowledge: if asked, you must tell how you voted on a given item.  The third round is secret, however.<br/><br/>After three rounds, count up the votes for each character for each item.  There are tie-breaking rules.  High score wins.<br/><br/>During the game you can make deals and break them - this will be no surprise if you've read the comics.  You must record your votes in ink, though!<br/><br/>",

The playing area is a well-designed plastic arena, with a football pitch embossed on the green baize playing area.  Players take it in turns to launch attacking moves based on combinations of dice throws. The defender then has a chance to save the shot, before launching a counter attack. Mechanically, Tir et But owes quite a lot to poker dice, the strategy depending mainly on assessing the risk after the first attacking throw and selecting which dice to retain, whilst re-throwing the remainder. Instructions are in French only, but are very easy to grasp, with a simplified crib-card on the back of the box. A Rugby version of the game, employing identical mechanics, is also available.<br/><br/>",

Each stick has four sides, with a different combination of ten letters on each side, so that whenever the Quibble sticks are scrambled, a new combination of letters will appear. In each game, the players form words of three letters or more from the letters appearing across the Quibble sticks.<br/><br/>By mathematical calculation, it has been determined that there are 1,048,576 permutations possible in each line of ten letters. This represents the number of different letter combinations possible in each of the Quibble sticks. So, ten time this figure is the number of possible combinations within a game of Quibble.<br/><br/>The players write down their words simultaneously and the scores are tallied after each round. For a faster, more vigorous game, play with 2 players and a recorder in which players call out the words. Only the first one to say a word can score for that word. Points are scored based on the length of each word written down (ex: 3 points for 3-letter word).<br/><br/>--According to Sid Sackson's &quot;A Gamut of Games&quot;:<br/><br/>Ten generously sized wooden sticks have ten letters arranged vertically on each face. These are randomly formed into a square array. Variations range from finding words in a single row, up to the entire array.<br/><br/>",

The pull-out board depicts a the 6 rooms of a Bed &amp; Breakfast. Every card of a standard 52-card deck is represented by one of the spaces on the board.<br/><br/>Also needed: 8 D6 (including 6 of different colors for the guests of the B&amp;B), plus 2 white dice for rolling; a score pad and pencil; about 30 chips in a unique color for each player; a standard deck of cards without jokers.<br/><br/>The 6 colored dice represent the guests, with the number showing representing their level of agitation (each starts at 2, mildly spooked). Each chip represents a ghost that can haunt a room on the board. Different ghosts belong to different players, which is why each player needs their own color of chips.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>--Draw your hand up to 5 cards.<br/>--Play a card and 'haunt' the room containing the card you played. To haunt a room, place a chip of your color on the top of the stack of chips in that room (unless a chip of your color is on the top of the stack), or begin a stack if none exists. You also haunt adjacent rooms that are already haunted (have chips of any color in the room).<br/>--Move one guest according to the roll of 2 D6<br/><br/>When a guest lands in a haunted room, points are awarded to the ghosts in that room. Points (equal to the guest's spook level - number on the guest's die) are distributed among the ghosts in that room, with more points going to the top ghost.<br/><br/>If a guest stops in a room that is not yet haunted, the player (if any) holding the card for that room can play the card and 'surprise' the guest, scoring points for scaring that guest.<br/><br/>Each time the a guest lands on a numbered room, their rank (number on die) is increased by 1. If the guest is a 6, they 'freak out'. Freaked-out guests are worth negative points.<br/><br/>Play ends when the last card is played. Player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>A few variants are also included in the rules.<br/><br/>",

Battlefleets leap across light years to compete for control of strategic stars and star-clusters.<br/><br/>Contents: 48-page rules booklet.  Counters are provided for play without miniatures.<br/><br/>The rules are designed for use with Kallistra's Space Dreadnought 3000 1/3000 scale starships and 1/600 scale fighters, but spaceship models from any manufacturer may be substituted. A model represents one ship or a large number of fighters.<br/><br/>A 6ft x 4ft table is required if using miniatures or 3.5ft x 2.5ft table if using counters.<br/><br/>Rules are included for playing Tactical, Strategic and Campaign Games.<br/><br/>The TACTICAL GAME is played for 10 turns.  Each turn is composed of the following steps:<br/><br/>1. Secretly write movement orders <br/>  2. Simultaneously execute movement orders<br/>  3. Secretly write combat orders <br/>  4. Resolve combat<br/><br/>Ships are grouped into fleets which move together between a dozen or so giant hexes representing a star system. The hexes are positioned in any of ten recommended configurations.  The hexes are not arranged in a hex grid, but rather form paths or rings.   Fleets unable to trace an uncontested path to a supply planet hex are at an extreme disadvantage in combat.<br/><br/>Aggressive movement plots can have dire consequences; fleets plotted to move THROUGH hexes occupied by a NON-MOVING enemy fleet are summarily destroyed.<br/><br/>Opposing fleets in the same hex battle.  There is no movement during battle. Players simply roll a twelve sided die for each attacking ship and reference the ship's offensive table.  The result is compared to the target's defenses. Combat may last several rounds until one side is destroyed or withdraws.<br/><br/>After 10 turns, the player with the greatest point value for all surviving ships is the winner.<br/><br/>The STRATEGIC GAME includes a couple scenarios played out using tactical rules.<br/><br/>The CAMPAIGN GAME is played on an area map for which players fight for supremacy. Each area represents a star system.  Players may build naval bases. Conflict is resolved by playing a tactical game.<br/><br/>Optional rules include supply ships, command and control, alliances, team-play and multi-force campaigns.<br/><br/>",

Another innovative concept, far ahead of its time, is the inclusion of scenarios that players bid on, attempting to undercut each other's force values.

Murray invented his own variation on it in that year.<br/>  It is an unusual game in that any number of people can play, almost without limit.<br/><br/>It is played on a square grid, whose size is 15 to 18 squares on a side.  It is essentially a multi-player solitaire, where a player can make multiple jumps as in draughts.  The winner is the person who has captured the most pieces when no more moves are possible.<br/><br/>In the original, pre-1898 version, the pieces are undifferentiated.  In Murray's 1898 version, pieces have colour to denote scoring, some pieces being more valuable than others.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to score the most points possible during each turn. Players score points when a die or dice combination matches one or more numbers on the field of play. Players use glass markers to cover those numbers as they compete.<br/><br/>Game in a Nutshell<br/><br/>The first player rolls three dice onto the field of play, called the leather , then uses glass markers ( paddy flats , or flatties ) to cover numbers that match an individual die or dice combination (see Basic Roll). A turn ends when a player is topped &mdash;unable to use all three dice to cover one, two, or three numbers on the leather . On the final roll of a turn, a player is allowed to cover as many numbers as possible, even if all of the dice cannot be played. At the end of each turn, points are added up and recorded by the scorekeeper. The dice are then passed to the next player.<br/><br/>Players must always roll three dice. If a roll results in stacked or cocked dice, including those cocked against a flattie , all three must be rolled again.<br/><br/>The player with the most accumulated points wins the match.<br/><br/>Basic Roll <br/>Dice can be added together or played as naturals. For example, a 2 , 4 , 5 roll offers five options:<br/><br/>Cover the 2 , 4 , and 5 .<br/><br/>Cover the 6 [2 + 4] and the 5 .<br/><br/>Cover the 9 [4 + 5] and the 2 .<br/><br/>Cover the 7 [2 + 5] and the 4 .<br/><br/>Cover the 11 [2 + 4 + 5].<br/><br/>This is just an overview&hellip;.<br/><br/>You will also learn how to score the game.

That's is the kind of game it is. Yet put two people together with a pencil, a scrap of paper, and some time to kill and chances are they'll wind up playing endless games of Tic-Tac-Toe, with never a winner.<br/>&quot;Hold that Line is a game I devised to fill just such an odd moment. It, too, is played with a pencil and a scrap of paper, but there is a chalange and a winner in each and every game.&quot;<br/><br/>This game is played in a dotted grid similar to that of Dots and Dashes, but the objective is not to control boxes inside the grid, but to not be the last player drawing a line in the grid. Each line must be straigh and each player must play on either end of the line draw. The entire line must be continuous, without branches, crossings or a dot being visited twice.<br/><br/>",

Men could be asked: On average, how many pairs of shoes does a woman own? Teams attempt to place several cards in order from least to greatest based upon their guessed answers.

Players will use these powers to try and gain control over the people, and build temples and fortresses for themselves to help solidify their victory.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of rounds, in which players will simultaneously select one of their available action cards, and then execute them. Playing action cards costs the players wrath, which is the main resource in the game.

The Metarus over Zama? Syracuse?<br/><br/>No one has ever questioned the selection of Midway as the decisive battle of the Pacific War. All agree that this one changed everything, as the Japanese plan to &ldquo;lure&rdquo; the remaining US fleet to its destruction led to a strategic defeat, due to code breaking, heroism, and remarkable timing.<br/><br/>Now you can play out this exciting battle and see if you can do better. The Battle of Midway, June 3-6, 1942 gives you all the parts you need to gain insight into the questions facing both sides. Paul Rohrbaugh&rsquo;s design blends clean simplicity with a fine level of detail (even accounting for the Japanese planes intended to be assembled and used on the captured island!). It includes an overview map-board of the area, an off-map battle board, and a variant map with Midway in detail, where, for the first time, you can pursue the actual Japanese invasion of the island and see what might have been.<br/><br/>Rules cover battles in the air, planes versus ships and versus land, surface to surface, submarines, seaplanes, and more, all in rules designed to be fast, combined with challenges that encourage replay.<br/><br/>You know the history.<br/><br/>Now, see if you can change it.<br/>Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series<br/><br/>That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value.&quot;<br/><br/>The Battle of Midway 1942 AD includes:<br/>&bull; One 11&rdquo; by 17&rdquo; map (containing the Game Map and Battle Board)<br/>&bull; Two Naval/Air Unit Deployment Charts ( Japanese and US)<br/>&bull; 176 counters<br/>&bull; This set of rules<br/>&bull; Four six-sided (D6) dice<br/>&bull; Two 8.5&rdquo; by 11&rdquo; inserts (map and rules for the optional variant game)<br/><br/>",

The cards contain also an explanation what the resulting words actually mean (for those that did not know the word before).<br/><br/>It's mainly a fun party game leading to discussions about local dialects, but the one finding most (new) matching pairs is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This abstract game uses pieces shaped like macaron cookies in five different colors (pink, blue, brown, green, and yellow) with four different colors of filling (pink, brown, green, and white). The pieces are played on a cloth board with a checkered grid playing area.<br/><br/>The game comes with two sets of rules. For rule set #1 (2 players only), players begin with 7 pink, 5 brown, and 5 green pieces each and take turns placing them on the board. The winner is the first person to line up at least three pieces of the same color in a row. If both players place all of their pieces without getting three in a row, the second player wins.<br/><br/>For rule set #2 (2-4 players), players take turns drawing random pieces from a bag and placing them on the board. If a player manages to surround any number of pieces in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) with two cookies of the same color (one on either end), the player captures all of the surrounded pieces. The captured pieces are worth points at the end of the game. Bonus points are obtained by capturing sets of certain color combinations. When all pieces have been played, the person with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each domino consists of two simple icons placed at each end and representing common items such as &quot;head&quot;, &quot;house&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;knife&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>Every person starts with two dominoes in their hand and play on a starting tableau of 4 dominoes in the center of the table.  They also have pen and paper to record their guesses.<br/><br/>On your turn play one of your dominoes onto the tableau to form a word or phrase from the two adjacent pictures.  Any combination is allowed but you're only joining two icons.  Write your phrase secretly on your paper.  For example, &quot;bird&quot; and &quot;hand&quot; could be &quot;bird feeder&quot;, &quot;a bird in the hand&quot;, &quot;pet bird&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>Others now write on their papers what they think your word or phrase is.  Once everyone has made their guesses score points as follows:  everyone scores one point for guessing correctly, the turn player scores one point for everyone that guessed his phrase or just one point if everyone guessed his phrase.  A 2 point bonus is awarded the player who solely guessed the phrase.<br/><br/>First player to 11 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

After one of the king's tasters dies of poisoning, the king no longer knows who to trust within his closest circle of confidants.<br/><br/>There is the Queen, who he married to secure the relationship with the neighboring kingdom, but who does not share the love he has for her.  Their daughter, the Princess, next in line to inherent the crown and friends with enemies of the king.  The Bishop, who has spoken aloud that the king should be replaced by a spiritual leader.  The Knight, just back from war with the neighboring kingdom and in a rage that the war had ended through marriage and not bloodshed.   The Rook, who has become senile in his old age and now wandering the halls of the castle aimlessly.  And the Pawn, ready to rise up in the ranks of the royalty by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Can you help protect the king through the seasons of time and ensure that he remains atop his throne?  Or will the tyrants prevail and take his crown from you?<br/><br/>En Passant (from French: in passing) is a special move in chess that allows an opponent to capture another pawn &quot;as it passes&quot; which was the inspiration for this game.<br/><br/>In this 16-card playing card game each player is dealt four cards.  The player with the King card in their hand goes first.  Starting with that player, each player plays a card and performs the action listed.  For example, one card may have you steal another players card.  Or another card may have everyone pass their hands to the player on their left.<br/><br/>Your goal is to keep track of the King Card as he travels from player to player.  Once someone is only left with one card the round ends and the player with the King Card gets a point.  The first player to 3 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

A player may only attack in the directions indicated by the red arrows (arrows must point perpendicular to an adjacent hex side). Players each roll one six-sided die, the attacking player gains a +1 to their roll.<br/><br/>If the attacker&rsquo;s roll is greater than the defender, the defending piece is removed.<br/><br/>If the defender has more than one counter adjacent to the attacking counter and they have lost combat, they may immediately combat once as a new attacker, before the start of their normal turn.

Can you uncover your opponents' ducks by counting legs?<br/><br/>Each player starts by drawing a secret duck tile. For that player each duck of that colour has 3 legs, all other ducks have 2 legs. Turtles have 4 legs, and flamingos have 1 leg.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3 tiles on their hand, and 1 tile is player centrally in the table. On a players turn the player have to play 2-3 tiles in a row or column, adding it to cards already on the table. The following player have to announce how many legs there are in the just played row/column; according to that player. Once you figure out which secret duck a player has, you shout out the colour. If you guess correct you score all the tiles on the table. If you guess wrong the player you tried to guess score all the tiles on the table. Then a new round is played until all tiles are used. The winner is the player with the most scored tiles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Classes are almost out at Cliffspire Academy. As a first year Arcana student, your final exam is to create a functional spell scroll. The more impressive and varied the spells, the higher your marks.<br/><br/>Of course you can't get your cauldron tuned quite right, and your quill of inscribing is on the fritz, and what does &quot;Aveum&quot; mean again?<br/><br/>Spellcraft Academy is a solitaire roll-and-write game played on a grid of letters. The player rolls a die to navigate the grid, selecting letters and copying them on a separate, blank grid. Points are scored for each completed word, chosen out of a word bank. The words in the bank are classified as either &quot;aspects,&quot; &quot;elements,&quot; or &quot;methods,&quot; and combining them -- having one word use letters from another -- is the way to score big points.<br/><br/>After there's no space left on the grid to inscribe more letters, the game ends, and points are tallied. A grading rubric tells the player whether they've passed the test... or failed, and need to take it again.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the April 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

The units of maneuver are almost all divisions or brigades or their ad hoc equivalents. There are two corps-sized units representing the First Allied Airborne Army when it&rsquo;s used in paradrop operations. Each full game turn represents 10 days to one month of &lsquo;real time,&rsquo; depending on the time of year.<br/><br/>The maps illustrate the militarily significant terrain found in and around this border area of western Germany in 1944-45 when portrayed at this scale. The national boundaries shown are the final internationally ones from just before the war began in 1939.<br/><br/>A hexagonal (&ldquo;hex&rdquo;) grid is printed over the map to regulate the placement and movement of units across it, much like the squares in Chess and Checkers. A unit is considered to be in only one hex at any one time. Every hex on the map has a unique four-digit identification number printed within it. They&rsquo;re provided to help find exact locations more quickly and to allow for the recording of unit positions if a game has to be taken down before it can be completed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each piece is placed on a white dot. Your task is to reunite your pieces into one stack. The first one to do so wins. Players start out with six numbered pieces; one (1), two (2), and three (3). The numbers on the pieces indicate the number of spaces (dots) a piece can travel. Pieces can pass over their own or their opponent&rsquo;s pieces, but cannot land on a dot occupied by an opponent, only their own. When a player lands on their own piece it is combined into a stack with the top piece number representing the number of moves that stack can travel. Players can have multiple stacks that they create as they are striving for their single stack. This simple and easy to learn game will surprise you on how fun it is to discover the complexity of moves and strategies that will keep this game fresh and challenging.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humorous card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.<br/><br/>There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.<br/><br/>During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.<br/><br/>A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).<br/><br/>If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.<br/><br/>The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.<br/><br/>NOTE: The expansion Monkey Business has been included in the base game since 2007.<br/><br/>",

Despite several viable suspects, police were forced to close the case because they couldn't determine how the killer got to Max while avoiding detection by video surveillance cameras.<br/><br/>Your job is to solve the mystery by finding evidence that will re-open the case and convict the real killer. But who was it?<br/><br/>In order to solve this cold case murder mystery game you&rsquo;ll need to find 3 separate clues that crack open the case. First figure out how the killer got to Max.

You can play with a traditional deck of playing cards, with the cards ordered A23... up to ...JQKA23... so that they loop. Each player starts a round with seven cards in hand and one card face up to start a discard pile.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player must draw the top card of the deck or the discard pile, but they can draw the latter only if that card will be part of a new meld. After drawing, they can meld a set or sequence of three cards. If this player has a meld in front of them, whether from this turn or an earlier one, they can add to melds already on the table, adding a fourth 6 to a set of three or adding a 2 to a QKA sequence. Additionally, you can meld a 7 on its own to the table.<br/><br/>To end your turn, if you still have cards in hand, discard a card. If you now have no cards in hand, the round ends. Players are then ranked by their points still in hand, with an unplayed 7 being worth 14 points, and players give points to the winner based on their ranking. The worse your rank, the more you pay. Additional penalties might double what you pay depending on what you have in hand.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if you have melded no cards, you can end the game with a blast by having a point total that is small or large enough based on all seven cards in hand. Also alternatively, if you have at most 10 points in hand at the start of your turn, you can call for the end of the round. If you have the smallest total, you're ranked first, but if anyone has fewer points than you, you're automatically ranked last.<br/><br/>",

Place a Word card face up. Your word must be related to the previous one. If the word has an obvious connection, for example &quot;Cheese&quot; with &quot;Goat&quot;, your turn is over. If your word sows doubt, another player says &quot;I don't see the connection&quot;. You have to justify the relationship between the 2 words. Everyone listens to your explanation and then they vote.<br/><br/>2. Place a Word card face down. This card may or may not relate to the previous word. A player can then say &quot;You're bluffing!&quot;. You return your card and must justify yourself. The voting phase follows to find out if you have been convincing enough! If no one calls the bluff, it's the next player's turn. We start from the last Word card revealed.<br/><br/>3. Draw a card. You can play it immediately or skip your turn.<br/><br/>4. Play a Monique card instead of a Word card. Each card has its rules written on it. The next player starts from the last revealed Word card.<br/><br/>And the humor in all this? If you manage to make your accuser laugh, you win! The first player to play all his cards wins.<br/><br/>Spice up your games with the red cards: only to be taken out when the children and other sensitive souls are in bed. ;)<br/><br/>",

A group of college students decide to reopen the old Black Pine Lodge in the mountains of Crystal Country. A place closed several times due to various misfortunes that have occurred over the years, but as soon as they arrive they realize that the place actually seems contaminated by something ancient and evil. They decide to explore the place, but it will only be when one of them finds a cursed mask that the real nightmare will begin! In The Maniac at the beginning of the game everyone is a &quot;Survivor&quot; but the real game begins when one of them finds the cursed mask. From that moment on he will become &quot;The Maniac&quot; and will have the goal of eliminating everyone else. The Survivors instead will have to try to escape from Black Pine Lodge by activating one or more endings. The Maniac is a hidden movement game where no one will ever know exactly where the other is.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Simultaneously, players start flipping over cards to find one that fits next to their rightmost card, with &quot;fits&quot; meaning that neither the number of symbols on the card nor the number of types of symbols nor the number of colors are repeated on the new card. If you draw a card that meets this description, add it to your row and draw again; if not, place it face-up on the table.<br/><br/>Once a player has seven cards in their row, they call &quot;Stop!&quot; All players check their card rows for errors, discarding any mistaken card and all cards played after it. The player with the longest row of cards claims the highest point card on display; the player with the second-longest row the next highest point card; and so on.<br/><br/>Shuffle the color cards for a new round of play.

The game is about racing with greyhounds and its progress can be influenced by the cards each player plays. To begin, the cards are shuffled and distributed to all players. The remaining cards are placed on the matching color group, causing the greyhound of this color to take the lead in the race. Thereafter, all players play a card from their hand and the greyhounds then move forward according to the number on the respective cards. Players use their tokens to wager on a greyhound of their choice. The game ends when no tokens remain of one color. Players receive chips according to their tokens of the same color as the winning dogs. The player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>Originally published in spielbox 1992 #1.<br/><br/>",

While working on the development of The Secret World Inside You, exhibition co-curator Susan Perkins, an avid tabletop game enthusiast, pioneered an idea to create a card game allowing players to learn about the community of microbes that live in our guts, known as the gut microbiome. Gutsy is based on the various ways we interact with those microbes on a daily basis and turns those interactions into a fun and educational card game.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for players to attempt to be first to create a healthy gut by diversifying their gut microbiome, which is influenced by what we eat and drink, whom we interact with, and the medicines that we take.<br/><br/>Two to four players draw from a common card deck, collecting microbes and pathogens to build their respective guts.<br/><br/>The first player to have six different kinds of gut microbes wins. The game is intended for players ages eight and up.<br/><br/>Perkins worked with the Museum&rsquo;s Associate Director for Digital Learning, Barry Joseph, and high school students in the Museum&rsquo;s Lang Science Program, educators, as well as Eric Teo, from the New York University Game Center MFA program, to create Gutsy.<br/><br/>Playing on the popularity of social card games like Sushi Go! and Killer Bunnies, the developers used illustrations, photos, and information created for The Secret World Inside You exhibition.<br/><br/>",

You call a running play or passing play and then roll the dice. There are charts for individual teams and on those charts are listings of who throws the pass or makes the run and then influenced by the defensive rating of the opposition another roll determines how large the gain is on a run or whether or not the pass is complete.

The train cards are played to the table in lines. The object is to move your station along a line of trains to the end of the train, simulating the train moving into the station (or leaving the station). Various event cards can be played, some of which allow your station to move forward 1 or more 'spaces' (train cards), or send other player&rsquo;s stations backwards. Wild cards that can match any train or station type also exist.<br/><br/>This game first appeared in 1947. There are at least 2 editions of the game, one of which included &quot;fold out stations&quot;; one edition came in a blue and white box, the other in a red and white box. The Pepys second edition was published in 1955. The first edition included station cards that were folded within the box. The second edition only had stations the size of normal cards and the train liveries were updated.<br/><br/>Real trains are featured, from the LNER, GWR, SR, and LMS lines (London and North Eastern Railway, Great Western Railway, Southern Railway, London, Midland and Scottish Railway).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Love 2 Hate is the card game of finishing sentences (and laughing at the result!). The rules couldn't be simpler.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards, sentence starters and finishers. At the start of the game everyone draws a hand of 5 finishers. Players then take it in turns to act as the judge. A judge draws the top starter card. Example starters include Cosplayers, Moist Towelettes, Crabs, and Mimes.<br/><br/>Then the judge has a decision to make: love or hate?! Let&rsquo;s say the judge draws the Hippies card. That can be played one of two ways:<br/><br/>I love the way hippies&hellip;<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>I hate the way hippies&hellip;<br/><br/>The remaining players now look through their finisher cards and chose one to play, face down. The judge reads these aloud and then chooses the best one. What does best mean? That&rsquo;s up to the judge, so know your fellow gamers! It might be the funniest, craziest, or most outrageous, depending on the judge, so choose wisely!<br/><br/>The winner keeps the card and play continues until one player gets 5 cards.<br/><br/>",

Pieces are distinguished by their movement and strength values.  Pieces also support each other, meaning that attacking and defending pieces are &ldquo;strengthened&rdquo; by those around them.<br/><br/>Therefore, Kerak plays in two strategic dimensions: that of individual pieces, and larger strategic groupings.<br/><br/>Also, since players set up their pieces one at a time, in any order or configuration, no two games of Kerak start the same.

However, while the mice will be looking to fill their stomachs with all that high-quality dairy product, the lemmings have another idea: Scupper the bridges that are being built and plunge into the torrent below! Combining elements of both teamwork and individual play, you'll be looking to choose the right time to reveal your true nature while screwing over your opposite numbers.<br/><br/>In the game, players add cards to the central pool, numbered from 0 to 10. Depending on how many people are playing, a certain target number must be reached; 35, for example, with eight players. Each round, one player MUST reveal whether she is a mouse or lemming, then rely on her fellow rodents to get them all across the bridge &mdash; or not, as the case may be! Reveal too early and you could be putting too much faith in the other players; reveal too late and there's a good chance you may not be successful!<br/><br/>Of Mice and Lemmings is a quirky update on the trick-taking genre and adds hidden identities, a healthy amount of bluffing, and rodents with one-track minds.<br/><br/>",

Landing on a cat costs the player one point, while hitting the center tile earns 2-4 points.

The piece can be moved one space, and may not re-visit a visited cell. Two goal cells are located at diagonally opposite corners of the rectangle (or in the obtuse corners of the rhombus). You win if either player moves the piece into your goal cell.<br/><br/>The rules at Game Cabinet state that &quot;the piece starts on any mutually agreed upon square&quot;. But since this is a finite game, with enough computing power it can be determined which player has the winning strategy depending on the initial placement, so in principle no cell would be mutually agreeable. In practice, the Pie Rule can be used.<br/><br/>",

The first player to rebuild both brickprints using bricks of their color (red or blue) is the winner!<br/><br/>Each round, all four dice are rolled, then players alternate turns by choosing one die from the shared pool and placing it onto the game board to collect bricks of their color, connect bricks in their collection, or manipulate future die rolls. When all of the dice are placed on the board, the round ends, turn order changes, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>However, a player can &quot;bump&quot; a die off an occupied action space. A bumped die is rolled and returned to the shared pool, extending the round by one turn. By strategically choosing when to bump -- and when not to -- you might be able to eke out a few extra actions over the course of the game!<br/><br/>Brick Work is a fast, fun, deceptively strategic game that combines the joy of brick building with creativity, puzzle solving, and modern game mechanisms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I'm Not Saying You're Stupid... is a trivia game where players try to guess the right answer, but also guess which player has the most wrong answer.<br/><br/>The game contains 110 trivia cards with 4 questions on each card. It also contains 9 I'm Not Saying You're Stupid... cards.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player gets paper and a pen to write their answers on. Also one player is designated as the score keeper. Each player also gets one of the I'm Not Saying You're Stupid...  cards.<br/><br/>To start one player draws a trivia card and reads the first question. Each player writes what they think the answer is. All of the questions have a numeric answer, and each player should only write a numeric answer. After every player has written their answer, each player places their  I'm Not Saying You're Stupid...  cards in front of the player whose answer they think is furthest from the true answer. Then the answer is revealed and players score points. 5 points for the correct answer, 2 points for the closest answer, and 1 point for placing the  I'm Not Saying You're Stupid... in front of the player who had the answer furthest from the correct answer. After scoring the next question is read. When all the questions are read from one card, the next player draws the next card. The game continues until one player reaches a predetermined amount of points or a predetermined amount of time has passed.<br/><br/>",

A couple of basic scenarios are provided along with rules for creating your own.  The game is clearly designed to appeal to Gamma World RPG-ers as there is a large section on how to incorporate power armour into the Gamma World game.<br/><br/>",

(&quot;fata&quot; is Italian for &quot;fairy&quot;) is a very clever and elegant card game that won hands down.<br/><br/>It features a deck of 110 cards. Each player belongs to a Techno-Fantasy Tribe of faeries and tries to catch the greater number of treasures by playing &quot;tri-spells&quot; (combination of three cards) and/or beating other players.<br/><br/>During his turn, the player may play a special &quot;charm&quot; card, then he may steal a card in front of another player (with a rock-paper-scissors system printed on the cards), then he may finally play up to two cards in front of himself.<br/>Each player have two &quot;virtual&quot; columns where playing cards: the first card of a column is played normally, the second card is played rotated by 180&deg;, the third card completes the column (the &quot;Tri-spell&quot;) and must be placed rotated by 90&deg;.<br/>The three cards of a tri-spell have a different meaning: the first card is for deciding the performed action, the second for the number and kind of targets, the third for the power of the spell.<br/><br/>Each player have also a designed enemy (secret role assignment at the start of the game): if he defeat this player, he's the winner. If nobody reach this target, the winner is the player with the most treasure at the end of the game.<br/><br/>One of the authors, Martina Mealli, she's also the illustrator of the cards.<br/><br/>",

Maneuvers are simultaneously selected and the matrix encoded into the books determines the results of each exchange.<br/><br/>Captain America was #1 in the series.<br/><br/>",

The Roman army counters represent a force of two legions, with auxiliary and other friendly foreign troops, totaling approximately 22,000 men. The Carthaginian army is typical of a mercenary type army, with counters representing some 30,000 men. Using the simple but comprehensive rules, up to six players are able to recreate a complete battle on any flat surface. The battlefield can be varied to suit any type of terrain, thus giving an extremely variable playing area.<br/><br/>Part of the Micro Warfare Series from Tabletop Games. The games in the series were intended to be played directly on the game table (without a mapboard) using rules concepts from traditional miniatures wargaming. The games offered an affordable alternative to the miniatures hobby in that they used un-cut cardstock counters for the game units.<br/><br/>Series II Additonal Armies<br/> Ancients:<br/> TTG-MA-A01 Persian<br/> TTG-MA-A02 Macedonian<br/> TTG-MA-A03 Gallic<br/> TTG-MA-A04 British<br/> TTG-MA-A05 Indian<br/> TTG-MA-A06 Sassanid<br/> TTG-MA-A07 Byzantine<br/> TTG-MA-A08 Goth<br/> TTG-MA-A09 Hun<br/> TTG-MA-A10 Late Roman<br/> TTG-MA-A11 Egyptian<br/> TTG-MA-A12 Assyrian<br/> TTG-MA-A13 Seleucid<br/> TTG-MA-A14 Chinese<br/> TTG-MA-A15 Norman<br/> TTG-MA-A16 Saxon<br/> TTG-MA-A17 Viking<br/><br/>",

Then players navigate the dungeon, fighting any monsters in their way, collecting treasure, and dealing with any events that might crop up along the way until the boss fight is triggered.<br/><br/>bCP is a co-op game with a competitive element. Players will find it difficult to navigate the dungeon alone but will be collecting treasures of varying value along the way, the choice on whether to share these with their party or hoard them for their own benefit at the end of the game is theirs alone. The person with the highest value of treasure when the boss is defeated or the heroes die at the hands of the boss is the winner.<br/><br/>bCP uses custom dice to resolve combat, trigger special abilities, and seed the dungeon. The game is played out through a series of rounds in which the players each take a turn consisting of two actions then the monsters take a turn fending off the heroes advances. This continues until the boss fight is triggered by a card located in the monster deck, at which time all heroes are warped to the room that the boss appears and fight desperately to best the boss of the dungeon.<br/><br/>With the varying player abilities and the random dungeon seeds bCP will not play the same way twice. Unlike other dungeon crawlers, bCP will not require a DM to guide the party along the way.<br/><br/>",

You'll get to try in Drachen-Rallye which pits players not only against one another but against gusty winds that sometimes blow you ahead and sometimes blow you back.<br/><br/>To set up the game board, place the dragons on their start spaces, then assemble the windmill-like second board and place it on the first game board with one of the arms of the windmill directly behind the dragons.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first roll a die. If you roll a number, you move your dragon clockwise exactly this many spaces; if you land on a green space, you then move forward two spaces, and if on a red space, you move back two spaces. If you roll a tailwind, you turn the windmill clockwise 1-3 spaces, pushing any dragons sitting at the front of that wind or riding on the clouds; if you roll a headwind, you turn it 1-3 spaces counterclockwise. (Once you've played a few times, you can use a second die that allows you to choose headwind or tailwind as you like, in addition to the distance that you move.)<br/><br/>The first player to circle the island and land on or pass its starting space wins!<br/><br/>",

Of course, yours is not the only team with this <br/>aim.  Beware that your opponents will try to set traps for you. Only the most efficient and shrewd team will win the game.<br/><br/>Panik consists of a deck of 19 manor cards (ghost manors, shared manors, and booby-trapped manors) and  36 hunter cards (nine per team, each including Basic, Tandem, Detector, Over-equipped and Call for Help hunters).  Each player randomly draws four manor cards, looks at them and places them face down in front of him in the order he chooses. Then, each player turns one manor card face up and places a hunter in front of one of his manors.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player places one of his hunters in front of any manor card that does not already have four hunters next to it. After placing, the player may expel one of the hunters already present in that manor. The owner of the expelled hunter must immediately place it in another manor.<br/><br/>Some of the hunters have special skills: a Detector allows an opponent&rsquo;s manor card to be turned face up before the hunter is placed, a Call for Help allows any previously placed hunter to be moved to the manor where the Call for Help has just been placed. An Over-equipped hunter can neither be expelled nor be called.  A Tandem doubles the number of points but can never be called for help.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the hunter cards have been placed. The manor cards are all turned over and the players now know which will bring the most points! The ghost manors yield one to five points per hunter present, while the booby-trapped manors yield points only to the owner of the Manor. The fewer hunters there are in a shared manor, the more points it yields.<br/><br/>",

Although large formal battles can be fought (and sometimes were in Vietnam), the main thrust of this rulebook is guerrilla and counter-insurgency warfare.<br/><br/>Giac My is designed to simulate small unit combat in Southeast Asia, but it can be used for 'liberation wars' anywhere, or small unit infantry combat in general. Obviously,, many facets of unconventional warfare are difficult to simulate in a gaming format. However, we have tried to include whatever is applicable (and feasible) for tactical level engagements of a reasonable size. We hope that these rules will be well received by those interested in modern miniatures wargaming.<br/><br/>Scale: one inch equals ten meters, one turn is forty seconds. Each figure equals one man or vehicle.<br/><br/>Alternate title: The game is labeled GI'AC MY on the cover, but referred to as Giac My throughout the rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Gettysburg was fought in July 1, 1863 until July 3rd of the same year. It took place in and around the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. <br/>It was the battle with the largest number of casualties in the American Civil War and is often described as the war's turning point.<br/>Union Major General George Gordon Meade's Army of the Potomac defeated attacks by Confederate General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. This battle put an end to Lee's plans for an invasion of the North.<br/><br/>Lee vs Meade is a game that covers the Battle of Gettysburg. It was the first game in a series of games put out by Rand known as the 'Command Series Volume I'.  The later version put out by Gamut of Games featured a mounted map-board while the original Rand Games version had a map on heavy paper.<br/>Lee vs. Meade has a 17&quot;X17&quot; map 72 counters(36 for each player) combat charts and turn records charts along with a rulebook.  The scale used is 1/2 mile per square and each unit is considered to be an entire division.  The two-color map is mainly green but there are also some hills and ridges. There is a clearly shown road network of the area as well as terrain that are suitable for defensive outposts.<br/><br/>The map of the Gettysburg area is broken up into a 12x12 square grid.  This grid system was used in several of the games developed by Rand Game Associates and was called the Time/Space Grid. Movement costs necessary to go from one square to the next are visible on the grid at the edges and corners between the squares making it easier to move without the use of a movement chart. Unlike some games that use a square grid, diagonal movement is permitted.<br/><br/>Another feature common to most of the games offered by Rand Games was fairly elaborate combat sub-routine in which the attacker and defender would each pick a combat method from a 6x6 matrix called the Tactical Analysis Chart and draw the appropriate &quot;Tac Card.&quot; These &quot;Tac Cards&quot; are numbered from 1 to 6. The cell on the Tactical Analysis Chart that corresponds to the intersection of the two players' combat methods determines which combat results table is used. There are 6 different types of CRT used in this game.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is easy. Firstly the Confederate army moves.Any combat resulting is resolved and then the Union army moves and any combat is resolved.<br/>In order to initiate a combat you have to move your units onto a square edge that contains enemy units. <br/>There are four different scenarios in the game. A different time of the battle is used in each one and different victory conditions are required for each one.<br/><br/>",

The kaleidoscopic game board is a tricky maze where you must be on guard, because with the roll of the dice and the movement of a token, the whole can quickly shift!<br/><br/>The challenge of Bailiwick' is to wind your way through the four rings, moving your triangular tokens either forward (counter-clockwise) on the colored spaces, or backward (clockwise) on the white ones, and maneuvering them onto the steppingstones, to advance upward, as you try to be the first player to get all four tokens into your matching center &quot;bailiwick space.&quot;<br/><br/>This game shares some similarities with Pachisi and Aggravation.<br/><br/>",

At the time we did Dark Stars, I played a lot of board games, but almost none of them SF because  they were so bad. They routinely ignored pretty much everything having to do with astronomy, physics, and mathematics, and since my background is technical I found that hard to swallow. The main problem with just about every science fiction game I ran across was too much fiction and not enough science. We put a lot of hard science into the system's design, simplified as much as possible to be playable, to try to put some of the science back in, rather than having it just fiction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the deck and deal it out facedown to all players.<br/><br/>Each player takes his deck in hand, and on a turn she says the next note in the scale while revealing a card and slapping it on the table (ideally revealing the card away from her). Thus, the first players says &quot;Do&quot; and reveals, the next player &quot;Re&quot; and reveals, etc. If the note being said matches the card being revealed, players must race to slap the card stack, with the last player to do so gaining all of the cards. When a keyboard is revealed, everyone must slap, regardless of the note. With &quot;Stereo&quot;, the two players on the immediate right and left of the player must slap, regardless of the note. Once a &quot;Mute&quot; has been played, everyone must quietly track the notes in their hand and slap the stack at the right time.<br/><br/>If you slap the card stack at the wrong time, you must take all of the cards, with the next player starting again with &quot;Do&quot;.

Any player can demand to see a just-moved pawn's hall pass (the number) and, if it moved either more or fewer spaces than that number, it is sent to detention.<br/><br/>If a player can move a pawn out of the school through any home room of another player, it is moved to the getaway car in their player color.

The game consists of two parts.<br/><br/>First Part:<br/>One of the alphabet cards is placed under the grid so that none of the players can see it. Players start by picking a number on the grid. The card is removed and all players see the letter underneath. This letter is written down and the number card replaced. The player then chooses another number revealing another letter in the same way. The letters revealed are written in the order they are revealed and must have the possibility of making a word. If a word is possible the player may continue to choose numbers and revealing letters. If a complete word is formed the player gets ten points per letter added to their score and may start over trying to make another word. If a blank or a letter that can not be used in the word is revealed then that players turn is over and the next player takes their turn in the same way. The front game ends once a player scores 150 points.<br/><br/>Second Part:<br/>One of the losing players forms a secret six-letter word using the letter cards placed on a special sheet, and this word is placed under the grid. The winning player from the first part chooses five numbers, which are removed to reveal one-quarter of one letter. The player tries to guess the secret word to win $1,000; if the player fails, s/he selects another number to reveal and $100 is deducted from the prize. This continues until the player either guesses the word or the jackpot goes down to $100.<br/><br/>The game is played in three rounds, with the player or team with the most money being the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Count Your Blessings is a board game that takes players through life, encouraging them to accomplish certain things for spiritual gain while managing their finances.<br/><br/>Players take turns to roll a die and move their tokens, executing instructions on the space their tokens land on.  Most of the time, they have to pay money, which is usually gained from the &quot;Pay Day&quot; space.  Players can also buy businesses and earn income from other players who land on those spaces.  Loans can be taken if money is insufficient, but too many loans lead to bankruptcy, which will hurt a player's final score.<br/><br/>Blessings, used for scoring, are mostly gained by achieving accomplishments.  Most accomplishments (getting a diploma, attending church, etc) are gained by landing on the spaces required.  Some require players to have visited another space (e.g. to get married, one must land on &quot;BYU Square&quot;, pay $15,000, then proceed to the &quot;Temple Square&quot;).<br/><br/>When landing on a Spice of Life space, players draw a card and follow the instructions printed, which can be beneficial or detrimental.  Some cards offer choices: a player can either gain cash or Blessings, or possibly mull over which to sacrifice.<br/><br/>Blessings are scored for a player when he or she lands on the &quot;Interview Square&quot;.  The game ends when a player has three Interviews; the player with the highest total score (from three Interviews) is the winner.<br/><br/>The 1985 version by Ungame is simpler in design.  It has fewer spaces on the board and does not have events that require players to track to different spaces to gain Blessings.  The first player to obtain a Gospel card (obtained by landing on a square) and have at least 50 Blessings (the number can be adjusted on agreement) wins and ends the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Taken from the publisher's website:<br/><br/>To play PLUG INN, the biggest board game in the world, you need a friend and a big, BIG table. If you don't have a big enough table, fear not! The game board can be easily adapted to the size of your choice... In PLUG INN, players compete in a &quot;Macro-Game&quot; by placing their tokens on a board composed of hexagons. Every hex of the game contains a &quot;micro-game&quot; that a player must win in order to place a token in the hex. Macro and micro games are controlled by a few general rules. Even if the general rules do not change, it is always possible to pick up a new Macro-Game or add new micro-games to refresh PLUG INN.<br/><br/>The first supplied Macro-Game is Hex. In Hex, you need to place several micro-games hexes in order to form a diamond-shaped board. Each player marks two opposite sides of the diamond with his tokens. Afterwards, tokens are played in the hexes according to the rules of PLUG INN. The goal is to connect your opposite sides with an uninterrupted chain of your tokens.<br/><br/>The first micro-games are:<br/>-Trip, an interesting variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe<br/>-Kono, a simple game in which you need to capture your opponent's tokens<br/>-Bulo, a reduced variant for the classic game of Nim<br/>-Decapawn, inspired by Martin Gardner's Hexapawn, where pawns battle on the board much like in Chess<br/><br/>This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of a game board representing the race track at the Carthage Circus, a long, oval wooden piece separating the center of the board and used as a lap counter, 4 wooden chariots, 28 Fates Cards, 45 Chance Cards and 2 dice.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player selects a color and the Fates Cards are distributed evenly between the players. On a players turn they roll the dice and move that many spaces forwards. On the roll of an even number, movement must be straight ahead. If an an odd number is rolled, the player can change lanes. The game ends once a player has completed 7 laps of the track.<br/><br/>The innovation that stops this from becoming a roll and move game are the Fates Cards and the Chance Cards. The board spaces are marked with either a &quot;C&quot; Chance symbol, an &quot;F&quot; Fates symbol, or a Fatum symbol. If your piece ends its turn in one of the spaces, then you follow the directions. If you land on a Fatum symbol and have the corresponding Fates card then you follow the directions on the Fates card either good or bad. If you land on an &quot;F&quot; symbol then you can swap a Fates card with the player on your left. If you land on a &quot;C&quot; symbol then you take a Chance card and the instructions are followed by the player indicated on the card.<br/><br/>This game is not to be taken too seriously and has a large element of luck.<br/>The most unique thing about this game is that it is a Tunisian production released for the 28th century anniversary since the founding of Carthage, and as such was produced for the tourist market.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is an indoor game designed and developed by golf professionals to simulate the thrills and excitement of actual outdoor competition.  The object of the game is to run up your opponent&rsquo;s score, while completing your own round in as few strokes as possible.<br/><br/>Par Fore the Course is an indoor game designed and developed by golf professionals to simulate the thrills and excitement of actual outdoor competition. As much as possible, Par Fore the Course is played the way real golf is played. But there&rsquo;s added excitement, because Par Fore the Course goes beyond the gentlemanly rules of the Royal and Ancient Game. In this competition, if you play a shot that lands you in trouble, your opponent does not stand back politely while you escape from your predicament. No! He gleefully drops you into a lot deeper trouble! And you do the same to him!<br/><br/>To start, cut the cards and the low card becomes the dealer and also plays first, play then follows clockwise. Once all first shots have been played, the player furthest from the hole plays. When two players are the same distance, the player arriving first plays. Once on the green, continue to putt until in the hole. Winner of each hole plays first on the next hole. In case of a tie, the player who played first on previous hole plays first for the next tee.<br/><br/>Begin each hole by drawing up to 5 cards to your hand. To begin par 3&rsquo;s roll 2 dice and to begin par 4&rsquo;s and 5&rsquo;s roll 3 dice. The roll of the dice determines your ball's landing point and do the following based on the par of the hole and where it landed:<br/><br/><br/>     If on the fairway - play a card trying to match the suit of the position you landed. Whether it matches or not will determine what happens next (water, sand trap, out of control, make it to the green, etc)<br/>     If in a sand trap &mdash; roll 2 dice (and/or play a card). The number rolled is the distance you are from the hole, unless doubles are rolled. In that case, the result will depend on whether you have a matching numbered card in your hand.<br/>     If in the water &mdash; count one penalty stroke. Then, move your ball to a drop area on the board represented by a circled D. Any numbered card can be played to the green. The number on the card represents the distance from the hole.<br/>     If off the fairway &mdash; You are out of bounds and count a 2 stroke penalty and roll dice again.<br/>     If on the green &mdash; you can putt. The number of the card played to make it to the green determines the distance to the hole. Roll dice to see if you putt into the hole.<br/>     If the number cannot be found - You have a lost ball. Count 2 penalty strokes and roll dice again. (Note: A number is missing on each hole. The missing numbers are: Hole #1&mdash;9, #2&mdash;12, #3&mdash;5, #4&mdash;10, #5&mdash;12, #6&mdash;12, #7&mdash;15, #8&mdash;13, #9&mdash;9)<br/><br/><br/>OUT OF CONTROL: <br/><br/>     Your ball is considered OUT OF CONTROL if you don't have a matching suit card for your numbered location OR number is off the fairway, but not in the water, a sand trap, or out of bounds. In this case, the player to your left plays a card and it determines what happens to your ball.<br/><br/><br/>HOLE IN ONE:<br/><br/>     When a player rolls two 1&rsquo;s and holds the Ace of the suit shown in the middle of the green, they score a HOLE IN ONE!<br/><br/><br/>SCORING: Each time a player rolls the dice from the tee or on the green, count 1 point. Each time a card is played either by the player or his opponent, count 1. At the end of each hole add penalty shots incurred to your score. Lowest total after 9 holes wins. (Use far right of score pads to count each stroke.)<br/><br/>",

On a turn, the active player reveals one of these action chips, then carries out the order depicted there. Perhaps you need to memorize, then reveal certain actions chips, but often you need to participate in &quot;monster games&quot;. You might have a task like making faces, naming ingredients in a soup, or imitating animal sounds, and on your turn you must first imitate in order everything done by the other players, then complete the task in your own way. Complete the task or win the game, and you can remove one of the crawlers on your body. Eliminate all of your crawlers to win!<br/><br/>",

Both sides have supporting artillery and helicopter assets attached.<br/><br/>Mechanics are straightforward with both players moving and then firing - damage takes effect after combat.  Fire is resolved by rolling a handful of dice, counting the hits and then subtracting the target's armor - units may be stunned, forced to retreat, take losses or be killed outright.  The advanced rules add a sort of opportunity fire where a unit may interfere with enemy movement by declaring it as a target (provided the enemy is within a certain distance).<br/><br/>The Operations Orders set up victory conditions and other effects (such as defensive positions) - thus, in a 2 player game, some information will not be shared between players.

        "description": "Played on a 6X6 square board BS Chess uses similar pieces and movement patterns to chess. however the identity of a piece is only know to it's controller. This allows players make normally illegal moves. Like a knight's leap with a pawn or a pawn's capture with a knight. After each move the opposing player may or may not call BS (short for bluffing style) in that case the moving piece is revealed, and a penalty is given to moving player if they cheated or to the calling player if the move was legal.<br/><br/>One other big change to chess is that the players pieces start in stacks along the back row of the board. This allows for a bit of meta gaming and reduces the number of choices each round even though a standard 16 man chess army is used.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hamertjesspel (Dutch for &quot;The Little Mallet Game&quot;) is a traditional pub-game that was popular in the Low Lands of Belgium and the Netherlands and can be traced back as far as 1750. It could be regarded as an early form of Pinball, but despite its erstwhile popularity, it was all but forgotten in the latter half of the 20th century. Recently replica boards are making a bit of a comeback, and &quot;het Hamertjesspel&quot; can be seen again at village f&ecirc;tes and other occasions that encourage nostalgic throw-back entertainment.<br/><br/>Four players sit on each side of a square wooden board with raised edges, defending their goal. A marble or small lead ball is dropped in the centre, either by hand or, on the more evolved board versions, through a &quot;fair&quot; central dropping device. Players try to get the marble into an opponent's goal, and keep their own one safe, by using a small wooden mallet (&quot;Hamer&quot; is Dutch for &quot;Hammer&quot;). To make life difficult for the players, the goal is split up in two by a centre isle, and spanned by a rail, so that it is impossible to block both halves simultaneously, or swap the hammer between goal sides easily. The board itself has a few obstacles (usually exposed nails) that deflect the marble.  Game play is best typified as frantic fun.<br/><br/>The boards tend to have a slight slope towards the centre point. The square versions commonly use 4 wood sections in a pyramid style. The &quot;Karrewiel&quot; (Cart Wheel), which is the round board version usually had more panes to create a nicer circular slope. Occasionally it would also be able to accommodate more than the standard 4 players, or have each player's goal area split in three gaps, rather than two. Most boards would have only one marble in play, but, reportedly, there are variants that had multiple balls simultaneously in the battle arena. If less people were playing, parts of the board could be blocked off using temporary wooden walls.<br/><br/>Traditionally, the first player to lose a certain amount of goals would have to buy the next round. Like all pub games, it was also played for money, and onlookers placed bets on the game's outcome.<br/><br/>In 1995 Battle Dome appeared, which is a modern flipper version of this traditional game, with a few added bells and whistles. In 2000 Felsburger produced the traditional Karrewiel version under the name Ch&uuml;ngel. Needless to say, most versions of the game keep coming from the Low Lands wood crafts cottage industry, that is slowly &quot;rediscovering&quot; this lost gem. And since the dimensions have never been standardised, quality and appearance are as diverse as the woodworkers making them.<br/><br/>",

The target whizzes into a scoring pocket.  Be the first player to win three rounds by scoring the most points in each round.<br/><br/>",

Like the latter, the Welsh name has confusingly come to mean Chess in modern Welsh. Most other scholars however disagree that this is the same as the Irish game which was played on a 7&times;7 grid.<br/><br/>Two opinions exist among those who maintain that the name Gwyddbwyll refers to a purely Welsh game. The Wikipedia Gwyddbwyll page describes chess at the top of the page, and this game below, referring to it as Gwyddbwyll Geltaidd to avoid confusion. It notes however that the game is properly called merely Gwyddbwyll, the longer name meaning merely &quot;Celtic Gwyddbwyll&quot;. This website also shows the initial set-up and gives a brief but incomplete description of the game in Welsh. The game according to this opinion is played on 9&times;9 grid and the object for the defending player is to get the king to a corner. Rules are otherwise presumably like Brandubh.<br/><br/>The alternative opinion that the game was played on a 7&times;7 grid is described at Celtnet. The initial set-up described there may be slightly speculative, but again it is believed that the other rules not described there were identical to Brandubh.<br/><br/>",

Once all of each players twenty marbles are distributed, blindly (the tower is a solid block of wood), the tower is slowly slid along a grooved path that distributes the marbles in the order they were placed into an even grid of depressions. Each player scores for marbles that appear in a row of four, either diagonally or orthogonally, and any line of five counts as two four-in-a-rows.<br/><br/>It's a quick game of memory and patterns, and it engages blocking and building strategies.<br/><br/>",

Next the cards are revealed and the suit of the highest valued card is a trump for that hand. If several cards tie, then the suit of the second highest card is chosen as a trump. If the tie cannot be broken, the hand is played without a trump suit.<br/><br/>The player who won the trump leads and each player plays a card, matching the suit with the card, that was led. The highest trump wins the trick and if there are no trumps, the highest card that follows the suit wins it.

Pablo has entrusted Tego to form<br/>a Management Team that will run his new company, Pablo Chocos. With $50,000, players' task is to headhunt and <br/>hire 12 best characters within 10 working days (10 rounds). The player who emerges with the group of best <br/>characters and meets most of Pablo's criteria shall be the winner.<br/><br/>Out of these winners, only a few will be The Ultimate Headhunter. These are those who can score the maximum<br/>110 points. So not all winners will become The Ultimate Headhunter, only the few great ones will.<br/><br/>The game play involves players bidding for these characters. One character will be bid at a time. The highest bidder gets the character. Players can also negotiate and trade during the game. The challenge is how one needs to achieve the target of the game without running out of money and also not to undervalue them until you lose<br/>the bid. Thus one needs to bid wisely, value the characters at the right place and to get them at the right<br/>time.<br/><br/>The Card Game comes with a package of 200 playing cards, 2 sets of 48 characters, and a fully coloured game <br/>manual.<br/><br/>Tego has also been designed for tournaments and competitions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's catalogue:<br/><br/>VROENHOVEN, BELGIUM, 11 May 1940: By mid-afternoon of 10 May, infantry elements of the 4th Panzer Division took over the bridgehead at Vroenhoven, relieving the exhausted paratroopers. During the evening, the infantry pushed west to free the main road and north to join with the Velwezelt bridgehead. Two platoons of the 2nd Company were all that remained of the Belgian troops near the Vroenhoven Bridge. On the morning of the 11th, the Germans started to attack towards the south to completely secure the bridge area. As the lead panzer elements were crossing the bridge, three Fairey Battle aircraft of the Belgian 5&Euml;me Escadrille appeared over the Albert Canal and began a bombing run against the bridge. Because their initial mission was to bomb wooden footbridges, the planes were loaded with puny 50kg bombs instead of the more potent 250kg bombs normally available. Lead by Captain Glorie, the three Battles made a first bombing run though withering anti-aircraft fire. Due to either the wounding of the observer or a malfunction of the bomb release system, Battle number T-70 of Captain Glorie, followed by the T-63 of Adjudant Delvigne, turned about and made a second run. Both were shot down after hitting the bridge. Une vaine mission de sacrifice!<br/><br/>Welcome to FACING THE BLITZ, an updated edition of the Albert Canal map and scenarios that were included in CH 7/1. A second edition map was printed after the initial print run was sold out and is included with this version.

        "description": "Flinke Flieger is a racing game played in rounds between two teams (or two players). Each round, two players (one from each team) race each other, trying to deliver an egg to their team's nest.<br/><br/>To set up the round, each player receives a seagull on a stick, which he has to hold by the stick during the race. The seagulls have a backpack, in which a flat paper egg is placed. Now, a spinner is spun, determining the special conditions for this round: it may be a straightforward race, or there may be special conditions, such as the players being required to run backwards or to spin twice before delivering the egg.<br/><br/>If a player drops his egg, he is out of the race for that round. If both players succesfully deliver their eggs, the fastest player's team receives an additional egg.<br/><br/>The game continues until fewer than three undelivered eggs remain at the beginning of a round. Now, players inspect their eggs by flipping them over to see which ones &quot;hatch&quot;. (Those that hatch have a chick painted on the back.) The team with the most chicks wins.<br/><br/>",

The earliest mention known dates from 1466. The cards were largely based on Tarot, at the time known as Tarocchi in Italy, by expanding the trump suit to 40 trumps. It was also known as Germini and Gallerini in other parts of Italy. It was played up until the 1930s.<br/><br/>Over time, numerous of games played with the very same deck were known as Minchiate, some including partnership and some not, and also differing in numbers of players. <br/>Minchiate games are all trick taking games of the Tarot family, although they introduce a few features that are unique and exclusive to Minchiate. Among these are scoring points for certain combinations of cards won in tricks, named 'versicole', and a different distribution of point values for the cards.<br/><br/>There were also a few gambling games played with the Minchiate deck not from the tarot family of card games, among them 'Al Palio' and 'A sei tocchi'.<br/><br/>",

The full set of rules can be found on my website)<br/>Product cards have a symbol, and only mascots with that same symbol are of use in winning the account for that product. Mascot cards have three symbols, each with a numerical value. Players take turns playing mascots with the appropriate symbol, vying to have the highest accumulated number value.<br/><br/>If a player has put any card into play during the round, at the conclusion they draw 1 fresh Mascot card.

        "description": "In Pioneer City, players become pioneers in wild west. First you start with your little wagon and try to be the first to arrive to the best land spots, there are six different choices of those. After that you go round the board and try to grab goods, crops, fish and so on (and later sell those). Game is divided to twelve months for five years (1858-1862), so you get to move 60 times during game.<br/><br/>During game you draw cards which affect the prices for different goods, moves indians, starts auctions or sends you to jail.<br/>Sometimes you get to go to the saloon, for a little gambling. Or you can go hunting or fishing, but then you have a risk to encounter indians.<br/><br/>Goal in the game is to collect as much money as possible, you get income from forests, fields, fish, gold etc. etc. Pioneer City is an old-fashioned game, which has clearly taken influence from Monopoly. But still there are couple of quite modern mechanics involved, little bit of choices and a little hint of theme.<br/><br/>",

All we have now is Dust.&quot;<br/><br/>Sovereignty of Dust is a post apocalyptic strategy card/dice game for 2-5 players.<br/><br/>Featuring a sandbox day/night system and both free-for-all and team based play, players take on the role of one of five factions vying for control of the ruins of a once-great metropolis now known only as &quot;Dust.&quot;<br/><br/>Capture your enemies, meet trade caravans and vicious gun runners, collect useful items and resources in the wasteland, gather intel on your opponents and undertake missions to carve your place in a crumbling world.<br/><br/>Players begin by selecting their faction:<br/><br/>    &quot;The Staten Island Resistance&quot; - A ragtag group of soldiers fighting for what's left of humanity.<br/>    &quot;Brothers of Dust&quot; - Though most would view them as a fanatical cult, the Brothers of Dust see themselves as the only light left in the world. <br/>    &quot;Long Island Greasers&quot; - Bikers influenced by the mentality of mid-20th century anarchist punk rockers. Their only goal is to reduce the city to smoldering ash. <br/>    &quot;Pax Americana&quot; - The scientists and intellects who survived the fall of the civilization. They consider themselves true patriots, fighting for the American way.<br/>    &quot;The Ward&quot; - Beneath the ruins of Dust, an army of monstrous human experiments is growing by the day, led by a crazed asylum doctor.<br/><br/><br/>Each faction has a preconstructed deck of cards, and a unique ability.<br/>At the beginning of each turn, players will discard any cards they have in play and draw three new character cards to the field of play. One action may be taken per turn by each of these characters. Actions include:<br/><br/>    Combat against another player's character or a city landmark.<br/>    Scouting the wastelands for supplies, or undertaking a mission on behalf of their faction.<br/><br/><br/>Victory points are awarded for capturing enemy units, conquering landmarks, and completing missions in the wasteland. Once the day/night deck has been depleted - the player with the most victory points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game Overview: A small box, a small price ($10), and big fun! Fire Ants! is a card game where you play as an ant and fires are breaking out throughout the ant colony. As a fire ant, you must extinguish those fires by collecting resources from the card deck. The fires can only be extinguished by collecting a certain number of metal cards, a certain number of plastic cards, and a certain number of water cards. You will also find ant magic cards which can be used in place of any resource card that you need. Each fire card that you extinguish is worth a certain value. The higher the point value on the fire cards, the more resources that are needed to extinguish that fire. At the end of the game, if all fires were extinguished then whoever scored the most points from their fire cards win. However, the game can beat you when seven fire cards are played at the same time and no one can put out the fires. When this happens, your entire colony has burnt to the ground.<br/><br/>Box Contents: The game comes in a small box that easily holds the 90 playing cards within it.<br/><br/>Game Play: At the start of the game, each player is dealt three cards and a five point double sided fire card is placed in the middle of the table. This fire will not be extinguished for a few rounds with players drawing a single card. You will need a total of 11 resources (2 metal, 4 plastic, and 5 waters) to capture this card and to put out this fire. While players are drawing cards to get that five point boost to their score, other fire cards may be drawn. When this occurs they are placed down onto the table. There are two five point fire cards, two four point fire cards, three three point fire cards, four two point fire cards, and five one point fire cards. If at any point, seven fire cards are placed onto the table, one of the players must put out a single fire without drawing any additional cards. If no one can, the game is over and the colony has burnt down and everyone loses. If you are able to get through the entire deck, then you know someone will win. You will need to reshuffle the cards and then it is a race to get the remaining cards to determine the overall winner.<br/><br/>--Chad Osborn (thedicehaveit)<br/><br/>",

The 133 symbols placed on the game cards were carefully selected to show best sportsmen, club badges, world records and many more.<br/><br/>ZnajZnak - Sport includes 63 cards on each of which 12 different symbols have been placed. Every two cards have a common symbol. Your job is to find and name it as fast as you can. If you don&rsquo;t recognize your symbol flip your card and read the information on the other side. Then place a new card on the back of your deck and go on with the game. If you manage to name your symbol you should give your card to the player on the left.

There must be at least one free space between players.<br/><br/>When the game starts you get a question in the color that you are standing on - if you answer the question correctly you move one space closer to the centre. If you answer incorrectly nothing happens. The winner is the one that reaches the centre first and answers a question of a self chosen category correctly.<br/><br/>Each player receives 4 tactics cards at the start of the game and 2 extra every time you land on a shaded square (though only once in a ring of the board). Normally you can only move directly forward towards the centre but the tcatics cards change this. Some cards let you move a player token of your own chosing back or forward or sideways or even diagonally. Other cards let you answer other players cards, force other players to answer yours or let you choose the category of a question disregarding which color you are currently on. Finally there are cards that override other cards.<br/><br/>If you land on a square where another player already is standing he is sent 2 squares further away from the centre.<br/><br/>",

Maybe no one comes to your parties because, quite frankly, they are incredibly boring. Are you a loner?

Well don't worry boring person... Help is here! BLANKR is an awkwardly hilarious card game that will get the whole party roaring with laughter. When you see people trying to escape through windows to flee boredom, just pull out BLANKR and see those lips smile again.

The rules are simple, one player reads out a Blankr sentence containing a blank and the others think of a word or phrase to fill in the blank. At the end of each round all the answers are read out aloud and the funniest answer wins a point (actually lets make that 3,873,093 points). Don't worry if you're low on wit and/or lack a sense of humour as the references cards contain over 330+ weird and wonderful ideas to get your brain juices flowing. See your friends and family curl their toes and chuckle as they read out the answers. Perfect-size travel box to put into your bag or back-pocket.
