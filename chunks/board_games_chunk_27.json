You&rsquo;ll be amazed how quickly you can learn about someone.<br/><br/>Everyone gets 10 Play Cards and takes a turn reading a Rule Card. During each round players have a chance to admit whether they're 'guilty' or 'not guilty' of a Play Card.

        "description": "Marram is a strategic tile game for 2-4 players. Players draw 3 tiles and take turns to lay 2 tiles that depict certain characteristics of features (two types of snakes, worms and patches of grass and sand), laying them to fit with those already laid.  Instead of laying a tile, the player may elect to use a spade card that allows the player to flip certain already-laid tiles changing the pattern of the underlying grass and sand.<br/><br/>Players claim ownership of features by placing welly boots on them during their turns. There are limited welly boots and several features to lay on, so the choice on where and whether to claim features is the key part of the game.<br/><br/>Completing a feature allows the player to score points and to claim back their welly boots for further use. Using a spade card allows the player to capture welly boots on the tile that is flipped as well as potentially completing features.  Players have the option of a short 30 minute game to reach pre-agreed points totals or a longer game in which all tiles are played. the player with the highest points total wins.<br/><br/>The set comprises a scoreboard, 96 tiles, 8 spade cards, 4 counters and 4 different coloured sets of 7 welly boots, and a tile bag.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game caters two to four players, ages eight and up. An average game lasts about 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Players try to buy and build the best hotels in this game, earning the most money or bankrupting their opponents. A successful hotel consists of three components: the land on which it's built, the hotel buildings, and the entrances by which guests arrive in the hotels. All three components need to be bought separately with in-game money. As in Monopoly, money is earned by players who end up on one of the entrances of your hotels, after their dice roll. The more luxurious the hotel, the more money a guest will earn you.

Descriptions should be truthful, yet clever, so the player in the hot seat doesn't get an easy guess.<br/><br/>In this game, all players except the one in the hot seat look at a guess word and then creatively describe what theirs is like. They might be telling about their swimsuit, neighbor, closet, hair or any of the other 300-plus words in the game. The player in the hot seat then tries to link all the clues together to figure out what is being described. The best part about this game is that the hilarious clues come from people who play the game. The player who guesses his or her word with the fewest number of clues wins.<br/><br/>What do you think players are describing with these clues?<br/><br/>Mine keeps getting bigger.<br/><br/>I compare mine with others.<br/><br/>My wife likes mine.<br/><br/>I never see mine.<br/><br/>I receive mine once a month.<br/><br/>You wouldn't believe what I do for mine.<br/><br/>Mine disappears too fast.<br/>What's Yours Like? is for 4 or more players ages 10 to adult.<br/><br/>",

Rules cover all aspects of the sport: facing, movement, contact, transferring the ball, passing and running.  The standard 'Combat Results Table' in most wargames becomes the 'Contact Results Table', where players are neutralized for a number of play segments or immobilized for the turn.  On passing plays, a 'Pass Completion Table' is consulted.<br/><br/>Extensive examples of play are included for both running and passing.  However, no rules are included for kickoffs/punts or Field Goal attempts.<br/><br/>",

Players take it in turn to play 1-4 cards onto the stack of cards. When a player plays, they must declare the number of cards played and give the value of a card (ace - king): for example &quot;three queens&quot;. The value given must be either one above, one below or the same as the value given by the previous player. Any player may call &quot;cheat&quot; before the next player plays. When a player calls &quot;cheat&quot;, the number of cards declared is then revealed. If the cards are all of the value given, the player who called &quot;cheat&quot; must take the whole stack of cards into their hand and the falsely accused cheater may start a new stack. However, if the cards are not all of the value declared, the cheater takes the stack into his hand and the first accuser starts a new stack. A player wins by emptying their hand. The game ends when there are only three players remaining.<br/><br/>This game is also known as Bullshit.  In Hoyle's Rules of Games it is referred to as I Doubt It.<br/><br/>Similar games include MammuZ, Verish' Ne Verish', Купи Слона, and Elephonkey.<br/><br/>",

Considered by many to be the issue where Command &quot;jumped the shark.&quot; Outraged subscribers were appalled when their complaints were dismissed as a bunch of whining by XTR head Ty Bomba.<br/><br/>Apparently intended merely as a small bonus game it ended up carrying the whole load when the planned issue game fell through, it was marred by unusually poor quality control (discolored countersheets.) It is a chess variant with the board expanded to 12 x 12 squares. Follow-up variants in the next two issues of Command added a some interesting variant pieces with new moves and powers and a whole different chess-like game based on 20th Century military units, none of which got the attention it deserved because of the outrage and bad feeling left over from the initial impression. For chess players some interesting ideas, many of which have been seen before in one form or another. For historical board wargamers, it was simply not enough there, and it seemed like a rather pathetic and transparent attempt to cover up XTR's failure to have a suitable alternative to the planned issue game.<br/><br/>EDIT REQUEST:  Does anyone have any information about the game itself?  How it plays, how it differs in strategy and &quot;feel&quot; from regular chess?  Any information other than how it came to be published?<br/><br/>And from the images, it appears the board is 16x16, rather than 12x12.<br/><br/>",

Cesare Borgia has long been considered the model of the Renaissance noble, the prototype of Niccolo Machiavelli's Prince-intelligent, cruel, treacherous, and ruthlessly opportunistic.<br/><br/>It is the XV-XVIth century, and you, the player, represent one of the great, powerful Italian families-the della Rovere, Colonna, de Medici, Orsini, or the newly-arrived Spanish house of Borgia. Your goal is to attain the one position that will guarantee you, and your family, fame, wealth and power: The Papacy.<br/><br/>The Prince is a game of making the best of available resources. Using the members of your family who are cardinals, Papal offices, strongholds in the patrimony of St. Peter, alliances with other families, and even patronage of the remarkable artists who lived at that time, players jostle for position and political leverage until the time comes for the Elector Cardinals to go into their enclave and vote for a new Pope.<br/><br/>Accommodating 3 to 5 players, this strategic cardgame brings to life the political intrigue of early Renaissance Italy. Relive the treachery, deceit, and war of Cesare Borgia and the other leaders that surrounded him.<br/><br/>",

You win the game.&quot;<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Each round, the players shuffle a regular card deck (included), deal out hands of 7 cards and divide up 80 chips among themselves. The shared central playing field is seeded with 4 cards. In turns, each player places cards from their hand into the central field using typical solitaire rules of alternating suit colors and strictly sequential cards in declining value order. Any kings cards in the initial deal or drawn later are placed in the &quot;corner&quot; slots at the player's first opportunity. Solitaire card chains are placed in descending order on the kings.<br/><br/>In the retail version the central playing field is a plastic hub which has four &quot;king&quot; slots and four &quot;tabbed&quot; slots for the available places to build the chains of cards.<br/><br/>&quot;After one player wins the hand by being the first to get rid of all his/her cards, the other players put one chip in the pot for each of the cards remaining in their hand. The winner of the hand receives all the chips in the pot and records the number of chips for his/her score. Each chip is worth one point.

        "description": "The story thus far...<br/><br/>The life of a Strategic Space Sheep Commander isn't easy, especially if that Commander is assigned to the Lambda Sector. Centuries of peace had lasted throughout Lambda, the various Sheep Systems have settled their remaining differences, and the sector has seen a golden age of prosperity and scientific advancement. With the era of scientific enlightenment came the creation of the Spatial Sheep Distortion Drive, supplanting the now-outdated Warp Drive. The ships outfitted with such operate both independently and synchronously with System bases to enable the crossing of vast distances in relatively short amounts of time. With this, the races of the Systems were brought even closer together. Commerce and cultural trade were at an all-time high, and families allowed their Sheeplings to roam free across the neighboring regions without fear.<br/><br/>All was well in the galaxy &ndash; until the first messenger ship arrived from a force that has become known only as &quot;Wolf&quot;. Its language was unintelligible, but its message was clear: complete and total annihilation of Sheepkind. Soon after, the first Wolf ships arrived, laying waste to the satellite planets of the Sheep Home Systems. Front-line galactic defense forces were able to stave off further destruction &ndash; but what is coming is far, far more terrifying than any threat faced in the galaxy's known history.<br/><br/>All Systems have been placed under Red Alert, with the Strategic Sheep Command called together and a Flock Commander named. As members of Wolf have been spotted in Sheep Commanders' uniform, SSC has determined that the best way of insulating the individual Systems is by outlawing all usage of the Spatial Sheep Distortion drives. Inter-system access is granted only to the Elite &quot;Shepherd&quot; class ships, via a complex network of Hyperspace travel. A fleet of these specialized ships has been assigned to recover the Sheeplings and return them to their Home Systems while the Wolf invasion is repelled.<br/><br/>You are a Sheep.<br/>You are a Defender in the Strategic Sheep Command.<br/>You have trained all of your career for this moment in history.<br/>You will issue Tactics to the Shepherd Fleet to direct the Rescue Mission.<br/>You know how to defeat Wolf &ndash; &quot;Ewe's The Force...&quot;<br/><br/>Space Sheep! is a real-time, customizable, cooperative game &ndash; with possible traitor(s) in your midst &ndash; for 1-8 players. The Defenders want to get the Space Sheep tokens and Shepherd tokens back to their matching Systems before all the cards are gone and time has run out. (If playing with Infiltrators, thus making the game semi-cooperative, each player receives a secret allegiance card; each player knows only her own allegiance, leaving her to guess and decipher who else is on her team.)<br/><br/>In Space Sheep!, on each player's turn, the player will play a card from her hand, allowing her to:<br/><br/><br/>     Activate a System and take the action associated with it (moving the Space Sheep and Shepherds),<br/>     Play a card to move a Shepherd clockwise, or<br/>     Play any card face down to the Defense Mat.<br/><br/><br/>Additionally, a player may play a card matching the System occupied by the Wolf to attack (and knock the Wolf token on its side).<br/><br/>In Space Sheep!, one player acts as the Supreme Flock Commander, managing the one-minute sand timer. If the sand runs out, Wolf attacks and players must discard cards from the Defense Mat, the deck, or their hands; if they can't, they lose the game. If the Wolf token has been knocked on its side, the Supreme Flock Commander may flip the sand timer before it runs out to avoid the Wolf attack, standing up the Wolf token and moving it to another System in the process.<br/><br/>Players who are Infiltrators will, of course, be attempting to delay action, make poor moves, and subtly manipulate the other players into making poor choices of their own. At any time players may point at one another in an accusatory fashion. If more than half the players simultaneously point at one player, this player is out of the game. He then reveals his Allegiance and:<br/><br/><br/>     If players have found an Infiltrator, shuffle the player's cards in hand and place them on the bottom of the deck.<br/>     If players have found a Defender, place the player's cards in hand on the face-down discard pile. On the ousted player's turn, Wolf attacks.<br/><br/><br/>If the Defenders get all shepherds and space sheep to their matching systems, then they win the game. If the sand timer runs out and players can't discard enough cards &ndash; or if the number of Infiltrators matches the number of Defenders in the game &ndash; then the Infiltrators win.<br/><br/>Players can customize Space Sheep! by varying the number of Systems in play (more Systems = more complexity), the number of tactic cards in the deck (fewer cards = greater difficulty), the strength of Wolf, the ratio of Infiltrators to Defenders, and the types of direction cards (more directions = greater variability).<br/><br/>",

There are Action cards to turn the tables a bit, as well as cards to earn or lose tip money. Perhaps you will wish to make a 'Barista Challenge' against the other players. Think your coffee will beat someone else's? Go ahead, make their day.

        "description": "Tic-Tac Match is a card game variation of the classic game tic-tac-toe.  Players compete to align three Symbol Cards of the same color and same symbol, either &lsquo;X&rsquo; or &lsquo;O,&rsquo; in any horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row on a traditional 3 x 3 grid of cards. The double matching feature permits covering cards already in play.  This eliminates frustrating ties found in traditional Tic Tac Toe.  But don&rsquo;t be fooled by the simple rules. Action Cards interject deep strategies so players can flip sides mid-game, wipe out their opponent&rsquo;s hand, or play two cards on a single turn. There is even a team-play version for four players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tetris the Card Game is based on the popular video game Tetris.<br/><br/>In this game, the players' goal is to clear 10 lines to win the game.  Players keep a grid of 10 cards face up in front of them, flipping them as lines are cleared to keep track of their score.  Each player may hold two cards at a time in their hand.  Cards may feature blocks known as Tetriminos which can be used to clear lines or special action cards that can hinder other players.<br/><br/>A puzzle will be displayed on the top of the draw pile.  To clear a line, players must use the Tetrimino cards in their hands.  If the Tetrimino on a card fits in this puzzle so that it completes a line (or lines) five squares across without any gaps, it can be played to clear a line (or lines).  In order to fulfill this goal, Tetriminos may be rotated.  For each line cleared, a card is flipped in that player's matrix.  If clearing a line is impossible with the player's hand or if no action cards may be played, then the player must discard a card of their choice and draw the top card of the draw pile.  The next player takes their turn and play proceeds until one player has flipped all ten cards in their matrix.<br/><br/>",

A departure from the traditional trivia-based DVD game, Pirates of the Caribbean has players traveling around a treasure hunt map, battling other pirate ships and completing pirate challenges. Players roll the dice and enter their coordinates on the DVD, which produces all the pirate challenges. At the beginning of the game, players receive a mission card that tells them how much gold, silver and rum they will need to collect for the game. You keep this a secret from the other players. Successfully completing pirate challenges, searching for booty and attacking other pirate ships are the ways you can get the gold, silver and rum you  need to complete your mission and win the game.<br/>The game, based on the hit movie franchise Pirates of the Caribbean, incorporates clips from the films and takes players to recognizable places such as Tortuga Island and Rum Runners Island. However, this is not a movie trivia game. The movie only serves to enhance the action/adventure game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This family of card games is enormously popular in Europe. Fundamentally, it is a set collection game in the manner of Game of Authors (America) and Happy Families (Britain).<br/><br/>May be played by three or more players. Shuffle well and deal equally among the players who must examine their cards; if a player holds any complete fours, lay these on the table.<br/><br/>The player on the right of the dealer asks any player if he holds a card needed to complete a set of four. The enquiring player must always have at least one of the set in their hand before asking. If the player asked holds the card in question, he must surrender it. The player who was succesful may continue to ask the one who has surrendered a card for a further card. The moment that player cannot supply the wanted card, he becomes the one to ask any player for a card.<br/><br/>If a completed Four is obtained, the succesful player should lay it on the table and that set is now safe. This continues round the table until all the sets are laid down and the player has tabled the largest number of four, wins.<br/><br/>The type of questions asked will enable an attentive player to know whom to ask for a wanted card to complete a four. A pool of counters or pennies formed at the start pays an agreed bonus to the player with the most fours. A stipulated fine may be paid to the player who is misinformed about a card.<br/><br/>",

Each of these is numbered 5 through 10 in the four colours.  The other four dice contain the low numbers and the Wild (W) faces.  Each of these dice is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, W, W in the four colours.<br/><br/>In a turn, the player starts by rolling all ten dice.  The player may then set aside any dice he wishes to keep.  He makes a second roll with the remaining dice.  He may set aside some of these dice, adding them to those already set aside; he may also take back some of the dice previously set aside.  Then he makes a third and final roll, scores and ends his turn.<br/><br/>Each phase specifies which dice are needed (sets, runs, flushes), so this is sort of sequential Yahtzee.<br/><br/>",

However instead of numbers, letters and words take center stage.<br/><br/>Players still have a maximum of 3 rolls in a given turn but now players have 7 dice at their disposal. The dice in Word Yahtzee contain a set of letters similar to that on offer in Scrabble and each letter is also tagged with a value, which is used in creating a score when a player meets one of the criteria.<br/><br/>The targets to aim for include words of certain lengths (top half of the score pad), whilst the bottom half includes categories such as 2 words, 3 words, all vowels and all consonants to name a few.<br/><br/>To achieve a Yahtzee a player must be able to form a 7-Letter word.<br/><br/>At the end of each game the highest score is declared the winner but like classic Yahtzee, players an play all 6 games featured on a single page and combine those scores to play a more epic game.<br/><br/>Word Yahtzee is a word dice game.<br/><br/>",

A player chooses between one of four actions on his turn:  Moving his pawn on the board via die roll; military fortification of a previously influenced country; military response to another player's prior coup d'etat against a non-fortified country; or attempt an invasion of a non-fortified country.  The game centers around keeping other players' military influence markers out of strategically valued countries, and installing your own influence and subsequent fortifications in same.  Once a country has military fortifications installed, it is immune from all further actions.  Unfortunately for the warmongers, world opinion is constantly being lowered by hostile actions, and propaganda efforts must be maintained to keep world opinion high enough for successful actions.  Of course, before you can militarily influence anybody, you have to get economic influence going, and the various spaces on the board track take care of giving everybody opportunity for same.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The galaxy is in peril! The evil robot Zaxxon and its legion of followers have conquered an asteroid belt! It's your job to ward off this threat before it's too late.<br/>Published in 1983, the Zaxxon Board Game was one of Milton Bradley&rsquo;s numerous attempts to translate video games to board games.<br/><br/>Will You Volunteer for this Dangerous Mission?<br/><br/>You and your opponent compete to be the first executive your perilous mission. Maneuver your fighter planes over the enemy fortress by die roll. &quot;Fly&quot; at high or low altitude by raising or lowering your planes on their bases for real 3-dimensional game play Zoom up and over fortress walls and dive down to blast enemy targets. Engage in dogfights at close quarters to force your opponent to retreat. Penetrate enemy radar to challenge Zaxxon to a showdown!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME: <br/>1. ROLLING THE DIE: both players roll their die AT THE SAME TIME. Reroll the die if there is a tie. On EACH turn, the player rolling the Lower Number on the die ALWAYS plays first. Then the player rolling the Higher Number plays second. <br/>2. USING THE SPINNER: the player rolling the Lower Number spins the spinner. The spinner controls enemy fire directed at fighter planes from missile silos and gun turrets (later in the game the spinner will also control the movement of Zaxxon). When RED is spun, any plane that is in or enters a missile silo area CONTAINING A MISSILE SILO is shot down and returned to its home base. When BLUE is spun, any plane that is in a gun turret area CONTAINING A GUN TURRET is shot down and returned to its home base. If a missile silo or a gun turret has been shot and removed from the board, there is no enemy fire from that area so any planes in that area are safe. Notice that the missile silo areas are surrounded by a red border and the gun turret areas are surrounded by a blue border. See Figures 5A and 5B for locations. When WHITE is spun, all planes are safe. Please Note: if your plane is shot down by a missile silo or gun turret in the inner fortress, return it to a RESTART space in your outer fortress. <br/>3. ORDER OF PLAY: after spinning the spinner, the player who rolled the Lower Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. Then the player who rolled the Higher Number moves his or her plane or planes according to the die count just rolled. You can move one of your planes the full amount on the die or move both of your planes, splitting the die count between them in any combination<br/>4. HOW A FIGHTER PLANE MOVES: a fighter plane can move from one space to any adjacent space by die count as shown in Figure 6. A plane can change direction or land on the same space more than once on the same turn. A plane cannot pass over or land on a space occupied by another plane. A fighter plane can &quot;fly&quot; at High Altitude or Low Altitude by raising or lowering it on its base. Each change in altitude (either High to Low or Low to High) counts as ONE on your die count. Your plane must be at Low Altitude to shoot a target and at High Altitude to cross a wall.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN THE GAME: <br/>Be the first player to destroy your enemy targets and shoot Zaxxon with both of your fighter planes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This very portable beer &amp; pretzels game comes as a pocket travel case containing 2 pig dice, two pencils and a scoring booklet that also includes the scoring table. The pigs are actual pig miniatures, with a dot on their right flanks.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first to score 100 points using &quot;pigs&quot; as dice. On your turn, you throw the pigs and hope they end up in a scoring position such as a &quot;snouter,&quot; &quot;trotter,&quot; or &quot;leaning jowler&quot; (ranging in value from 1 to 60 points); if they do, you decide whether to &quot;cash&quot; the points (pass the pigs to the next player) or to roll again. If you roll a non-scorer (&quot;pig out&quot; - one pig on the right flank, the other on the left flank; a fairly frequent result), you lose any as-yet-uncashed points. If you throw an &quot;oinker&quot; (both pigs touching each other), you lose your entire accumulated score. If you throw a &quot;piggyback&quot; (one pig on top of the other), you're altogether eliminated!<br/><br/>The variant Hog Call rules allow the other players to risk predicting the outcome of the throw; if predicted successfully, the hog caller earns twice the value of the position *and* deducts that same amount from the roller's score!<br/><br/>Schweinerei, the German edition, was released by Milton Bradley in 1984; Milton Bradley in 1996; Winning Moves Games (USA) Deutschland in 2001.<br/><br/>",

Board Game lets fans play as their favorite secret agent or staffer and compete against other players. The object of the game is to gain the Upper Hand over your opponents by insulting them, doing well on missions (quite the ego boost), and encountering random guest stars and secondary characters from the show. Each player starts with five Upper Hand, and the first player to have 20 Upper Hand wins.<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of the following characters to play: Archer, Lana, Malory, Cyril, Pam, Cheryl, Ray or Dr. Krieger. The insults and dirty tricks you deliver to the other players are based on actual quotes from the show that your character makes. The cards in your unique deck of twenty cards give you the ability to hurl insults, &quot;come on&quot; to another character, or say something that builds up your character's own ego. Naturally you'll have plenty of opportunities to belittle your co-workers while in the office and out in the field. Doing so will knock them down a peg or two on the Upper Hand track.<br/><br/>The action takes place at the ISIS Headquarters, though spy missions send the gang off to exotic locales each round of play. The game features six important office locations within ISIS, but you (typically) play with around four of them, making each game play out very differently since the &quot;Office Map&quot; varies from game to game. Each location does something different, but only the first person to go to each location each round gets the benefit listed on that location. Surely there will be no name calling when another player beats you to the punch!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A high-pressure game of getting rid of a &quot;hot&quot; potato so as not to be holding it when time runs out.<br/><br/>This game probably goes way back. Sidney Addy's Glossary of Sheffield Words describes a game in which &quot;a number of people sit in a row, or in chairs round a parlor. A lighted taper is handed to the first, who says:<br/><br/>Jack's alive, and likely to live<br/>If he dies in your hand, you've a forfeit to give.<br/><br/>The one in whose hand the light expires has to pay the forfeit.&quot;<br/><br/>That was written in 1888.<br/><br/>Apparently later it was played with an actual hot potato. Whoever ended up with the potato when the music stopped was kicked out and the potato elimination match continued.<br/><br/>By the 1950s, manufactured Hot Potato games were already on store shelves. Remco&rsquo;s late 1950s version used small plastic pans for each player, covered up so that no one would know who was holding the real potato. In the 1960s, there was &ldquo;Spudsie,&rdquo; a wind-up potato who emitted a loud DING when time was up. In the 1980s, there was the battery-powered &ldquo;Chip O&rsquo;Grattin.&rdquo; Most recently there is a battery-powered talking potato, which shouts out &ldquo;Yahoo!&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, those humans can attempt to save their cursed companions at a cost or take them out and hope they stay dead.<br/><br/>Each player's turn is comprised of three steps, always in the following order: Event, Move, Action. Once each player takes a turn that's called a round. At the end of each round, all Enemies take their turn:<br/><br/>EVENT<br/>Each player draws an event card which they must immediately play.<br/><br/>MOVE All characters can move up to two spaces in any direction or may choose to stay put. Items and Ex-Mortis Pages on the board may be picked up by moving over them, but characters cannot stop to take an Action and then continue moving. A Character will pick up whatever is on their space before having to take any Action on that space, such as Attacking an Enemy.<br/><br/>ACTION<br/>After moving, the player may make Actions as defined by an Item Card. There is no limit to the number of Actions a Player takes on their turn, given they're all viable Actions.

The rondel spaces are not fixed in place- they are randomized at the beginning of the game. Not only that, they're double-sided, so you might never play on the exact same configuration twice. There are two different victory conditions, and players each have a small &quot;tech-tree&quot; in their city with multiple viable paths. Furthermore, the city cards are double-sided, one side is identical for all players, and the other side is unique. To top it off, the crux of the gameplay is the push-your-luck damage system, which makes you value spaces differently depending on how damaged you or others already are.<br/><br/>Bottlecap Vikings is packaged with 3 mini-expansions for other Tasty Minstrel Games<br/>Harbour: Ice Viking<br/>Gold West: Bandits Promo<br/>Eminent Domain: Battlecruisers – Heavy Assault<br/><br/>",

Run for Your Lives! each player receives four cards from the deck; cards are one of two types: a zombie (which come in different varieties) or a potentially helpful item that can protect you from those aforementioned zombies.

A player cannot have identical items or zombies in front of him. If you ever have five zombies in front of you, you've succumbed to the horde and become a zombie yourself. As a result, your mental abilities are extremely limited, which means that on your turn, you simply draw the top card and play it on a living player, getting revenge against whoever killed you or perhaps aiding the player you care for the most.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you collect five items in front of yourself, you've proved yourself invulnerable to zombies and instantly win!<br/><br/>",

Sabotage your opponents with PORTAL-BLOCKERS, and VAPORIZE blockers in your way. Battle your opponents up close with LASER SWORDS, or eliminate them with LIGHT STARS. Finally, NEUTRALIZE the other star systems with the very powerful NEGATIVE ENERGY DISCS (NED).<br/><br/>New Advanced Rules: Use your Ninja Master Card to come into the battle when your ninja is facing elimination. In addition, each ninja has a special ability and on the third hit-point is eliminated. This adds much more strategy to the game and plays in about an hour.<br/><br/>Ninja Galaxy is a fun Space-Battle Adventure for the whole family and yet serious enough for the &quot;gamer.&quot; A game of strategy, chance and fantastic finishes!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Moral Dilemma is a rude, adult party game where the right answer is always determined by your peers. This party game of ethical debate will put you and your friends in a position to discuss some of the most outrageous predicaments with some of the most terrible resolutions that we could think of. Two unique sets of rules will create two very different ways to play the game! In one set, argue for what you believe, and in the other you argue for whatever the cards tell you.<br/><br/>On your turn, you pull a card and read. You then secretly vote for one of two choices on the card. The rest of the group (society) then votes as a team. If you agree with society, then you get the point!<br/><br/>Includes hundreds of unique moral dilemmas (with a few classics thrown in there) that can sprout hours of fun and debate!<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s in the box:<br/><br/>385 Cards<br/>Game Instructions<br/><br/>",

So, you and your deceased friends have decided to have a little race around the graveyard....&quot; Thus begins the wackiest game from Twilight Creations yet! The players control their pawns as usual. But: the pawns in this game are self-propelled windup toys!<br/><br/>Players are dealt 8 cards and then draft them by passing first 4, then 3, then 2, and finally 1 to the player to their left. Other players then lead one of their sets and other players must play all their cards for the same action. Whichever player plays the most of that action takes it - if there's a tie, they both take it. The actions include Winding your pawn from 1-4 times, rotating left, rotating right or rotating your opponent.<br/><br/>As players move on the board they encounter hazards, which might make them lose progress and brains. Each time they hit a brain they can take a brain token. Brain tokens allow them to take special actions when discarded.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player manages to cross the finish line and exit the graveyard. There are 4 double-sided boards which allow many different races.<br/><br/>",

It was most popular about five hundred years ago and was played by Monks in churches as well as on village greens throughout England.<br/><br/>The game is for two players.  One player has nine black playing pieces, the other has nine white playing pieces.  The first player to reduce their opponent to two pieces wins.<br/><br/>In the first stage of the game players take turns placing their pieces on the board, attempting to make a line of three.  Once all the pieces have been placed, players may slide them, still attempting to make a line of three.  Whenever a player makes a line of three, they remove an opponent's piece of his choice.  When one player has only three pieces left, he is allowed to move any piece from any point on the board to any other point in order to more effectively block the winning opponent and to make a line of three.  As soon as one player is left with only two pieces, his opponent wins.<br/><br/>",

Dogs naturally do not belong on there, so poop should be cleaned up.<br/><br/>Aim of the game<br/><br/>Collect the dog's feces in your shovel. The first player to three pieces on his or her shovel is the winner.<br/><br/>Game play<br/><br/>Put the dog in the middle of the table. Each player gets a shovel. The youngest player starts the game by rolling the dice. The symbols on the dice indicate what you should do. This mostly indicates how many times you can push the handle on the dog's leash. Each time you push it the poop gets closer to the end, when it drops out you get it and one point. When you have three points, you win the game.  Other symbols on the dice tell you that you can't do anything on this turn or that you can switch shovels with another player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue is a fast-paced game of cards and intrigue at court, created by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia. Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves.<br/><br/>In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards.<br/><br/>The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand.<br/><br/>The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players.<br/><br/>If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card. At the end of the game, the player with the least penalty points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Between the time that saw the sinking of Atlantis and the great flood that was to cover the world, there was an unsuspected Bronze Age. An age of legends, raw magic and conflicts in the lush jungles and steaming swamps that would one day become the Mediterranean Sea. Heroes from all over the continent embarked on a Homeric quest to save the world from the threat posed by Anastyr, the queen of dragons.<br/><br/>Anastyr is a cooperative board game with miniatures for 1 to 4 players. Each player takes on the role of a powerful hero, and your team of heroes embarks on an incredible odyssey through a world where they will face hordes of enemies and monsters, wizards and warlords, all very different depending on the environment in which they live. Each hero has their own equipment and fighting style that will each evolve during the course of their journey; all hoping to be powerful enough to face the ultimate threat at the end of this epic, adventure-filled campaign! During their quest, heroes will ride a variety of mounts (horses, raptors, saber-toothed tigers and other exotic creatures) that will give them special advantages, and their combat skills and ability to coordinate with their companions will be tested constantly.<br/><br/>Anastyr has some particularly immersive innovations, such as scrolling tiles, interchangeable magnetic mounts, and backdrops that turn your game board into a beautiful diorama. The game features a dynamic mix of playing cards and special dice to roll and introduces combat mechanics loosely based on brawler video games. Heroes eliminate their opponents by unleashing fearsome combos. But they will also be able to ravage the battlefield with their Fury, a devastating attack resulting from unleashing their rage that has accumulated over the course of the battle. Each hero has a unique deck, which reflects their individual fighting style. And in the campaign mode, this deck can be improved by the player by the addition of new cards they can choose which will reflect the evolution and the leveling up of the hero over time.<br/><br/>Anastyr is easy to learn, but also fast, tactical... and brutal!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They are given $20 in fake money and 10 junk food tokens as well as the give character cards matching the pawn they selected.<br/><br/>Players take turns using the spinner to decide actions and movement.  Moving into a new square triggers the action described on the square, in addition to any action the spinner dictated.<br/><br/>Typical actions are giving away money or junk food tokens to other players, receiving money or junk food tokens from other players, and swapping money or junk food tokens with another player.<br/><br/>Special actions are the question spaces on the board.  When a player lands on one they must read the next question on the current question card, write down their answer, and pick one of the other players to guess the written answer.  If they guess correctly, they turn one of their character cards face down; if they guess incorrectly, then the current player turns one of the his/her character cards face down.<br/><br/>Some sample questions:<br/>&quot;True or False: I'd rather watch a horror movie than a sentimental drama.&quot;  <br/>&quot;What's my favorite movie?&quot;  <br/>&quot;Has a dog ever chased me?&quot;<br/><br/>When one player has turned all five character cards face down, the game is over.  Players with face up character cards remaining must add three points per card to their point total (sum of junk food and money).  The player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Most of the re-releases revolved around alternate years Super Bowls with the players present from the respective teams ending up in that years game box. This game gave you all the players needed for a full football team on offense and defense and movement bases that allowed particular players to hopefully run particular routes. There was also the triple threat QB. He could pass, punt and kick your field goals. Earlier versions just included a little clicker type device to flip around the ball. Little felt football were included. Game field vibrated with an electric buzzer to set the players in motion. Set up your formations then turn the switch on and off accordingly, adjusting your players as the rules allowed. So what if the game is absolutely impossible to play? The components were enough to keep us all entertained and constantly wanting to pull it out.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player will roll the dice which will correspond to the number of spaces a player moves. When a player lands on a tile that indicates a type of a card (Color, Size, Location or M.O.M Classification), they get to take one card from that pile. The card is then placed facedown. Should you obtain another card of that type, you place the new card on top of the other card. The dice ranges from 2-6 with one of the sides showing a &quot;P&quot;. When this side is rolled, the player who rolled it, gets to go to a passage (location space marked with a &quot;P&quot;) of his/her choice. All other players not on a &quot;P&quot; are temporarily removed.

        "description": "A travelling game through Continental Europe.<br/>Each player begins in a home city and draws 8 cards for other cities they must visit by a combination of land, sea and air travel. Roll a die each turn for movement, with players trying to choose the optimal routes. The first player to visit all their cities and return home wins.<br/><br/>The limitation of using only 1 mode of transport per turn, as well as increasing cost for air based on distance, increases the analysis and decisions required. Certain 'special' city cards also provide benefits (extra turn, free movement, etc.) or penalties (miss a turn, mandatory travel).  With 180 cities on the board, there are multiple paths to choose each turn, and no two games are ever the same!<br/>A Ravensburger Family game.<br/>Note: The rule book also includes educational information about notable attractions for the 63 'special' cities.<br/><br/>",

It takes about 30 minutes to play a full game, even with an 8 person game.<br/><br/>Players choose a Warrior card (like Medusa or Puss In Boots) from their hand to represent them in battle, then multiple players must work together as a team to defeat the players on the other side of the table. They also use Item cards (like Excalibur or Flying Carpet) to get them out of a tight spot and turn the battle around! Each battle is also set on a Battlefield (like Beanstalk or Sleepy Village) and players can use the terrain to their advantage.<br/><br/>The actual battle is conducted by players describing their character's action to the judge, who has final ruling on all matters. If it convinces the judge, it's fair game! After each battle, the role of the judge passes to the player on the current judge's left.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The semi-educational game of time travel and abduction!<br/><br/>Evil Baby Orphanage is a communal deck party card game for three or more players. Each player takes on the role of a Time Nanny using advanced time out technology to rid the time stream of the world's worst villains and &quot;prehabilitate&quot; them to be accountants, or ballerinas, or something.<br/><br/>The game consists of two decks; the baby deck and the nanny deck. During your turn play nanny cards from your hand to &quot;adopt&quot; babies from your friends, keep your babies in check, and make your opponent's babies go nuts. Then each of your babies takes its &quot;unsupervised actions&quot; unless you can calm them down with toys or nap time. Finally, adopt an evil baby from the time stream (three face up babies from the baby deck), draw more nanny cards, and end your turn.<br/><br/>Start your turn with ten mischief and win the game, but be careful, containing the world's most mischievous babies isn't easy! Keep your babies from burning down your orphanage as you try to keep the Unabomber away from the arts and crafts table, Kim Jong Il away from the toy rocket ship, and Caligula away from everyone...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the Lands Between, a mysterious and otherworldly realm where the landscape is rich and varied. As you explore, you&rsquo;ll build out a hex-based map of your surroundings, with unique locations to visit, resources to gather, NPC&rsquo;s to interact with, and enemies to fight. Your progress is tracked by a narrative story that provides objectives as well as guidance on how to achieve them &ndash; and, depending on your decisions, alternative side-quests and emergent narrative to experience, too.<br/><br/>Diceless and with strong elements of deck-building, combat is both deadly and personal. As your Tarnished character levels up, you must carefully build your attack and effect decks to best optimise with your equipment. Although exploration takes place on the zoomed-out hex map, each player has their own dedicated quest book on which combat encounters will take place face-to-face.<br/><br/>When you enter combat, you&rsquo;ll open your quest book to the indicated page. There, you&rsquo;ll find a battlefield grid that raises the level of combat from one of simple physical positioning to state of mental readiness. Using rows and lanes, this unique system means your position dictates not only your physical position in the encounter, but your battle stance: aggressive, neutral, or defensive. Each battle stance has benefits and drawbacks to exploit and avoid with the changing state of battle, which can even vary from one encounter to the next.<br/><br/>Understanding enemy attack patterns is key, helping to inform when to expose an enemy weakness and press home an attack, and when to play defensively while your stamina returns. Drawn at random but possible to manipulate, the marching order will determine which characters act when, and give you the vital opportunity to plan ahead, just as you&rsquo;d learn &lsquo;tells&rsquo; in the video game.<br/><br/>A single bad decision can mean death to the unwary, sending unlucky Tarnished back to the nearest Site of Grace to respawn.<br/><br/>Because combat takes place in your individual quest book, your encounters also won&rsquo;t disrupt play for everyone else. After making the three actions in your turn &mdash; and enduring any enemy attacks &mdash; your combat will pause while the other Tarnished continue exploring the overworld, with combat resuming once your turn comes back around.<br/><br/>When your party locates a dungeon, your quest books will be joined together, allowing you to take on bosses together on a much larger stage while still being up close and personal. But boss encounters aren&rsquo;t the only time you&rsquo;ll fight side by side. If one of your fellow Tarnished is in trouble, there are also ways to join their personal combat book and lend a hand &mdash; or a sword.<br/><br/>The official tabletop adaptation of the hit video game that sold over 13 million copies in its first month after release, ELDEN RING&trade;: The Board Game features huge and lavishly detailed miniatures, as well as close to a thousand cards, four large quest books, and a towering stack of exploration tile, all in the core box alone.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a big box cooperative campaign game for 1-4 players, where each session is playable in 90-120 minutes and core box campaigns will span 30-40 hours, increasing to 90 hours with the expansions. And your Tarnished can make the entire journey with you, from one region to the next&hellip;<br/><br/>",

If there are no more players than boards, the dealer may also play if desired. The dealer or &quot;caller&quot; is furnished with an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards, shuffles them, and turns over the top one calling it out. Each player with that space on their board covers it with a counter. The dealer continues turning over cards until someone wins by having a complete row of five scored, either horizontally or vertically. The player who wins becomes the next dealer.<br/><br/>Several scoring methods are suggested, such as collecting all counters lying on other boards. Or, continue playing until everyone has a line of five, then scoring via the rank of poker hands - the boards are arranged so that each line vertically and horizontally represents every different poker hand, ranging from a &quot;straight flush&quot; to &quot;a pair&quot;.<br/><br/>",

After determining who goes first, players choose the Robot Master's stage on which they wish to start the game. On your turn, flip over the challenge card to reveal your first challenge. You choose the dice you wish to use to pass the challenge, then play cards from your hand and use abilities from your character to blast, jump or run through the challenge. Your opponents can play cards from the Dr. Wily side of their hand to make your challenge more difficult, possibly doing damage or taking lives from you along the way. If you beat the challenge, you move forward on the stage a number of spaces determined by the challenge you defeated.<br/><br/>Once all spaces are clear and you are face-to-face with the Robot Master, you enter the &quot;Boss Battle&quot;. You and your opponents now take turns battling each other until only one robot remains standing. If you are the victor, you take the Robot Master's powers from the character card, stacking it under your own character card. If you were the first player to defeat this Robot Master, you also gain its Trophy, which allows you to set a die to any face you wish in a future Challenge or Boss Battle.<br/><br/>Play continues around the board until you have defeated enough Robot Masters to enter Dr. Wily's castle and face the final boss. The first player to defeat Dr. Wily wins.<br/><br/>",

If a player lands on another cap or a stack of caps, that player captures the stack by nesting his or her cap on top of the stack.  A player then seeks to return that stack of caps to home-base to keep them.  The game ends when there is only one active color of caps left on the board.

Devil Bunny hates the Earth, for reasons best left known to people who bother to think about such things, and has decided to have his revenge by releasing upon this world the most unsatisfying brand of saltwater taffy known to man.  You and your friends have devised a way to stop him, however.  By luring cute and cuddly little squirrels into the factory and getting them to gum up your works (presumably doing unpleasant things to the squirrel, too) you think you might be able to break yourself, thus foiling Devil Bunny's plot.  Sure, it's a half baked idea, but you're taffy pulling machines, not scientists.  Besides, Devil Bunny's plot isn't likely to succeed anyway.<br/><br/>The game focuses on distribution of tokens (representing squirrels) in a linear fashion eventually leading to your machine.  However, on certain rolls of the dice, Devil Bunny will come out onto the board and repair (remove tokens from) a machine.  Wacky, fun, quick.<br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/><br/>    2001 Origins Award Nominee: Best Abstract Board Game<br/><br/><br/>",

How you pass is to select one card from your hand, put it on the table face down next to the person on your right, then you pick up the card the person on your left put down. You keep doing this until 1) you get 4 of a kind or 2) someone else gets four of a kind. At this point you grab a spoon, and the person who doesn't get a spoon gets a 'pig' point. Once you get 3 pig points you are a hog. If you are a hog you have lost, but you can still be part of the game. Hogs can talk to game players, but if a game player talks to a hog they get a pig point. Of course the winner is the person left when everyone else is a hog.<br/><br/>",

A Drinking Man's Thinking Game can be played as a drinking game, or other methods of 'penalties' can be agreed upon by players prior to game play.  The cards also feature traditional poker symbols, so the cards may be used to play games such as Texas Hold 'Em, Poker, or a Wench variation utilizing the card mechanics.  Cards have 3 different categories, Stein (table cards), Barley (played only on a player's turn) and Wing (which can fly out of a player's hand at any time).  The game involves remembering what cards your opponents have that they may have shown during the game, or tricking them into breaking one of your rules or a rule that is in play so they must pay a penalty, and you can remove a card from your hand. The object of the game is to remove all cards from your hand and go 'out,' thereby making the player at the end of the night, who accumulated the most points, The Wench of the evening.  They will then have to pay an agreed upon punishment such as buy the beer or pizza, take out the garbage, etc.<br/><br/>",

Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered, I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the Goblin City to take back the child that you have stolen, for my will is as strong as yours, and my kingdom as great.&quot;<br/><br/>Jim Henson's Labyrinth: The Board Game is a beautiful exploration of the movie for 1-5 players in which Sarah, Ludo, Sir Didymus and Hoggle must adventure through the labyrinth and make their way to the goblin city to save Toby from Jareth, the goblin king!<br/><br/>The board is very simplistic, beautifully illustrated and dominated by the titular Labyrinth. This is the maze that players must navigate every time they wish to save Sarah&rsquo;s baby brother. Each game is different with the blank card spaces being filled with the magical encounters and monsters that are depicted on the deck of cards that comes with the game, this ensures a great deal of replayability and unpredictability in the game, giving the Labyrinth its signature feel.<br/><br/>The game consists of two distinct stages, one in which the group must adventure through the labyrinth trying to find the goblin city whilst keeping their willpower as high as possible (nobody wants to fall into the oubliette!), and a second stage in which the players must fight their way into Jareth's castle where Sarah must say the&nbsp;magical words that will release her brother.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a fairly complex strategy game featuring resource management and trading.  The objective is to move one of your player tokens to the 9th circle and defeat Lucifer.<br/><br/>The initial setup is the outer ring of the board. Each tile is two rings and the tiles are numbered. Players take turns placing 3 of their player tokens on the tile of their choice.  Each tile corresponds to one of four resources.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each player's turn, two dice are rolled.  A 7 brings a demon into play in a corner of that player's choice.  Any other number will result in some players gaining resources. Rolling doubles gives your regular allotment of resources, plus a resource of your choice.  Rolling 2 or 12 allows you to place a marker on one tile that either doubles or eliminates production for that tile.<br/><br/>Players can use their resources to bring out new player tokens, buy new tiles for inner circles of hell, move themselves, descend deeper into hell, move others, flip tiles, or alter die rolls.  Players can trade resources with other players during their turn.  The lower circles of hell generate more resources (2 for 3/4, 3 for 5/6 and 4 for 7/8).<br/><br/>The game ends when a player descends to the ninth level and defeats Lucifer by rolling a 10 or better on two dice.<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>This is a very simple CCG based on the movie Star Wars: Episode I.<br/><br/>First, after shuffling, you see who goes first (usually drawing &quot;destiny&quot;) and then draw 6 cards from your reserve deck.  The player who goes first usually chose the planet to battle at first.  And, from these 6 cards, you then deploy up to 6 &quot;counters&quot; worth of cards from your hand.  These can be Locations (if you are on the same planet), weapons and characters.  There were also &quot;effect&quot; cards that could be deployed to the table to boost up your characters, power, equipment and # of counters per turn.<br/><br/>Phase two is battling for the planet you are currently on.  You lay any battle cards in your hand down and pick up your deployed character and weapon cards.  These are arranged in the order of &quot;battle card, weapon card, character card.&quot;  With the cards in order from last (first character you want to battle with) to first (last character to be battled), you place them face down in a stack and you both turn over cards until you get to a character (in the case of weapons and battle cards).  Cards turned over before the character are attached to the character (weapons and such) if the character can use them.  If the character can not use them, then they are discarded.  If you have weapons, you total up the number of &quot;power dots&quot; (red dots) and draw destiny.  That is the top card of your reserve deck.  You then look at the small number on the &quot;die&quot; in the upper right hand corner of the card.  You add this power to the character.  Whichever character has more power wins and the loser discards his character and attached cards.  Damage is listed on the card that lost.  The loser then discards that many cards off the top of his or her deck.  Both players then turn over their cards in the fight deck for the next characters to fight, etc. If the attacker ends up with more characters then the defender then the defender discards 1 card for each.  The cards that survived the battle remain at the planet for the next round.<br/><br/>The final phase is called even up.  Pick up your original hand and you may discard it before drawing back up to 6 cards then go back to phase one again.  If you have more than 6 cards in your hand, you have to discard down to 6.  If you have less than, and you wish to keep them, you then draw to equal 6.  If you are not satisfied with your hand, you can discard the whole thing and draw 6 fresh cards.<br/><br/>If after a battle you are the only one with characters left on a planet you have won it and you move to the next planet which is chosen by the winner of the planet.  You can also &quot;surrender&quot; the planet.<br/><br/>You win by controlling 2 of the 3 planets or by running your opponent out of cards.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other little things involved but that is basically how the game goes.  The artwork on the cards is up to Deciphers usual very high standards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dread Pirate is an elegantly presented family game focusing on pirate lore and like any good Pirate the one with the most loot wins.<br/><br/>Each of the pirates start in their own port with a few doubloons and jewels of their own color. The rest of that color of jewel are piled near their port and the remaining doubloons are piled on &ldquo;Dread Island&rdquo; in the center of the map, along with the &lsquo;fate&rsquo; cards that are drawn when sailing through specific marked areas of the board. It is these pirates goal to sail to the other ports and either raid or trade for jewels of the other colors. Once a pirate has at least one jewel of each color they can land on that Dread Island and collect some free doubloons. &quot;Skirmishes&quot;can be had with other pirates at sea and may slow the journey, but the reward of treasure can be great. Once all the jewels are gone from the original piles in the home ports (some will accumulate on Dread Island), the game is over and everyone counts the swag in their pouch.<br/><br/>The 2002 Signature Edition of this game is packaged in a wooden treasure chest and includes a board in the form of an aged treasure map, three wooden dice, four treasure sacks, four die cast metal ships, one wooden wind cube, fifty-two Dread Pirate cards, four map cards, fifty replica doubloons, 120 treasure jewels, 1st Edition rulebook, and captain&rsquo;s log. The chest and rule book are also marked &quot;Old Century Classics&quot;.<br/>The 2003 Signature Edition is identical with the exception that it only has 100 jewels, and a 2nd Edition Rulebook and is marked &quot;Front Porch Classics&quot; instead of &quot;Old Century Classics&quot;.<br/>The 2007 Signature Edition differs from the 2003 version in that it has a 3rd Edition rulebook, a Jolly Roger flag, and the four map cards are discontinued.<br/>The cloth map has extra anchor icons identical to the ones seen in Buccaneer's Revenge, and the game comes in a black wooden chest instead of a brown one. It is also marked &quot;copyright Sababa Group&quot;, instead of Front Porch Classics.<br/><br/>The Bookshelf Edition is packaged in a wooden bookshelf box and includes all of the components of the 2003 Signature Edition, plus a Jolly Roger flag. The rulebook is marked &quot;Bookshelf Edition&quot;. The Copyright 2003 Bookshelf edition rulebook is otherwise identical to the 2nd edition treasure chest rules.<br/> The 2007 Bookshelf Edition, which was marketed by Sababa Toys, has a rulebook that corresponds to the 2007 Signature Edition. It only has 45 gold pieces instead of the 50 seen in all previous editions. The coins are also smaller, and the cloth map is smaller than the one seen in the Signature Edition.<br/>Sababa Group editions of the game are also marked &quot;Copyright 2007 Sababa Group&quot; on the Dread Pirate cards and on the inside box lid.<br/><br/>",

Some spaces are event ones - like gain/lose a turn, go forward or backward, discard one or more mushrooms etc. When all the players reach the end of the track the one with most &quot;good&quot; mushrooms wins.<br/><br/>The game is very popular in Poland - there are many versions by many publishers (they often differ in the shape of the path, the number of mushrooms to collect, and the adventures included).<br/><br/>",

Players cooperatively make decisions on how to progress the story as they decide to explore different regions of the world, follow leads, leverage allies, and overcome opposition of all kinds. During gameplay, players use a variety of physical and digital game components &mdash; a deck of cards with essential clues and plot twists, a dozen physical handouts, and a dedicated website with additional resources &mdash; to steer the narrative in fun and surprising directions for a truly immersive experience.<br/><br/>Beginning with an introductory prologue designed to get players acquainted with the massive Dune universe, the game then continues with three big adventures, each taking roughly two-to-three hours to play. During each episode, players can earn experience points to level up their characters in between missions and unlock new options in future gameplay. Each adventure can be played separately as standalone episodes, yet should players complete all three episodes, they will unravel a master game narrative with an epic climax and unforgettable resolution with lasting impact on the future two games in the trilogy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Possibly a relative of Hnefatafl, Fox and Geese is a hunt game played on a cross-shaped board of thirty-three points connected by vertical, horizontal, and alternating diagonal lines.  Like many ancient abstract strategy games, the number of pieces and their starting positions varies from region to region but the general play of the game is the same: one player controls a single piece, the fox, the other player controls the geese (usually 13 to 17).  The fox player tries to remove all of the geese from the board by jumping them.  The geese player tries to prevent this from happening by pinning down the fox so that it cannot move.<br/><br/>The game of Solitaire can be played on a Fox &amp; Geese board, and some sets include additional markings for playing Asalto = Siege.<br/><br/>There are some claims that Fox and Geese is related to an earlier game called Halatafl, but there is as yet no concrete definition of what exactly this game was or how it was played.  There are also several contemporary games using the Halatafl name, at least one of which is played on a similar board to Fox and Geese but with differing rules.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://av.getinfo.de/media/11310?2</a> ( CC Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives 3.0 )<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://vimeo.com/51819749\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://vimeo.com/51819749</a><br/><br/>",

You must be vigilant and find your allies before your enemies can unite against them or you.<br/><br/>Players control coloured pawns that represent characters from early in the Buffy TV series, both good (Buffy, Giles, Xander, Willow, and Cordelia) and evil (The Master, Drusilla, and Spike). The twist is, no-one knows which pawn you control, or which character it represents. At the start of the game each player is given a colour card and a character card, kept secret from the other players. Unowned colours and characters are still in play, not controlled by any player. Each turn players can choose to move any pawn they wish, not just the colour they control. When you move a pawn into a space that's already occupied, you may choose one player (or unowned group of colour and character cards) and ask to see their colour. If that colour pawn is present in the space you just moved to, you may ask to see their character card. You cannot reveal this information to the other players. Once this phase is complete, anyone who controls a pawn in that same space may reveal their colour and character cards to everyone and start a fight. The losing side has to drop a character involved in the combat (and the associated player, if any) from the game. Play continues until it's established that all remaining players are on the same side.<br/><br/>Same theme and nearly identical name, but a different game from Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Game.<br/><br/>",

The demo rulebook made available was mostly a straight-up copy of the Massive Darkness rulebook.<br/><br/>Overturn is tactical combat based RPG board game with co-op elements to it. It uses a rich Middle Eastern folklore as a backdrop to tell its story which is ingrained with supernatural elements, legends and conspiracies.<br/><br/>The game uses a multiboard system to depict major scenarios with each major scenario ultimately ending after defeating its boss. The objective to win is simple: defeat all the bosses to reach the final boss and win the game. This can be done all on its own but it&rsquo;s the coop element that makes Overturn unique. Each board or primary mission can be completed with multiple heroes and players yet each player has the option to pursue their own version of the story on the board and the choice to assist other players or not.<br/><br/>The combat is turn based with the enemies having their own unique AI that makes them formidable as well as unpredictable. Players grow their levels by defeating enemies and learning new skills and increasing their power. This applies to enemies too who grow just as much tough as the player grows bolder.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can you name the five Great Lakes in 30 seconds?  Sure, but can you name five things you shouldn't say to your boss?  That's the idea behind this quick-thinking team trivia game.  When it's your team's turn, roll the die and move your pawn that many spaces.  You'll then draw a card and you and your teammates will try to name 5 things that fit a category within 30 seconds.  If you can, you get another turn.  If not, it'll be your opponents' turn.<br/><br/>Most of the spaces on the board are solid colors, which determine what category is in play.  For example, if you land on a red space, you play the red category.  However, there are four kinds of special spaces:  All Play (both teams get a different category, and the first team to name 5 things in their category rolls the die and takes the next turn), Flip Flop (teams alternate giving answers until someone can't think of another), Wild (your team gets their choice of the five categories on the card) and Double Down (you have to pick two of the 5 categories and name five things in both those categories, all in 30 seconds).<br/><br/>When you reach the big Name 5 space in the center of the board (which you have to do by exact count), you'll have the chance to win the game.  You and your team will have 90 seconds to name 5 things in each of the 5 categories on the card.<br/><br/>Contents: 336 game cards (3,360 questions), 1 60-second sand timer, 1 dry-erase marker, 1 dry-erase scorecard, and instructions<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This wacky, quacky matching game combines developmental skills for young children with the fun of a &ldquo;My First Game.&rdquo; Lucky Ducks offers all the benefits of memory and matching games in a format that&rsquo;s easier for little fingers than cards. As a bonus, it helps kids with shape recognition and colors. Switch on the circular pond, and the ducks start swimming&ndash;the bottom side of each duck has a colored shape. Players take turns picking up a duck and looking at the color and shape; if it matches their color and shape they get to keep the duck. If it doesn&rsquo;t match they put it back. The ducks continue to swim so it&rsquo;s more challenging than a traditional memory game, but easy enough for even the youngest duck lovers to play. This extra challenge makes the game more fun for parents and kids to play together, with plenty of opportunities for fun and learning. For 2-4 players ages 3 and up. Includes motorized &ldquo;pond,&rdquo; 12 ducks, and complete instructions. Requires 2 AA batteries (not included).<br/><br/>",

In the paper and pencil version, you draw a grid of dots and then each player must alternately draw dashes joining adjacent vertical or horizontal dots. If you are able to complete a square, you mark it as your own and you must draw another dash. At the end of the game, players achieve long runs of squares.

Many boxed versions with suggestions and timers are available, and several TV shows have been made using the basic idea of the game.<br/><br/>In most versions, one player silently acts out a title (book, movie, show, etc.), phrase or person and their team must guess it. The words can be from a commercially made list or just creatively made up by the players. Many signals and conventions have become traditional (see link below). The experience is usually humorous, whether you are strenuously flapping away like a buzzard - alternating with pretending to push a buzzer and lying dead on the floor - for several minutes while your team guesses everything but buzzard (&quot;bird!&quot; &quot;scavenger!&quot; &quot;bird of prey!!&quot; &quot;raptor?&quot;) or frantically struggling to think up clever clues. Many of the clues use the &quot;sounds like&quot; hint - pretending to sew for the word &quot;so,&quot; for example. The excitement and frustration of piecing together the clues and guessing is also a great part of the fun, of course, and the relief is immense for both the actor and the guessing team when the guess is finally (or miraculously suddenly) correct. The game usually produces much laughter in the group playing it - solving the riddles is only part of the experience.<br/><br/>",

This game is played with only 1 copy of the game, so players do NOT need to bring their own decks to the table.<br/><br/>The object: Collect as many &quot;Carrots&quot; as possible, hoping that one of them is the randomly predetermined &quot;Magic Carrot&quot;.  In doing so, you must keep your bunnies alive as long as possible, while eliminating your opponents' Bunnies because once all the Carrots have been claimed you must have a living Bunny to win.<br/><br/>The problem: Your opponents are armed with outrageous weapons (from level 1 weapons such as a &quot;Kitchen Whisk&quot; to level 12 weapons such as the &quot;Nuclear Warhead&quot;) and you must roll higher than these levels to survive.<br/><br/>Use cards to defend your Bunnies, such as the hilarious &quot;Magic Spatula&quot; or other special cards, or use a &quot;Feed The Bunny&quot; card to force your opponent to buy cabbage and water (if they have the money to do so...)<br/><br/>Your opponents, as the back of the box quotes, &quot;will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the game, which can get dreadfully vengeful, horribly nasty, hilariously messy, and just plain fun!&quot;<br/><br/>The game includes 165 cards (including the Blue Starter Deck and Yellow Booster Deck), 36 small cards, 6 twelve-sided dice, &amp; Instructions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "POOP is an UNO-like game where the first player to run out of cards wins! Players are given a 5-card hand and take turns laying cards (pooping) but trying not to clog the toilet! If the toilet is clogged the player must pick up the entire poop stack and a new toilet is started. If 3 cards of the same color are played in a row then the toilet is Flushed and that toilet is reset with zero poop cards. Some cards make players perform crazy acts on their turns.<br/><br/>POOP: The Game is an original card game created by kids and adults for kids and adults. Kids love it because of the silly designs and opportunity to make poop jokes. Adults love it because POOP makes them act like kids.<br/><br/>EDUCATIONAL: Younger children get a healthy dose of basic math while playing POOP. Seriously! You'll see them adding up the POOP cards to make sure they don't clog the toilet!<br/><br/>INTERACTION: One of the funnest stages of UNO is remembering to say &quot;UNO&quot; when down to your last card. POOP takes this one step further giving players similar responsibilities throughout the entire game. If you forget and other players remind you then you have to draw another card (and take a drink if you're playing POOP as a drinking game. Speaking of...)<br/><br/>DRINKING GAME FOR ADULTS: After getting feedback from our successful (and critically acclaimed) ZOMBIE SHUFFLE campaign, we learned that many people loved that we included drinking rules. For this reason we've made POOP an even easier drinking game. Players take drinks if they draw a card or clog the toilet and everyone drinks if the toilet is flushed.<br/><br/>ENDLESS POSSIBILITIES: We've found at least 3 other exciting ways to play POOP using the same standard deck! You'll find the Alternate Rules PDF in the downloadable Trial Version of POOP but we are very interested in what you come up with when playing with friends and family. Experiment and send us your ideas! We'll credit you if we share it with the POOP community.<br/><br/>",

Inside the goal each direction has circles with numbers. A penalty must be shot to one of the free circle. To do so, the shooter has to roll the die and get one of the numbers of the intended circle to score. If a shooter has a star, the number in the star of every circle will count as well.<br/><br/>A player in their turn will have the chance to kick a penalty at another players&acute; goal. The turn player will put a shooter card face down with the arrow pointing at the intended goal. Then the player of that goal will put a goalkeeper card face up showing their move to stop the penalty. Then, the shooter will reveal their card showing the ball direction. If the goalkeeper guesses it correctly (left, middle or right) they can put gloves chips (1, 2 or 3 gloves as their capacity) to block the circles. The shooter will indicate one of the remaining circles of that direction before rolling the die. If the goalkeeper does not guess it right, the shooter has all that direction circle options to choose. If the shooter scores it will count one goal in their scoreboard.<br/><br/>First one scoring 5 goals will be the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

The higher the creature is on the food chain, the more types of creatures it can chomp. Creatures cannot chomp their own kind, nor can they eat anything higher up on the food chain. Nobody can chomp an octopus or an electric eel, which are special action cards in the game. The game plays rather like the old card game War, with the superior creature &quot;chomping&quot; the others and taking the trick. The first player to collect all the cards wins the game.<br/><br/>The rulebook includes several variations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Authors - One of the earliest versions of the family of Go Fish games, in which players call on each other to give up a named card, attempting to meld sets for points, based on which set of the game it is (e.g. the first melded set gets 10 points, the second gets 5 points). When all sets have been melded, most points wins.<br/><br/>From The Card Games Website<br/>This is Go Fish without the stock pile. All the cards are dealt out as equally as possible to the players. A turn consists of asking a player for a rank (or a specific card if you play that version). If they have it your turn continues; if not the turn passes to the player you asked. As in Go Fish, you must have a card of the rank you asked for. Books of 4 cards are discarded. The game continues until all the cards are formed into books, and whoever gets most books wins - or you can score one point per book and play to a target score.<br/><br/>This game is often paired in the same deck with Top Trumps<br/><br/>Happy Families - An even earlier (1851), British version with the educational theme centered on family members and their occupations.<br/><br/>Quartett - This is the German equivalent of Happy Families or Authors. Many different designs of cards were made for this game in the late nineteenth and throughout the twentieth century, with various educational or other themes.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets five hero attack cards. Shuffle the villain cards and place them in the middle of the play area.

Put the final battle cards to the side.<br/><br/>The first player takes the turn marker card and turns over the top dysfunctional family card, which affects this round of the game. Lay out the number of villain attack cards as shown on the first villain card. Now each player takes their turn, beginning with the player with the marker card. Players pick a card from their hand to attack a villain, heal their hero, or put a hero story card into effect. Once all the villain attack cards have a hero attack card played under them, players can use their hero's special ability.<br/><br/>Gameplay proceeds until all the villains have been defeated (or no family members are alive). Then it's time for the final battle.

        "description": "くまきちファミリーの最高のティータイム (Kumakiti family no saiko no teatime) (Kmakici Family's Greatest Teatime) is a card game from Japan featuring a family of soft toys lead by a bear, Kmakici. It includes a dolphin, a squid and a rock band of rabbits. The family are created by an artist Raityo Tsume (雷鳥つめ) and are popular in Japan in SNS messaging apps.<br/><br/>The various characters in the Kmakici family are on the cards in different combinations. Players draw and play cards to the table from a hand of three, trying to build sets of five different characters. If a player places a card which completes a set of five, they draw a token from the end of a line.<br/><br/>The tokens show a grilled steak initially, but on the hidden side are sweets, cakes and teatime treats. Players are trying to get four different treats to win the game outright.<br/><br/>However, if a player cannot or will not play a card, they draw a steak, which, being unsuitable for a tea party, counts as negative points. If all the tokens are claimed without a direct winner, then the player with fewest steaks wins.<br/><br/>Whilst the game is aimed squarely at young children, a Japanese reviewer found the game to be more complex and challenging than expected.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>Let's start a great teatime with our friends.<br/><br/>In this game, you have to collect five different characters on the field. When it is your turn to play, you draw a card from the deck and put up to three cards from your hand on the field. However, only one card of the same type of character can be played on the field.<br/><br/>If you manage to get the fifth character on the field, you get the candy on the back of the chip.<br/><br/>The chips are laid out in a straight line, steak side first, and are taken in the order in which they are laid out during the game.<br/><br/>If you don't have any cards to play or don't want to play, you will have to take the steak (negative points).<br/><br/>If a player is able to collect four different sweets, that player wins at that moment, and if all the chips are gone, the player with the least steak wins.<br/><br/>友と、最高のティータイムを始めよう。<br/>　このゲームは、5種類のキャラクターを場に集めるゲームです。<br/>　プレイヤーは自分の手番が来たら、山札から1枚カードを引いて、手札からカードを3枚までで場に出していきます。ですが、場には同じ種類のキャラクターは１枚しか出せません。<br/>　みごと5種類目のキャラクターを場に出した人は、チップの裏面のお菓子を手に入れることができます。<br/>　チップは最初にステーキの面を向けて一本道に並べてゲーム中は並べた順番に取っていきます。<br/>　出せるカードがない、または出したくない時にはステーキ（マイナス点）を取ることになってしまいます。<br/>　お菓子を4種類集めることが出来たら、その瞬間にそのプレイヤーの勝ち、チップがすべてなくなった場合はステーキの少ない人の勝ちです。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warriors is a card and dice-rolling game with a fantasy military theme. Each player begins with a randomly dealt army of 11 units. Most will be creatures of one of the game's 6 types (Barbarians, Goblins, Elves, Trolls, Dwarves, Undead). A lucky player may also get Wizards (which protect creatures of one type from attack) or Catapults (one-use weapons that have a 50/50 chance of destroying a target card). Creatures come in three varieties (infantry, archers, cavalry).<br/><br/>Armies are placed face-up in front of the players, and three rounds of warfare ensue. At the start of each round, players receive additional cards, including the vital Attack Cards, without which an army can only stand on the defensive. Attack cards are of two types. One (&quot;Battle&quot;) allows all of a player's creatures of one type to attack creatures of either the same type or the type that the attacker most dislikes. Elves, for instance, may attack an opponent's Elves or his Trolls (the Elves' &quot;natural enemy&quot;.) The other type of Attack Card (&quot;Mercenary Army&quot;) allows creatures of different types to combine in an attack against creatures of any one type, but limits the number of attackers. Attack Cards also provide various bonuses to the attacker.<br/><br/>The resolution of attacks is modeled on Risk. The attacker rolls up to three dice, the defender up to two (the number depending on how many infantry each side has in the battle). The side with more archers, if either, adds one to its high die roll. The highest and second highest rolls for each side are compared, and the low roller in each loses a card (with the defender winning ties). The attack continues until one side is wiped out or the attacker voluntarily breaks off. Attackers with surviving cavalry can then make further attacks.<br/><br/>Players gain victory points for enemy units destroyed and for having the most creatures of a particular type at the end of the third round of play.<br/><br/>",

Assets are earned primarily by passing Payday spots on the game board.  Money is also earned (and sometimes lost) by drawing Action cards, which assign set amounts or multiples of the wheel spin.<br/><br/>There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  The first one is a decision to either attend college (payment due and a longer track), or not - with different career cards drawn as a result of that decision.  There are a handful of choices regarding house speculation, but for the most part it is a game of luck.<br/><br/>This game makes a number of updates to older games in the game family.  The maximum number of players has been reduced from 6 to 4, and a number of new cards and concepts have been introduced, increasing the randomness of asset collection.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Club is a slightly satirical game about life in the fast lane - a board game about love and about people's need to meet one another.<br/><br/>The whole game takes place in a nightclub and the game board is the dance floor. On their turn players push three new dancers to the dance floor from their own bar counter (edge of the game board) and as they come into play they push others towards the center of the dance floor. Once two dancers meet in the heat of the night they can be made into couples and the better the match the more players score. If only two of the four visible qualities match then the dancers have a one-night-stand which is not a very long term fun and is thus worth only one point. With three matching qualities the dancers actually like one another, start dating and that is worth four points. If all the four visible qualities match then the dancers get the &quot;happily ever after&quot; the one true love we all search for and thus it is worth full 5 points.<br/><br/>Each dancer also has a secret quality that can and will alter the basic score. For example if a guy has a large... &quot;personality&quot; then the player gets two extra points unless the other dancer is drunk, because if she is she wouldn't notice the difference. Girl's beautiful roommate on the other hand only has a function in the one-night-stands and the fun the couple would have means now triple fun and thus the player gets triple points. There are 12 different secret qualities in the game ranging from heart-broken to those who still live with their mom.<br/><br/>Occasionally the game gets spiced up by one of the three special characters in the game. Bouncer can remove any of the dancer from the game board where as a Rock Star walks into the game normally, but once (s)he has gathered a fan crowd and he's completely surrounded player can take the Rock Star and four adjacent dancers back to his hotel room and form two couples out of them. The bully is the guy who harasses women and picks a fight with men and once he enters the game his mere presence prevents any dancer next to him to be part of a couple.<br/><br/>In the end the player who has been the best cupido wins the game. In other words the best scorer wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Classic Swedish children's game about robbers and police. One player is the police and gets (no. of players +1) police pieces and the radio car, while the others get a robber piece each. Robbers try to rob banks and post offices, occasionally stashing their money in hideouts where it's safe for the time being, and finally 'escaping the country' (=exiting the board) by rail, plane or ship, while the police naturally tries to catch them. Caught robbers get a 'jail sentence' of d6 turns, but may also try to escape each turn on a roll of 6; four arrests will eliminate the robber from the game, though.<br/><br/>In a rather morally questionable fashion, the police always gets a 'bonus' from whatever money a caught robber happens to be carrying, and the winner is the player with most money in the end - whether robber or police!<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>1 board<br/>6 police men<br/>1 police car<br/>5 thieves<br/>1 six-sided die<br/>Money bills: <br/>15 10,000,-<br/>20 5,000,-<br/>25 1,000,-<br/><br/>There is also a children game from the same theme:<br/><br/>     Lilla tjuv & polis<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of The Haunting House is to be the first to escape a haunted house that the players have entered. The haunted house is made up by randomly laying out tiles in a 6x6 square making up the floor plan and then adding entrance and exit tiles at opposing edges.<br/><br/>Each player then gets a set of cards symbolizing different actions. Each turn consists of two phases: a random phase and planned phase. First, the random phase is where a number of random cards are drawn and executed, throwing the players off track from their plans. During the random phase, a few cards are inserted into each player's card set that cannot be chosen during the planned phase. Apart from normal move cards, there are also special action cards that may for instance move the exit or things like that. After the random phase remove the white bordered cards and perform the planned phase. Now, each player secretly select a sequence of 5 cards that define that player's actions that turn (somewhat reminiscent of RoboRally).<br/><br/>Publisher's blurb<br/><br/>The Haunting House is a wildly fun, fast paced, strategy boardgame with a twist. The object is simple, players enter the front door and race to be the first to reach the exit. It's not as easy as it sounds. Half the time the players choose their own path. The other half their paths are chosen randomly by opponents. Additionally, the board elements constantly change as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The Haunting House features 38 tiles that make up the board, 60 cards and six custom-sculpted pawns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cashflow 101 is a serious game designed by investor, businessman, and self-help author Robert Kiyosaki to serve as a tool for learning basic financial strategies and accounting principles. Cashflow 101 is the first of several games created by Kiyosaki to reinforce the information in his books.<br/><br/>The board has two tracks: A &quot;Rat Race&quot; small circle where you only roll one die to advance, and a &quot;Fast Track&quot; where you roll two dice to advance. In the Rat Race you get paid for passing your Paycheck space, and then draw from one of four decks of cards depending on which space you've landed. Some of the deals are good, others are bad. Your main problem here is a shortage of cash. In the Fast Track your main problem is an excess of cash and finding investments to sink it into before you lose it to lawsuits, divorce or tax audits.<br/><br/>The heart of the game though are the player sheets where players learn how to fill out a financial statement. Players choose from a variety of starting careers (Truck Driver, Mechanic, Lawyer, Airline Pilot, etc.) and fill out their financial sheets appropriately. As they land cards and invest in different deals they dutifully log each change to their financial sheets as well. After a few games most people end up using the same financial sheets to fill out their own personal information.<br/><br/>With each card event the drawing player may buy at that price, but all players may sell at that price. Also, players may make co-investments with the drawing player or even buy the deal from him if they agree. Player deals are encouraged.<br/><br/>The game with few players is heavily biased towards real estate. With 5-6 players the cards are being drawn fast enough that the part time businesses pay off as well.<br/><br/>There are thousands of Cashflow 101 game clubs around the world.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you roll three dice, with each die face showing a balloon color and a shape, then record the results by circling numbers from the bottom of the column, going up. The highest number you circle in a column equals the points that you score.<br/><br/>Not happy with your results? Then roll again with any number of dice &mdash; but you have to roll an additional die as well, which means you'll circle more results on your scoresheet. You can reroll a second time as well to add a fifth die to your results. This (possibly) gives you better control over the results, while helping you ascend the columns more quickly to higher potential scores.<br/><br/>However, at the top of each column is a different colored number that's much lower than the numbers immediately below it. Hit this number, and your balloon's popped because it went too high. What's more, this popping triggers a scoring break that occurs at the end of the round, with everyone scoring based on their current heights in the columns. You want to go high, but don't trigger the break or else your points will plummet right before scoring.<br/><br/>After three breaks, players total their scores to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

Winners obtain tokens representing survival items such as food and matches, which are useful for other challenges.<br/><br/>During successive turns in the end game, players vote together on who should be expelled from the island.  When only two people are left, all the other players vote together on who should be the sole Survivor.<br/><br/>",

You come from secret services and taskforces from all around the globe, and train together either as attackers or defenders. Plan the assault! Ready the defense! Coordinate your Operators! Outwit the opposing team! &hellip;before they make their next move.<br/><br/>6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.<br/><br/>To win a game of 6: Siege &ndash; The Board Game, you must fulfill the mission&rsquo;s objective for your side or eliminate the opposing team. During each round of the game, each player has two activation phases in which they can activate two to three operators. When activating an operator, a player has a wide range of actions to choose from: mandatory movement, shooting at targets, over-watching to cover specific areas, or making use of the team&rsquo;s or their personal gadgets! All this while time is ticking down&hellip; Operators can also lean to protect themselves while crouched, opening their line of sight without losing the benefit of cover. Every map of the game also has an upper floor that Operators can utilize when they want to navigate the map more quickly. The game rules are intuitive with how cinematic it is, and the flow of gameplay is bolstered as a result. Of course, we couldn&rsquo;t leave out a destructible environment! While the defenders often barricade the map, the attackers tend to break walls using grenades and hammers. The real-time flow of the game may be interrupted when a player calls for line of sight. If you think it is wrong, you could inflict a time penalty on your opponent&hellip; but also risk giving them the edge if you&rsquo;re proven wrong! Which group of Operators will accomplish their strategy and be victorious? It&rsquo;s up to you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now the king has died, and his heir, King Tyrial II, has decided to dispatch his finest lords to raise the fallen city and stand ground against all its enemies, within and outside the city walls.<br/><br/>In Fallen City of Karez, each player will take the role of a lord of one of the guilds who seek to tighten their grasp on the rising city. The players will strive to maintain a balance between keeping the city safe for its citizens by sending exploration parties to defeat any threats, and at the same time attracting to the emerging city new adventurers wishing to fill their pockets with fortunes and their names with glory.<br/><br/>In the action phase at the start of each of the eight turns, players can assign two citizens or one adventurer to act on their behalf in the various buildings of Karez, send an exploration party to remove any threats that lurk near Karez, or buy new equipment to reinforce their parties of heroes. Some guild houses may choose to erect their own private Dungeons (!) in an attempt to inflict havoc and dismay on the other houses. After everyone performs their actions, the players must check how these actions affected migration to Karez; the results of this phase will reflect on the growth of Karez towards a city state, which is the common aspiration of all players.<br/><br/>Players start with different initial possessions and owned buildings. In addition to the common goal of raising the city, each house also has some unique goals (ambitions), which will eventually determine the sole winner. That said, the game is semi-cooperative in that while each guild has its own ambitions, all players must succeed in raising the city by the end of the game or else everyone loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Hobbit Card Game, two teams play against each other: good versus bad. The basic game mechanism is trick-taking, but whoever wins the trick can distribute the cards amongst all the players, depending on his character's ability. Bilbo, for example, must keep one card from the trick, give one card to another player, then discard the remaining cards.<br/><br/>In addition to a special ability, each character has a special affinity with the forces that govern his motives. Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin are scions of good, while Smaug and Bolg are cruel and evil. The cards respond to these alignments accordingly: a white star on the card symbolizes the forces of good; the helm of an orc adorns cards possessed of evil power; and a card with a pipe grants players the ability to draw an extra card in the next round. If a card with the opposite power is assigned to your character (Gandalf gets an orc helmet, or Smaug gets a star), then that character takes a point of damage. If your character is already damaged and is assigned a card with the symbol of their own side (Bilbo gets a star, or Bolg gets an orc helmet), then that character gets a single point of damage healed. Two points of damage eliminates a character from the game, so use the cards you win to knock out your opponents and heal your allies.<br/><br/>The round ends when players have emptied their hands, and the last of the cards that were in play have been assigned to the characters. Players who have taken enough damage are eliminated at this point. Depending of the number of players, if enough good characters have survived, the game continues until the final round. If the evil characters have killed enough of the heroes, then the villains win the day!<br/><br/>",

On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!<br/><br/>The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).<br/><br/>Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!<br/><br/>The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the &quot;II&quot; from the name of the latter game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The concept of Arne is new. Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone&rsquo;s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else&rsquo;s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.<br/><br/>Arne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.<br/><br/>There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.<br/><br/>How ARNE Works!<br/><br/>Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:<br/><br/>White cards which you may only play when it is your turn <br/>Black cards which you may play whenever you want to<br/><br/>In practice, all players can play cards at the same time. This means that the tease factor is very high indeed.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Arne Total<br/><br/><br/>",

A new territory has been discovered, which could be the promised land they have always looked for, where gods walk alongside the worthy; a land of opulence, abundant harvests and good living, the very idea of Valhalla.<br/><br/>The first expedition settled there and founded a colony. Months later, a second expedition is sent there. The sea voyage goes very terribly and many men die. A small band of survivors arrive hungry and exhausted at the colony camp, which does not look at all like what they imagined. They discover an icy and disturbing place, immersed in the mist, surrounded by an oppressive forest... and empty! None of the settlers are there. What was their longship is planted into the earth in the centre of the camp like a sinister totem. They will have to rebuild the camp, survive the hostile conditions, explore this cold and frightening land before understanding what happened and solve the mystery.<br/><br/>HEL: The Last Saga is a cooperative survival horror viking board game, created by the duo behind SMOG: Rise of Moloch by CMON, game designer David Rakoto and art director Christophe Madura. The game offers players the chance to lead a small group of survivors, each with their own background and secret motives. The players must cooperate if they want to survive the immediate dangers of cold, hunger and external threats, but they will also have to complete their inner quest to be worthy of the Saga that will retain their name. HEL: The Last Saga is highly narrative, with chapters to read according to what the players accomplish. The game mechanisms mix exploration, tactical combat with a bit of resource management. Storytelling and background are ubiquitous and replayability comes from the unique way you have to replay a failed mission.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Oregon Trail: Hunt for Food Card Game challenges 2-6 players to find enough food to keep them alive during their travels &mdash; six hundred pounds of food, to be precise. Not all of you might live while tracking down this food, but ideally at least one of you will make it to the end of the trail with a full belly.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle the hunting cards, then lay them out in a 6x6 grid, with three cards in each pile. Shuffle the supply deck, then lay out four supply cards, which are available for you to use. Place the hunter on a pile on the outside border of the playing area. Each player takes a die, which has numbers 1/1/2/2/3/4.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls their die, then has a number of actions equal to the result. A player can (1) flip a card in an orthogonal line from the hunter up to a distance equal to the number of actions that remain in the turn, (2) move orthogonally to an adjacent space that isn't blocked, or (3) shoot at an animal that isn't blocked. If you flip flowers, a tree, or a rock, that space is now blocked; if you flip an abandoned wagon, you can pillage it for a card of your choice from the supply deck, but then it too becomes an obstacle; if you flip a blank card, nothing happens; and if you flip an animal, you can try to shoot it on a future action as long as nothing blocks the hunter's path to it.<br/><br/>When you shoot, you spend a bullets token, then all players roll their die and you need successes on all dice, e.g. rolls of 1 or 2 to kill a bison. If you don't succeed, you can spend more bullets and reroll the dice that failed. If you succeed, you get one hundred pounds of meat; if you run out of actions or decide to stop, the animal flees.<br/><br/>You have only twelve bullet tokens at the start of the game, with four more in the supply deck. If you run out of bullets, you lose the game. If you flip dysentery or drowning, you die and everyone else carries on without you; if you flip snake bite, broken leg, or other calamities, you need the treatment from the supply deck, dying if an identical card is flipped before this happens. If all players die or the hunter becomes trapped by obstacles, you lose the game. Only by collecting six hundred pounds of meat do you win, no matter how many of you are still alive!<br/><br/>The Oregon Trail: Hunt for Food Card Game can be played on its own or combined with The Oregon Trail Card Game.<br/><br/>",

The equipment is in a smaller but solid blue box. The rules say the game is for 2 to 7 players, but apparently the banker is one of them, because there are but 6 tokens.<br/><br/>Aim of the game is to save that much that a house can be bought and subsequently furnished with goods like a vacuum cleaner, living room furnishing, kitchen furnishing, radio, washing machine and a sewing machine. The first player to furnish the house and additionally has saved at least 2,000 Ft in saving bonds is the winner.<br/>To that end each player get a house-plan in which he has to fill up 6 parts. The house can only be bought at O.T.P. (19), where as the furniture can be bought at space (11). At space (33) one can buy all domestic appliances at Keravill's.<br/>Very striking of this &quot;party game&quot; is clearly pedagogic second objective. That does appear from the pedantic phrases of some Chance cards like:<br/><br/>Go to the cinema! The movies are instructive and entertaining. Advance to space (17) and pay 10 Ft.<br/>Exercise is healthy and entertaining. You should exercise as well. Advance to space (7).<br/>Read! Reading is pleasant, useful and cheap entertainment. <br/>You have dirtied the street! Pay 10 Ft.<br/><br/><br/>The scene is laid in Budapest and vicinity appearing from the fact that a stroll can be taken over the Margit isle (26), go to the Fishermen's Bastion (29), make a trip over the Donau to Visegr&aacute;d (38) and one may/have to stay 2 turns at Lake Balaton. <br/>A few other fields are: a shoe-shop (14), a cinema (17), a tobacco-shop (20), a confectioner's shop (24), a stores (28) and a theater (36).<br/>There are 41 spaces in total, of which 6x Szerencseker&eacute;k (Wheel of Fortune). There are 46 Wheel of Fortune cards (60x90 mm) but these cards have no illustration. There are 60 savings bonds (58x88 mm) of 1000 Ft and 30 savings bonds of 5,000 Ft. The money consists of 6 neutral banknotes printed in color on white paper: 10 - 20 - 50 - 100 - 200 and 1000 Ft. Each player receives 4,000 Ft at the start of the game. On/over Start you receive 4,000.-/2,000 Ft as wages.<br/><br/>The price of this set amounted to 52.40 Ft at the time of issue.<br/><br/>The title translates as &quot;Budget smartly!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Castle Assault is a unique gaming experience combining the ferocious onslaught of Tower Defense games with the strategic elements of CCGs and progressive advancement of RPG's.  Castle Assault seeks to break the mold of traditional card games and organically extracts the most enjoyable parts of these different genres and distill them into a standalone concept. Castle Assault plays in about 30 mins, and is for 1 or 2 Players.<br/><br/>Each Player controls a Castle on either side of the Battlefield with 10 Health and a Hero outside of the Battlefield.  Players play Units from their hand to the gameboard and these Units physically move toward the opposing Castle based on the Abilities of that Unit and your choices with the intent to bring your opponent from 10 to 0 Health.  Should you destroy your opponents Castle or destroy their Hero you win!<br/><br/>&quot;More details please&quot; - a Battle Card Game with tons of combat and strategy.  Card combat is fast and furious; every time two opposing Units touch each other in the same column, they Engage in combat (which is often), and can happen either during the Move Units step or during the Open Phase by Charging or using an Ability described on your Units.  Combat is resolved immediately with Unit cards exchanging their combat values at the same time (with no luck involved).  Should either Unit have a higher attack number then the Armor + Health of the opposing Unit, that Unit is destroyed.  Should a Unit smash the opposing Castle without a defending unit, that Unit attacks the opposing Castle directly lowering that Castles Health by the Unit's attack value.<br/><br/>Your Hero grants some bonuses throughout the game and you can even join the Battlefield to turn the tide, however should your Hero be destroyed you immediately lose the game.  As you progress through the 1-Player Campaign and complete feats or heroism you can level up and customize your Hero based on the way YOU play. <br/> Every deck is also customizable meaning your Unit selection can be optimized before battle, but note this is not a 'pay-to-play' type game.  You receive all the cards from all warbands including the 1-Player warband in the Core Edition (NO BOOSTERS).<br/><br/>Most Units have Abilities to; keep them alive, move more quickly, laterally move, resurrect, summon allies, surprise, dissipate, and damage the opposing Castle from afar.  You may feign attacks, play Commands to make your Heroes more powerful in a myriad of methods to tactically breakdown your opponent.<br/><br/>The 1-Player Campaign provides a &quot;Right-Outta-the-Box Experience&quot; with 9 Scenarios culminating in a final boss showdown.  1-Player mode operates by Monsters auto-populating in the opposing Castle with your victory condition changing every Scenario including outright smashing the opposing Castle, destroying a boss overlord, or surviving the onslaught.  With 9 Scenarios per 6 warbands it creates 54 different challenges  (9 campaigns x 6 warbands = 54 games).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the game of dark fun, where players who are dead right win! Many people die in utterly ridiculous ways, and Stupid Deaths challenges players to identify myth versus fact. In this hilarious party game, players work to beat the Grim Reaper before the Grim Reaper beats them.<br/><br/>Players start the game with a True and a False Voting Card as well as an Extra Life Token. All the players begin on the Green space, half way around the board from the Red space where the Grim Reaper starts his chase. The first player takes the top Stupid Deaths Cards and reads it aloud, individually all the other players have to decide if the scenario is real or made up and turn over either their True or False Voting card. Each player who has voted correctly moves their player piece one space closer to home and away from the chasing Grim Reaper. For each player who voted incorrectly the player must move the Grim Reaper one space forward towards their own piece! When the Grim Reaper catches up, lands or passes a play piece, that player has been &lsquo;touched by death&rsquo; and is out of the game unless they use their Extra Life Token to give them one more chance. It&rsquo;s a race against Death to be the first player home and reach the Red space!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bondespelet (&quot;The Farmer Game&quot;) or occasionally Nya Bondespelet (&quot;The New Farmer Game&quot;) is a Swedish classic roll-and-move game about farmers and farming. You win by being the first farmer who buys the castle. The journey goes from a croft via a farm to a manor and ends with the castle (UK: Stately home).<br/><br/>The game features a roll-and-move style of movement around the board, success relying on having your marker stopping on the good spaces so you get crop markers that you can sell later on. Farms and forests are bought and sold by the money you earn from the events and crops.<br/><br/>Though being an absolute classic in Sweden, and one of the flagships for the game publisher Alga, very little is known of this game's origin. It has seen at least four graphically major remakes since the first version. It's rumoured to be as old as the 40s, at least we know that the game existed in 1951.<br/><br/>The now defunct publisher AB Sago-Konst is rumoured to be the first publisher. When they in the 1950's became, or became part of (history is unclear here),  AB Grafisk konst the latter published another more or less identical version. They were followed by Aristospel with yet another more or less identical version. Since approx. 1974 Alga (currently owned by Brio, itself owned by Ravensburger) has published this game in about half a dozen editions.<br/><br/>See the information tab on the various versions for details about them.<br/><br/>",

Players must buy cheap gems to sell them at higher prices later, but this is all about probability and reality as well. To win, you have to diversify your stock, but you are limited on initial capital and the number of gems in the bazaar is limited as well.

Players keep their penguins behind screens so that no one knows who has which colors.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player adds a penguin to the pyramid. The first penguins are placed in the bottom row (obviously), but once two penguins are adjacent, a penguin matching the color of either of those penguins can be placed on top of them; e.g., either a red or blue penguin can be placed on top of adjacent red and blue penguins. The bottom row can be no more than seven penguins long. If a player knocks down the pyramid, he takes penalty points equal to the number of penguins behind his screen, then players start again from scratch. When a player can't play &mdash; whether because he has no penguins at all or no penguins that can legally be played &mdash; he passes. Once all players pass, the round ends and everyone scores one penalty point for each of his unplayed penguins. Anyone who played all of his penguins returns two penalty points.<br/><br/>After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game 'box' has levers labelled from one to nine. (There are also sets made with 1-12.)<br/><br/>Initially all the levers are in the 'up' position.<br/><br/>The first player rolls two dice.  He or she then knocks down the levers as follows:<br/><br/>One number which is the combined value of both dice.<br/><br/>Or...<br/><br/>Two numbers whose total adds up to the combined total of each dice.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>If a one and a five are rolled, the player may choose to knock down the lever covering the number six, or the levers covering numbers one AND five, or ANY other combination of numbers adding up to six.<br/><br/>The player continues to roll, knocking down levers each turn, until he or she cannot use the whole of the dice count because those numbers in the box have already been covered. (Note: If the 7,8 &amp; 9 are covered, some versions let you choose to roll one or two dice. Some use that rule if the total of the remaining numbers is less than six.)<br/><br/>The player's score is the total value of the numbers left uncovered (in some versions the score is instead read directly from the numbers left on the box -- if the 2, 4, &amp; 6 are left, then your score is 246).  All the levers are then raised again, and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>There are several methods of scoring. In the traditional pub gambling game, you add up all the levers left uncovered. The games pays out after one round (one turn per player who paid into the pool). If you manage to &quot;shut the box&quot; you win instantly and get double the stake from each player.<br/><br/>In other scoring methods, you play multiple rounds, with players adding points to their previous score. As players reach forty-five (or other set number) they go 'bust' and must drop out of the game. The game then ends when only one player remains in the game.  He or she is the winner.<br/><br/>If any player knocks down ALL the levers in his or her turn, and thus 'shuts the box', they are automatically declared the winner!<br/><br/>This was later the inspiration for the NBC Daytime TV game show High Rollers airing from 1974 until 1975 and again from 1979 until 1980 under the name as (The New) High Rollers and much later in Syndication from 1975 until 1976 and from 1987 until 1988.<br/><br/>",

Kids spin the spinner, pop a hamburger into the pig&rsquo;s mouth, then pump his head. The more they pump, the more his belly grows until . . . pop! Kids love the suspense as they watch his belly grow; the player who makes his belly burst loses the game. Redesigned in 2013 to make it easier for kids 4 and up to play, children can quickly reset this pig game with one pump of the pig&rsquo;s head and experience consistent belly busting game-play each and every time. Pop the Pig provides hours of fun and is completely kid powered (no batteries needed). For added convenience, all pieces can be stored inside the pig. Kids won&rsquo;t see a pop up pirate, but they will get to pop a pig. For ages 4 and up, 2-6 players. From the makers of Gooey Louie and Jumping Jack.<br/><br/>",

The cash flow in the game consists of taxes (for players staying on others' possessions) and events from &quot;Chance&quot; cards (fines, taxes, misfortunes). In a difficult situation, players can pledge their properties &ndash; otherwise, the player bankrupts and loses the game.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money &ndash; after everyone else's bankruptcy or after established time os over.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Game mechanics is almost exactly the same like in Monopoly.<br/><br/>Each turn, the player rolls two dice, moves around the board and buys properties located in various European countries (from communist period), grouped by their region.<br/>1) If a player lands on an unexploited property, he can buy it or allow the bank to auction it to other players.<br/>2) If he lands on someone's property, he must pay its owner a rent (proportional to the value of the land and its buildings).<br/>3) If the property belongs to the player and he has all the lands in the country, he can build houses or hotels that increase rent for visitors.<br/>There are also other places on the board that you can't buy, but they require the player to draw a &quot;Chance&quot; card, pay taxes, collect income, and even go to jail. Each player also has regular income everytime they pass the starting field.<br/><br/>Properties are located in countries listed below (from cheapest to most expensive):<br/><br/>     South: Greece (2 properties) &ndash; yellow color, Italy (3) &ndash; red color.<br/>     West: Spain (3) &ndash; blue color and Great Britain (3) &ndash; orange color.<br/>     North: Benelux (Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, summary 3 properties) &ndash; green color and Sweden (3) &ndash; purple color<br/>     East: RFN /West Germany/ (3) &ndash; brown color and Austria (2) &ndash; black color.<br/><br/><br/>The game continues until everyone but one player leave the game (bankrupt) or until an established time is over. I the latter case all players sum up they fortune &ndash; cash, power plant, railway stations, water supply, properties (not taken to pledge) with the value of buildings, half value of properties taken to pledge.<br/><br/>It is still avaible in shops for around 8$.<br/><br/>",

Garis (1872-1961) created the character &quot;Uncle Wiggily Longears&quot; for a children's book in 1910. According to Whitehill, the game based on the children's story was first introduced by the Milton Bradley Company in 1916. Bradley modified the game in 1923, 1949, and 1955. Whitehill states that Parker Brothers obtained the rights to Uncle Wiggily in 1967. However, in 1989 both Milton Bradley Co. and Parker Brothers reintroduced different version of the same game. Hasbro now owns both the Parker and Bradley rights, but apparently is producing the Bradley version for the current market. The game is of the &quot;racing&quot; variety in the style of the European &quot;Goose Game&quot;, that is the first player to reach the end of the &quot;track&quot; wins.<br/><br/>",

In order to save Britain, the great chieftain Vortigern has asked the Saxon brothers Hengist and Horsa to help defend Britain. You and your brother agree to help, but over the years Vortigern has become greedy and does not pay you enough.<br/><br/>It is time for you to take matters into your own hands and take what is rightfully yours! You have good maps, strong fighters, and stout boats. The coast is littered with villages, towns, monasteries, and estates. All are waiting to be pillaged! Who will win the thrilling hunt for fame and fortune: Hengist or Horsa?<br/><br/>In Hengist, both players compete for the same treasure tiles. The player who reaches a treasure tile with one of his raiding groups first gets the tile &mdash; but a part of the road is hidden and must be explored first. Not always is the direct path the most successful way. The player who uses their cards wisely and has a little bit of luck will get the more valuable treasure tiles and win the game.<br/><br/>",

At their disposal are only 300 brave Spartan soldiers and a number of other Greeks supporting them. Choosing when to put their strongest units into battle is essential, as is knowing when to make a stand and when to consolidate their strength.<br/><br/>By playing cards that collectively surpass the strength of the Persian unit that is in front of them at any given point, they defeat it. The players win or lose together, depending on if the Persian army withdraws, or if their last stand fails.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players move around a map of Europe, scoring points for each destination they reach. Card play determines destination, transportation method, and distance traveled. Players may play hazard cards to block or slow down their opponents. One of the players is the assassin and scores bonus points by getting a &quot;hit&quot; on one of the other players. Game length is variable: when a weapon card is drawn by a player, it is placed on the map. When the fourth weapon card is drawn, the game ends.<br/><br/>The game is a revised version of EuroHit.<br/><br/>[Below descriptive text from the box back]<br/><br/>Assassination has been the tool of the desperate and the ruthless seeking change since time immemorial.  The course of mankind's bloody history has taken many a turn due to the assassin's bullet.  Any successful leader--whether criminal, business scientific religious or political--can suddenly become a target in these modern days.  The assassin strikes without warning, at the least expected time from the last expected quarter.  Be he professional or amateur, the assassin's primary weapon is his ability to blend with his background, to be &quot;one of the crowd&quot;.  It is his skill at doing so that enables him, like the hunter in the wild, to surprise and kill his quarry.  Unbeknownst to you, the world's greatest assassin could be your brother or sister, your spouse, your child or parent, or your friend seated beside you.  Perhaps you yourself are the next &quot;Jackal&quot;.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is a challenging card/board game for 3-6 players, aged ten and up.  Played against the backdrop of modern Europe, players travel about the board, scoring points for visiting as many cities as possible.  But beware, for some unknown reason one among the players is an &quot;Assassin&quot;, who scores even more points by making a &quot;Hit&quot; when in the same city as another.  Perhaps the intercession of an &quot;Interpol Officer&quot; might save you; perhaps not.  Perhaps an &quot;Espionage Agent&quot; will alert you to who among the players is the threat; perhaps not.  Perhaps the assassin will hit an &quot;Innocent Bystander&quot; instead of you' perhaps not.  And the players never know when the turn of the next card in the deck will bring the game to an end.  Like our fast-paced world, the action in ASSASSIN is furious and challenging, with just a hint of uncertainty and danger to add spice to the intoxicating mix.<br/><br/>Blessed with colorful and eye-catching artwork, Avalon Hill's ASSASSIN is both educational and entertaining.  Playable in under 90 minutes, it is the perfect game for social gatherings.  The rules are easily mastered, and included numerous options to make the strategy more or less challenging, and playing time shorter or longer.  The play can e lighthearted and friendly, or ruthlessly competitive, the rules allow for either, depending upon the style of play and the desires of your group.  So, if you are ready to face the challenge of touring Europe while a killer stalks your heels, shuffle the cards and sit down to play ASSASSIN.<br/><br/>A fast-moving fun game for 3 to 6 friends to play in an evening!<br/><br/>",

This releases a ball, which will trigger one of the three traps at random. Trapped mice lose a wedge of cheese. The first player to gather 8 wedges (a full circle) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to &quot;capture&quot; all of the cards, this is done in the following manner.<br/><br/>1. Deal the cards equally among the different players, keeping them face down.<br/><br/>2. The player at the left of the dealer begins the game by taking off the first card of his pack, and placing it on the table face up, and the play continues to the left until each player in turn turns up the first card of his pack in the same manner.<br/><br/>3. When any player sees two cards which are alike turned up on the table, he may call out &quot;SNAP&quot;, and the one first calling takes all the turned up cards in both places where the duplicate cards appear.<br/><br/>4. The successful player takes all cards won and places them face downwards under his original pack and must then play his first card upon the table.<br/><br/>5. The game continues as above until one player secures the entire pack, thereby winning the game.<br/><br/>",

The first to get one row complete wins a round.

        "description": "Slap Jack is a standard deck playing card game for youngsters and adults. Even the youngest of children can join in the fun and even play by themselves.<br/><br/>Number of players: Two to eight, each for himself.<br/>The Deck: Standard 52 card pack.<br/><br/>The Deal: Any player is able to deal first. Just shuffle and deal out cards, one at a time to each player in rotation until all have been used. The cards need not come out even. Each player squares up his hand into a neat pile in front of him without looking at the cards which are face down.<br/><br/>Object of the game: To win all the cards by being the first to slap each jack as it is played to the center.<br/><br/>The play. Each player in turn, starting from the dealer's left, is required to lift one card from the pile in front of him and place it face up in the center of the table. The players must turn up the card away from him and not toward him; he must not see it earlier than any other player. At the same time, the play should be made with a swift movement so the other players may not see the denomination of the card before he does.<br/><br/>If the card played to the center is a jack, the first player must slap his hand down on it, take it, and with it, all cards below it in the center of the table. The player who wins these cards must turn them face down and shuffle them with the cards in his hand still remaining on the table in front of him, in order to form a new hand.<br/>Suppose more than one player slaps at a jack. The one whose hand is lowest (directly on top of the jack) is declared winner of the pile. If a player has no more cards left, he remains in the game until a jack is next turned, and he may then slap at the jack in an effort to get a new hand. Should he fail to win, the player is declared out of the game. The play continues until one player possesses all the cards. That player is then made the winner! NOTE: If a dealer's card is exposed, then all the cards must be shuffled before they are again placed face down. If a player slaps at any card in the center other than a Jack, he is required to give one card, face down, to the player of that card.<br/><br/>",

You can play one match for each card in the center row.  You can also combine two cards from your hand that add up to the number you wish to match.  If the card(s) you played match both number and color, you earn the right to place extra cards from your hand in the center row and even force other players to draw cards.  Don't forget to yell &quot;Dos!&quot; whenever you have two cards in your hand or you could end up drawing more cards!<br/><br/>The round ends when one player gets rid of all his cards. That player earns points based on the values of the cards left in the other players' hands. Continue playing in rounds until someone reaches 200 points. That player is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.<br/><br/>The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.<br/><br/>Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Before they can roll and move, players must pick a card and present the rest of the players with a nasty choice between two thoroughly unpleasant hypotheticals in categories such as pain, embarrassment, ethics, and ingestion. If the player guesses the majority preference, he gets to move otherwise he must pass. Some spaces allow the player to invent their own awful hypothetical choice. The other players vote secretly on their choice in this case. If the vote is not unamimous, the player can move or send someone else back. Players roll a six-sided die and there are only 10 spaces to the goal so games go very quickly. Typical choices on the cards include, &quot;Would you rather lie naked in a bathtub full of live roaches or dive head first into a pool of tobacco spit?&quot; The answer &quot;neither&quot; is NEVER allowed.<br/><br/>Variant:<br/>The 2003 version of this game &quot;Would You Rather?&quot; appears to have quite different rules to the above described game. There is a new simpler square board with more spaces. Unlike the 20 minutes of the above game, 1-2 hours is recommended by the manufacturer. Players roll a dice, then move and depending where they land, draw cards with dilemmas to pose to the rest of the other players. The current player must try to secretly predict the result of the other players' subsequent open discussion and consensus view. No-one is penalised for an inability to reach consensus, the game encourages one option picked at random perhaps by flipping a coin, to keep the game moving. If the current player predicted correctly, they get a bonus turn.<br/><br/>Typical questions include &quot;Would you rather ... On senior prom night, have to take your parent -OR- your 12 year old sibling?&quot;<br/><br/>Every so often players get the opportunity to take a difficult challenge with the winner being the first person to complete their third challenge.<br/><br/>",

Play begins with the players inserting the sticks through the tube and then pouring the marbles into the hole at the top of the tube. The sticks act as a web that block the marbles at the top of the tube. At this point, the players begin to carefully remove the sticks one by one. The goal is to get the stick out without making any of the marbles fall through. If any do so, the player who made them do so collects them. Once the last marble has fallen, players count their collected marbles, and the player with the fewest wins the game.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    Toy Story Ker Plunk!<br/><br/><br/>",

Then the other player gets to make one free guess. If they're right, they get three letter cards. If they're wrong, the other players get a chance to steal. If they guess the word, they get one letter card. If they have cards, and get it wrong they lose a letter card. If no one guesses the word, another clue is read. If no one gets it the next time around the players will only receive one letter card from that point on.<br/><br/>Letter cards can be the letters D, I, R, T, or Y; they can also be ~ cards, Wild cards, or Action cards. Players win when they can spell DIRTY.<br/><br/>DIRTY MINDS will provide two or more adults with hours of laughter as seemingly filthy clues point towards the most innocent of answers. Some people say a dirty mind is a terrible thing to waste. Use yours to play DIRTY MINDS, but remember... NOTHING IS AS DIRTY AS IT SEEMS!<br/><br/>TEST HOW DIRTY YOUR MIND IS BY READING THE FOLLOWING CLUES:<br/>- I'm a four letter word. <br/>- I'm a name for a woman. <br/>- I end in u-n-t. <br/>------ What am I?<br/><br/>",

Designed in 1949 by then 19-year-old Kari Mannerla and published two years later in 1951, it has sold over 3.5 million copies since, half of them in Finland. There's one in almost every home in Finland.<br/><br/>Players start in either Cairo or Tangier and start exploring Africa, trying to find gems. The main objective is to find the legendary giant diamond, Star of Africa. However, when flipping the tokens, players cannot know what they will find: nothing at all, some lesser gemstones or even a robber stealing their money and slowing their progress.<br/><br/>When someone finds the Star of Africa, a race begins. The player with the diamond tries to deliver it back to Cairo or Tangier, other players try to find a horseshoe - a token discarded with no value before, now a key to victory. Winner is the player who reaches Cairo or Tangier first, carrying either the diamond or a horseshoe.<br/><br/>A rules amendment, which prevents a player being stuck on an island and effectively out of the game, was only added in 2005.<br/><br/>The first official expansion, Afrikan tähti: Retkikunnat, was published in 2014. This could be a record - a game being expanded for the first time, by the rights holder, 63 years after it was first published.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by: Inkan Aarre<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tiddledy Winks varies based on publisher, but they all generally have a cup or other container that sits in the center of a target.  The object of the game is to flip small smooth disks (the &quot;winks&quot;) into the cup.  This is accomplished by placing a wink on a piece of felt and then pressing down on the edge of the wink with a larger disk (the &quot;tiddledy&quot;) so that the wink pops up into the air, and hopefully lands in the cup.  The highest points are awarded for winks that land in the cup, with winks landing in the target area scoring less.  Players decide ahead of time to play a set number of rounds (in which case the winner is the person with the highest score at the end of the last round), or to play until someone reaches a certain score (in which case the winner is the first person to reach or exceed that score).<br/><br/>Wikipedia notes that Joseph Assheton Fincher filed the original patent application for the game in 1888, applied for the trademark Tiddledy-Winks in 1889, and licensed John Jaques and Son as the exclusive distributors of the game. However, the intense popularity of the game prompted other publishers to churn out cheaper competitors under names like Spoof, Flipperty Flop, Jumpkins, Golfette, Maro, Flutter. As early as 1890, Jacques boxes included a label warning of &quot;worthless imitations... issued by unscrupulous and jealous persons&quot;, and its rules threatened that &quot;proceedings will be taken against any one infringing the Proprietors' Rights in this Game&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The players indicate their answer by putting face down either their Fact Answer card or Crap Answer card.  The Reader then determines which player was the first to put their Answer card down.  Once all of the Answer cards are down, the player who was first to answer turns over their Answer card.  If the answer is correct, they receive 2 tokens from the middle pile.  The Reader will then ask everyone to turn their Answer cards over.  All other players with the correct answer will receive 1 token.  All players with the wrong answer (including the player who puts their Answer card down first) will have to put 1 token back in the middle pile.<br/>The Reader&rsquo;s turn is complete when all 3 questions have been read.  The Question card is then returned, face down, to the bottom of the Question card pile.<br/><br/>During the game you will randomly draw Rush Hour cards.  The Reader who picks up a Rush Hour card may nominate any player to answer the Rush Hour questions.  Once the nomination has been made, the egg timer is turned over and the Reader begins to read the questions.  The aim is to have all 5 questions asked and answered within the time limit so that both Reader and the answering player have a chance to win as many extra tokens as possible.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win Fact or Crap.<br/>- The game ends when all tokens from the middle pile are gone.  Players then count up their tokens.

Simon lights one of the coloured pads and sounds a tone, then two, then three, etc.  Players attempt to match Simon by pressing the pads in the proper sequence.  If someone fails, they get a 'raspberry' and are out of the game.  Of course Simon speeds up as the game progresses so it becomes increasingly more difficult.<br/><br/>For a little less randomness, players can set the game to ignore the computer and perform the sequences themselves adding one colour to each play.  Player 1 can press &quot;Red&quot;, Player 2 then must press &quot;Red&quot; and then adds another &quot;Red&quot;, player 3 then must press &quot;Red, Red&quot;, and then adds &quot;Blue&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BlackJack originated in French casinos around 1700 where it was called &quot;vingt-et-un&quot; and has been played in the U.S. since the 1800's.<br/><br/>Blackjack is played with a standard deck of 52 playing cards. In a Casino, usually six (6) or eight (8) decks of cards are shuffled together and placed in a card shoe for distribution.  The player must wager before any cards are dealt. He does this by placing his bet in front of his table position. Next, the dealer deals two cards to each of the players and two to himself. (One of the dealer's cards is dealt face up, one is dealt face down). Face cards count as ten, ace counts as one or 11, and all other cards are counted at their face value.<br/><br/>A blackjack occurs if the player's first two cards are an ace and a ten or face card. This is usually a winning hand, although if the dealer also has a blackjack, it is a tie. A winning blackjack pays the player three to two.<br/><br/>The dealer must draw on 16 and stand on 17. (A dealer total of 17 including an ace, or &quot;soft 17&quot;, must be drawn to in some games and must stand in others). Options:<br/><br/>Hit or Stand - Hit means to draw another card, which the player signifies by tapping the table with his cards or a similar hand motion. Stand means that the player wants no more cards, which the player signals by placing his cards under his wager or holding his hand in a horizontal direction. If the player hits and busts (goes over 21), his wager is lost.<br/><br/>Double down - The player is allowed to double his original bet on his first two cards, then draw one more card.<br/><br/>Splitting - If the first cards a player is dealt are a pair, they may be split into two hands which are played separately. The bet on each hand must be the same amount. Aces receive only one card. After splitting, Ace-ten counts as 21, and not as blackjack.<br/><br/>Insurance - A bet not exceeding one-half of the original bet. When the dealer's up card is an ace, the player may take insurance. If the dealer's down card is a ten or face card, the player wins two to one. Any other card means a win for the dealer.<br/><br/>Surrender - To give up after the deal of the first two cards. Only one-half of the original bet is lost. Not all blackjack games offer surrender.<br/><br/>When not playing at a casino, it is usual for the role of Dealer to rotate among the players.<br/><br/>Pontoon is a similar game, but there are some small rules variations. For example, the dealer wins on ties and both of their cards are dealt face down.<br/><br/>",

Known as Awase or Kai-awase. In USA and England known as Pairs, Pelmanism, or Concentration. But these are played with simple playing cards. In Switzerland was a domino-like game named Zwillingsspiel with the same roots. In Czech Republic this type of game is known as Pexeso. The name is an acronym of &quot;pekelně se soustřed!&quot;, which literally translates to &quot;hellishly focus!&quot;.  It usually consists of 32 pairs of square cards. There are thousands of Pexeso sets with different themes.  There are hundreds of different Memory games - starting with 24 cards for the youngest, with all kinds of animals, art, about countries, also a gay and a &quot;Breast Memory&quot;, several free giveaway Memory games published by companies.<br/><br/>Players lay a series of tiles upside down in random order.  Then proceed to uncover 2 at a time.  If they match, the player keeps both.  If they don't, the player loses his turn.<br/><br/>There are 2 different types of memories: <br/>type A: Pure memory games with pairs of identical motifs and <br/>type B: memory games with similar motifs, e.g. 1x1 memory with a pair consisting of the numbers to be multiplied and the solution.<br/><br/>Game end when all tiles have been matched.

        "description": "Top Trumps has been a popular card game in the United Kingdom since the seventies. There are many different card decks based on different subjects, e.g cars, planes, films, military jets, or TV shows. The decks are also available in the USA.<br/><br/>Each pack of Top Trumps consists of a number of cards (usually 30 or 32), each of which features an item or character related to the subject of the deck; each card has a picture, some numerical statistics, and possibly some additional text. The pack is the size of an ordinary pack of cards so is readily portable.<br/><br/>2-6 people can play. Deal out all the cards face down to the players. Each player holds their cards face up but may only look at their top card.<br/><br/>The player to go first chooses the a statistic (usually a high one) from their top card, e.g. &quot;Top Speed 252mph&quot;. All other players read out the same statistic. Whoever has the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their pile. They then choose the statistic for the next round.<br/><br/>During a round, if 2 or more cards tie or no data is available for that particular statistic then all the cards are placed to one side and the same player chooses again from their next card. The winner of the hand also takes the cards that were placed to one side.<br/><br/>The first player to win all the cards is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Familiarity with the deck is useful since the player will know which statistics are high (and, particularly, which cards have the absolute highest value for a given statistic).<br/><br/>This game is sometimes paired in the same deck with The Game of Authors a.k.a. Quartets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Note: Not to be confused with Anti-Monopoly II. Please be careful when submitting new versions of this game; basically, anything published after 1987 will almost certainly be Anti-Monopoly II and belong to that game, even if it's called &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. As for the reasons why this is so, please see the clarifications at the end of this article and the article of Anti-Monopoly II.)<br/><br/>The &quot;Bust~the~Trust!&quot; Game<br/><br/>The basic idea of the game is to end the monopolistic practices of the 3-company-combinations of the game board. The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.<br/><br/>There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three &quot;accusation circles&quot; respectively. &quot;Accusing&quot; is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the &quot;Budget-Commissioner&quot;; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.<br/><br/>Variant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.<br/><br/>Anspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.<br/><br/>Anti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as &quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; was published as &quot;Choice&quot; whilst the company was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;.  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name. Plenty of potential for confusion there, eh?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Roulette is a French word meaning &quot;small wheel&quot;. It is the oldest casino game still in existence today. The exact origins of the game are unknown - there's probably been gambling using a wheel since the invention of the wheel. Some say it was invented in 1655 by the French scientist Blaise Pascal while working on a perpetual motion machine. Others say it derives from a Chinese game in which player try to move 36 statues into a magic circle. <br/> The Roulette layout that we know today first appeared in 1765 in Paris, but the modern version of the game did not appear until around 1842 when Frenchmen Francois and Louis Blanc are said to have invented the single &quot;0&quot; roulette game. Another mystic legend tells that Francois Blanc, who founded the first casinos in Monte Carlo, sold a soul to the devil for the secret of roulette. As proof, they point out that the sum of all the numbers on a Roulette wheel added together total 666 - the number of the beast.<br/> The single &quot;0&quot; wheel became known as the &quot;French Wheel&quot;. When French immigrants brought the game to America a double zero &quot;00&quot; was also added and this became known as the &quot;American Wheel&quot;. The game became popular in the old west of America during the California Gold Rush.<br/><br/>Modern Roulette is a perfectly balanced wheel with a slot for each number. The numbers alternate between black and red (the 0 and 00 are green) and exactly opposite each other number is the corresponding higher and lower number (0 is opposite the 00, 1 is opposite the 2, and so on up to the 35 being directly opposite the 36). Players may place a multitude of wagers: Single Number pays 35:1, Two Numbers pays 17:1, Three numbers pays 11:1, Four Numbers pays 8:1, Five Numbers (American Wheel) pays 6:1, Six Numbers pays 5:1, Column or Dozen pays 2:1, High/Low Black/Red or Odd/Even pays 1:1. The 0 and 00 are not counted when calculating the odds which gives the house its edge. Ironically, no matter where you place your chips, the house edge remains almost constant (5.26% American Wheel, 2.70% French Wheel).<br/><br/>When all the bets are placed the croupier rolls a little ivory ball along the inner edge of the wheel in the opposite direction of its spin. As the wheel turns, the ball loses momentum, bounces among the slots and finally falls into one of the numbered slots. The number that the ball rests on is the declared as the winning number for that game and winning wagers are paid off. <br/> ",

        "description": "The Game of Goose is an ancient children's classic, possibly tracing its roots all the way to the Ancient Egyptian game of Mehen which was played in early Old Kingdom times.<br/><br/>Francesco de Medici in Italy sent a copy of this game to King Felipe II of Spain during the 16th century.<br/>It became one of the most popular games in Europe during that time.<br/><br/>Circa 1600, Beno&icirc;t Rigaud's heirs printed in Lyon &quot;Le Jeu de l'oye, renouvell&eacute; des Grecs, jeu de grand plaisir, comme aujourd'huy princes &amp; grands seigneur&quot; [sic] &quot;le pratiquent&quot; - Le jeu de l'oie, renewed from the Greeks, game of great pleasure, as today princes and great lord [sic] play it -, the oldest French copy known.<br/><br/>Father Claude-Fran&ccedil;ois Menestrier describes the game in his &quot;Biblioth&egrave;que curieuse et instructive&quot; (1704) : 'There's another type of game, that seems easier to learn, and easier to play; it's the game of goose so common and it is said to come from the Greeks, though nothing can be found about it in their authors. This game is much easier than cards game, because it's always wholly displayed to the players, and, being in the form of a snail or spirally folded snake, it's appropriate to print the things that one wants to learn...'.<br/><br/>The game became an instant hit in France in the 1600s, and engendered a lot of variants (educational, commemorative, ...) up to the present day.<br/><br/>It turned up later in England about 1750, according to Whitehouse, under the title &quot;Royall &amp; most pleasant game of the goose - Invented at the Consistory in Rome and are printed and sold by H.

Beach of New York who entitled it The Jolly Game of Goose. An 1855 edition was called simply The Game of Goose.<br/><br/>It is a simple game of racing, using a spiral track with lovely illustrations. The main principle is one shared with Snakes and Ladders as well as the later Game of Life: virtue is rewarded and vice is punished.<br/><br/>Schmidt Spiele rates their G&auml;nsespiel for ages 5 and up.<br/><br/>Bibliography<br/>Whitehouse, F.

Birmingham: Priory Press Ltd.<br/>'Jeux de princes, jeux de vilains', edited by Eve Netchine, Biblioth&egrave;que nationale de France / Seuil (2009).<br/><br/>--gameplay description from Wikipedia:<br/>The board consists of a track with consecutively numbered spaces (usually 63), and is often arranged in a spiral with the starting point at the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to throws of one or two dice. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a goose is depicted; landing on a goose allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards or lose one or more turns, the most recognizable being the one marked with a skull and symbolizing death; landing on this space results in the player being sent back to start. On Spanish boards the reverse is usually a Pachisi board.<br/><br/>Many themed versions of the game have been created, depicting topics as diverse as ice skating, Richard Nixon, and sewage pumps. These can be valued for their historical or artistic merits even by those who have no interest in the game itself, with some editions having been sold for thousands of dollars at auction or displayed in museums.<br/><br/>",

The pencil and paper grids were changed to plastic grids with holes that could hold plastic pegs used to record the guesses.<br/><br/>Each player deploys his ships (of lengths varying from 2 to 5 squares) secretly on a square grid.  Then each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location.  The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; or &quot;Miss!&quot;.  You try to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them.  First to do so wins.<br/><br/>The Salvo variant listed in the rules allows each player to call out from 1 to 5 shots at a time depending on the amount of ships the player has left (IE: players each start off with 5 ships, so they start off with 5 shots.  As ships are sunk, the players gets fewer shots).  This version of the game is closer to the original pencil-and-paper public domain game.  Many versions of the pencil-and-paper game have different amounts of shots based on the ship (IE: Battleship: 5 shots. Destroyer: 3 Shots, Etc.).<br/><br/>In 2008, Hasbro &quot;reinvented&quot; the game into Battleship (Revised).<br/><br/>Some history of the published versions of the game:<br/>1931: Starex Novelty Co. of NY publishes Salvo.<br/>1933: The Strathmore Co. publishes Combat, The Battleship Game.<br/>1943: Milton Bradley publishes the pad-and-pencil game Broadsides, The Game of Naval Strategy.<br/>1943: Also published in 1943 Sink it by the L R Gebert Co. for distribution by G.

By turning over a card from the draw deck and following its instructions, players move their pieces around the game board, switch places with players, and knock opponents' pieces off the track and back to their Start position.<br/><br/>Slides are located at various places around the game board. When a player's piece lands at the beginning of one of these slides not of its own color, it automatically advances to the end, removing any piece on the slide and sending it back to Start.<br/><br/>Game moves are directed exclusively by cards from the play-action deck.  If one plays the normal version in which one card is drawn from the deck each turn, the outcome has a huge element of luck.  Sorry can be made more of a strategic game (and more appealing to adults) by dealing five cards to each player at the start of the game and allowing the player to choose which card he/she will play each turn.  In this version, at the end of each turn, a new card is drawn from the deck to replace the card that was played, so that each player is always working from five cards.<br/><br/>A player's fortunes can change dramatically in one or two rounds of play through the use of Sorry cards, the &quot;11&quot; cards (which give the player the option of trading places with an opponent's piece on the track), and the fact that it is possible to move from Start to Home without circumnavigating the full board by making judicious use of the &quot;backward 4&quot; cards.<br/><br/>",

You can buy a deck of cards designed for the game, but it can be easily played with a standard deck of cards:<br/><br/>Throw away all but one of the queens from the deck. You won't use the &quot;extra queens&quot; during play. (You may also want to throw out all black cards or all red cards to speed up the game). Deal all the cards out to the players. Players put down any pairs they have, then keep the rest of their cards in their hand, hidden from their opponents. From here on, take turns; on your turn, draw a card from any other player. If you made a pair, then put it down.<br/><br/>In the end, all cards except the &quot;old maid&quot; (the one queen left in the deck) will be down in pairs. Whoever holds that card loses! Everybody else wins!<br/><br/>The best part of this game is seeing another player draw the old maid away from you. You're supposed to keep it a secret when this happens (because other players will avoid drawing from the victim if they know that they risk the old maid by doing so), but young children usually laugh or gloat when the old maid gets taken from them. Adults playing can make the victim feel better by trying to draw the maid away from them.<br/><br/>",

Write your name on a tombstone<br/>What is your choice?&quot;<br/><br/>All sorts of gruesome deaths await you and the rest of your wagon party in this official multi-player card game version of the classic computer game. To win you&rsquo;ll need to keep one player alive all the way from Independence, MO to the Willamette Valley. But between rattlesnakes, starvation, dead oxen, broken bones, dysentery, and a host of other calamities the odds are long . . . almost as long as the Oregon Trail itself.<br/><br/>Players work together to move along the trail, fording rivers and playing Supply Cards to overcome calamities. But be warned&ndash;there will be times when it makes sense to let one of your wagon mates succumb to a calamity rather than expend precious supplies. And every time players go the way of all flesh, you&rsquo;ll flip over the roster card and write their names on tombstones (don&rsquo;t forget to include a quick epitaph). It&rsquo;s a great way to relive your fond memories of one of the world&rsquo;s most beloved computer games, and to kill off your family and friends at the same time.<br/><br/>",

For the revamped versions with a toilet component, see the new Mouse Trap page.<br/><br/>Mouse Trap pits 2-4 players against each other as mice trying to navigate through a complex mousetrap.  They build the Rube Goldberg inspired mousetrap as they move their mice across the board. They also try to collect cheese cards, which allow them to move other mice to cheese wheel which is the bait for the trap.  Once the mousetrap has been completely constructed, players can attempt to capture each others' mice in it by turning the crank, which activates the mousetrap. If the mousetrap doesn't malfunction, the mouse is captured and out of the game. The winner is the last mouse who avoids being trapped.  The main appeal of Mouse Trap is the ridiculously complex contraption that is the mousetrap. Somehow even young children can figure out how to assemble it from the blueprints on the board, and everyone enjoys watching it do its magic.<br/><br/>UPC 032244046575<br/><br/>",

If a player has the requested card type, they surrender them all to the asking player, and the asking player can then continue asking for a type of card from either the same player or different one.  If a player doesn't have the card requested, he says Go Fish and the asking player then draws from a draw pile.  A draw which results in the last card asked for or in a complete book means the asking player gets another turn.<br/><br/>",

Additionally the first person to complete the course gets additional money tokens.<br/><br/>There is a very linear board that you move along by spinning a wheel or landing on spaces that tell you to move to a specific space or forward or back.  There are a handful of intersections where you can choose to go one direction or another but they ultimately have similar spaces and meet back up quickly.  There are a handful of choices regarding insurance and investments but for the most part it is a game of luck.<br/><br/>Note -- this entry covers many versions of the game with different rule sets.  In general, the newer the printing the gentler the rules.  The 1960s original can be quite brutal if the players choose to act on all the options made available to them.

It's a simplified Pachisi variant in which only one die is rolled per turn.<br/><br/>The game is abstract, each player has set of pawns of his color. Each turn player rolls a die using the Pop-O-Matic and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is bumped, the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.<br/><br/>For advanced players, we suggest that when a piece gets bumped, it should only be bumped back to its START space, rather than to its HOME.  Only when bumped from their START space are pieces sent HOME.<br/><br/>Travel Trouble uses the same mechanisms, but is on a smaller board with fewer spaces, so it plays more quickly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme<br/>Players take the part of land owners, attempting to buy and then develop their land. Income is gained by other players visiting their properties and money is spent when they visit properties belonging to other players. When times get tough, players may have to mortgage their properties to raise cash for fines, taxes and other misfortunes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player remaining with any money.<br/><br/>Cultural impact on rules<br/>Monopoly is unusual in that the game has official, printed rules, but most players learn how to play from others, never actually learning the correct way to play. This has led to the canonization of a number of house rules that make the game more palatable to children (and sore losers) but harm the gameplay by preventing players from going bankrupt or slowing down the rate of property acquisition. One common house rule has players put any money paid to the bank in the center of the board, which jackpot a player may earn by landing on Free Parking. This prevents the game from removing money from play, and since players collect $200 each time they pass Go, this results in ever-increasing bankrolls and players surviving rents that should have bankrupted them. Another house rule allows players to take &quot;loans&quot; from the bank instead of going bankrupt, which means the game will never end. Some house rules arise out of ignorance rather than attempts to improve the game. For instance, many players don't know that properties landed on but left unbought go up for auction, and even some that know to auction don't know that the bidding starts at $1, meaning a player may pay well below the listed price for an auctioned property.<br/><br/>Background<br/>In the USA in 1933, Charles Darrow devised Monopoly based on an earlier game by Elizabeth J. Magie. The patent was filed 31st August 1935 while the game was on sale in America. Based on an earlier game, The Landlord's Game, it was at first rejected by Parker Bros., as being too complicated to be a success. How wrong could they be! It came to the UK in 1936, made under licence by Waddingtons. Darrow died in 1967 having realised he had developed one of the most successful board games of all times. It was awarded as Game of the Century by the TRA (Toy Retailers Association).<br/><br/>Monopoly was patented in 1935 by Charles Darrow and released by Parker Brothers. The game was actually one of a number of variants in existence at the time, all of which date back to an earlier, 1904 game by Elizabeth J. Magie called The Landlord's Game. Magie was a proponent of the Single Tax put forth by famous author Henry George.  The game was designed to show the evils of earning money from renting land (as it leads to the destitution of all but one player) and the virtues of the proposed Single Tax - players could choose to play under regular rules or alternate &quot;Single Tax&quot; rules.<br/><br/>The game didn't really go anywhere and Magie lost interest in it. Variations of the game evolved, however, and homemade versions traveled up and down the Atlantic coast and even as far west as Michigan and Texas, being developed all along the way. Eventually the game was noticed by Charles Darrow, who introduced it to the world in its current form.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    The Landlord's Game<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/>Official<br/><br/>    Monopoly Stock Exchange Add-on<br/>    Monopoly Free Parking Mini Game<br/>    Monopoly Get Out of Jail Mini Game<br/><br/><br/>Unofficial<br/><br/>    Super Add-Ons: Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)<br/>    Entrepreneur's Accessory to Monopoly (fan expansion for Monopoly)<br/>    Game Spice: Monopoly Expansion (fan expansion for Monopoly)<br/>    Mafiopoly<br/>    Monopoly: Mob Rule Expansion Deck<br/>    Final Fantasy Monopoly<br/><br/><br/>",

Both players place 3 cards face down (occasionally, some people play with the modified rules of 1 or 2 face-down cards instead of the standard three) on the table and then place another face-up card on top of those.  If the two are equal, they place more face-down cards and add another face-up card (etc.)  The winner of the round once the most recent face-up cards are different in value takes all of the cards currently on the table.

        "description": "Created by Eleanor Abbott in the early 1940's to entertain children recovering from polio and first published by Milton Bradley (now Hasbro) in 1949, Candy Land encourages young players to socialize, exercise patience, recognize colors, learn rules, and follow directions.<br/><br/>Players race down a rainbow-colored track to be the first to find the lost King Kandy at Candy Castle, but watch out for obstacles like the sticky Molasses Swamp!  Start by placing your plastic Gingerbread Man (or other character marker) at the beginning of the track.  Each turn, players draw a simple card and move by matching the color on the card to the next color on the track.  Some cards show a named location on the board; players who draw these cards move forward or backward on the track to the named location.  The game ends when the first player arrives at Candy Castle by reaching or moving beyond the last square on the track.<br/><br/>In the 2004 version, younger players are not required to remove backward on the track if they draw a named card, and the last square of the track was changed from a Violet Square to a Rainbow Square, resolving a 55-year dispute over whether a player needs to land on the Violet Square or move beyond the Violet Square to win.<br/><br/>Prior to the 2006 version, three colored spaces on the track (one in Molasses Swamp and two &quot;Cherry Pitfalls&quot;) were marked with a dot.  Players who landed on a dot were &quot;stuck,&quot; and were unable to move from the spot until they drew a card that matched the color of the square they were on.  The 2006 version replaced gum drops with licorice spaces; players who land on a licorice space only lose their next turn.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Legend of the Lost Candy Castle&rdquo; is printed inside the box and can be read out loud. The game parts can be stored below it. The game board is colorful and has lots of yummy candy references.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Castles of Burgundy is a legendary Board Game design created by Stefan Feld. In this 1-4 players tabletop experience, you will take on the role of an aristocrat controlling a small princedom. Trying to build a settlement with powerful castles, practice trades, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/>Now, this timeless game is coming back with an extremely polished, high-end special edition resulting from a collaboration between Ravensburger and Awaken Realms.<br/><br/>In this special edition, you can expect a complete re-design of art and layout to ensure that every piece will have great art and enhance in-game usability. Only the best materials (cardboard, cart paper, box, insert, etc.) will be used to provide endurance, and a premium feel. Many extra components will bring the gaming experience to the next level, such as double-layered player boards, special bags for hexes, 30% bigger tiles, or metal coins.<br/><br/>The Castles of Burgundy is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by a Duchy board that is placed in the Player board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Castles of Burgundy is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.<br/>    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.<br/>    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.<br/>    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The 2019 edition of The Castles of Burgundy includes eight expansions, seven of which were previously released as promotional items and one new to this release (Shields).<br/>This edition has one fewer double-sided Monastery boards than what came in The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion – Monastery Boards. It doesn't include The Castles of Burgundy: 1st Expansion – New Player Boards, The Castles of Burgundy: 3rd Expansion – German Board Game Championship Board 2013, or The Castles of Burgundy: 7th Expansion – German Board Game Championship Board 2016. However it includes one new player board (x4) that had never been released before (Board 2).<br/><br/>",

There's nothing like the sound of coins clinking in your hands. You vastly prefer it to the sound of coins clinking in someone else's hands, or the sound of coins just sitting there in a pile that no-one can quite reach without getting up. Getting up, that's all behind you now. Life has been good to you. Just ten years ago, you were tilling your own fields in a simple straw hat. Today, your kingdom stretches from sea to sea, and your straw hat is the largest the world has ever known. You also have the world's smallest dog, and a life-sized statue of yourself made out of baklava. Sure, money can't buy happiness, but it can buy envy, anger, and also this kind of blank feeling. You still have problems - troublesome neighbours that must be conquered. <br/>But this time, you'll conquer them in style.&quot;<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s also a new faction, the Gray Hands, so now a sixth player can join in the fun!<br/><br/>The Undermountain Module<br/><br/>Undermountain is a vast and multileveled dungeon beneath Mount Waterdeep that once served the crazed wizard Halaster as a site for magical experiments. Now it is a labyrinthine maze with few refuges for weary adventurers.<br/><br/>The rumored wealth of Undermountain entices adventurers to brave the mysteries and monsters beneath the City of Splendors. The risks and the rewards are greater for undertaking Quests that require more Gold and Adventurers.<br/><br/>The Skullport Module<br/><br/>Skullport&mdash;also known as the Port of Shadow&mdash;is nestled in the heart of Undermountain, deep below the streets of Waterdeep. It is a haven for nefarious crimes, underhanded deals, and back-alley murders. Those who visit Skullport do so at their own peril, for around every corner are new ways to make people disappear.<br/><br/>The Skullport module includes a new resource: Corruption. Unlike Adventurers and Gold, having Corruption in your tavern penalizes you at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each Corruption token in your Tavern at the end of the game is worth negative Victory Points. The exact negative value depends on how much Corruption has been collected throughout the game; the more corrupt you and your fellow Lords are, the more Corruption hurts your score.<br/><br/>",

You can confuse Imperials with false orders and assaults behind enemy lines. You can command Director Krennic and his finest death troopers. And you can set traps for the Rebel pilots and soldiers, luring them away from their base and into massive battles with more fully cinematic combat and tactics. Even Jabba the Hutt makes an appearance, offering his services to the Empire and feeding his prisoners to the Sarlaac.<br/><br/>Altogether, Rise of the Empire introduces eight new leaders, thirty-six plastic miniatures, five target markers, two attachment rings, three new dice, and more than one-hundred new cards. You'll find U-wings, TIE Strikers, Nebulon-B frigates, and the Interdictor.

And someone who knows how to steer ships using stars. You finally got some of those rivers you'd wanted, and they led to the sea. These are dangerous, pirate-infested waters, and you cautiously send rat-infested ships across them, to establish lucrative trade at far-off merchant-infested ports. First, you will take over some islands, as a foothold. The natives seem friendly enough, crying their peace cries, and giving you spears and poison darts before you are even close enough to accept them properly. When you finally reach those ports you will conquer them, and from there you will look for more rivers.<br/>One day, all the rivers will be yours.&quot;<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first large expansion for A Feast for Odin, The Norwegians, includes a viking-sized number of additions to the game, adding new strategies and puzzle-tiles.<br/><br/>Renewed action board: The largest of the new additions, made of three double-sided pieces that can be flipped to show different actions based on the number of players, opening up new action paths and increasing the chances of players getting in each others' way. It contains new opportunities like butchering, elk-hunting, fishing, and thievery, along with changes for some old actions. It's now easier, for example, to play an animal strategy, because you can now get two of the same animals in one action. There is also a new fifth column with (better) actions that require only one viking. For example, you can now forge a grey special tile with a sword value of 8 or less by using an ore and only one viking! Another totally new 1-viking action is to do a &quot;small emigration&quot; using a whaling boat, which covers one space at the banquet table instead of two but is worth 7VP and costs no silver to do so. And as a bonus, you can send two vikings to this column instead of one to play an occupation card in addition to the action. The catch is, once you use an action from the fifth column, you can't place any more vikings for the rest of this round.<br/><br/>New puzzle-tiles: 2x5 rectangle (horse/pregnant horse/leather/vadmal) and 5 spaces in a &quot;U&quot; shape (herbs/pig/antlers/tools). The red versions of these tiles feature two new animals, horses (worth 6VP) and pigs (worth 1VP and breed every round as opposed to every other round) respectively, adding yet more paths for an animal strategy. There are also five new grey special tiles such as a pan, a hauberk and an anvil, most of which can be forged with ore. Also included is a third goods box to hold all the new tiles.<br/><br/>Four new exploration boards: Islands on the frontside (Isle of Man, Isle of Skye, Islay, Outer Hebrides) with Irish coastal viking-settlements on the backside (Waterford, Wexford, Cork, Limerick), where people from Norway came to stay through the winter, to trade at, and to settle nearby. Also included are renewed versions of the four exploration boards from the base game, with updated iconography and some with adjusted VPs.<br/><br/>New buildings: Also totally new is the idea of a random start-building. Everybody gets one of the six double-sided &quot;artisan shed&quot; boards, and whenever a player could build a shed during the game, they may instead build the front or backside of their artisan shed. Just like the stonehouse and longhouse, the artisan sheds offer new spaces to place orange and red tiles to earn bonus goods, silver and VP, and many of them require specific tiles to be placed in specific spaces. So everybody has another different start-opportunity - like the occupation cards.<br/><br/>VP tokens: Another new option is that, whenever a player would play an occupation card into the game, the player may instead discard the card for a VP token, which are worth 4, 3 or 2VP at the end of the game. A nice little competitive element, as there are a limited number of the 4VP and 3VP tokens.<br/><br/>Other stuff: The expansion also includes another mountain strip, more two-silver coins and more beans/mead and oil/runestone tiles.<br/><br/>The expansion includes another almanac about the new game-elements and their viking-history. But again it was written by Gernot K&ouml;pke as a &quot;historical-science&quot;-journalist and learned local newspaper editor and the main elements will be published on BGG at Expansions-Almanac / Almanach für Erweiterungen.<br/><br/>&mdash;adapted from the description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Then, during Ages II and III, you can activate a god or goddess in the Pantheon instead of taking a card from the pyramid. To do so, you pay whatever that god or goddess demands from you in offerings, then place it next to your city.<br/><br/>With Isis on your side, you can use a card from the discard pile to construct one of your Wonders for free. Zeus, whose nod determines what happens and what does not, enables you to discard any single card from the card structure that you want, as well as any mythology or offering token that may be on it. The Phoenician goddess Tanit, whose people were renowned for trade, fills your coffers with twelve pieces of gold. Enki, the Sumerian god of crafts, technology, and creation, lets you choose one of two progress tokens. Minerva's ability to stop the conflict pawn from moving toward you can assist with a military victory or save you from military defeat.<br/><br/>What's more, instead of adding three guild cards to the deck for Age III, you add three of five Grand Temples. Each Grand Temple belongs to a different Mediterranean culture, and if you possess a mythology token from that culture, you can build the temple for free. These temples are worth a total of 5, 12, or 21 points, depending on how many you build.<br/><br/>7 Wonders Duel: Pantheon also includes two new Wonders: the Sanctuary (which gives you an additional turn and allows you to invoke deities at a reduced price) and the Divine Theater (which grants points and access to additional gods).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The multi-award-winning strategy game Hansa Teutonica is back in a Big Box edition including the base game and all expansions. In the game, players attempt to increase their standing as merchants in the Hanseatic League by gaining prestige points in various ways. For instance, they can try to establish a network of counting offices in new Hansa cities by occupying an entire trade route between two cities &mdash; but before that happens, player markers can also be displaced by other players. Players may also aim to develop their trading skills, improving their abilities throughout the course of play. With only two actions per turn and a variety of contested opportunities, every turn is equally quick and strategically demanding.<br/><br/>Hansa Teutonica is a highly interactive strategy game as players block and push each other each turn, but it also gives cunning players the chance to put being blocked into an advantage. The game's many possible strategies can also be tested and perfected on the variant game boards of the beloved Hansa Teutonica: Britannia and Hansa Teutonica: East Expansion.<br/><br/>",

To deal with the dilution of the deck, naturally caused by adding more cards, all sea cards feature a wave icon, and whenever it is revealed in the display, you discard the first card in the row, then replenish.<br/><br/>A new fourth university is available on the association board, and if you take it, you claim one of six special universities from the reserve that feature one research icon and one of six animal icons. When you take this registry, you reveal cards from the top of the deck and keep the first revealed card with an animal icon that matches your chosen university.<br/><br/>For each of the five action cards, four alternate versions with a little twist will be available. Players draft action cards at the start of play, replacing two of their standard action cards with these new ones, increasing the asymmetry in the game.<br/><br/>New bonus tiles and final scoring cards will also be included.<br/><br/>Also the expansion will include alternate wooden markers for the 3 tracks and cute animals to mark the conservation projects you support instead of using your regular player markers.<br/><br/>",

By growing up to five different kind of crops &ndash; corn, indigo, sugar, tobacco, and coffee &ndash; they try to run their business more efficiently than their close competitors: growing crops and storing them efficiently, developing San Juan with useful buildings, deploying their colonists to best effect, selling crops at the right time, and, most importantly, shipping their goods back to Europe for maximum benefit.<br/><br/>The game system lets players choose the order of the phases in each turn by allowing each player to choose a role from those remaining when it is his turn. No role can be selected twice in the same round. The player who ends up with the most victory points &ndash; achieved by shipping goods and building &ndash; wins the game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico: Anniversary Edition and its follow-up versions include two expansions: Puerto Rico: Expansion I – New Buildings, that first appeared in 2002 in Spielbox magazine and was later published by alea and Rio Grande Games, and the Puerto Rico: Expansion II – The Nobles expansion from alea's Schatzkiste collection of game expansions.<br/><br/>The game has completely redesigned components and artwork: The cardboard doubloons are now sixty metal coins, while the fifty octagonal resources have been replaced with colored wooden crates. The building tiles are now illustrated, and the cardboard for those tiles and other components are nearly 3 mm thick to give the bits more heft. The individual player boards, the VP tokens, the ships, and other components have also been redesigned.<br/><br/>",

Be advised that business is much more difficult on this rail, so players will want to take advantage of friendly hospitality by establishing branchlets and helping form towns. In addition to the new railway system, players will also discover new station master tiles, private buildings, and an expanded player board to offer more strategic depth in their decision making.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Times have been hard. To save on money, you've moved out of your old castle and into a luxurious ravine. You didn't like that castle anyway; it was always getting looted and never at a reasonable hour. And if it wasn't barbarians it was the plague, or sometimes both would come at once, and there wouldn't be enough chairs. The ravine is great; you get lots of sun, and you can just drop garbage wherever you want. In your free time you've taken up begging. Begging is brilliant conceptually, but tricky in practice since no one has any money. You beg twigs from the villagers, and they beg them back, but no one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes. You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through. Still, you are sure that, as always, you will triumph over this adversity, or at least do slightly better than everyone else.<br/><br/>Dominion: Dark Ages is the seventh addition to the game of Dominion. It contains 500 cards but is not a standalone game. It adds 35 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus new bad cards you give to other players (Ruins), new cards to replace starting Estates (Shelters), and cards you can get only via specific other cards. The central themes are the trash and upgrading. There are cards that do something when trashed, cards that care about the trash, cards that upgrade themselves, and ways to upgrade other cards.<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The second major expansion to the original game of Carcassonne, Traders &amp; Builders contains 24 tiles with new features such as Bridges and Cities.<br/><br/>Some tiles also feature symbols for the goods Wine, Cloth and Wheat. Players collect one of these goods when the feature that has it on the tile is scored. Players with the most of each type of good gets bonus points at the end of the game. There is a popular house rule that allows the trading of goods between players in exchange for other goods and the ability to choose where a tile is placed. There are also two new wooden playing pieces in this expansion.  The Builder is like a meeple in that it may be placed in a city or road as a kind of supervisor. A subsequent tile extension of the feature the Builder is in allows the player another tile placement. Farmers will also be able to place a new Pig pawn in a field for extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Finally, Traders &amp; Builders comes with a large cloth bag. Not only does this make it easier to keep and handle the tiles, but it also removes the problem of having non-identical backsides.<br/><br/>Carcassonne: Traders &amp; Builders Expansion Play Summary<br/><br/><br/>     Traders - Some of the new city tiles depict goods: wine, grain and/or cloth. When you complete a city, your own or someone else's, you collect a matching token for each good in the city. At game end, whoever has the most goods in each category scores an additional 10 points.<br/>     Builders - Each player receives a builder meeple in his color. You can add your builder to any city or road you already have in progress. Now anytime you add a tile to that city or road, you immediately get to take another turn. The builder does not count as a follower for determining control of a city or road.<br/>     Pig - You can add your pig to one of your farms to enrich its value. A farm with a pig scores 4 points per completed city served instead of the usual 3.<br/><br/><br/>Traders &amp; Builders is playable with or without the first expansion.<br/>Part of the Carcassonne series<br/><br/>Some versions of HiG Scandinavian release, blue box, has The River I included.<br/><br/>",

Each time that a player completes a route, they claim a share of one of the companies depicted next to that route. At the end of the game, whoever holds more shares of a company than all other players receives points as a reward.<br/><br/>The United Kingdom half of this map collection introduces the concept of technology to TtR. At the start of the game, players can build only one- and two-train routes and only in England. By spending wild cards, players gain the ability to build routes three trains long or longer, in addition to being able to build ferries across water and build train routes in Scotland, Wales and Ireland. Players can also buy bonus cards that allow them to score extra points for taking certain actions during play. The game takes us to the beginning of the railway era, so the title correct for the whole United Kingdom of Great Britan and Ireland. <br/>Take notice: Designer Alan R. Moon has himself mentioned in his Design Diary of the game that &quot;The Advanced Technology Cards were not fully playtested&quot;. He also doubled down on that sentiment in the rules forum with &quot;I've seen several posts where players are playing with the Advanced Technologies the first time they play the game. These cards were included because we had extra cards that could be used for them, and we considered including them as a bonus, but they were never intended to be part of the basic game.&quot;.<br/><br/>Although officially an expansion for Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe, this could be used for Ticket to Ride: Nordic Countries.  However use with Nordic Countries would be limited to three players and use of spare trains.  The UK map requires 35 trains, the Pennsylvania map requires 45 trains, and Nordic Countries contains 40 of each colour (with 5 spare).<br/><br/>Part of Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With King of Tokyo: Power Up! &ndash; an expansion for the King of Tokyo base game &ndash; Included is the new monster Pandakai, a giant panda bear. After choosing a monster, each player takes the eight Evolution cards associated with that monster, shuffles those cards, and creates a personal deck. At the end of a player's turn, if she has three hearts, she draws one Evolution card and adds it to her hand; this is possible even in Tokyo (when hearts are normally useless) and even if the hearts are used for some other action, such as healing.<br/><br/>A player can reveal and play an Evolution card at any time. Some Evolutions are temporary, allowing a one-time bonus, while others are Permanent, such as Gigazaur's &quot;Tail Sweep&quot;, which allows him to change one die to a 1 or 2 each turn. Each Evolution card also identifies whether a monster is a Mutant, Invader, or Robot, and while not relevant for Power Up!, this species identification could come into play in future expansions.<br/><br/>The rules for King of Tokyo: Power Up! contain a few variants: Players start with a random Evolution in play, or draw two cards and choose the one they want, or draft a set of Evolutions prior to the start of play. However you play, the goal of the game remains the same: Score 20 points or be the last monster standing amid the rubble of what was once Tokyo.<br/><br/>Part of the King of Tokyo series.<br/><br/>",

The Vacuum has failed to eliminate the Zombie, the Virus has spread far and wide, and the Loser has turned defeat into victory. 50 different species have tried to conquer the galaxy, and each have made their mark on the universe. Their warring has not gone unnoticed.<br/><br/>20 new alien cultures are now racing towards the site of the conflict. They each want to carve out their own piece of the galaxy for themselves. The aliens may be familiar to some of you (reprints of past favorites), or are aliens no one has ever seen before. The first on our list is a blast from the past; the Sniveler!<br/><br/>In addition, this expansion includes additions to the Cosmic Encounter universe. From the game-changing Cosmic Quakes to the bounties held within the Reward deck, these additions are sure to spice up your quest for galactic dominance.<br/><br/>Every game has seen five races converge to do battle for control of an empire. Now, the galaxy gets crowded. A sixth race appears to do battle, and the sixth member of your play group is able to join you. Cosmic Incursion allows a sixth player to get in on the fun.<br/><br/>Cosmic Encounter puts you in charge of the fate of an alien race. Each flavor of extraterrestrial strives to be the first to conquer five enemy colonies and establish themselves as the dominant life form. Every faction has a unique power, a power they intend to use to crush their enemies. With over 50 aliens to choose from no two games will be the same.<br/><br/>",

These steam-driven behemoths sail freely across the sky, aiding their empire's expansion through innovation and confrontation. As the years pass, the world has come to understand that no single faction will rise above the rest for any span of time. In the hope of decreasing the conflict and increasing the peace, leaders of Europa begin to gather each year to declare a new way for the factions to resolve their differences.<br/><br/>Scythe: The Wind Gambit, an expansion for Scythe, adds two new modules that can be played together or separately at any player count and with either the base game on its own or with other Scythe expansions:<br/><br/>&bull; Airships: (1 miniature per faction; 16 tiles) An airship is a new type of unit that is distinctly different from characters, mechs, and workers. Unlike those units, airships never control territories. Airships are moved via a Move action, and rivers and lakes do not constrain their movement. Each airship has two randomly combined abilities (1 aggressive and 1 passive ability; same combo for all players).<br/><br/>&bull; Resolutions: (8 tiles) The resolution module changes the way a game of Scythe ends. If you play with this module, ignore the standard end-game trigger (when a player places their sixth star, everything stops and the game ends). Instead, the resolution tile for the current game will determine when and how the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Welcome back to the Colonial Fleet.&quot; - Admiral Helena Cain<br/><br/>The arrival of the Battlestar Pegasus heralds a new era in the lives of the Galactica crew and the Colonial government, bringing badly needed manpower and firepower to humanity's ongoing fight against the Cylons. However, under the command of Admiral Cain there is no place for compassion or mercy. Now brutal necessity and hard choices erode humanity's moral compass. The Cylons, in turn, are changing as well. The more they are exposed to humans, the more their individual agendas begin to guide their actions. In a time of suspicion and desperate need, the line between right and wrong grows less and less distinct.<br/><br/>The Pegasus Expansion for Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game brings players the next chapter in the popular Syfy series. In addition to more Destination, Crisis, Super Crisis, Loyalty, and Skill Cards, this expansion introduces many new card types such as Treachery Skill Cards, representing the underhanded methods used to sabotage humanity's struggles. New characters in the expansion allow players to play as Cylon Leaders, who can win or lose based on their own mysterious motivations. New gameboards allow characters to explore both the Pegasus and New Caprica. Finally, with the New Caprica Objective Card and board, humanity will be subjected to Cylon rule, and must defend themselves from their oppressive overlords until Galactica can return to attempt a daring rescue.<br/><br/>&quot;We fight 'em until we can't.&quot; - Kara Thrace<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/><br/>    Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game<br/><br/><br/>",

Louis XV reigns in France, and it's the height of fashion to attend his lavish balls where important luminaries dress up in extravagant gowns and fancy frock coats, all eager to surpass one another in elegance and grace. In just a few weeks, Louis XV is hosting the final Grand Ball of the season, and everyone is clamoring for you to provide them with an elegant frock coat here, a sumptuous gown there, or even a small sum to fund the great fireworks display. You quickly realize that it's not just about your tailoring business anymore; it's about creating a presence at the most prestigious ball of the era and the chance to gain everlasting fame and prestige.<br/><br/>In Rococo: Deluxe Edition, you are the owner of a distinguished tailoring business endeavoring to increase your prestige. Each turn, you play an employee card that allows you to perform a task, such as hiring a new employee for your staff, tailoring exquisite gowns and frock coats to rent or sell, or funding some of the many decorations. However, employees are not always able to perform all tasks, so you must plan carefully how you direct them, especially as each employee grants a unique bonus &mdash; including some that generate prestige.<br/><br/>The Grand Ball ends after seven rounds with a huge fireworks display and final scoring. You will gain prestige points for the sumptuous gowns and frock coats you have rented out to guests at the ball, certain employee bonuses, and the festive decorations you have funded. Whoever has collected the most prestige at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Rococo: Deluxe Edition contains the previously released Jewelry Box expansion, the Festivity Dresses expansion, and the Fancy Dresses promo, as well as a new &quot;Madame du Barry&quot; solo mode expansion. This version of Rococo features changes from the previous edition of the base game, along with premium components including custom poly-resin lace and thread tokens; gold foil heat-stamped, wooden player markers; velveteen cloth bags for garments, silk and jewelry tokens; and upgraded punch boards for the garments, silk, and coins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The area is filled with rolling hills, many of which are topped with mysterious stone circles or the ramshackle houses of the recluses who live outside of town. At night, the piping of the whippoorwills fills the air, while lightning bugs dance in the witch-haunted hallows. This is a place where dark pacts with unknown forces are made, and where city folk go to disappear without a trace. But however much the people of Dunwich may distrust outsiders, they desperately need your help against the Horror that has manifested on the Whateley farm...<br/><br/>Dunwich Horror adds 8 new Investigators, 4 new Ancient Ones and many new Investigator cards, Mythos cards and monsters to the base set.  It also adds new location cards, for a total of 14 cards at each location instead of 7. Dunwich Horror also adds many new mechanics. Players can take a train to Dunwich (a new board that is placed on the end of the Arkham board), which adds 9 new locations and 2 new outer worlds to the game. Players reduced to 0 stamina or sanity have the option of drawing from the Injury or Madness deck, acquiring permanent handicaps, rather than losing half their items and clue tokens. Gates are no longer permanently sealed (a popular house rule in the base game). Condition cards provide benefits to all players may be activated. And, of course, the Dunwich Horror itself - not as strong as the Ancient Ones, yet far stronger than any other monster in the game.<br/><br/>This expansion also features revised rules and an FAQ that addresses many of the perceived faults of the base game. Replacement cards are provided for items and spells that are subject to errata.<br/><br/>",

Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>The game changes the base game in three main ways:<br/><br/>First, there are 3 new commodities in the game, distinct from resources - paper, cloth, and coins, which can be acquired from Forest, Meadow, and Mountain spaces, respectively. Cities that would normally produce two of one of those resources instead produce 1 resource and 1 of the corresponding commodity. (To make commodities easier to obtain, each player starts the game with 1 city and 1 settlement on the board.) These commodities allow players to build city improvements that confer various advantages and eventually points.<br/><br/>Second, the deck of development cards is replaced by three different decks, each corresponding to one of the commodities. Building city improvements gives players a chance to draw these cards with every roll of the dice. Building more improvements will increase these chances, but cards cannot be bought directly in any way. These cards are similar to the development cards in the base game, but with a wider range of effects. (Some cards are balanced better as well - the new Resource Monopoly card, for example, can take no more than 2 of the named resource from any one player.)<br/><br/>Finally, players can also build knights on the island along their network of roads. These knights can be used to claim certain intersections and move the Robber (taking the place of Soldier cards), but are also used to defend the island from periodic barbarian attacks. If the island is successfully defended, the player(s) with the most knights are rewarded. If not, the player(s) with the fewest knights each have a city downgraded to a settlement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In El Grande, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of meeples) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo&mdash;a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king's pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a majority of caballeros in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any meeples you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large meeple) and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>El Grande Big Box, the 20th anniversary edition of El Grande, includes all previously published expansions: Grand Inquisitor &amp; Colonies, Grandissimo, King &amp; Intrigant, King &amp; Intrigant: Players' Edition and King &amp; Intrigant: Special Cards as well as something currently known only as the &quot;Anniversary Extension&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Crave more white-knuckle space dog-fighting? Incorporate the Cylon Fleet option. The Conflicted Loyalties option introduces new Loyalty Cards that will test even the most trustworthy allegiances. Finally, relive the emotional turmoil of the hit television series with the Ionian Nebula, which pits players against the various conflicting personalities aboard Galactica.<br/><br/>The Cylon Fleet option keeps the pressure intense by introducing the Cylon Fleet game board. This board makes sure that every Crisis Card drawn will result in some sort of enemy ship activity. Once the Cylon Pursuit Track reaches the end, the Cylon ships will transfer over to the main game board, surrounding Galactica. There&rsquo;s little time for rest between assaults, so get out there and protect those civvies, fighter jockeys!<br/><br/>Alliances are put to the test in the Conflicted Loyalties option, where the new Final Five Loyalty Cards up the stakes and introduce penalties for revealing your fellow humans&rsquo; Loyalty Card. In addition, new Personal Goal Loyalty Cards present players with an incriminating task to undertake. If they don&rsquo;t fulfill their goal, then they will cause Galactica to lose a resource at the end of the game. Will you raise suspicion by completing the damaging task, or will you lay low and hope your failures won&rsquo;t condemn the rest of your crew?<br/><br/>Finally, with the Ionian Nebula option, familiar faces populate the fleet as allies, and can be encountered by visiting locations on Galactica. But beware! The Cylons can influence these non-player characters, compelling them to produce negative effects when encountered. Manage humanity&rsquo;s conflicting personalities carefully... or infighting will leave you vulnerable!<br/><br/>",

Leader dice, unlike other types of dice, cannot be acquired during game play.<br/><br/>Some Leader and Entrepreneur die faces show two phase symbols. With these faces, if their assigned phase doesn't occur but its other phase does, then the die automatically shifts to the other phase. Other Leader and Entrepreneur die faces show a dollar sign in addition to a phase symbol. With these faces, if the die is used for that phase (instead of being reassigned), then it returns to the cup (not the Citizenry) after being used. When a Leader die is used to Consume, it always matches the world&rsquo;s color (Entrepreneur dice never match any world).<br/><br/>20 objective tiles are supplied, with 6 randomly chosen each game. When an objective is satisfied, the player(s) who met it that round receive its listed number of Talent counters (from 2-5) and then that objective is no longer available. A player may assign Talent counters as &quot;one-shot&quot; wild workers (who, if used for Consume, always match their world). If their assigned phase doesn't occur, those Talent counters aren't used up, allowing for conditional assignments. At game end, any unused Talent counters are each worth a victory point.<br/><br/>",

Agriculture has advanced significantly in recent years, ever since the discovery of the maxim, &quot;leaves of three, let it be.&quot; Autumn, a time of celebration. The peasants have spent a hard week scything hay in the fields, but tonight the festivities begin, starting with a sumptuous banquet of roast hay. Then, the annual nose-stealing competition. Then you have two jesters, one who always lies, one who always tells the truth, both hilariously. Then, they fight to the death! This celebration will truly have something for everyone.<br/><br/>This is the 5th addition to the game of Dominion. It adds 13 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus 5 unique cards. The central theme is variety; there are cards that reward you for having a variety of cards in your deck, in your hand, and in play, as well cards that help you get that variety.<br/><br/>(Source: RGG Cornucopia page)<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>This is an expansion not a full game, you will need either Dominion or Dominion Intrigue to be able to play this. There are no basic victory or treasure cards in this set.<br/><br/>The goal is as previously in the series to have the largest Dominion of all players, basically to have the most victory points. Players will build their decks as before by buying cards which offer varying benefits, the ultimate goal being to buy victory cards. In contrast to previous games of the series players will be rewarded for building a deck containing a variety of cards.<br/><br/>",

Moon's Ticket to Ride, with most expansion including a double-sided game board and destination tickets and rules for those locations.<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride Map Collection 1: Asia + Legendary Asia presents players with two set-ups on Earth's largest continent:<br/><br/>&bull; Team Asia from Alan R. Moon &ndash; Four or six players compete as two-player teams, with teammates sitting next to one another at the table. Each player has their own secret hand of cards and tickets, in addition to some cards and tickets being placed in a shared cardholder that either player on the team can access.<br/><br/>When a player draws cards, they must place one card in the cardholder and the other in their hand (unless they takes a face-up locomotive, in which case it must be shared); when a player draws tickets, the first ticket kept must be placed in the cardholder and any additional tickets kept added to their hand. A player can spend their turn to add two tickets from their hand to the cardholder. A team's points are tracked collectively, and the team with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&bull; Legendary Asia from Fran&ccedil;ois Valentyne &ndash; The main change in this set-up is that some of the routes through Asia are labeled mountain routes, with one or more spaces on the route bearing an X. Whenever a player claims one of these routes, their must place a train from their reserve in the Mountain Crossing area of the game board, earning two points for each such train but losing access to them for the rest of the game. The player who connects to the most cities in a single network earns a ten point &quot;Asian Explorer&quot; bonus.<br/><br/>Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe is required to use the maps in this expansion.

This beautiful collectors edition features several amazing Game Trayz organizers and includes all existing expansions as well as a brand new one: Nightlife, which has buildings and locations that are more active in the evening hours.<br/><br/>This strategic tile-laying game has players use hex-shaped building tiles to create their own unique city.

Your goal is to have your city thrive and end up with the greatest population.<br/><br/>Each player builds up their own economic engine and infrastructure that will be initially self-sufficient, and eventually become both profitable and increase your population. As your city grows, you'll increase both your income (giving you more cash to spend) and your reputation (growing your population). The winner is the player with the largest population.<br/><br/>During each game, players compete for unique goals that offer additional population boosts - and with the many varying buildings and properties, you&rsquo;ll never play the same game twice!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Chambers, The King in Yellow<br/><br/>A new theater production is coming to Arkham all the way from Paris. Unsurprisingly, it's been all the rage in conversations among Arkham's socialites. But in your efforts to learn more about the play, you've uncovered a darker history. Disappearances. Suicides. Delusions. Insanity. Wherever The King in Yellow is performed, madness follows close behind&hellip;<br/><br/>In The Path to Carcosa, the second deluxe expansion for Arkham Horror: The Card Game, it becomes your task to uncover the secrets of this unusual play. The expansion's two scenarios kick off The Path to Carcosa campaign with a trip to the Ward Theatre and an invitation to the formal dinner party hosted by cast and crew. But with every answer you gain and every clue you uncover, you only find yourself falling deeper into mystery and madness.<br/><br/>Along with its new scenarios and encounter cards, The Path to Carcosa introduces six new investigators and sixty-two player cards (including a complete playset of each) that afford you new ways to explore and enjoy the game&mdash;even as they challenge you to overcome new weaknesses.<br/><br/>",

These are placed on the board locations, events, and on Destination cards. Workers perform various actions to further the development of a player's tableau: gathering resources, drawing cards, and taking other special actions.<br/><br/>b) Play a Card: Each player is building and populating a city; a tableau of up to 15 Construction and Critter cards. There are five types of cards: Travelers, Production, Destination, Governance, and Prosperity. Cards generate resources (twigs, resin, pebbles, and berries), grant abilities, and ultimately score points. The interactions of the cards reveal numerous strategies and a near infinite variety of working cities.<br/><br/>c) Prepare for the next Season: Workers are returned to the players supply and new workers are added. The game is played from Winter through to the onset of the following winter, at which point the player with the city with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

This side board expansion opens up six new locations throughout Egypt, including bustling Cairo, ancient Tel El-Amarna, and the shining, snaking, Nile River. Yet the Egypt of the 1920s is hardly a safe tourist destination.

        "description": "Of all the cities found in H.P. Lovecraft&rsquo;s vision of Massachusetts, perhaps none is quite so deadly as the small fishing village of Innsmouth. Decrepit and dying, Innsmouth is being consumed from within by an ancient pact once made to save the town. The investigators will find every hand turned against them as they explore its rotting docks and fetid beaches. In the end, perhaps the only way to save Innsmouth is by destroying it along with the terrible creatures that haunt its waters near Devil Reef.<br/><br/>Innsmouth Horror introduces several new game concepts to the Arkham Horror Series, including Personal Stories unique to each investigator as well as the Innsmouth Look. The town of Innsmouth is hostile to the investigators, and they may well find themselves thrown in jail and fed to a Shoggoth while they search the town for evidence to call in the Feds. However, leaving Innsmouth to fester is a bad idea, since the Deep Ones will gather and rise, bringing with them the Ancient One. Innsmouth Horror also adds 16 new investigators, eight new Ancient Ones, two new Heralds, Epic Battle cards for the new Ancient Ones, over 30 new monster markers, plenty of new encounters, and an expansion board featuring the town of Innsmouth. Over all, this expansion adds over 300 new cards to the base game.<br/><br/>",

The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.<br/><br/>When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.<br/><br/>A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.<br/><br/>Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.<br/><br/>NOTE: This 2021 printing includes the Aberrations &amp; Undead expansion.<br/><br/>",

Locomotive cards are used exclusively for tunnels (which work as they do in Ticket to Ride: Europe).

Neutral delegates are added by the global events, representing the wishes and trends of society.<br/>When a player (even the neutral player) has more delegates in a party than any other player, that player takes over the party leader seat for that party, and when a party has more delegates than any other party, it becomes dominant. The dominant party will become ruling during the next generation, imposing its one-time bonus, its ongoing policy, and granting chairmanship for its party leader, awarding that player 1 terraform rating.<br/><br/>Party:       Bonus:                     Policy:<br/>Kelvinist    1MC/heat production        10MC -&gt; 1 heat production + 1 energy production<br/>Scientist    1MC/science tag            10MC -&gt; draw 3 cards (once per player)<br/>Unity        1MC/planet tag             Titanium is worth +1MC<br/>Mars First   1MC/building tag           Placing a tile on Mars gives 1 steel<br/>Greens       1MC/biological tag         placing a greenery tile gives 4MC<br/>Reds         1TR for the lowest player  Increasing TR in the action phase costs +3MC<br/><br/>The political arena also determines the players' influence, which can be used to moderate or enhance the effect of the current global event. Influence is gained from being the chairman of the Committee, being party leader in the dominant party, and for having a non-leader delegate in the dominant party.<br/>In order to pay for all these new bonuses, the Committee is revising the terraform rating, lowering it for all players by 1 step each generation.<br/><br/>In Turmoil, players can try to force their own agenda, or push it in a more moderate, economic way. They can play to mitigate the global events with influence, or adjust their play to better take advantage of them. And they can anticipate the competing players' agendas and try to benefit from them, or counteract them.<br/><br/>Turmoil is an expert expansion - be prepared to meet the full spectrum of human civilization in the era of terraforming Mars!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Special destiny cards, drawn during the destiny phase, display a &ldquo;hazard warning&rdquo; in the upper left corner; this indicates that a hazard card should be drawn.<br/><br/>Consisting of two types (temporary and permanent), these cards have a variety of wild effects. The Energy Fields hazard card, for example, lets each main player draw two free cards... but they must show them to the group first.

Lovecraft's weird fiction. The museum harbors artifacts that draw the attention of horrible beings, and the unfathomable wills of these creatures make themselves known in the form of blessings and curses. Four new Ancient Ones, eight new investigators, and several new monsters accompany the introduction of these powers, and the entrance of the museum has been remodeled thanks to four Entrance Cards, which give investigators more ways to spend their turn if they'd rather not attempt an adventure.<br/><br/>Blessings and curses work their power in Unseen Forces through the introduction of a white and a black die. A blessed investigator gains the Blessed card and adds a white die to the player's dice pool, giving him an extra icon to use to complete his tasks. Being cursed forces a player to take the Cursed card and roll the black die along with the rest of his dice pool. If the player rolls any die that matches the result on the black die, he must discard both from his pool immediately.<br/><br/>Blessings and curses don't keep building up on an investigator. Any blessed character who receives a second blessing can draw a spell card, a clue, or a common or a unique item card. Cursed investigators, on the other hand, are walking a very fine line.

A tenuous solidarity between human and Cylon wavers under overwhelming desperation and doubt. For those seeking the promise of peace, a single vessel guards the future. The Demetrius, guided by unknown forces, plots a course through the stars &ndash; a course for home. Many would oppose this vision of the future. In this desperate time, both human and Cylon are driven to take matters into their own hands. For some, this means risking everything. For others, this means mutiny.<br/><br/>Battlestar Galactica: Daybreak Expansion brings humanity's plight to its gripping climax. With two supplemental game boards, twelve new character sheets, thirty new Crisis cards, twenty-five new Skill cards, and much more, Daybreak invites players to undertake desperate missions, struggle under the constant threat of mutiny (through the addition of a Mutineer card in the Loyalty deck that can affect either human or Cylon), and bargain with Cylon Leaders driven by motives of their own!<br/><br/>Daybreak also includes rules and components for an optional Battlestar Galactica experience titled &quot;The Search for Home&quot;, featuring a new endgame and a new game board for the Demetrius, the sewage processing ship that becomes the fleet's best hope of salvation.<br/><br/>",

For example, the distances are not fixed, which means that all options are open and not equal to vary the flow compared to the standard game.<br/><br/>2) Coal age<br/><br/>This module breaks up familiar strategies through the addition of a coal resource. Coal can be used to improve locomotives and factories, or it can also be used in foundries. These new foundries bring in a decent income when they are fired with coal. Alternatively, coal may also enhance a locomotive or the effect of a factory, if used as a heat source.<br/><br/>3) Single ticket<br/><br/>This module is a solo version, which features a dummy opponent that occupies different spots and tries to stop the player from achieving high scoring.<br/><br/>On top of the three modules there are new components: engineers, a factory, tokens and cards.

        "description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>Carcassonne: 20th Anniversary Edition is a special edition of Carcassonne to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its Spiel des Jahres win in 2001. This edition includes the tiles from the Carcassonne base game, &quot;The River&quot; mini-expansion (with five new river tiles), &quot;The Abbot&quot; mini-expansion, and a new 15-tile &quot;anniversary&quot; mini-expansion. All tiles are adorned with UV-print, with many detailed easter eggs being hidden in the art. Costume stickers are included in case you wish to &quot;dress&quot; your meeples.<br/><br/>All contents are compatible with existing and future Carcassonne releases.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rails of Europe is an expansion for Railways of the World. Glenn Drover, one of the two designers of the original game, has designed a European setting for the expansion, which uses the original game's pieces, tiles, money, trains, shares and rules, along with a new map and card deck. There are some rules changed and added for the expansion to reflect the new setting of the expansion.<br/><br/>Due to the complicated corporate history of Eagle Games, this expansion was unusual - it was originally an official, yet unlicensed expansion of Railroad Tycoon. It was official, since the designer of the original game also designed this expansion and it was to be published by a company that is a descendant (of sorts) of Eagle Games.  The expansion is unlicensed because it never bore the Railroad Tycoon name, which was licensed from Sid Meier's computer game. Its status as an expansion of Railways of the World is much more official, although it existed before the base game of Railways of the World was published.<br/><br/>",

These cards can be used with the components of the base game to provide more variety or used to play the Dixit game on their own. (Dixit 3 includes no scoring board or tokens, so you'd need to track such things and create your own voting tokens.)<br/><br/>As for the game play in Dixit, each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from his hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty or otherwise doing something that in his opinion is associated with the played card. Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on her card submission also scores. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Dixit: Journey &ndash; In the U.S. and Australia, the cards included in Dixit 3 will be packaged into a standalone game titled Dixit: Journey and not sold as an expansion.<br/><br/><br/>",

Conversion is possible, however, for yourself or for another player by paying a charitable donation to the Treasury (Almshouse).

Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on her card submission also scores. The first player to reach 30 points wins.<br/><br/>",

The city tiles are objectives (in prestige points and/or development cards) and you need to fulfill one of them in order to win.<br/><br/>The Trading Posts are special bonuses you earn by acquiring an array of development cards: more prestige points from the 1st noble tile you receive, an extra token when you choose the &quot;Take 2 gem tokens of the same color&quot; action, and so on.<br/><br/>The Orient adds three decks of cards (one for each level of development cards). They are added on the right side of the regular cards and you place two of them face-up on the table for each level. The new cards have special powers (like double bonus cards or joker cards which take the color of one of the developments you already own).<br/><br/>The Strongholds expansion gives each player three towers (strongholds). When you acquire a new card, you must put a stronghold on an face-up card on the table. You're now the only player able to purchase/reserve it. You may also move one of your strongholds from one card to another one or remove another player's stronghold.

        "description": "The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.<br/><br/>In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.<br/><br/>Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.<br/><br/>Stone Age: 10th Anniversary is a new edition of the Stone Age base game that features a double-sided game board (winter and summer), decorative player pieces, a revised rulebook, two mini-expansions (&quot;The Igloos&quot; and &quot;The Wild Animals&quot;), and a &quot;Winter Is Hard!&quot; variant.<br/><br/>",

To claim such a route, discard a number of cards equal to the length of the route with all the card being the same color, then mark the route with a single Bullet Train miniature; instead of scoring points for such a route, advance your marker on the separate Bullet Train track as many spaces as the length of this route. At the end of the game, whoever has contributed the most to this shared project receives the largest bonus, with the player who contributes least being penalized.<br/><br/>This game board also has a small inlay for the Tokyo subway system, so players are effectively working on two networks at once. You might have a ticket that lists a city outside Tokyo and a station with Tokyo, and you need to complete a route from that other city to Tokyo, then from the central Tokyo station to that particular subway station.<br/><br/>In Italy, the game board is divided into regions, and players score bonus points based on how many regions they connect in their network, with three regions &mdash; Sardegna, Sicilia, and Puglia &mdash; counting as two regions in your tally. If you have separate networks, then you score each one separately.<br/><br/>The board also introduces a new type of ferry route. On this game board, all gray routes are ferry routes, with these routes having 1-4 spaces marked with a wave symbol. To cover a wave symbol, you must play a locomotive or a ferry card from your hand (in addition to the other cards needed to claim this route); a ferry card is a special type of card that can be drafted on its own on your turn, and it contains two wave symbols, so it can be used on its own to cover two symbols on a route.<br/><br/>The player trains and game cards from Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe are needed to play this expansion.<br/><br/>",

Since then, you&rsquo;ve crossed these borders every night, searching for the city, hoping to set foot inside. You have seen wonders beyond compare: the sacred cats of Ulthar and the turquoise and tourmaline city of Celepha&iuml;s that rests beneath the gingko-covered slopes of Mount Aran. You have all but abandoned your waking life, eating less and less, spending more and more time asleep. But tonight is different. There, on the silvery, blade-thin horizon between wakefulness and sleep, the black ships from the moon have finally caught up to you.<br/><br/>Descend into a world of sleep and splendor with The Dreamlands, the latest expansion for Eldritch Horror. For the first time, you have the chance to walk upon the sweet-smelling grass of the Enchanted Wood, travel into the Underworld, or sail off the edge of the world and voyage to the moon&mdash;this expansion introduces an entirely new side board, portraying the mystical, ethereal Dreamlands. As the realm of dreams leaks into our waking world, you&rsquo;ll find eight new investigators that stand united against two insidious Ancient Ones: Altach-Nacha the Dreamweaver and Hypnos, the Lord of Sleep. With a massive array of new Spells, Conditions, Assets, Adventures, Mythos cards, and encounters for every location, The Dreamlands promises adventures unmatched by anything in the waking world.<br/><br/>",

Randomly draw two god cards and place them next to the board so all players can see their powers. At the end of the initial setup, shuffle the Ragnar&ouml;k tokens that are not on the board or on the Age Track and draw two of them. Look at the names of the two provinces listed on the tokens and place one god figure in each of them (these Ragnar&ouml;k tokens are then put aside).<br/><br/>Each god's ability is always in effect, changing the rules of the province they're in. The rest of the provinces are not affected. After a player attempts to pillage a province containing a god figure, whether he succeeds in the pillaging or not, he must then move the god to a different unpillaged province that does not contain a god figure. So the two gods can never occupy the same province, and they never go to a pillaged or destroyed province.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the 2nd and 3rd Ages, the two gods are again placed in random provinces, determined by drawing 2 unused Ragnar&ouml;k tokens.<br/><br/>The combination of the two gods used in each game creates a unique texture to that session. They affect draft choices and influence the flow of the battles. Will you try to benefit from a god's power again and again by moving him where you want and always pillaging his province? Or will you do your best to neutralize him by pillaging around his province? Perhaps you'll want to attempt a hopeless pillage on his province just to move him onto another province where he will hinder another player's plans. They add a whole new layer to the game, without adding hardly any complexity to the rules.<br/><br/>The miniatures each come with a tarot-sized God card.<br/><br/>",

This random scenario system provides an almost unending variety of map configurations, force structures, and combat situations.

        "description": "The Lurker at the Threshold is a boxed expansion set for Arkham Horror, the classic cooperative board game for 1-8 players, set in a world of gothic horror created by author H. P. Lovecraft. This expansion will bring new levels of dread to your table top, with the addition of a brand new Herald Sheet for &quot;The Lurker at the Threshold&quot; &ndash; a powerful and malevolent being that has appeared to prepare the way for the Ancient One, plus more than 200 components and some extraordinary new game mechanics to boot.<br/><br/>One of the highlights is the full set of 18 Gate markers that are designed to replace those from the Arkham Horror core set, as well as those from The Dunwich Horror and The Kingsport Horror. They are treated exactly the same as the previous Gate markers, except that each Gate now has an additional characteristic. For example, the &quot;Gate of Madness&quot; will cause an investigator to lose one Sanity when they fail to close the Gate, and a &quot;Moving Gate&quot; moves along with monsters during the Mythos phase.<br/> Brand new to The Lurker at the Threshold are Relationship Cards for use in games with two or more players. Each player draws one Relationship Card at the start of the game, which describes some advantage gained due to how the investigator to your left is related to you. Perhaps you are business associates and mutually reap the benefits of income, or both are Students of the Arcane and gain more frequent access to the Spell deck. No matter how you're related, these will bring a more interesting back-story to your game, involving your characters in more ways than ever before.<br/> Finally, The Lurker at the Threshold introduces the Dark Pact deck, which will tempt foolish investigators to enter into a terrible arrangement with the Lurker itself. Although these Dark Pacts may grant your investigator enhanced abilities, there is sure to be a cost. What happens when the price is too high?<br/> Of course, with over 100 new Location cards, Mythos cards, Gate cards and Spells, plus more Common and Unique Items, The Lurker at the Threshold will enhance and expand the enjoyment of Arkham Horror for players of all skill levels.<br/><br/>-- from the publisher's web site, edited slightly to be up-to-date<br/><br/>",

Featuring art by the French illustrator Marina Coudray, Dixit: Revelations looks utterly unlike any Dixit expansion that has preceded it. Coudray's mysterious and enchanting images are heavily influenced by early twentieth century design, from the Art Deco movement to Surrealism, even while they convey stories and ideas that may be millennia old. In her art you&rsquo;ll find echoes of Picasso, Magritte, Matisse, Escher, Greek myth, Indian religion, pop music, internet memes, and much, much more... In these stylized pieces, reminiscent of New York City&rsquo;s architecture and glass Tiffany lamps, you&rsquo;ll find many allusions to ancient myths and folk tales.<br/><br/>Dixit: Revelations is an expansion for Dixit that contains 84 new cards for use with that game. In Dixit, each round one player takes on the role of Storyteller, choosing one card from his hand, then telling a story, singing a ditty, or otherwise doing something that in his opinion is associated with the played card. Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller. If either no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all of the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received. Each player who submitted a correct vote or who received a vote on her card submission also scores. After a certain number of rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Now it is time to upgrade your ships to the limits of today&rsquo;s technology, and ready them with the brave pilots. Now it is time to go beyond the deep blackness of space into the truly unknown universe&hellip;<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black, players have access to four new ships that they can upgrade their original ships to. To do this, they will need to hire specialized pilots. There are many pilots to hire, each possessing a unique special ability. Pilots are also specialized in what ships they are trained to use. Hiring the right pilot for a ship reduces that pilot's cost. The more ships a pilot is specialized in, the weaker their special ability is. Pilots are hired by spending unused dice that correspond with the four different ship types, and are worth victory points during play. Pilots are shuffled into a deck and splayed out like planets.<br/><br/>Additionally, Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black introduces a press-your-luck exploration option for players. This allows players to venture beyond the planets and into deep space where they might encounter dwarf planets worth victory points, or rare materials that yield resources... or they may encounter cosmic threats like solar storms, black holes, and even supernovas. Either way, exploring deep space provides a player with exploration badges. These badges are tallied up at the end of the game and players are rewarded bonus victory points based on who has the most of a certain badge type. They are four types of badges to collect.<br/><br/>Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black also comes with additional planets and new and exciting secret missions to explore!<br/><br/><br/>For a deluxe edition of this expansion, see Tiny Epic Galaxies: Beyond the Black – Deluxe Edition<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>This Big Box is the same size as other Big Boxes, but with a slightly different component mix. This big box includes the basic game, Inns &amp; Cathedrals, Traders &amp; Builders, Wheel of Fortune, Hills &amp; Sheep and The River. It also includes two extra sets of meeples - one pink and one purple.<br/><br/>",

The Moon Portal is placed on the remaining tile (the center tile for normal difficulty, on the side for harder difficulty, in a corner for masochistic players). Villagers can follow monks when they move. To rescue a villager, you have to bring him to the Moon Portal and take a special rescue action on that tile.<br/><br/>Villagers come in families of 1, 2 or 3 members. When an entire family is rescued, you get the family's reward. Small families give small rewards (like an extra Qi, or an artifact that can move the other monks to your tile), large families give large rewards (like a sword that lets you turn one die to white during each exorcism, or an armor that cancels the ghosts' come-into-play effects).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some ghosts are able to kill villagers. Each time a villager gets killed, the players suffer the family's curse (which can go from annoying -like having a tao token removed from the game- to downright brutal -like having a extra Wu-Feng incarnation come into play-). Villagers also die if their tile is haunted. Haunters also force villagers to flee (villagers that cannot flee are killed).<br/><br/>",

With inventive objectives like rescuing survivors from a burning inn and protecting valuable ore from a greedy ettin, the Quest Guide in Lair of the Wyrm delivers fresh new challenges to your adventures.<br/><br/>What's more, Lair of the Wyrm brings two new heroes to the fight against the forces of evil. Reynhart the Worthy is a fearless warrior whose prowess in combat means he rarely makes mistakes. He can reroll misses once per attack, helping to ensure that every strike is righteous and true. Meanwhile, High Mage Quellen is a master of body and mind, and is able to quickly recover from exertions that would devastate lesser men. Quellen has developed the ability to feed off the fatigue of those around him, gaining strength where his fellows fail.<br/><br/>But even as the heroes of Terrinoth gain new allies and tactics, their great enemy silently grows in sinister power. In addition to the Wyrm Queen herself, a fearsome Dragon Lord lieutenant seemingly formed from solidified flame, the Overlord gains two new monsters: mischievous and destructive Fire Imps, and flying Hybrid Sentinels...half-dragon monstrosities with a cruel penchant for preying on the weak. The Overlord's new advantages are not limited to his minions, however. His new available class, Punisher, specializes in making heroes pay for every inch they advance. With abilities like Trading Pains and Exploit Weakness, the Punisher class will make the hero players flinch with fear every time something seems to go their way.<br/><br/>Also integrates with Road to Legend app (Android, Apple iOS, and Steam).<br/><br/>",

Now, a crack team of elite Rebel operatives launches their investigation to uncover the truth behind the Imperial plot.<br/><br/>This expansion offers new content for both the campaign game and the skirmish game. You can play a fully formed mini-campaign that challenges your Rebel heroes to rush to Han Solo's aid or battle through a Mos Eisley cantina in the skirmish game. Two new heroes join the forces of the Rebel Alliance, but Heavy Stormtroopers and Tusken Raiders fight for the forces of the Empire. With ten sculpted plastic figures, twelve double-sided map tiles, and over sixty new cards, Twin Shadows brings new levels of danger and skulduggery to every Imperial Assault game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War of the Ring Collector's Edition is a strategic wargame in a fantasy setting where one player takes control of the Free Peoples, and the other player controls Shadow Armies.  As with the standard version of this game, one can win a military victory, either as Sauron and the Shadow Armies if he conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or with similar conditions when playing as Fellowship and Free People. The game may also be won by the Free People by completing the quest of the Ringbearer and trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Hidden movement prevents Sauron's awareness of the real intention of his enemies and keeps him looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring. The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.<br/><br/>Limited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.<br/><br/>The War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one&rsquo;s resources. The additional armies and characters of this version also enrich the theme and make it more true to the entire Tolkien saga of the Ring War.<br/><br/>",

In the shadow of the Notre Dame cathedral, the players compete for prosperity and reputation. Each family controls one of the 3&ndash;5 boroughs that surround the site of Notre Dame. As head of their family, each player tries &mdash; through clever use of their action cards &mdash; to advance the power and prestige of their family, but penalties are assessed on those who do not take care of the health of the people who live in their borough. The player with the most prestige at the end wins.<br/><br/>The &quot;New Person&quot; expansions allow for more variety during gameplay since these characters make different actions available to the players, and they consist of the following characters:<br/><br/>A period cards:<br/><br/>    Bell-ringer: When hiring the bell-ringer, take 3 prestige points for each influence marker of their color on the central Notre Dame sector.<br/>    Priest: When hiring the priest, players take one influence marker from the general supply and place it onto the central Notre Dame sector. Nothing else happens.<br/>    Procurator: When hiring the procurator, players execute the action of any one of their seven sectors according to the influence markers (incl. the trusted friend) in it.<br/><br/><br/>B period cards:<br/><br/>    Benefactor: When hiring the benefactor, players may return any number of victory points to the supply. For each returned victory point they may move their rat marker one place backwards (but never below 0)<br/>    Butcher: When hiring the butcher, players place one influence marker from the general supply into each empty sector in their borough. The corresponding actions are not executed<br/>    Trader: When hiring the trader, players take 1 gold coin from the supply for each of their marketplaces that don't have message tokens on it.<br/><br/><br/>C period cards:<br/><br/><br/>    Actress: When hiring the actress, players move all influence markers (incl. their trusted friend) from a sector (not Notre Dame) to any other sector in their borough (not Notre Dame!) and execute the corresponding action.<br/>    Gravedigger: When hiring the gravedigger, players take prestige points from the supply, the number of points corresponding to the current plague value.<br/>    Mistress: When hiring the mistress, players take one influence marker from the general supply, place it in the sector with their trusted friend, and execute the corresponding action. (If the trusted friend is not yet in the borough the mistress evokes no action.)<br/><br/><br/>Notre Dame: 10th Anniversary also includes a small expansion for The Castles of Burgundy titled Trade Routes.<br/><br/>",

More specifically, in the game water functions like a joker, e.g., you can swap two water tokens for any one goods token. Many of the new tribe cards, which replace the set in the base game, allow players to choose to spend gold or water tokens, which can make it a little easier to build.<br/><br/>The Targia &mdash; a Tuareg woman &mdash; is a special pawn like the robber, but has a more positive effect for players. She starts in the opposite direction of the robber and moves each turn one edge card. When you place one of your Targi on the same card, you receive a favor: Either take a goods token of your choice or spend one good to reveal the top card from the draw pile and receive what it shows. Now a less attractive edge card might be more interesting because the Targia offers an additional reward.<br/><br/>Finally, shifting sand cards give the players rather strong immediate advantages when they place a Targi on them &mdash; but since these shifting sands are placed next to the central playing area, you lose an intersection on the central cards.<br/><br/>",

Throughout the many quests included in this expansion, heroes will enlist the aid of unique allies in their mission to stop the evil overlord.<br/><br/>The comprehensive campaign in Labyrinth of Ruin features nineteen narratively rich quests. While they can be enjoyed as standalone experiences, these engaging adventures were designed with campaign play in mind, telling the story of an enigmatic sorceress's vile plot to bring darkness to the world; as with the base game's campaign, &quot;The Shadow Rune&quot;, Labyrinth of Ruin uses a clever plot system that reacts to players' successes and failures. With each successfully completed quest, either the heroes or the overlord will grow in power...leading up to a gripping showdown in the campaign's finale!<br/><br/>A new Overlord deck in Labyrinth of Ruin provides an alternative to the core game's fifteen basic Overlord cards, while cunning new monsters add their strength to the forces of evil. Hero players benefit from the addition of four brave new characters and four versatile new classes: Beastmaster, Treasure Hunter, Hexer, and Apothecary. All of this &ndash; along with new Travel Event cards, Condition cards, Shop Item cards, and two green power dice &ndash; ensure even greater customization and replayability than ever before!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ticket to Ride Map Collection 4: Nederland contains a new game board with new rules for use with Ticket to Ride or Ticket to Ride: Europe with players now creating train lines in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>The basics of TtR gameplay remain the same as always &mdash; players collect train cards in order to claim routes between pairs of cities with the overall goal of completing tickets they hold in hand &mdash; but Ticket to Ride: Nederland twists this gameplay in two ways. First, nearly every route on the game board is a double-route, with two tracks connecting cities. Both of these routes are in play no matter how many players are in the game.<br/><br/>Second, every route &mdash; whether double or single &mdash; has a bridge toll that a player must pay when building on that route. On a single route or the first track of a double route, the player pays this toll &mdash; which costs 1-4 coins &mdash; to the bank; on the second track of a double route, the player pays this toll to the player who built the first track. Players start the game with 30 coins, and if you can't pay a toll, you must take a loan card to cover the fare, with each loan costing you 5 points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>In addition to helping you avoid loans, coins matter because at game's end, players receive a bonus based on how many coins they hold relative to everyone else. In a five-player game, for example, the player with the most coins scores a 55 point bonus; the 2nd place player scores 35 points, and the other players 20, 10 and 0 points. If you've taken a loan, however, you're ineligible for this bonus scoring, so players have an incentive to build early and often.<br/><br/>These coin bonuses are balanced by the multitude of destination tickets with large point values: six of them are worth 29+ points while another seventeen are worth 17-26 points.<br/><br/>",

The bandits now have horses that they can ride to move faster between the cars, and these horses allow them to jump into the stagecoach as well. The stagecoach is protected by a guard with a shotgun, but a punch in his face would be enough to eject him toward the roof of the train. From there, though, he will annoy the bandits on the roof.<br/><br/>Once the stagecoach is free of the guard, the bandits can collect a new strongbox. Inside the stagecoach, they will also find some hostages who will be worth a ransom at game's end. Careful though, as each hostage has a negative effect that will annoy the bandit for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Horses &amp; Stagecoach also features new round cards and a new event to add more fun to the game. Whiskey flasks spread inside the train also enhance the faculties of the bandits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Everything happened because of a single cat.<br/><br/>It had to get on board during our rendezvous with the Adrastea science vessel, orbiting the DB-198 protoplanet. Soon after, we took samples from DB-198 and made our jump back with everyone tucked away safely in their stasis pods. Everyone, except the cat.<br/><br/>Even its nine lives couldn't save it. As the ship accelerated up to 1000G, poor critter turned into a four-kilogram projectile that smashed several sample canisters and turned into a thin layer of protein soup on the bulkhead door. Nothing too bad, right? Well, it turns out something weird was hidden in the damaged samples. A voracious, parasitic form of XNA that could attach itself to many different genetic molecules, including DNA, and rewrite them to grow carrier organisms. This strange virus recombined the cat&rsquo;s remains. Then, it went through all the biomass in our kitchen supplies. Finally, it found us, locked away in our stasis pods; pieces of canned flesh waiting to be opened.<br/><br/>Soon, all hell broke loose. We tried to fight these things, but the more we bled and the more of us died, the stronger and larger they became. The last of us now plan to destroy the ship, but the road to control room is blocked by the original carrier, now a lumbering hulk of flesh that still has a disfigured cat&rsquo;s head. I volunteered to fight it with a jerry-rigged flamethrower. I know it&rsquo;s irrational, but this damn animal has to pay for everything that happened to my crew!&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Now lets get some more detail on the rules. Again, this is just a general idea, that we will be developing hard in the upcoming time! But we hope it will give you enough feel to give you decision to get it or not ;)<br/><br/>Larvae (Metagorgers):<br/><br/>Biggest change will be larvae stage - at the begging of the game this will be the ONLY thing that will be in the alien bag (no other stronger aliens), but whenever you will happen to get one, you will roll a die to determine how many there will come (probably 2-4).<br/><br/>They will be able to only give you light wound, but if they do, they will try to run (with the part that they have bitten off and your DNA). So if at the end of the round they will not be killed, you take them off the board and put one Shambler token into the alien bag (so Metagorger escaped, evolved and now is somewhere in the ship).<br/><br/>Shamblers:<br/><br/>Shamblers will be much stronger opponent and be able to hit you pretty strong. In addition they will try to find and eat whole body to evolve into next stage.<br/><br/>We are thinking about giving players possibility to burn bodies to prevent this from happening.<br/><br/>Fleshbeasts:<br/><br/>Evolved Shambler. They will be the strongest opponents in the game - stronger then Intruder Queen - they can come into being only after eating whole corpse so there can be more of them on the ship at the same time.<br/><br/>Generally, they will be designed in a way to create amazing pressure on players to do everything they can not to make Flashbeast creation possible, or they will be really screwed.<br/><br/>Butcher:<br/><br/>With the pass of time, one of the shambler can eat another and Butcher is created - it is also really strong opponent, but there can be only 1 Butcher in time at the Board.<br/><br/>Overall combat:<br/><br/>As you probably can tell, combat will be very different from Core Box. It will force players to take much more active approach - you need to make sure that whatever will be on this ship will not evolve beyond its current state.<br/><br/>It will still not be a combat game, but a survival one, but the feeling will be very different. You will want to fight and make sure to kill (and then double kill just to be sure), instead of mostly run.<br/><br/>Mutation cards:<br/><br/>Infection cards will be changed into mutation and once again they will come with some serious disadvantages. They might be instant one-time thing or they might be a permanent setback.<br/><br/>What can also happen, that with some major disadvantage, you can get some small buff (for example you will not be able to hold any weapon, but you will be a little bit better in close combat).<br/><br/>We will try to keep mutation in very cinematic fashion.<br/><br/>Corpes:<br/><br/>We will also probably want to add heavy impact at corpses left on the ship and introduce more then just one starting and you will discover them during ship exploration. You will either waste resources and time to burn them (but meanwhile you can also burn very important parts of the ship) or ignore them, but it will fire back at you.<br/><br/>All in all this expansion will be designed in a way to give you constant pressure between trying to meet your goal and managing Carnomorphs on the ship.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Normally, the influence of the Kami is restricted to the bonuses each of them grant during the Kami turn, granted to the Clan who has the most Shinto worshiping them. With Kami Unbound, the Kami will get their own figure, which starts the game in a specific Province.<br/><br/>While no Clan worships that Kami, the figure just stands there, watching over the mortals' actions. However, as soon as one of the Clans sends one of their Shinto to worship that Kami, they take its Kami power card (an all new component), placing it next to their Clan Screen to mark that they have the favor of that god. While you have the favor of a Kami, its figure basically counts as one of your figures. It can be moved when you Marshal and counts as 1 Force to your Clan when deciding Harvests and Battles. Also, being the powerful forces they are, Kami can never be Taken Hostage, targeted with Betrayal, or even killed!<br/><br/>More than that, the Kami card lists a special power the player can choose to activate. In order to use the Kami power, the player must Consume one of the Shinto they have worshiping that Kami. In an overwhelming demonstration of faith, the Shinto is removed from the Temple tile and returned to your reserve (though not technically killed). When this is done the power on the Kami card is activated, granting its controller its power!<br/><br/>Players may lose the favor of a Kami, however, either by Consuming one of their Shinto to activate the Kami power, or because another player recruited more Shinto than them to that Kami (or is tied for Shinto but has more Honor than them). If that happens, the Kami card, and control of the Kami, immediately passes to the new player who now gains all the benefits of having the favor of that Kami (including being able to activate the Kami's power!).<br/><br/>",

When a player stops on a demon space, they must draw and reveal a curse token to see how they're affected. Maybe they have to discard certain cards before they can travel on a particular type of terrain, or perhaps other explorers will move while the cursed one is paralyzed, or maybe you'll be afflicted by a demon, specifically a demon card that's shuffled into your deck and does nothing but frustrate you or get transformed into a half-coin each time you see it.<br/><br/>Why would you travel to a demonic location when bad things would happen to you? Moving to that space doesn't cost a card, so you might just be being cheap, but additionally some demon spaces have tunnels that allow you to move directly from one hex on a tile to another on that same tile. Is that free movement worth the punishment you might suffer? The expansion includes two blockades that bear a demon symbol, and if you're the first to break such a blockade on your quest across the map, you must suffer the curse that follows.<br/><br/>To play with this expansion, you must use the &quot;Caves&quot; variant of The Quest for El Dorado base game in which mountains are loaded with cave tokens. This expansion includes new cave tokens to be mixed with those of the base game, as well as four new types of expedition cards (with three copies of each) that can be pulled into the market once a stall opens.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with one of four familiars (dealt out at random) in their deck, with each familiar having a repeating power and a one-shot bonus power. For a further way to juice up your deck, you can visit one of the three tavern spaces in the game. When you do this, you draw the top three hero cards of the ten-card deck, place one of those heroes in your hand (after which it becomes a regular part of your deck), then shuffle the other two heroes into the deck. Only one hero per adventuring party, please!<br/><br/>The expansion includes six suggested map set-ups &mdash; all at medium or hard levels, and all with three new terrain tiles &mdash; as well as guidelines for how to create maps yourself.<br/><br/>",

The armies of Philip, Alexander and the Successors meet the hosts of Persians, Scythians and Indians to the east. In this expansion, you will find historical scenarios that focus on the hoplites of classical Greece fighting off the invading Persian army at Marathon and Plataea; epic battles from the Peloponnesian War, the rise of Macedon and Alexander's battles of Gaugamela, Issus and Granicus against the Persians; and battles involving Alexander's successors. With your Greeks you will be able to turn west and battle the Carthaginians in Sicily, or as King Pyrrhus at Heraclea and Ausculum, battle the Romans.<br/><br/>This first expansion showcases over 20 scenarios (the package includes over 300 new unit blocks and stickers you need to fight out these battles). Now, that is a lot of history, but Commands & Colors: Ancients is, by design, a unique historical game system that will allow players to effectively portray stylized Ancient battles that play to a conclusion in less than an hour.<br/><br/>The battle dice resolve combat quickly and the command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory. Yet the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Ancient units, their weapons, terrain and the history.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the Year of the Dragon: 10th Anniversary consists of the In the Year of the Dragon base game and the The Great Wall of China &amp; The Super Events expansions that first appeared in the alea Treasure Chest.<br/><br/>In In the Year of the Dragon, players take on the role of Chinese rulers around the year 1000. The game plays out in twelve rounds, with each round representing one month in a year that seems to go from bad to worse. Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.<br/><br/>The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of &quot;person&quot; cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) to help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing them into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, tax collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.<br/><br/>Careful planning is the key to surviving &quot;the year of the dragon&quot;, but survival alone may not win you the game.<br/><br/>When you add The Great Wall of China expansion to the game, every player takes the six Great Wall tiles in their color. When a player choose the new action &quot;build Great Wall&quot;, they choose one of their remaining Great Wall tiles, receive from the supply the symbol shown on the tile, then place this tile under the first event tile. The tiles give 1 rice, 1 rocket, 2 yuan, 1 palace level, 3 VP, and 3 spaces on the order track.<br/><br/>For The Super Events, shuffle the ten super event tiles face down, then randomly draw one of them and place it face up on the seventh event tile. It will be resolved after this event.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ticket to Ride Map Collection 6: France &amp; Old West includes a double-sided game board that features France on one side and the western half of the United States on the other.<br/><br/>In the France half of this expansion, 2-5 players collect train cards and claim routes in order to complete tickets in hand, but most of the tracks on the board aren't colored! Each time that you draw cards, you must take a colored tile that's 2-5 train cars long and place that tile on an empty track bed. Once you've done this, any player can claim that route by discarding the appropriately colored cards from hand, as in any other Ticket to Ride game. (Single-length routes are already colored, and the map contains a number of gray-colored ferry routes.)<br/><br/>Multiple track beds on the game board overlap, and once a tile has placed on the board, any track beds crossed by this tile are off-limits and nothing can be built on them. At the end of the game, players score their tickets, with bonuses being awarded for longest continuous route and most tickets completed.<br/><br/>In the Old West half of the expansion, 2-6 players start the game by choosing (in reverse player order) a starting location for one of their three city pieces. The first route that a player claims must have this city as one of the route's two endpoints, and each subsequent route claimed must connect to that player's existing network.<br/><br/>After claiming a route, a player can place one of their remaining cities on either end of that route by discarding a matching pair of train cards. Only one city marker can be in each city. Whenever a player builds a route that connects to a city owned by another player, the owner of the city claims the points for the route, not the player placing the trains. If both endpoints of the route have cities, then the owner of each city scores these points. Whoever completes the most tickets in this expansion scores 15 bonus points.<br/><br/>As a variant, you can play Old West with Alvin the Alien. No player can start the game in Roswell, and the first player who builds a route into Roswell scores 10 points, then places the Alvin marker in any city that they control. The next player to connect to this city scores 10 points, then moves Alvin as before. Whoever controls Alvin at the end of the game scores 10 bonus points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TMG Deluxified version of Gentes - Kickstarter only<br/><br/>Gentes is an interesting civilization game with an innovative timing mechanism.<br/><br/>&quot;Gentes&quot; is the Latin plural word for greater groups of human beings (e.g., tribes, nations, people; singular: &quot;gens&quot;). In this game, players take the role of an ancient people who are attempting to develop by building monuments and colonizing or founding new cities in the Mediterranean sea.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds, each consisting of two phases: action phase, and tidying up. There are three eras &mdash; rounds 1-2, 3-4, 5-6 &mdash; with new monument cards entering the game at the beginning of rounds 1, 3 and 5. Each player has a personal player mat with a time track for action markers and sand timer markers. In the action phase of a round, the players take their turns in clockwise order, conducting one action per turn. Each action requires an action marker from the main board that is placed on the time track. Depending on the information on the action marker, you have to also pay some money or take sand timers that are placed on the time track. When you have no free spaces on your time track, you must pass for the remainder of the round. Therefore, the number of actions per player in a single round may vary significantly if, for example, you choose double sand timers instead of two single ones or take action markers that require more money but fewer sand timers. Single sand timers are dropped in the tidying up phase, while double sand timers are flipped to become single sand timer markers and stay for another round. The actions are:<br/><br/>Buy new cards from the common display<br/>Build monuments (playing cards from your hand to your personal display for victory points and new options)<br/>Train/Educate your people<br/>Build/found cities<br/>Take money<br/>To play a card, you must meet the requirements printed on that card, such as having specific persons on your personal board (e.g., two priests and four soldiers). These requirements are why training &mdash; i.e., getting specific people &mdash; is important, but that is not that easy because there are six different types of people &mdash; three on the left and three on the right side of your personal player board &mdash; and you have only six spaces in total for the two types in the same line. If you have three merchants, for example, you move your marker for counting merchants three spaces toward the side of the soldiers and thus you have only three spaces left for soldiers. By educating a fourth soldier and moving your soldier marker forward to its fourth space, you automatically lose one merchant because that marker is pushed back to its second space.<br/><br/>It is crucial to generate additional actions by using the specific functions of monuments in your display and cities you have built. Cities are expensive, but they create benefits at the end of each round or provide new options for taking an action without acquiring an action marker, gaining only a sand timer marker instead.<br/><br/>Try to have a steady income to avoid wasting actions to take money. Pay attention to the display of common cards, which is new in every single game, because the monument cards are shuffled randomly within the decks of eras I, II and III. Collect identical achievement symbols on the cards to benefit from the increasing victory points for a series of symbols. Build cities to enlarge your options!<br/><br/>The differences between the Deluxified and regular edition:<br/><br/>Includes &quot;New Cities&quot; Expansion<br/>A foil stamped box<br/>6 oversized meeples<br/>24 normal sized meeples<br/>89 metal coins<br/>28 wood action tokens<br/>21 wood lock tokens<br/>60 wood hourglass tokens<br/>4 dual layered player boards<br/>4 custom shaped score tokens<br/>folded space custom insert<br/>1 drawstring bag<br/>1 upgraded round token<br/><br/>",

However, destiny is a fickle mistress...<br/>Play with 20 new Power cards (2 copies of each card) like the dangerous Argosian Tangleweed, the powerful Chalice of Eternity or the mysterious Sepulchral Amulet!<br/><br/>There are new cards with abilities modifying the core of the game in interesting ways, like blocking someone else's familiar, rerolling the die not chosen by any player or straigthening once-used card (for 1 crystal) to use it again this turn. The main power of this expansion lies in the concept of the Die of Destiny.<br/>Once per round, a player can take a die from the menu as usual, but instead of applying its effects, roll a Die of Destiny. The bonuses from this die are generally weaker than those of seasons dice, but it gives the players certain number of destiny tokens. Whoever has most tokens by the end gets +20 prestige (in other words, whoever relied the least on the stronger, seasons dice).<br/><br/>This expansion is independent on the first one (Seasons: Enchanted Kingdom) and adds more variability and some new concepts to your plays.<br/><br/>Only for the first edition of Seasons: Path of Destiny, discover a special promo card: Igramul the Banisher! The effect of this card was created by Federico Latini during the Seasons: Path of Destiny contest in September 2013.<br/><br/>",

In Road to Legend, one to four hero players must work together to overcome the challenges presented to them by a companion app which takes the place of the overlord player.<br/><br/>Much of the gameplay for Road to Legend is the same as it is in the core game. Heroes undertake quests by venturing into dark and perilous locales, battling monsters and gaining riches along the way.<br/><br/>Road to Legend uses many of the rules from the core game of Descent: Journeys in the Dark Second Edition, in particular elements such as movement, actions, combat, and other aspects of the tactical game.<br/><br/>Because of this similarity, it is necessary for players to be familiar with the core game rules before attempting to play Road to Legend.<br/><br/>However, there are many fundamental differences between the core game and Road to Legend, in particular the following:<br/><br/>&bull; Road to Legend is a cooperative game with no overlord player. All players are on the hero side and win or lose the quests and campaign together.<br/><br/>&bull; There is no basic game or Epic Play variant. Players only play Road to Legend as part of a campaign, which consists of a series of story quests.<br/><br/>&bull; Setup for each quest (including quest rules, tiles, tokens, and monsters) is determined by the app, and quests do not start with the entirety of the map revealed. As players explore the map and open doors, additional quest rules, tiles, tokens, and monsters are revealed.<br/><br/>&bull; Instead of resolving all hero turns followed by all monster activations, hero turns and monster activations alternate. Additionally, the actions that are performed by monsters when they activate are determined by the app.<br/><br/>",

Adding the Forbidden Alchemy expansion as well, however, will increase the number of scenario variants available to you.

There are Spirits whose names are known by the local Dahan people &mdash; Spirits of growth and fire, of strength and river. But these are not the only Spirits&hellip; Legends whispered on the rarest of days tell stories of Spirits from the deepest, furthest reaches of the land. Powerful forces of nature that have not been witnessed in ages.<br/><br/>When white-sailed ships reach our coastal waters, when would-be colonizers step foot onto the unblighted shores, when they raise blade and plow to claim the land with greed and hunger, nature stirs. When Invaders strike out at the heart of the Island, they draw the attention of Spirits of myth and legend and face power unimaginable.<br/><br/>This time, they learn to fear Nature Incarnate.<br/><br/>Spirit Island: Nature Incarnate introduces eight new Spirits, twenty new aspects, and so much more.<br/><br/>",

These visions also invoked an increasing sense of empathy and fellowship between these people &mdash; a bond much stronger than their Path affiliation. A mass exodus from the Path capitals took place over the course of the first Era, and the first pioneers discovered that the Time Rift in their visions not only exists, but it holds the foundations of a new civilization, one that may eventually set all people of New Earth down a new path - the Path of Unity.<br/><br/>Explorers from the Path of Unity soon discovered a secluded mountain valley where the enigmatic flora not only survived the impact, but it mutated and evolved by the asteroid&rsquo;s toxic Neutronium dust. The resulting flower-like crystal formations synthesize a substance called Flux, which is collected and studied by the Harvesters, the valley&rsquo;s mysterious inhabitants. The Harvesters are willing to share the secrets of the Flux technology with the Paths, but remain silent about its side effects, which only they are immune to...<br/><br/>In the alternate storyline of Fractures of Time, Anachrony&rsquo;s first major expansion, the four original Paths and the newly formed, sanguine Path of Unity have gained access to a powerful new technology called Flux. Flux Cores can be acquired in the Amethynia Valley, the expansion&rsquo;s new main zone. By using the Flux Cores to power up their Fracture device, players may move (&ldquo;Blink&rdquo;) one of their already placed Exosuits to a new action space instead of placing a new one, or immediately retrieve some of their Workers or Free Action markers. This can result in never-before-seen action efficiency, but just like the Time Rifts, the Flux technology is a double-edged sword. Without a sufficiently advanced Fracture device, overusing it can cause Temporal Glitches; hectic negative effects such as shutting down the Exosuit bay slots, temporarily disabling buildings, or making players more prone to Anomalies.<br/><br/>The Valley holds other secrets as well. The Operators&rsquo; advanced technology allows players to remove the Temporal Glitches, upgrade their classic Path tech with new quirks, and even enlist the Harvesters themselves as a powerful new class of Workers, who are immune to the Flux&rsquo;s side effects.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Innovation: Echoes of the Past is an expansion for Carl Chudyk's Innovation, released in 2010, that mirrors the construction of the earlier game as both include 110 cards, 105 cards that are divided into different decks (labeled age 1 to age 10) and five cards that show special achievements that can be claimed.  The expansion's 110 cards are all new.<br/><br/>In loose terms, Innovation is a Civilization-style game in which players first have access to low-powered cards in age 1, then build up to more powerful cards in later ages, stacking new acquisitions on old to build the strength of their holdings. Players meld cards, score points and take special actions (called &quot;dogma actions&quot;) unique to their cards in play in order to claim achievements. The first player to claim 4-6 achievements, depending on the number of players, wins the game.<br/><br/>Innovation: Echoes of the Past changes game play from the base game in a number of ways. First, there are now two draw decks to get cards from in each age -- players draw Echoes cards or Base cards depending on the contents of their hand. Second, the maximum player count is increased to five.<br/><br/>Third, and most interestingly, Innovation: Echoes of the Past introduces new game mechanisms. With foreshadow, a player can stash a card under his player board, then bring it into play (and use it) on a later turn when he melds a card that's from the same age or a higher one. With echo, when a player takes the dogma action of a card in play, he can receive additional actions showing on that card and any other cards visible in the same stack.<br/><br/>",

If the diggers manage to find the gold hidden under one of the goal cards, then the diggers share the loot found there; if the gold can't be reached before the deck runs out, the saboteurs profit instead. After three rounds, the player with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>The Saboteur 2 expansion adds new role cards (the boss, profiteers, geologists) to the base game, new action cards (steal gold, change your role), and new tunnel cards featuring doors, ladders and bridges. What's more, the gold seekers can now be divided into teams &mdash; blue vs. green &mdash; and only those on the team that finds the gold score anything &mdash; assuming that anyone finds the gold at all, of course...<br/><br/>",

Players put new locations into the game, hire leaders, and send people to work in buildings to gain resources and new skills.<br/><br/>Every card in 51st State can be put into play three ways: You can invade a location to gain many resources once, or you can sign a contract with this location to gain one resource every turn, or you can attach the location to your state so you can use its skill.

        "description": "In the year 2097, the entire Earth was enveloped in a cataclysmic shift in climate, plunging the globe into another ice age. Nearly 90% of the world&rsquo;s population was eliminated, driving the survivors to band together into loose communities and tribes.<br/><br/>In Arctic Scavengers, you are the leader of a small tribe of survivors. Resources, tools, medicine, and mercenaries are all in scarce supply. You and your tribe are pitted against up to four other tribes in a fight for survival. Build up your tribe, skirmish against other players head-to-head, or even bluff your way to victory. The player with the largest tribe at the end of the game is declared the winner!<br/><br/>As the competing tribes develop and grow, headquarters are established for each tribe thanks to the components in the included HQ expansion. This base camp consists of a Tribal Leader (complete with special abilities) and the potential to construct buildings that can be used strategically during game play. Additionally, the game introduces alternative victory paths, new mercenaries, new tools, and the addition of the &quot;engineering schematics&quot; pile.<br/><br/>As the tribes evolve further and struggle for dominance, information becomes the most valuable currency. In the new world mapped out in the Recon, deception reigns, leading to a need for reconnaissance. This expansion adds new tribe leader roles, new mercenaries, new equipment, and new levels of player interaction (i.e., new ways to make your opponents feel pain).<br/><br/>Arctic Scavengers: Base Game+HQ+Recon comes with a plastic insert to organize all your cards for ease in play setup.<br/><br/>",

When you explore the depths, if the revealed card is a monster, you can fight a Leviathan on the border. Some new lords and some allies will help you fight, using their power.

        "description": "Kingdom Builder: Nomads provides more options and more variety for Donald X. Vaccarino's Kingdom Builder, with four new game boards - and consequently four new powers associated with their respective game boards, such as the power to place one or two stones from a quarry on empty spaces to block them. Three additional Kingdom Builder scoring cards are included to provide new scoring opportunities during game play, and red houses are included to allow for up to five to play.<br/><br/>The new game boards replace the castle spaces from the base game (which score three points for anyone adjacent to them) with nomad spaces. During set-up, in which four game boards are chosen at random from all available boards, a randomly chosen nomad tile is placed on each nomad space. The first player to build a settlement adjacent to a nomad space takes this tile and must use it during her next turn; the tile is removed from the game after her next turn, whether she used it or not. Nomad tiles allow a player to build three settlements on the specified terrain, move settlements, build without following the adjacency rule, remove another player's settlement, or score points.<br/><br/>The new scoring cards give points as you place settlements during your turn, specifically for placing settlements in a straight line, for placing settlements next to those of other players, and for placing settlements on terrain that's not adjacent to empty terrain of the same type. (Replacement scoring cards for &quot;Workers&quot; and &quot;Merchants&quot; are included in Kingdom Builder: Nomads and should be used in place of those in the base game. These cards merely reflect the fact that the expansion boards have Nomad spaces which also count for scoring for these cards.)<br/><br/>In addition to the quarry power &ndash; which both helps block opponents and fill spaces in which you don't want to place settlements &ndash; the new location powers allow you to place a settlement in the flower fields, to place a settlement adjacent to at least three of your own settlements, and to move a settlement in a straight line on the board until it hits an obstacle.<br/><br/>Kingdom Builder: Nomads FAQ<br/><br/>",

The Great Rivers and the Fishermen of Catan have been expanded somewhat for this expansion through extra tiles and player pieces.<br/><br/>This compilation includes 5 scenarios:<br/><br/>     The Fishermen of Catan - Originally released in the 05/2006 Spielbox magazine and then subsequently released in Games Quarterly magazine.  Expanded in this edition.<br/>     The Rivers of Catan - Originally released in the Atlantis scenario box, then subsequently in Games Quarterly magazine as &quot;The Great River&quot;.  Expanded in this edition to include two rivers, one occupying 4 tiles, and one occupying 3.<br/>     The Great Caravan - Originally released as a free expansion in Germany.<br/>     Barbarian Invasion - New in this edition. - Barbarians are invading Catan and the players have to try to stop them with new knight pieces. This plays very similarly to the flood mechanic in the Atlantis scenario from the Atlantis and Das Buch scenario packs.<br/>     Traders &amp; Barbarians - New in this edition. - You get new hexes, one for the castle, one to produce glass, and one to produce marble. You try to rebuild Catan after the invasion. You get gold and victory points if you finish tasks in the castle, but to do so you have to travel back and forth to the castle on roads and undeveloped paths. There are still some barbarians around who interfere with trade routes.<br/><br/><br/>It also includes 4 minor variants:<br/><br/>     2-Player Rules - Use the new &quot;Commercial Chips&quot; to force trade with your opponent. Use 3rd and 4th neutral player to block your opponent.  Also available online: Klaus2player.pdf<br/>     Catan Event Cards - Originally released in the Atlantis scenario box, then subsequently released for sale separately. Replaces the dice with a deck of cards to minimize randomness.<br/>     The Harbormaster Card - Originally released in the Atlantis scenario box, then subsequently available online: harbormaster.pdf. Gives two victory points to the player with the most harbor points.<br/>     Friendly Robber Rules<br/><br/><br/>This game belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

The earlier you wake up, the earlier you will be in turn order, and the better options you will be guaranteed to have. Wake up early too often, however, and your apprentices will become unhappy and stop working as efficiently. They would much rather sleep in!<br/><br/>Then, players decide their actions for the turn, deploying their apprentice work force to various tasks. You'll need to buy paint, mix paint, work on painting the fresco, raise money by painting portraits (which you'll need to buy the aforementioned paint!), and perhaps even send your apprentices to the opera in order to increase their happiness. Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and frescos you would like to paint.<br/><br/>Fresco: Big Box contains all of the material from the original Fresco game, plus all expansions released through the end of 2012 and the all new 2nd expansion (with modules 8, 9, and 10)! You can play without expansions for a lighter family game, or add in expansions &ndash; whether one, two, or all &ndash; to vary play and to increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.<br/><br/>",

Now, they work to awaken their dark master once more. If they succeed, it will mean the end of all you hold dear. So, while lesser men quail in terror, you must take up arms to defend the world against those who would enslave it forever.<br/><br/>The dangers that lie ahead of you are not for the faint of heart. Deadly crushing walls, unspeakable curses, and assassins cloaked in shadow will try to claim your life long before you ever reach the corrupted temples of Zorek. However, if you're lucky enough, you just might find some help in unexpected places.<br/><br/>Descent: the Altar of Despair includes more than two dozen new plastic miniatures, featuring six new heroes and five new kinds of monsters. Heroes have powerful new skills and treasures to discover, while the Overlord gains a host of deadly new tricks and tactics, including dark glyphs and relics.<br/><br/>",

This expansion adds new dominoes, new giant tokens, new challenge tiles, and additional components to allow a fifth player to join the game.<br/><br/>The new dominoes are shuffled in with those from the base game. If, on your turn, you add a domino with a giant on it to your kingdom, then you must also add a giant token, covering up any one crown of your choosing in your kingdom. If you add a tile with footsteps to your kingdom, then you get to remove a giant token from your kingdom and give it to an opponent, who then covers up a crown in their own kingdom. Covered crowns do not score points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Traditional end-of-game bonuses are also eliminated. Instead, before the start of each game, two challenge tiles are drawn. These provide additional ways to earn points. For example, get 5 bonus points for each lake tile that surrounds your castle or get 20 bonus points if your castle is located in one of the four corners of your kingdom.<br/><br/>",

There are a lot of advantages: you don't age; you don't have to see yourself in mirrors anymore; if someone asks you to do something, you can just turn into a bat, and then say, sorry, I'm a bat. There are probably some downsides though. You always think of the statue in the town square that came to life and now works as the tavern barmaid. The pedestal came to life too, so she has to hop around. The village blacksmith turns into a wolf whenever there's a full moon; when there's a crescent moon, he turns into a chihuahua. That's how this stuff goes sometimes. Still, when you breathe in the night air, you feel ready for anything.<br/><br/>Dominion: Nocturne, the 11th expansion to Dominion, has 500 cards, with 33 new Kingdom cards. There are Night cards, which are played after the Buy phase; Heirlooms that replace starting Coppers; Fate and Doom cards that give out Boons and Hexes; and a variety of extra cards that other cards can provide.<br/><br/>Dominion: Nocturne is a part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round.

The Stalker, a class for the Scout archetype, is a master of the hunt who excels at laying traps of all kinds. The Healer class gains a Prophet, whose mind is his greatest tool; by sharing his insight with those around him, the Prophet bolsters the effectiveness of his fellow adventurers.<br/><br/>The new monsters include Plague Worms and Harpies, but most troublesome of all is Bol'Goreth, a single-minded killer devoted to the will of the overlord. This massive troll is capable of flattening farmhouses and devouring livestock whole. His uncanny resilience allows him to shrug off bodily ailments that would be lethal to lesser creatures, while his fits of unchecked rage make him a force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>The new overlord class &quot;Infector&quot; features a wide selection of powers centered around spreading pestilence and disease.<br/><br/>",

Instead of gaining three coins, they place one of these tiles in the next open space on a circular display; the law on this tile remains in effect until the end of the game or until it's covered. (Should a fifth tile be placed, for example, it's placed on top of the first tile played.) At the end of the game, players receive points based on how many tiles they played.<br/><br/>In the second half of 7 Wonders: Babel, one of five age specific great project cards is randomly revealed at the start of each age, and a number of tokens are placed on it, based on the number of players. This card imposes a tax on players who want to play cards of a certain color. When a player pays this tax, he takes one of the tokens from this law card. At the end of the age, if all of the tokens have been removed, then players receive a bonus (which is depicted on the card) for each token they have; if tokens remain on the card, then each player without a token is penalized.<br/><br/>Just as the cost of cards increases in each age, the number of resources required to pay the tax also increases.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeon Lords: Happy Anniversary includes the Dungeon Lords base game, the Festival Season expansion, stickers for food tokens, metal coins, a new &quot;Dungeon Set-up&quot; mini-expansion, and other items.<br/><br/>In Dungeon Lords, you are an evil dungeon lord who is trying to build the best dungeon out there. You hire monsters, build rooms, buy traps and defeat the do-gooders who wish to bring you down. Each turn, players use a hand of cards to choose where to place their worker imps. Actions vary from mining gold, hiring monsters, buying traps etc. Each action has three spots available - with each spot having different effects (e.g., mining gold lets you mine more gold in each spot). When using the cards, two cards will become locked and will not be able to be used next turn.<br/><br/>The entire game lasts two &quot;game years&quot;, and each year consists of four seasons (a.k.a. turns). At the start of each season, players see the heroes and events to come in the following season, allowing them to prepare. At the end of each season after the first, heroes are allocated to each player according to the players' level of evilness. Heroes range from mighty heroes to sneaky thieves. Each hero has its own power for which the player needs to prepare for. At the end of each year, the heroes travel into the dungeons to fight.<br/><br/>Scoring in the game is based upon what you have built, the monsters you have hired and the heroes you have captured.<br/><br/>The Festival Season expansion adds a fifth season to the year:  festival season. More time to build your dungeon, but also more time for adventurers to gather a larger party. There are new monsters, rooms, and traps to prepare your dungeon for the battle, but also new nasty spells for the adventurers and sneaky bards who encourage them to perform so-called &quot;heroic&quot; deeds &ndash; not to mention two paladins for each year, now ready to punish up to two evil players.<br/><br/>Would you like to push other players toward evil instead of moving yourself toward good when visiting the city? What about making an investment instead of traditional gold digging? Or what about repairing conquered tunnels or rooms instead of digging new ones? Only eight actions are still available to you, but each season one of those actions is replaced by an alternate set of spaces that offer new and intriguing options. And did we mention that it has recently become fashionable for dungeon lords to have their own personal pets?<br/><br/>",

Accordingly, the B-Wing Expansion Pack for Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game packs a mighty punch! The B-wing can be equipped with a system upgrade for precision targeting and can wield as many as two torpedoes (including the hard-hitting Advanced Proton Torpedoes), as well as a cannon. These short-range torpedoes can only fire at enemies within Range 1, but with its five shields and ability to barrel roll, the B-wing is built to get up close and personal in even the thickest of combats.<br/><br/>The B-Wing Expansion Pack contains a stunning miniature at 1/270 scale, a maneuver dial, all necessary tokens, four ship cards, and a devastating arsenal of five upgrade cards.<br/><br/>",

You might even accomplish something great together.<br/><br/>With the Atomic Bonds Cooperative Upgrade Pack for Fallout: The Board Game, the number of scenarios available to you just doubled. This upgrade pack has everything you need to play every competitive scenario from Fallout: The Board Game and the New California expansion as a cooperative scenario.

Players control a home galaxy and a fleet of space ships. As players upgrade their galaxies, they gain access to more ships and more dice.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player rolls a set of dice; how many dice are rolled is determined by the level of that player's galaxy. Each side of the six-sided die represents a different type of action: Movement, Colony Action, Harvest from Culture Planets, Harvest from Energy Planets, Improve an Economic Influence, and Improve a Diplomatic Influence.<br/><br/>After the roll, the player sorts the results of the roll (one selective re-roll is allowed) and organizes the dice in a desired activation order. Each die, in order, is then resolved and the results are immediate, which allows the player to pull-off unseen combos and surprise other players. Other players have the option to copy other player's actions...at a cost!<br/><br/>As players expand their galaxy by colonizing other planets through economic and diplomatic influence, they gain victory points AND the special powers brought in by those planets! In addition to galaxy upgrades, effective resource management provides luck-mitigating options that can sway the game in a calculated player's favor.<br/><br/>Whoever achieves the most points from acquiring planets and upgrading their personal galaxy wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Keyflower: The Farmers is an expansion for the game Keyflower. In that game, each player develops his own unique village over four seasons by successfully bidding on a variety of village tiles (specialized buildings and boats), skills, resources, and workers (&quot;keyples&quot;).<br/><br/>In Keyflower: The Farmers, players develop the agricultural side of their economy by acquiring new farm buildings, growing wheat, and collecting and breeding farm animals (cows, pigs, and sheep). Animals are kept in the fields created by the layout of the roads, adding a new dimension and considerations to the base game. Points can now be scored through the acquisition and breeding of the animals, by harvesting wheat, and from the layout of the fields.<br/><br/>Players may choose to use all of the tiles from Keyflower: The Farmers and add tiles at random from Keyflower to make up the required number of tiles or simply mix the two sets of tiles.<br/><br/>",

The characters may be hired when you're able to pay for the fee of a harbor, and they are &quot;loaded&quot; like any other resource, following the same rules.<br/><br/>You might find it enticing to add several characters to your boat &mdash; especially since most of them earn you additional gold at the end of the game &mdash; but with fewer holds dedicated to the regular resources, navigation becomes more dicey. All in all, more challenge, more silly fun, more Jamaica.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eldritch Horror: Masks of Nyarlathotep is an expansion for Eldritch Horror, a cooperative board game for one to eight players in which intrepid investigators must traverse the globe in an attempt to thwart the cataclysmic rise of an otherworldly Ancient One. Strange cults are gathering strength in remote corners and bustling cities all over the world. Though they seem to worship different gods, the investigators have found a thread that runs throughout all of the cultists&rsquo; horrific rites.<br/><br/>In Masks of Nyarlathotep, each of these sects pursues the awakening of an aspect of the same horrific creature: Nyarlathotep. This being is known as the Messenger of the Outer Gods, and he is the only Ancient One that still actively walks among humanity. The investigators must work to stop the cults springing up to serve his many guises, or Nyarlathotep will gain enough strength to open the Ultimate Gate, ushering in an unthinkable doom. Strike down these cults in new Adventures, explore ancient mysteries among new Mystic Ruins, and destroy the monstrous followers of Nyarlathotep. New to this expansion, Personal Stories unique to each character add stakes to the actions undertaken by each investigator, and a Campaign mode adds a fresh challenge and enriches the narrative of the investigators&rsquo; struggles to stop the many cults worshipping the multitude of faces worn by one dread being in Eldritch Horror: Masks of Nyarlathotep!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

By placing the tiles in this expansion, players build hills and vineyards, trying to plan ahead to claim the sweetest meadows for points &mdash; bringing sheep and shepherds while keeping watch for the wolf that waits to be drawn among the tiles...<br/><br/>Whenever a tile featuring a hill icon is added to the playing area, it is placed on top of another randomly drawn tile, elevating it above the playing surface and creating a hill. Hill tiles act as tie-breakers: if two or more players occupy the same feature equally (a &quot;shared majority&quot;), but one of the tied players has a follower standing on a hill tile, that player will have an advantage over the others, and will score all the points for that feature.<br/><br/>Vineyards are designed to increase the importance of monasteries. Each vineyard tile placed around a monastery adds three points to that monastery's score. However, these bonus points only count if the monastery is completed, so players are more likely to sabotage their opponents' monasteries in order to prevent them from being finished.<br/><br/>Shepherds are new pieces that can only be placed in fields. Each time a player expands the field occupied by his or her shepherd, that player has two options: 1. Draw a sheep token out of a bag, placing it near their shepherd; or 2. Trade in all their accumulated sheep for points. Each sheep token is worth 1-4 points, depending on the number of sheep depicted. However, hidden among the sheep tokens are two wolf tokens, and if a player draws one of these, all of their sheep are lost and placed back into the bag. This introduces a push-your-luck aspect to Carcassonne, as players can choose to either &quot;cash-in&quot; the sheep they have, or try to add more sheep and risk losing them all.<br/><br/>The goal of Hills &amp; Sheep remains the same as in basic Carcassonne: claim the most points to win the game. Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Puerto Rico, players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.<br/><br/>Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.<br/><br/>The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are occupied by workers.<br/><br/>During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.<br/><br/>Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanism in which a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.<br/><br/>",

Now that players have learned to master the postal routes in the south, they naturally turn their eyes toward the north, looking for more routes to establish to add to their ever-growing postal networks. The new routes run between Holland and Sachsen - between Preu&szlig;en and the free cities. The players build new postal stations in order to provide fast service for important letters to the many new customers in the north.<br/> Hard-working postal carriers add horses to their carriages to enable them to travel farther and more safely, which will help the separated Preu&szlig;en provinces to achieve power and glory.<br/><br/>With this expansion, we offer new ways for players to enjoy Thurn and Taxis. The new board opens up new areas for postal routes. To support the new board, we include new bonus tiles and new city cards (with horses on their backs to support the new rules). We hope players will enjoy these changes and the strategic opportunities they offer.<br/><br/>",

These Orders consist of the Galactic Senate, the Science Guild, the Merchant Alliance, the Mining Coalition, the Order of Knighthood, and the Mystic Brotherhood. The Galactic Orders expansion focuses on these six independent organizations and their influence upon a galaxy at war.<br/><br/>Each Galactic Order is represented on the table by a large Galactic Order card that specifies the special power associated with that Order, and each player starts with 20 Faction Tokens that match the Faction symbols on their Starting Decks. Whenever a player deploys a Unit or plays a Tactic with a Galactic Order icon on it, he gets to place his Faction Token onto the corresponding Galactic Order card. Players must choose between leaving their Faction Tokens on the Galactic Order cards to score points at the end of the game, or removing their Faction Tokens in order to use the unique special powers associated with each Order.<br/><br/>",

You never know what you may discover beyond the horizon&mdash;a towering range of mountains, the lair of an evil beast, or the sun reflecting from the walls of one of the Free Cities. Yet throughout your travels, there&rsquo;s always been a feeling of competition with other adventurers, driving you to fight harder and move faster than another so-called &ldquo;hero.&rdquo; Just maybe you&rsquo;d prefer to work and fight together, once in a while?<br/><br/>Unbreakable Bonds is a new expansion for Runebound, and gives you the option to dramatically reshape the nature of the game. Rather than competing against up to three opponents, Unbreakable Bonds invites you to journey through the fantasy realm of Terrinoth as part of a group, or even to strike out on your own in a solo game! With a robust combat system to control the monsters, two new heroes, five cooperative / solo scenarios, and a wealth of new asset and skill cards for any game, Unbreakable Bonds pushes the borders of Terrinoth further than ever and leads you beyond the edge of the map.<br/><br/>",

His starting defense stat is very high whilst his attack and health stat starts at the minimum of one. Gasket is able to perform position manipulation, boost his defense or attack stat and disrupt the skills or movement of the baddies. The backup plan allows him to deal damage, repair himself or to perform a devastating crowd control skill. Another unique ability of him allows him to lock  commands in the backup plan and chain them. Once your bones reach your placed skill dice you are able to perform alternative and powerfull effects.<br/>Gasket is a versatile Gearloc who is invaluable for both solo and coop play.<br/><br/>Gasket comes with his own set of 21 beautiful custom dice, an 11.5 gram chip, closeable dice holder, and a neoprene character mat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To make the card deck larger &mdash; so that not all of the cards would be in play, as in the game as published &mdash; this expansion includes additional character cards that belong to a new guild. Some of the powers of these characters match those of the base game, but you'll also now have the ability to dig through the discard pile to pull characters back into play.<br/><br/>Second, the expansion includes a stack of stock cards, with each card having a special power that modifies existing actions. Only one card is in play at any time; it starts with five or six scroll counters on it, and each time this action is used, one counter is removed. Once the final counter is gone, someone places a new stock in play.<br/><br/>Third, whenever a 3 or 4 is rolled on a die at the start of a round, a ship of the same color is placed on the supplemental game board. As an extra action, a player can discard a worker of the appropriate color, reveal the matching ship, and take the action depicted, such as advancing on the influence track or reusing a one-time power on one of your character cards.<br/><br/>Finally, Bruges: The City on the Zwin includes statues of values 8 and 9 to give players more incentive to complete canals as well as a revised &quot;Engraver&quot; card to replace the one in the base game.<br/><br/>",

The contracts, for example, provide more ways to score points, but may also be traded for the item they depict: workers, resources, or skill tiles. Extensions double the fixed point scores of existing tiles. Cabins provide more opportunities to upgrade and to build the extensions. Keyflower: The Merchants works well with 2-6 number of players and particularly enhances the two-player game.<br/><br/>Players may choose to use all of the tiles from Keyflower: The Merchants, then add additional tiles at random from Keyflower in order to make up the required number of tiles (the Merchant's variant), or they can simply combine the new tiles with the existing game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nemesis: Aftermath &amp; Void Seeders is an expansion for Nemesis. It contains all of the stretch goals from the Kickstarter campaign except for Medic: the Aftermath expansion and the Void Seeders expansion.<br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>&quot;Every spaceship has a voice; a melody of machinery and subsystems its crew learns intimately during long travels. The problem is, ever since the last mission our ship sounds WRONG. There&rsquo;s something foul in the way it&rsquo;s speaking to us. Barely audible murmurs. Strange whispers no machine could make. The dark corridors and vast halls almost seem to SING.<br/><br/>Some of us have tried to locate sources of this interferences, but they always seemed two steps ahead. Stalked by their never-ending presence, we soon started cracking. Our engineer has cut some words on his flesh. When we asked why, he replied:&lsquo;Incandescent secrets need to be written in blood&rsquo;. Then, our navigator took a spacewalk without her suit. When we pulled her in, her entire face frozen and cracked, she grinned in a way I will never forget.<br/><br/>Now, it got even worse. Noises turned into voices, sharing tales of slaughter and terror. They do not run from us anymore. They encircle us and herd us through the ship to some dark purpose. I need to UNDERSTAND them before it&rsquo;s too late. I put my hand on the pistol grip, looking at the backs of my last two crewmembers. I see dark mysteries swirling under their skulls. It would only take two bullet holes to release them...&quot;<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Overlook:<br/><br/>Voidseeders are a race that can interact with the minds of crew members. They will have few nests instead of one, but only one strong fighting presence at given moment. Once killed, new one will be awakened from the most developed nest.<br/><br/>This race will focus on whispering and controlling minds - people who will be near them will start to hear voices commanding them to do different destructive things.<br/><br/>Nests:<br/><br/>On the board, there is normally 1 Nest as a room token, but there are additionally 2-3 smaller nests. Those are places where new Voidseeders will born. At the moment of discovering main Nest, you should put a Stalker miniature in it (this is the model that is on the ship from the beginning. He is very dangerous, especially when faced by people with a high Insanity level).<br/><br/>Other Nests will start showing up on the board together with discovering certain Exploration tokens. Those nests will be especially dangerous. They will not move, but if a crew member will happen to end the turn at the tile with a nest, he will get a serious wound.<br/><br/>Voidlurkers<br/><br/>They will spawn in nests, and their objective will be to spread insanity and try to move players to Nests.<br/><br/>Whispersers<br/><br/>They will work very similar to Voidlurkers, but with the difference that they will have the main goal of defending the main nest.<br/><br/>Stalker<br/><br/>He is a main guardian. He takes advantage from fear / insanity of the crew members and will focus on them.<br/><br/>Despoiler<br/><br/>Equivalent of the Queen. Actually, it is hard to say if she is real or if it is a mass hallucination. One way or the other, she will only emerge when all Insanity tokens are on players (number of tokens will be specific for different numbers of players). She is extremely strong.<br/><br/>Contamination card<br/><br/>Here it will change a little bit - players will normally get a contamination card every time they will get an insanity token. They will be easier to discard (you don't need to check if it was infected or not). Effect of the card will only take place at the very end of the game, and it will be the same as in the normal version - if it will turn out it was indeed &quot;infected,&quot; it will mean that your character, even if escaped, went mad and lost the game either way.<br/><br/>Whispers mechanic<br/><br/>This mechanism will change the noise mechanic. Whenever you move (or an event card will tell you to), you will need to roll for whispers. If you would get a corridor with an whisper token already in it (you hear something more) - you need to draw a Card from the Insanity deck. Those cards will apply to you or not based on the numbers of insanity tokens your character has. Effects might be very different - from one-time action to permanent disabilities.<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>In combat, Voidlurkers will only try to add insanity tokens to you and then run away to the closes nest. Whisperers will be harder to kill, as well as present some portion of actual physical danger, but their main weapon will still be giving you insanity tokens.<br/><br/>Things will change with Stalker and Despoiler - those two will be huge opponents who will give you real wounds, so you will not want to be near them.<br/><br/>Event phase<br/><br/>In the event phase, one additional step that will be added is checking your insanity tokens and numbers of Voidlurkers and Whisperers in all rooms next to yours. If the number of them is higher than the number of insanity tokens, you add one insanity token and draw one contamination card.<br/><br/>But whenever you will be in a room with other people, this effect will be less harmful. (they can help you calm down)<br/><br/>Overall feel<br/><br/>Overall feel we will be going for will be way different from what you will have in the base Core Box. We have a lot of cool ideas how to get Insanity cards in a way, that it will be an additional layer of you not trusting your friends  - not only because of their objective but perhaps because of the Insanity cards.<br/><br/>Additionally, interaction with Voidseeders will be way different, you will need to think very carefully where to move or place your hero to not go insane.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dominion, that's what you're trying to achieve. This time with animals! They each have a lesson to teach, whether it's how to spit really far or what kind of grass tastes the best. It's a lot to keep track of, but you're like an elephant: you remember everything. And you're afraid of mice. You've taken up riding. Horses are intimidating; they say you can lead a horse to water, but you haven't managed it, so you're working your way up, starting with dogs. So far so good; the dog hasn't bucked you off yet. Your menagerie got off to a poor start, with just a goat, two rats, and the advisor who suggested starting a menagerie. You couldn't get that fox you wanted, but it was probably bad anyway. Now you've got some camels, which are just as useless for sewing as you'd been warned, and a turtle that can hold its breath for longer than anyone can stay interested. Soon the animal kingdom will be yours.<br/><br/>Dominion: Menagerie, the 13th expansion to Dominion, has 400 cards, with thirty new Kingdom cards. There are Horses that save a draw for later, Exile mats that cards can be sent to and rescued from, and Ways that give Actions another option. Events return. You need the basic cards and rulebook in order to play Dominion: Menagerie, which can be combined with any other expansion in the game series.<br/><br/>",

This fifth token is only used in five-player games. Other than this&mdash;and advancing tokens two player positions each round&mdash;the game plays out exactly as before, with four phases per round: Worker, Building, Aristocrat, and Trading.<br/><br/>&quot;The Banquet,&quot; designed by Karl-Heinz Schmiel, adds cards with special powers that allow players different types of actions on their turns.<br/><br/>The two expansions may be used separately or combined.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Saint Petersburg<br/><br/><br/>",

Strong soldiers bend to his every wish, goblin minions build siege towers and manufacture devastating demolitions, and his retinue of legendary warriors follow him wherever he goes. The Warlord is first and foremost a commander of troops.

The usual set up and gameplay rules apply, but new pieces are used:<br/><br/>Warriors - Players get two of these in their colour. When placed with the &quot;barracks&quot; location ability, they prevent all building actions on spaces adjacent to it<br/><br/>Wagons - 1 per player. These are placed with the &quot;wagon&quot; ability, and can be moved across the game board.<br/><br/>Ships - 1 per player. These are placed with the &quot;lighthouse&quot; ability, and can be moved across water spaces on the game board.<br/><br/>City Halls - 1 per player. These are placed with the &quot;city hall&quot; ability. They take up 7 building spaces, and count as 7 regular settlements for scoring and placing purposes.<br/><br/>6 task cards are also introduced. These allow for additional end game scoring. The three Kingdom Builder cards are selected as usual, and then 1 task card is randomly chosen for each Crossroads game section that is in play. These show specific achievements that players get points for completing at the end of the game, such as having a settlement on each of the 4 map edges.<br/><br/>Kingdom Builder: Crossroads FAQ answers many frequently asked questions!<br/><br/>",

Tolkien in his beloved classic. Its characters, enemies, and scenarios are drawn directly from the first half of the novel. The three new scenarios in The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill can be played one at a time, or they can be linked to form a campaign that allows players to relive Bilbo's dramatic story arc!<br/><br/>Bilbo Baggins is included as a hero and adds a new sphere of influence to the game: the Baggins sphere. Baggins sphere tokens can be used not only to pay for Baggins sphere and neutral cards, but they can be used to get yourself out of sticky situations via a number of game effects that change with each scenario. While Baggins can gain resources and take actions like other heroes, he is so central to the story that if he leaves play, the players automatically lose.<br/><br/>The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill introduces a new type of card &ndash; treasure &ndash; and players acquire these treasure cards, which represent Middle-earth's most valuable items, only by completing scenarios, with treasure then carrying over into subsequent scenarios. Don't find all the treasure that you suspect is present in a scenario? Explore it again, and hope that you find the riches before you perish...<br/><br/>",

Included are more than 50 new scenarios and advanced campaign rules covering three Theaters of Operations throughout the War: The Battle for Normandy in the summer of 1944, the Blitzkrieg to the West in 1940, and Operation Barbarossa on the Russian Front in 1941.<br/><br/>The new campaign rules let you play scenarios in succession, with the outcome of each battle impacting what follows: each success brings you closer to victory, while defeats will deal you temporary set-backs, or worse, the complete rout of your Army!<br/><br/>With the Memoir '44 Campaign book, you'll step into the boots of Montgomery, or head out at the front of a German column to try and throw the Allies back to the sea. Unleash your Panzers onto hapless Belgium and France, or advance into the frozen steppes of the Soviet empire.<br/><br/>Part of the Memoir '44 series.<br/><br/>The Battle for Normandy can be played without any expansions, but you will need tiles from Memoir '44: Terrain Pack and Memoir '44: Eastern Front for Blitzkrieg to the West and Operation Barbarossa.<br/><br/>One of the twelve campaigns also requires Memoir '44: Air Pack, which is recommended, though not required, for the other campaigns.<br/><br/>Buy the Microbadge<br/><br/><br/>",

Several new factions rise to disturb the status quo. The Unity nanomachines bend energy and matter to their will. The Shaper ships tear the spacetime fabric apart, while insignificant Octantis factions take a developmental leap after leap forward. It almost seems like the base laws of the universe no longer apply.<br/><br/>Eclipse: Shadow of the Rift introduces several new mechanisms to Eclipse, including Time Distortion, Evolution and Anomalies, as well as several new Rare Technologies, Developments and Discoveries. It includes two new player boards with three new different alien species from which to choose. Due to its modular design, you can use all of these additions or just some of them in any game of Eclipse according to your preferences and play style. The expansion does not require the Rise of the Ancients expansion, but is fully compatible with it.<br/><br/>As the shadows unfold from the rifts of spacetime, can your civilization stand unbroken?<br/><br/>",
