        "description": "During the game, the player builds a deck of cards that represents a scientific base operating in alien territory.<br/><br/>The game switches between Relief Steps, where you choose new cards to add into your deck, and Combat Steps, where alien waves of increasing difficulty are fought. Both enemy waves and cards eligible to be recruited are randomized (drawn from a previously shuffled deck).<br/><br/>During Combat Steps, your military cards can be played to destroy aliens or to repair your defenses. Then, surviving aliens damage your base back, deactivating your Shields and eventually lowering its Constitution rating.<br/><br/>Your scientific cards grant victory points and useful abilities, but eventually clog up your deck leaving your base vulnerable. Pursuing sinergetic card combinations and keeping the right balance between scientific and military assets is essential.<br/><br/>Aliens cannot be defeated. Game continues until your base is destroyed (by reaching 0 Constitution) and the game is lost, or the player decides to evacuate, cashing out the acquired victory points into a final score rating.<br/><br/>From the moment the evacuation is requested until it actually happens, two more waves of aliens must be fought, so pushing your luck too far might end in failure.<br/><br/>-description by the designer<br/><br/>Aliens have no technological nor numerical advantage. Humanity is unable to stop their slow advance due to the strange dimensional energy that surrounds them, against which our weapons and defenses are unprepared. This Anomaly is an unknown force, that only our dreams and subconscious may perceive.<br/><br/>We're vulnerable to its terror and delirium, but our scientists claim that this weakness comes with the potential for mastering it. Many survivors of the invasion have been elevated to a higher psionic state.<br/><br/>Now we're focused on Astalos, a terraformed quadrant under enemy control, still wrapped in traces of Anomaly. Our plan is to deploy there different operational bases so that our scientific personnel can carry out tests and measurements.<br/><br/>Our presence will attract hostile response. General, your mission is to defend one of those bases to the best of your ability, so you can then withdraw with the maximum amount of data and samples. You'll be deployed and evacuated by a Class IV Frigate, that will be kept hidden in supraorbital location and therefore will only be able to provide limited support.<br/><br/>You'll get the details during the transfer.

They come bearing dazzling gems, precious Dragonite or even a rare dragon egg - all being the preferred currency of the Dragon Lords. Gems are crafted into precious items like rings, necklaces and scepters. Eggs are hatched and the Dragonite hoarded. Dragon Riders accumulate these items to elevate their status in dragon society.<br/><br/>MEGA Mini Dragons is a 1-4 player, strategic board game of resource management with exclusive dragon meeples. Each turn, new merchant cards are dealt beneath the floating castle cards. Players spontaneously decide to which castle they send their Dragon Rider. If two or more players choose the same castle, the player with the higher status sends the contenders to a different castle. Castles and merchants offer different resources and crafting choices. Every turn, Dragon Council cards are dealt face down, which dictate item values at the end of the game. Players may choose to spend an action to sneak a peek at values, or even bribe a Council member - and switch a value card for one that pays proper respect to their pile of dragon loot!<br/><br/>Dragon Lords, take to the skies!

These strongholds are brimming with Loot - ancient relics, magickal baubles, mountains of gold - and guarded by fearsome foes and evil creatures of the wizard&rsquo;s own dark creation. Should tooth and claw prove insufficient, these wizards have further reinforced their dungeons with wicked traps and magickal safeguards. The world is full of these hidden treasure hoards and your group of Adventurers has just found one.<br/><br/>Some wizards are richer, more magickal, and more cunning than others, yielding a greater bounty from their Loot-filled dungeons. But heed this warning - once you enter a wizard&rsquo;s dungeon you must kill the Boss if you ever wish to leave. Of all the wizard&rsquo;s creatures, none is more fearsome or more perilous than its most trusted and wretched enforcer.<br/><br/>But peril be damned, you&rsquo;re an Adventurer! Now get looting!<br/><br/>Wizard&rsquo;s Loot is a tabletop card game about exploring dungeons, slaying monsters, and hoarding loot! As you and your group of fellow Adventurers explore a wizard's dungeon together your individual goal is to be the Adventurer with the most Loot, but all of you must cooperate if you hope to leave the dungeon alive.<br/><br/>In order to escape with sacks full of sweet, shimmering Loot you must defeat Enemies, collect their Essences, and slay the dungeon&rsquo;s Boss. Once the Boss has been slain, and the Adventurers escape the dungeon, the Adventurer with the most valuable Loot is the winner.<br/><br/>Each player will get a chance to lead the group, explore the dungeon, and make choices along the way. You can turn over every stone or previous looter's skull you come across in your insatiable search for Loot, or you can race from room to room hacking and slashing your way through the wizard&rsquo;s hordes. Wizard&rsquo;s Loot is a game about exploration and choices, and will reward - or punish - players for the risks they take. But choose wisely - your collective decisions will determine if all of you make it out alive with bags full of Loot, or if your corpses are added to an ever-growing pile in the wizard's dungeon!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Do you not feel&mdash;how shall I call it?&mdash;that a revolutionary wind is blowing?&quot;<br/>&ndash; Alexis de Tocqueville, Souvenir (January, 1848)<br/><br/>33 years after the Congress of Vienna, Continental Europe still lives under the reactionary system designed by the Austrian Prince Metternich, the dominant figure of the age. Outside of England and France, absolute monarchy is the norm - and even in the latter, Louis-Philippe, the &ldquo;bourgeois king&rdquo;, is busy rolling back the people&rsquo;s hard-fought liberties.<br/><br/>In the east, the empires of the &ldquo;Holy Alliance&rdquo;, Austria, Russia, and Prussia, enforce ruthless repression against progressive ideas - whether nationalist, republican, democratic, liberal, or socialist. But the time is ripe for revolution, and the conflagration of 1848 will shake this old system to its core in a whirlwind of insurrection and new ideas. &ldquo;People&rsquo;s wars&rdquo; will rage.<br/><br/>1848: Springtime of Nations is a 2-player CDG depicting the unprecedented wave of revolutionary activity that swept across Europe in the titular year of 1848. Based on the hit area control system pioneered by GMT&rsquo;s 1989: Dawn of Freedom, and Twilight Struggle, it pits the forces of &ldquo;the Revolution&rdquo; against those of the &ldquo;Counterrevolution&rdquo; in a struggle to decide the future of Europe, and the world.<br/><br/>The Revolutionary player controls the various insurgent and progressive movements trying to usher in a new order, while the Counter-Revolutionary player leads the forces of reaction aiming to preserve the status quo. They will fight over and across the empires and nations of Europe, attempting to suppress their enemy&rsquo;s influence and extend their own through a combination of political and military force - all the while navigating myriad historical events of the time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two Degrees is a cooperative tile-laying game where you create a civilization that mitigates the rise in global temperatures. Grow Forests, build Wind Farms and Connect Cities via high speed rail to keep temperatures from rising by two degrees.<br/><br/>During the build phase, players take turns adding world tiles to their civilization. The department head of each department will record any progress. For example, if you place a tile that creates a Wind Farm, the head of the Department of Energy will move their tracker from 0 Wind Farms (red) to 1 Wind Farm (yellow).<br/><br/>After the build phase, players move into crisis mode where they must draw crisis cards and deal with whatever crises are on the cards. These crises will vary in severity based on a Report from a specific department. For example, the crisis card &quot;Coal Power&quot; will cause global temperatures to rise based on a Report from the Department of Energy. Temperatures would rise by 0.0 if the report is blue, 0.1 if the report is green, 0.2 if yellow, or 0.3 degrees if the report was red.<br/><br/>Your goal is to keep global temperature rise below two degrees for the duration of the game (10 rounds, each round has one build phase and one crisis mode). You'll score your civilization at the end based on the number of Forests, Wind Farms and Connected Cities you have.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Great for a party, a game night, or a lazy afternoon.<br/><br/>Each puzzle is composed of a set of cards. You can solve the puzzle by reading, comparing, arranging and pondering the messages, drawings, and artwork on the cards. Solving the puzzle reveals a sequence of numbers. When you think you&rsquo;ve got it, gather the solution cards corresponding to the number sequence and flip them. If you see a message or image, you&rsquo;ve solved the puzzle.

        "description": "The Emperor wants the most entertaining fireworks festival to celebrate the end of the summer and his 31th birthday.  He has made it known that there will be a competition for teams to show off their best firework routines to be included in the grand celebration.  There are four major types of fireworks in use, and the debate over which type of firework is superior can be fierce.  Are the heart shape fireworks the best?  Or maybe it is the trefoils?  Of course, balance is also important, and showing mastery of that aspect is to be rewarded as well.  Each week, the teams submit bids (well, bribes) to the Chancellor for the opportunity to show off their firework routine.  The team who makes the highest bid has the best chance to impress the Chancellor as they get to choose the dominant firework shape for the trial, but the penalty for failure is high.  If you fail too many times, you won&rsquo;t be able to participate in the festival at all!<br/><br/>31 Fireworks is a trick taking game that rewards aggressive bidding as well as clever card play.<br/><br/>Winning the bid allows you to determine trump, and just under half of the points available each hand are from the trump suit. The dealer has a small advantage in that they get the final bid and they can also force a second round of bidding - but this is not without risk - they could get stuck making a bid higher than they would like!  Teams that win the bid more often should have a better chance to score points, but if you are overly aggressive, there is a steep penalty for missing your bid three times.<br/><br/>Unlike most trick taking games, trump can be played at any time.  This definitely changes how you will approach the course of the tricks. Four of the five suits are shorter than usual (only 10 cards), so players will be void sooner than you think.  The best partnerships will be able to provide useful cards to each other when one of them wins a trick.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the wild, most humpback whales feed by lunge fishing, which is relatively ineff-fish-cient. Some pods, though, have developed the &quot;bubble net&quot; feeding technique, where a whale dives deep below the fish and comes up, blowing a spiral of bubbles, confusing the fish and driving them into a tight ball, leading to a higher-quality bite!<br/><br/>This is what we are replicating in Bubble Net. Each player is competing against themselves to eat more fish than they lose out to sea.<br/><br/>Player boards are divided into segments that match the points of the compass.<br/><br/>Set-up: Place a Fish token on every marked space, and the starting Bubble tokens on their spots. Shuffle the Fish cards and place the deck in the middle.<br/> On your turn, simultaneously with any other players, add one Bubble to the track. If the Bubble closes a segment, drive any fish present inward by one. All fish that are pushed into the very centre, which represents your Mouth, move into your Belly.<br/><br/>Next, place your two Podmate tokens. They cannot share a segment with a Bubble, but they close any segment where they are placed - a whole whale needs a whole segment.<br/><br/>The Fish respond: flip the top Fish card, and for every Fish icon represented, move all Fish tokens in that segment out by one space, unless the segment is blocked by one or more Bubbles, or a Podmate whale. Any Fish outside the spiral escape to the &quot;Freedom&quot; space, and can no longer be eaten.<br/><br/>Continue alternating moves between the Whales and the Fish until any player has made a Bait Ball (all Fish are within the center spiral), then all players Lunge. All Fish within the center spiral go into your belly, and any outside that area escape.<br/><br/>If there are more Fish in your Belly that escaped out to sea, you have won!<br/><br/>Bubble Net is a multi-player, meditative solitaire game that takes around ten minutes to play and can have as many players as have boards. Players share the Fish deck; each card affects all players, a bit like Bingo, so new players can join the game at any point, continuing when others reach the Bait Ball stage.<br/><br/>The interactive variant allows players to take on the role of their neighbors' Fish, with each person playing a Fish card from their hand face-down onto their neighbor's playing area before the Whales move, instead of drawing a single card that affects everyone from the Fish deck afterwards. Players may choose to score against each other instead of against themselves in this variant.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It features:<br/><br/>Evocative and gorgeous new artwork that will immerse you in the war between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists!<br/><br/>Standees for Generals and Local Notables that will bring those historical figures to life and make it easier to read the board.

The goal is to build either formation with 'Player' cards. 'Players' have specific positions they play in, a point value from 5-20 points and also 'Managers' that they do not work well with. A manager is limited to the number of such players he can have. Each turn, a player draws a 'Player' card from either the draw deck or from the 3 face-open cards or discards a 'Player' card on top of one of the three face-open cards (thus taking the card below out of the game).<br/><br/>Once a formation is completed, a player may end the round by revealing his lineup. Points are scored for players in their proper position and bonus points for completing a team first and there's a deduction for having players who don't work with the manager.

The Confederate army of North Virginia, under General Lee, and fresh from victory over the Union at Chancellorsville, assaulted the Army of the Potomac under Union General Meade at the crossroads town of Gettysburg in the deadliest battle of the entire conflict. The battle ended following the near suicidal attack known as Pickett's Charge which led to the battered rebel army withdrawing from the field. Lee's invasion of the North has been halted.<br/><br/>This box set contains over 2,000 men. Each of the two armies are presented on colour-coded plastic sprues; the push-fit pieces are extremely easy to assemble - enabling you to quickly get to the business of gaming this fascinating era of history on the epic scale it deserves.

        "description": "In March 1939, the small, newly-created nation of Slovakia declared its independence from Czechoslovakia and immediately became a satellite of Nazi Germany. Slovak troops invaded Ukraine in 1941 and fought alongside the Germans for five years as the most minor of allies. The puppet government began mobilizing reservists just four days before the German invasion, and sent its troops over the border six days later. Those soldiers proved far less enthusiastic about the adventure than their proto-fascist leadership. Slovak formations performed poorly for the most part, with just one notable success.<br/><br/>Puppet Brigade is a Campaign Study for the Panzer Grenadier series, focused on the battles of the Slovak Army&rsquo;s Mobile Brigade. There are nine scenarios plus the brigade&rsquo;s background story, and 88 die-cut-and-mounted playing pieces. This is not a complete game; you&rsquo;ll need Fire in the Steppe and Broken Axis to play all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>Puppet Brigade is a partial reprint of our long out-of-print Slovakia&rsquo;s War expansion, with just the first chapter from that book and the 88 pieces that first appeared in First Axis.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Scribble out numbers and spell words to give your allies clues. Can you pass secret messages to your field operatives and complete your mission and outsmart the enemy?<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out 6 Mission Tokens and 6 corresponding Photo Cards. Each player will then take a Mission Card, which will indicate which Photo Card is theirs. Next, pick up a Code Card. In Special Ops 1, you must scribble a message on your Code Card to transmit to your fellow spies, this should be a word that describes your secret target Photo Card. If your Photo Card is guessed correctly then the target has been identified and you will win the Code Card.<br/><br/>In Special Ops 2, players can only use the code cards that you won in Special Ops 1 to transmit messages. Pick a target player, and shuffle the Mission Cards. Put one Mission Card face down in front of them, they must look at it secretly. The Photo indicated by the Mission Card is their target for this round. The target player may now use any of the remaining scribbled-on Code Cards to help everyone else guess the right Photo. <br/>If the Photo is guessed correctly, the players win that Photo; however, if it is not guessed correctly the enemy will win it. Once all players have had a turn as the target, count how many Photos your spies have won and how many Photos the enemy has. If your team has more Photos than the enemy, then the players win, but if the enemy has the same number as your team or more, the enemy wins.<br/><br/>",

Distribute your tekka's attribute points, then pick a Omega special move and a Pilot trait to gain advantages in combat.<br/><br/>You play the game in turns, all against all or in teams. You must manage your Ready dice, which are your tekka's energy, to perform the actions it is capable of. The dice used go on the matching attribute bar then in the Cooldown box, and sometimes in the Locked box. At the beginning of one's turn, the dice bubble up one box.<br/><br/>You keep track of the used Ready dice by placing them on the attribute bar that corresponds to the used action. The blackened letters indicate the attribute scores, which represent the limit of Ready dice that can be used per turn to perform the corresponding action. The used dice move from the attribute bars to the Cooldown box, and sometimes in the Locked box. It's better to keep some Ready dice to roll GUARD between turns, as the dice will be Ready again at the beginning of your next turn.<br/><br/>Game after game you'll increase your tekka's attributes, Dice pool (starting Ready dice) and MP (its hits points), and you'll have the opportunity to pick a second Omega special move and a second Pilot trait.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Magic Number Eleven is an innovative sports game depicting the tactical confrontation of football games with simple rules. <br/>It's a 2 player game, and each player becomes a coach of a football team, confronting each other. The game consists of two Rounds; 1st half and 2nd half. Each round consists of several turns.<br/><br/>In your turn, you basically place a Player Card on the Field Board. The meaning of Player Card placement is an expression of where the team is currently focused on and which player is the center of the tactics. <br/>Each Player Card has semicircular tactical icons which can be combined with the icons on other Player Cards. Therefore, each team will have more tactical icons according to the combination of the Player Cards, as the turns go on.<br/><br/>There are 4 different type of tactical icons- Attack, Defence, Pass, and Press- and the action and the effect you may take in your turn vary according to the type and amount of the icons you have been made.<br/>Based on the tactical icons you have, you may 1) attempt a shot, 2) draw Synergy Cards, and 3) push the Control Maker on the Control Track.<br/><br/>When you attempt a shot, compare your attack power and the opponent's defence power. Both of attack/defence power can be strengthened with the Synergy Cards that each player has. The Synergy Cards represent the teamwork and the passing play of the team. And if your Control is high enough, you may add more Synergy Cards to the attack power. If the total of the attack power is higher than the defence power, as a result, it's a goal!<br/><br/>In case you made the total attack power exactly 11, it called a Magic Number, or Wonder Goal, so the opponent can't defend the shot even with the higher defence power. On the other hand, if it exceeds 11, it's always no goal bacause the shot was too strong to be on target. Since there is always at least ONE unknown Synergy Card which has to be played from deck, so you can't guarantee the outcome of the shot!<br/><br/>A round ends when all the Synergy Cards run out. When the 2nd round ends, a team with higher score wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Is it possible to escape by boat when a shipwreck occurs? The difference between sinking, swimming, and safely making it to an island may be just a vote away!<br/><br/>Gameplay in Lifeboats: Plank of Carneades is all about voting, which takes the form of both co-operation and betrayal over the course of play as circumstances change and you find your sailors on the brink of death. During a vote, each player chooses a card from their hand, then everyone reveals their choices at the same time. You have one card of each boat color &mdash; which also correspond to the player colors &mdash; as well as three captain cards. If you're the only person to play a captain card during a vote, you get to decide the result...but if more than one captain card is played, they're ignored. In either case, each captain card can be played only once.<br/><br/>To set up, take turns placing your officers and sailors in empty spaces on several lifeboats, each of which is heading toward a particular island. The game then proceeds in multiple rounds, with the lead player position rotating each round. Whenever a vote is tied, the lead player breaks the tie.<br/><br/>First, players vote on which ship springs a leak. Whichever color boat receives the most votes has an empty space filled with a water token &mdash; and if the boat has no empty spaces, the players on this boat vote to determine which occupant will be thrown overboard to the sharks to keep the boat from sinking. In this type of vote, officers are worth two votes, sailors only one. However, if a ship has more leaks than occupants, it sinks and everyone on board turns into shark chum.<br/><br/>Second, players vote on which ship moves forward one space toward its island. If the ship reaches the island, all of its occupants are safe and will score their player points based on which island was reached.<br/><br/>Third, players scramble to find better chances for survival. Starting with the lead player, each player removes one of their officers or sailors from their respective boat, placing its token behind the boat. Only one occupant can jump from each ship, so a player late in the round might not have to put someone in the water. Then in reverse order, players move their token to an empty space on a different ship...and if the swimmer can't do this because all seat are full, glub glub glub.<br/><br/>Keep playing until all officers and sailors are either safe or dead, then determine who saved the most valuable crew.<br/><br/>Lifeboats: Plank of Carneades differs from Lifeboats in that it allows for up to seven players to fight for seats on ships. In addition, in some circumstances the ships will move faster and more ships will spring a leak, making gameplay move faster. Finally, the captain card is more powerful as players can use it to keep any ship from springing a leak in a round.<br/><br/>",

This ultimate pirate-themed card game will test your skills as you work to divide the plundered booty and outwit your opponents. With every move, prove yourself to be a true sea dog and master the art of piratical pilfering. Arrr!!<br/><br/>Your aim is to get the highest four-digit number on your secret doubloon cards at the end of the game. All cards are face down, but you'll swap cards in and take sneak peeks as you play.<br/><br/>Every turn you draw a card and choose whether to discard that card for the action, or swap with one of your face-down cards and play that action instead. You could even use a skullduggery token to swap the card with one of your neighbours.<br/><br/>The cards will move as you play. Can you track the cards you've seen and discard the right one at just the right time?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The players work together to use their skyship, Nantucket, to hunt powerful Skybeasts in the Crucible&rsquo;s upper stratosphere (known as the Skyrealm). Each time the players defeat a Skybeast with Nantucket, they score a certain amount of renown.

Players take turns drawing cards from the Main Deck, and execute computer instructions.<br/><br/>There are 4 Crash Cards hidden in the Main Deck. If you draw a Crash card it's game over unless you can play a Debug Card or Lucky Break.<br/><br/>Mess up your friends by stealing their cards with Pull Request, or manipulating the deck with Out of Order Execution. Switch turns on them so they draw the wrong card.<br/><br/>Also, each player is trying to manipulate a shared number called the Accumulator to match a Target Number. Both numbers are represented with d10 (10-sided) dice. You use Operation Cards such as Add, Multiply, Divide and Subtract, along with Data (number) cards to change the Accumulator. To win, manipulate the Accumulator to equal the Target Number, or be the last hacker standing!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cohors Cthulhu: Tactics is a horror-themed, solitaire/co-operative adventure wargame set in the Cohors Cthulhu universe during the height of Imperial Rome. You begin your heroic journey as one of a handful of survivors of an ambush, desperately trying to escape the Mythos-ridden mists of a Germanic forest. As your heroes grow in experience and power, you will fulfill your destiny, becoming the leader of a powerful legion and facing the avatars of the Outer Gods themselves in full-scale war.<br/><br/>The game is meant to fuse the strategic nuance of tabletop wargames with the immersive narrative of role playing games. Cohors Cthulhu: Tactics will feature a wide range of 28mm miniatures in both resin and 3D print at-home STL files. The miniatures range features Roman Centurions, scoundrels, nobles, hunters, priests, druids, assassins, soldiers, and warriors. Facing them will be the full might of the Outer Gods: The Cult of Mormo with their Priests, Servitors, Ghouls and Overlords of Mormo, Teufel Hounds, Fluttering Fiends, Sheehad, Elder Things, Chosen and Die Draugr.<br/><br/>",

There are 4 game modes : a competitive mode (1 vs 1), a team mode (2 vs 2), a cooperative and a single player mode.<br/><br/>Step 1 : Choose a combination card.<br/>Step 2 : Visualize the position of your tokens thanks to the transparency of the cards.<br/>Step 3 : Place your tokens according to the combination and create alignments of tokens to score points.<br/><br/>in a cooperative mode :<br/><br/>As soon as you reach 15 points (or more), the game ends. Count the cards in the discard area: if there are 12 or less, you win! To be a &lsquo;&lsquo;Boussanga Scholar&rsquo;&rsquo;, the goal is 10 cards or less, and to be a &lsquo;&lsquo;Boussanga Master&rsquo;&rsquo;, the goal is 8 cards or less!<br/><br/>in a competitive mode :<br/><br/>When a player or team reaches 15 points or more, or draws the last card or takes the last pawn of a color from the reserve box, the others play again once. At the end, the player or team with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each turn players take up to three actions. Possible actions include drawing a card from the deck, playing a path card or moving your pawn. The first player to build a path to the treasure and reach it with their pawn wins.<br/><br/>Watch out! Ancient totems sprawled across the island give players special abilities with exciting twists.<br/><br/>The game takes place in 1909, after a large earthquake had collapsed the largest cave system on Cocos Island into a valley. It had been rumoured that the island's caves had been used by pirates for centuries to hoard their riches. Players take the role of famous treasure hunters that have raced to the island to explore it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Figures can move one space or jump over others, with the goal to bring all of your pieces to the other side.<br/><br/>The game works well because of two additions. First, each player has a Mandarin that starts on a temple space and must end on his opponent's temple. If the Mandarin is hit, it returns to its home temple. Second, the game includes seven blockade discs. These are placed at the beginning of the game, and the rules offer four variations on how to treat them.<br/><br/>",

The second attempt, which came to be known as the Bent Pyramid, had its original angle of inclination changed during construction, resulting in an unmistakable shape. Finally, there is the Red Pyramid. The first successful attempt at constructing a smooth-sided pyramid heralded a new era of pyramid building and became the precursor to the famed Pyramids of Giza.<br/><br/>In the game, you become one of the Egyptian architects Sneferu called upon after two failed attempts. The pharaoh is wary of his inevitable demise and there is no room for error anymore. You must build a pyramid that will honor the great ruler. But only the pyramid that matches Sneferu&rsquo;s greatness shall be chosen as the pharaoh&rsquo;s final resting place. The builder of such a pyramid will be showered with gold and undying fame. And those who fail? They shall be trapped in the pyramids of their own making as they are torn down on top of their heads. Well&hellip; there is your motivation. So,  get building!<br/><br/>Sneferu is a family-weight abstract game by Adam &Scaron;paněl (Project L) where players attempt to win the great pharaoh&rsquo; s favor by building the highest pyramid possible from mined blocks (with each block being a combination of two of the five possible materials). The players get these blocks by spending the two resources in the game: food and time. Time, represented by your boat moving forward on the Nile, is a finite resource with no way to gain more. The boats&rsquo; position on the river also determines player order: it is always the turn of the player who has used up the least time and is the furthest back on the Nile. Players can gain food by completing sections of their pyramids with matching materials.<br/><br/>The blocks on offer change each round and it is up to the players to decide when is the best moment to invest a lot of time or food, or perhaps even pay extra for just the right block.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will travel up the Nile, from Cairo all the way to the distant Nubian Desert , and then back down. Along the way, you will visit famous quarries providing gold, granite, limestone, white limestone, and basalt. Can you seize the best opportunities these quarries provide?<br/><br/>The architect that builds the tallest pyramid wins! Or will you manage to build the entire pyramid in such a short time?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You move one of your game pieces until you arrive at the edge of the gameboard or at a space occupied by another game piece, but the move has to be at least 2 spaces. After that, you place a new game piece, always with the flat side down.<br/><br/>If your move is more than 2 spaces, you turn the game piece over after your move so that it is now lying in the hollow with the round side down. This means that this game piece is fixed on this space and may no longer be moved.<br/><br/>With every turn, there are more and more game pieces on the board, which leaves fewer free spaces and therefore fewer moving possibilities.<br/><br/>Having to skip a turn does not necessarily mean that you have no chance of moving any more.<br/>Who will make the very last move and thus win the game?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Putting sheep in disguises to protect them from deadly predators seemed like a great idea... until we lost all the sheep. Now a new age is upon us! With demand soaring, sheep are worth their weight in gold! Build your Flock, build your fortune, and protect it all from predators and opponents alike. NSFW artwork on every card!<br/><br/>Sheep in Disguise is a vibrant and strategic card game about protecting adorably-helpless Sheep from being devoured by the many outrageous and dangerous predators of the world. Collect Flocks of Sheep, keep them safe from Attacks, and use Action cards to destroy anyone that gets in your way!<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing cards to collect matching sets of disguised Sheep and a variety of powerful Action cards. When a player has collected 3 Sheep of a kind, they must be placed face up on the table immediately. This set of 3 Sheep is called a Flock. In a 4 player game, the first person to collect 4 unique Flocks is the winner.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player may use as many Action cards as they like by playing them to the Discard. They may also make one trade with the Field per turn. The Field is a constantly changing group of cards in the middle of the table that players can exchange cards with to help them build a strong hand. The Field guarantees that the game isn&rsquo;t completely luck of the draw and allows the player to strategize and build combo moves in order to progress their game.<br/><br/>Players can also target an opponent's Flock by placing an Expose card on top of it. This Action exposes the Flock's disguise, leaving them vulnerable to an Attack! Players must choose to take the risk of leaving their Flock exposed or pay to remove the Expose card, ensuring the Flock's identity remains a secret. When an Attack card is drawn, all Exposed Flocks are destroyed!<br/><br/>Be strategic and be devious. If you play your cards right, you can turn the Attack card into an extremely powerful tool to help you get ahead... otherwise, you may end up as the victim.<br/><br/>If you find yourself falling behind, don't worry! All players are in it until the very end and one big move is all it takes to flip the whole game on its head!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What Has Come To Pass<br/>It wasn&rsquo;t long ago that Dr. Zycheck&rsquo;s experiments for immortality went awry and he was transformed into the undead thing known as The Creator. Further experimentation with creatures both living and dead quickly caused the Isle to become overrun with his Zombi monstrosities. Many tried to escape the Isle and others barricaded themselves in their cellars hoping to ride out the storm, while a few brave heroes did what they could to end the madness. Most didn&rsquo;t make it. Professor Mortimus Philbin, Dr. Zycheck&rsquo;s former assistant, rose to challenge The Creator with his self-made army of Exterminators, designed to do battle with Dr. Z&rsquo;s minions. Unfortunately, the Exterminators were nothing more than mindless Cyber Zombis who slaughtered the living when the walking dead weren&rsquo;t available as targets.<br/><br/>Just when it seemed things couldn&rsquo;t get any worse, the Virus began to transform and spread like a plague, holding the Isle hostage within its deathly grip. Zombis began to mutate and hordes of the undead were being driven by powerful new masters. The heroes fought valiantly to save the Isle, but the virus-fueled undead seemed impossible to overcome. The Virus had infected the Heroes as well, however, empowering them to perform amazing feats that could be used to stop the onslaught. But rather than using their new found abilities to save the Isle, they began to work against each other in a desperate struggle for self-preservation.<br/><br/>The Creator stood to reign triumphant as the Isle swiftly fell into the hands of the dead, but the Brood Mother emerged from a vile cesspool of the darkest Virus. A creature with an insatiable appetite for both the living and the dead, she began to even the odds. Now, in the Isle&rsquo;s darkest hour, The Creator, the Brood Mother, and the survivors of Chaos Isle face off in a final battle to either save the Isle, or doom it forever.<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>Chaos Isle is a zombie-themed card game that can be played solo or by up to 6 players using just a single deck. The game is played using cards separated into 6 different decks, including Mission, Character, Equipment, Feat, Virus and Enemy cards consisting of Tasks, Events, Mutations and Zombis. Chaos Isle: Zombi Deck places each player in the role of one of the Characters, with each attempting to be the first to complete their mission and all the while fending off 14 different Zombi enemies.<br/><br/>What's Included:<br/>Includes the Base Game and the First 4 Expansions!<br/>8 Zombie-themed Dice and pouch in plastic case!<br/>50 colored Glass Hit Counters and pouch in plastic case!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players start the game by placing their Centurion in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game-board. Two Legionnaires are then placed next to the Centurion.  Each turn a player may choose to randomly draw a new tile from the bag or move a tile already in play.<br/><br/>The innovative game-play feature at the heart of CENTURION are its double-sided PROFILE SYSTEM tiles. Each side represents a different posture--often considered defensive or offensive--and indicates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or use of a special ability) the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive profile.  Each maneuver profile conveys a file's different options for movement and attack. The full circle is standard Move, a hollow circle the Jump, an arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on.  Defend your own troops while positioning yourself to capture your opponent's Duke, Jarl or Centurion tiles.<br/><br/>With thirteen different double-sided Soldier tiles and nineteen total pieces for each player, every game of CENTURION brings different challenges requiring new strategies. Add to that players can choose to play asymmetrically with the sets from The Duke, Jarl, or CENTURION, battling among all three armies. The variety of play is limitless.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This edition of Carcassonne: Wheel of Fortune includes the Bridges, Castles and Bazaars expansion.<br/><br/>Carcassonne: Wheel of Fortune is both a full replacement for the base game of Carcassonne and an expansion to the original base game. It includes 72 tiles, consisting of 63 tiles released in the original base game, 6 from Inns &amp; Cathedrals, 1 from Traders &amp; Builders and 2 from King &amp; Scout. It also includes a special replacement start tile which depicts the Wheel of Fortune, a new mechanic unique to this edition of the game. The new start tile is the size of 16 tiles, arranged in a 4&times;4 square and is built using some of the tiles removed from the base game.<br/><br/>Nineteen tiles from the game have numbers printed on them allowing players to randomly spin the Wheel of Fate (between 1 and 3 spaces around the wheel). Otherwise, a player may choose to place a follower on the wheel if they decline placing a follower that turn. The results of the Wheel vary depending on which of the sixths of the wheel the pig lands on. Results vary from forcing all players to remove a follower from the board to rewarding the player who moves the pig with three bonus points. There are six outcomes in all.<br/><br/>Play of this game does not require ownership of any Carcassonne base game. All expansions are compatible with this game. This game can also be played with the base game as an expansion, using its wagon wheel watermark to differentiate it from the base game.<br/><br/>Bridges, Castles and Bazaars is the eighth expansion for Carcassonne. It allows players three new options while playing:<br/><br/>Bridges may be used to continue a road over a field tile, thereby allowing an incomplete road to technically run into a field segment. They are otherwise treated and scored just like roads.<br/><br/>Castle tokens are placed atop 2-segment cities and allow players a chance to cash-in on the next completed adjacent feature.<br/><br/>Bazaars are a new type of tile that allows players to auction off tiles in exchange for points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You know the drill.  <br/>Werewolves terrorize the villagers by night.  Fear crazed villagers run around lynching each other during the day and exercising secret powers in the darkness.  Blah, blah, blah.  <br/>It&rsquo;s all so deliciously clich&eacute; it makes you want to laugh out loud.<br/>Except that you, the Slayer, have a secret.<br/>After a particularly rowdy night at the local tavern last Friday, you woke up with stiff joints and a set of unexplained claw marks down your back.  Ever since, you&rsquo;ve been plucking your   eyebrows twice a day and craving rare steak.  Once, you even caught yourself trying to scratch behind your ear.  <br/>With your foot.<br/>Last night, you heard howling in the distance and it made the fur&hellip; er&hellip; little hairs on the back of your neck... stand at attention&hellip;<br/><br/>Wolven is a solitaire hidden role deduction game in which you (as the Slayer) seek to identify and eliminate the werewolves before they overrun the village&hellip; AND before you sprout fur and claws!<br/><br/>The tokens in Wolven each have a picture of a villager on their front.  Each unique villager has a special ability that aids the player in the process of deduction, earns silver, or helps protect other villagers against the werewolves.<br/><br/>The back of most of the tokens show picture of a Peasant, who is a sort of generic villager with a special ability of his own.  A few of the tokens, however, have werewolves on their reverse sides instead.  The object of the game is to identify which villagers have werewolves on the back and eliminate those tokens from play.<br/><br/>To spice up the deductive part of the game, one or more of the villagers might also have a Peasant on their front face.  So when you see a peasant on a token, you're not sure if you're looking at the back of a villager token, or the front of a peasant token.  If it's a peasant token,you're not sure if the reverse side is another peasant, or a werewolf!<br/><br/>The game is played by pulling tokens from a bag and viewing only one side, which is placed face up on the table.  You may continue drawing tokens until you decide to stop, or until you place a token that show a werewolf.<br/><br/>You may then spend silver to use the abilities of any of the face up villagers.<br/><br/>If you stopped drawing tokens before you drew a werewolf, you may then select the token of your choice to remove from the game.  Once it's removed from the game you can look at both sides to determine whether you've eliminated a werewolf or a villager.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you didn't stop drawing until a werewolf turned up, the token to be eliminated from play is selected randomly.  Drawing a werewolf also advances a token on the infection track.  If this token ever reaches the end of its track, another werewolf is added to the bag.<br/><br/>In either case, the tokens (other than that which was eliminated) are placed back in the bag and another round begins.<br/><br/>If, at the end of any round, all of the werewolves have been eliminated, the player wins.  If, however, the werewolves ever outnumber the regular villagers remaining in the game, the player loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;How the West was Saved: the Russo-Polish War 1920&quot; is a two&ndash;player strategic wargame based upon the Russo &ndash; Polish War from April 1920, when the Poles were poised to attack Kiev, until October 1920 when the War effectively came to an end. One player commands the Polish and Ukrainian armies; the other commands the Russians (and their Lithuanian allies if Lithuania joins the conflict). Generally, each counter denotes a cavalry or infantry division or an artillery train; but, some smaller brigades and regiments are also represented.<br/><br/>This was a war of manoeuvre fought over huge distances with relatively small armies. As a consequence, even though both sides were well equipped for defence - possessing artillery, barbed wire and machine guns - a combination of vast open spaces and rudimentary reconnaissance meant that, unlike on the crowded battlefields of WW1, defensive positions could often be outflanked and overrun before reinforcements arrived.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are designed to reflect this fog of war. Players only have a certain number of resource points each turn to supply and to move units. As supply lines extend so, just as happened historically, they become increasingly vulnerable, and strategic options reduce. Players take it in turns to allocate Activation Markers to units that they wish to move; but, their orders may not be received or obeyed. The direction that a unit is facing is integral to the combat system, recognising the importance of flanking manoeuvres.<br/><br/>The war was a fascinating mix of ancient and modern. With cavalry operating alongside aircraft, armoured trains and tanks, and carrier pigeons alongside field radios. It also featured some of the characters who were to become icons of the twentieth-century: Churchill, de Gaulle, Lenin, Pilsudski, Stalin and Trotsky.  This rich tapestry of equipment, characters and events is captured in Cards to reflect the random events and extraneous factors which the Gods chose to cast down upon those caught up in the tumultuous events which unfolded in Eastern Europe during the fateful year of 1920.<br/><br/>Box contents:<br/>&bull; 16-page Rulebook,<br/>&bull; Set Up Card,<br/>&bull; Two Six-sided Dice (2D6): One Red, One White,<br/>&bull; mounted 48 x 68 cm map showing territories between Warsaw and Smolensk,<br/>&bull; 216 unit counters and game markers, and<br/>&bull; 40 laminated Random Event Cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Aside from being a smart-ass and always being right, they care about having magic artifacts and spellbooks &mdash; but these items aren't easy to get, so sometimes magicians just decide to meet and compete against one another in a refined bidding ritual to take items from others. Whoever first claims two spellbooks wins!<br/><br/>Each player starts Zockende Zauberer with three vials (life points) and three gems: two bearing a pearl and one bearing an imp. Players also receive two spells at random from a shuffled decks of magic cards.<br/><br/>Each round consists of four phases: lay down, call, confirm, and score. First, everyone lays a gem face down, starting with the first player and with this happening up to three times. The active player can call out how many pearls or imps they intend to reveal from among the played gems, and the next wizard can increase this call with a higher number. Once everyone passes on going higher, the player who made the call starts revealing played gems, although they can't reveal two gems from the same pile.<br/><br/>If the call was correct, the active player claims a spellbook; if not, they lose one of their vials. Collect two spellbooks or be the last wizard standing, and you win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1796, the young French Republic was no longer at bay, having knocked Prussia, the Netherlands and Tuscany out of the War of the First Coalition. However, the French were still facing their long-time and toughest enemies: England and Austria. Challenging England on the high seas was out of question, because the French fleet was no longer a match for the Royal Navy. Therefore, the French Directory ruled that the best chance for victory was a decisive land campaign to force Austria to sue for peace. Two large French armies  commanded by experienced Generals Jourdan and Moreau were to advance into Germany toward Vienna. In the meantime, a small French force was to undertake a diversionary movement in Northern Italy. This operation, on a lesser theater, was entrusted to a young Corsican General named Napoleon Bonaparte.<br/><br/>&quot;Bonaparte in Italy: The Castiglione Campaign, 1796&quot; is played on a point-to-point map representing the territory of the provinces of Mantua, Brescia and Verona and uses a simple system stressing the importance of command and supply. Game counters represent Brigades and historical Leaders that fought during the campaign. Combats take into account the role of leadership, cavalry and artillery. The players must carefully monitor the cohesion status of their troops throughout the campaign and choose the most appropriate time to use &lsquo;Forced Marches&rsquo; and &lsquo;Marches to the Sound of the Guns&rsquo; to win the decision. Additional chrome includes rules for the siege of Mantua, bridge destruction, garrisons, cavalry pursuits and optional rules for Leader casualties, the Fog of War and reconnaissance.<br/><br/>",

To do this, get the room modules with all necessary equipment and invest in the neighborhoods.<br/><br/>The setup is very simple, a deck of houses and another deck of rooms. Four cards from each are deployed online. Players choose characters in a quick open draft and start the game with 3 fund tokens and 2 cards from the room deck.<br/><br/>A basic game turn would be to take a room, build a house or a public building and finally invest in one of the four neighborhoods.<br/><br/>It is important that every time we take a room (every turn) we can perform its ability. There are 7 different abilities that allow us to: draw more cards, discard houses, exchange houses, invest in the neighborhoods, steal funds previously invested in the neighborhoods, etc. This is one of the main interaction mechanics.<br/><br/>Another way to interact is with the constant investment in each of the 4 neighborhoods to which the houses belong. According to whether funds have been invested or corrupted in each neighborhood and according to the houses that each player has built, the value of these will increase or decrease.<br/><br/>The game has 12 asymmetrical characters that provide a goal to get extra points and a ability that will give us some advantage.<br/><br/>To speed up the game we have 4 event cards that benefit the players and 6 special cards that allow us to draw cards to fill the players' hand.<br/><br/>When it comes to scoring, the value of the houses built, the bonus icons we have among the cards, the funds tokens in our reserve, having fulfilled our character's goal and the funds invested in each neighborhood with respect to the houses we have built will be important.<br/><br/>Off-Plan has 1 standard game mode (with two variants) and 2 solitaire modes.<br/><br/>One of the variants includes the Vulture Backgrounds card, which is shuffled into the housing deck and causes an abrupt ending.<br/><br/>-description from developer<br/><br/>",

After a thousand years of war, Countermay is dying. Battles, curses, extraterrestrial parasites, demonic influence, and other hazards have ruined much of the planet. The food is running out, and the threat of starvation looms. The only way to save Countermay is to seize undisputed control. Until then, armies march, fed with the ever-dwindling food as they churn farmland into mud with their boots.<br/><br/>In the game, players assume command of one of the vastly different warring factions &mdash; including steampunk aliens, displaced WWII-era American GIs, or a risen empire of the undead &mdash; to expand, glorify, or defend their empires.<br/><br/>The plot of the 2013 movie The Gamers: Hands of Fate revolves around the fictitious game of Romance of the Nine Empires. Within the movie itself, AEG was the publisher of the game, but as a result of Kickstarter funding for the film, it decided to create a real-life version of R9E, as an expandable card game.<br/><br/>Romance of the Nine Empires: Arcane Fire is the first expansion to the card game featured in The Gamers: Hands of Fate. This box contains a complete play-set of cards necessary to build two new factions, as well as brand new cards for the five existing factions of Countermay.<br/><br/>Wield the power of guardians, extraplanar heroes summoned by wizards, with the Magocracy of Arcanix, or strike down your foes with the dueling Tuatha!

At first round, each player get 3 tiles from their pile and than draw one each subsequent round, maintaining 3 options to play at almost all time. In your turn, you must place one tile (considering that you cant extend the panel mor than 7x7 tiles away) and optionally rotate 90&ordm; clockwise another placed tile (only if the rotated tile is not forming a circle pattern yet). The turns goes until the 7x7 panel is created.<br/><br/>You score one point creating circle patterns with absolute majority of your colour and 3 points if the circle created has only your color. You also score bonus points (1 for each circle) if the scored circle is created only by your pieces.<br/><br/>Ar fisrt glance, Azzelij seems to be a simple tile placement, but as the game flows players faces lots of hard decisions to make: May I get a point or avoid another player to get a better position? May I close the 7 piece limit to stop opponents to grow at one edge or stay creating my pattern? May I risk to get a full-colored circle of mine or get two or more majority-only circle points?<br/><br/>As the game flows, the decisions ar harder to take and the panel gets its 7x7 piece formation, that increases the difficulty and fun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The streets of this broken city are crowded with Boss Man's thugs, corrupt cops and rogue cyborgs. It's time someone took out the trash. City of Fury is a 9 card solitaire homage to classic Beat 'em Ups like Streets of Rage and Double Dragon. Choose your vigilante then patrol the streets, itching for a fight, while scrolling ever rightwards. Can you defeat Boss Man and his criminal sidekicks?<br/><br/>Setup: 5 Street Cards are laid in a row, randomly but with the Boss Card on the right, to form the Screen on which your Vigilante and Enemies will fight. The other 2 Enemy Cards are placed face up on the right Street Cards as your initial Enemies, and your Vigilante is placed on the leftmost Street Card. This initial shuffling is the only random element in the game.<br/><br/>Your Skills Card contains the Actions you can take on your turn. Your Vigilante has 4 Skills (Punch, Kick, Shoot and Dodge), which each have 4 levels of Charge; higher Charged Skills are more powerful. On your turn you activate one of your Skills, performing the Actions of its current level, then reduce that Skill to the lowest Charge Level. Then, you pick two of your Skills and increase their Charge by 1. Actions include movement (which can involve swapping places with adjacent Enemies), melee attacks against adjacent Enemies, shooting attacks against non-adjacent enemies and healing.<br/><br/>It is then the Enemy turn; at any one time there are usually 2 Enemies on the Screen. Each Enemy Card has two unique Behaviour Boxes, showing the Behaviours they will take based on whether they are to the left or right of the Vigilante, so each follows a unique AI and requires different tactics to beat. Some enemies may back up and shoot, others close in and punch, others may prefer to get behind you.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, once your Vigilante and any Enemies have acted, if an enemy has been killed then the Screen Scrolls Right; the dead enemy card is placed as a new Street card on the right, and the leftmost Street Card is flipped and placed to the right as a new Enemy. To win the game you must defeat the Boss Man.<br/><br/>",

After a bloody 24-day struggle for the island of Saipan, next the Americans invaded Guam and Tinian in late July. Guam fell after 20 days of battle; Tinian, after eight. B-29 Superfortress bombers soon arrived on the islands to begin the strategic bombardment of Japan.<br/><br/><br/>Designer Jay Townsend brought you the battle for Saipan in the game Saipan 1944. Panzer Grenadier: Marianas 1944 is an expansion book for Saipan 1944, studying the battles for Guam and Tinian in 30 new scenarios. Ten of them take place on Tinian, and twenty on Guam &ndash; one from the 1941 Japanese invasion, and the other 19 from the 1944 American assault.<br/><br/>Everything you need to play all 30 scenarios is included with this book and the boxed game Saipan 1944 - no other games or supplements are needed to play any of the 30 scenarios.<br/><br/>Marianas 1944 includes two new maps by Guy Riessen &ndash; numbers 100 and 101 as Panzer Grenadier&rsquo;s map collection bursts into the triple digits. These are used with the four maps from Saipan 1944 for the book&rsquo;s 30 new scenarios, but are fully compatible with other Panzer Grenadier maps.<br/><br/>There are also 24 new laser-cut, scorchless and sootless playing pieces featuring additional unit types: Japanese truck-mounted anti-tank guns and heavy coastal artillery, Marine flame-throwing Sherman tanks and the entire Guamanian order of battle for World War II.<br/><br/>",

Medina de Rioseco features both a historical and alternative battle that allows players to recreate the engagement as it was fought or to bring in additional Spanish forces available but not present at the battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle over Britain is the first in a game series featuring single plane-vs-plane air combat in WW2.  Play is driven from a standard deck of cards (which you supply), one die, plane ratings (Speed, Agility, Firepower, Performance, Durability), and your skill. Includes 20-page illustrated rules (standard rules, optional rules, solitaire rules, and &quot;roleplay&quot; options for customizing pilot flying abilities), historical scenarios, Battle of Britain (1940) campaign game, and set of 16 airplane counters, Dogfight Display, and Reference Card.  Planes included are Supermarine Spitfire I, Boulton Paul Defiant, Gloster Gladiator, Hawker Hurricane I, Me-109E Emil, Me-110C, and Ju-87 Stuka.  Fast, furious, and fun... Tally Ho!<br/><br/>Each plane is dealt a hand of cards, the number of cards dependant on the plane's speed.   Each turn represents just several seconds of real time.  You play a card from your hand each turn to try and establish &quot;Advantage&quot; over the opponent... the side with Advantage may (depending on the values of the cards played) be able to fire a burst at the enemy.  You will need to consider two main things each turn:  your relative altitude (which is suit dependent), and relative fire position (which is card value dependent).   When you find yourself &quot;disadvantaged&quot; (tailed), you can try to break off.<br/><br/>Plane ratings make a great deal of difference... for example, faster planes have larger hands, those with superior performance are tougher to tail and tougher to shake once they are tailing you, and an agile plane can &quot;yank the stick&quot; more effectively in a pinch.   Firing a burst means you compare the relative fire position cards, roll one die, modify the roll by the plane's firepower modifier, and check the Fire Combat Table to see if you cause any damage (and/or critical hits) to the enemy.  (And watch out for those rear firing gunners.)<br/><br/>If you find yourself damaged or out of ammunition, you can always try and disengage.  When the deck of cards is exhausted, the game is over.  You will quickly be able to &quot;read&quot; each plane's strengths and weaknesses from their ratings.  Superior planes are stronger, of course, but anything can happen, and one false move might see you suddenly dodging bullets rather than dishing them out.<br/><br/>",

The first volume of this series is centered on one of the characters the most known for this epic, colonel Georges Armstrong Custer.<br/><br/>In this game, three game boards represent the historic space of three major fights which delivers this hero of the western conquest to tribes Lakotas, Cheyenne and Arapaho: Washita (in November 27th, 1868), Honsinger Bluff (in August 4th, 1873) and Little Big Horn (in June 26th, 1876). On these maps, 1 cm represents approximately 200 meters and a game turn represent approximately half an hour of time.<br/>The lenght of this game is 10 turns, it is the time which you have to manage  the 7th of cavalry, the famous regiment of Custer, and allow him to fil his mission in spite of Indians warriors which will oppose you vehemently.<br/><br/>You can repel the American Indians who threaten your survival? You will try to replay history, but you can also explore new tracks by following the thread of the numerous proposed hypothetical scenarios. The task is difficult, but glorious. One thing's for sure, trust, it is a good day to win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description of 2008 (print-and-play) 1st Edition:<br/><br/>In the 1920s, United States military planners hatched a scheme for the invasion of Canada. Called War Plan Crimson, it was a subset of War Plan Red, the plan for war with England, the largest, most detailed and most amended of all the U.S. war plans. A war with Great Britain and the British Commonwealth would be a world-wide conflict, easily making the term &ldquo;Second World War&rdquo; appropriate.<br/><br/>Even without the expected aid from Japan, the powerful British navy would threaten U.S. interests in and control of the Philippines, Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, Samoa, Cuba and Puerto Rico as well as the Panama Canal. In exchange for these losses, the U.S. planned to conquer Canada. This would be a crown to Manifest Destiny and a platform to rebuild and eventually regain all that would be lost elsewhere.<br/><br/>Canada would be invaded even if neutral. The Canadian government would be abolished and the conquest held in perpetuity. It would be made clear to Canada she would suffer grievously for resistance. The British peoples were seen as tough adversaries capable of fighting against odds to the finish. Use of poison gas was authorized from the start of hostilities. It would be a terrible war where populations would be on the front lines.<br/><br/>Experience had taught the British the advantage of naval control, and geography provided an inland ocean. The Great Lakes would be a shield of the Canadian Dominion and another sword to cut and bleed the United States of America. A long period of tension during which both sides made military preparations would include building naval forces for the Great Lakes.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is the most unusual game ever published in our popular naval series. While we've created games based on wars that never happened, fought with ships that were never built, in each case military planners thought about these battles and the ships at least reached the planning stage.<br/><br/>In this case, designer Milan Becvar has created a game in which neither the ships nor the plans have a &quot;real world&quot; analogue. That allows for a wide-open strategic situation, in which friendly and enemy bases are so close together that fleets cannot hope to elude one another.<br/><br/>There are 80 &quot;long&quot; ship pieces, using a larger size than usual for our naval games &mdash; both to make it easier to assemble them and because they're just plain cool.  This is further supplemented by 264 square pieces for smaller ships, aircraft, fleet and other markers.  The American and Canadian fleets are almost exclusively composed of &quot;lake battleships,&quot; similar to the coast defense vessels of other navies, with shallow draft and anywhere from four to seven big guns. There are also a handful of cruisers and a large number of destroyers.<br/><br/>The map, by Guy Riessen, covers the Great Lakes basin at the usual 32 miles per &quot;sea&quot; zone. All of the lakes are covered, linked by canals, both those that existed and those that could have been built. Both sides of the lakes are dotted with ports, with the American side hosting many vulnerable industrial centers and the Canadian shores within easy reach of the Dominion's vulnerable east-west lines of communication.<br/><br/>There are 13 scenarios, or separate game situations, included, with many more likely to join them in future Daily Content segments. The game uses the regular Great War at Sea rules, with some special rules to address this unusual situation.<br/><br/>U.S. Navy Plan Crimson is our first print-and-play game: The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor are the maps and rules printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.  The game isn't for sale; it's free to all members of our Gold Club.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "City of Thieves (Tyvenes By) is a semi-casual game for 4 players. It incorporates aspects from both sides of the spectrum - from advanced to easy and family friendly.<br/><br/>You control a gang of thieves in a medieval city. Your thieves are represented with cards, reaching from 1 to 4 in experience. 4 being the best.<br/><br/>The city consists of 4 shops and the kings castle. The butcher, blacksmith, the market and the bank are all available targets to rob each round and hold a fixed amount of gold coins.<br/><br/>The goal is to steal these coins, which all four gangs compete about - or sometimes have to split. The core elements are bluff, strategy and luck, as you put down your theif-cards face down, and mix their experience with dice rolls. The dice are put on top of the cards, showing only the half truth of what you are up against.<br/><br/>In the beginning of each round a &quot;day card&quot; is drawn and read aloud. This will have an effect on the city or a specific shop. The same thing happens at the end of a round with a &quot;night card&quot;. These two random effects often lead to fun combinations.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the underground auction house opens, allowing you to spend your coin on new thieves for your gang.<br/><br/>Ultimately your goal is to grow your gang big enough to steal the kings crown jewels from the castle - in a similar way to how you steal from the city shops.<br/><br/>",

You can also get chips that count towards end game points in the drafting process.  After the draft, the hands are played out acquiring point tiles.  At the end of each round, player with the most tiles/tricks gets bonus points.  Also, you will be carrying over three cards into the next round.<br/><br/>End of the game, more points are gained by being in the top three in the number of tricks, highest total on your three remaining cards and the number of chips gained from drafting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rommel's Obsession is a block game that covers the 1941 battle for Tobruk and the British counterattack known as &quot;Operation Crusader&quot;.  The Axis had besieged Tobruk and were holding the Halfaya Pass into Egypt.  The Allies launched a wide sweeping offensive through the open desert with the goal of relieving Tobruk.  This is a battle with no clearly defined front line.  Historically, British and Axis formations criss-crossed each other in bewildering patterns.<br/><br/>Blocks in this game are mostly regiments and brigades and each turn represents two days time.  Great effort has been made to duplicate the feel and decisions the commanders faced in the battle.  Smart aggressiveness is rewarded.  The Germans have the superior units, but the Commonwealth can more readily replace losses.  Victory is determined not only by possession of territory, but by those casualties.<br/><br/>Why call it Rommel&rsquo;s Obsession?<br/>Tobruk became the focal point of Rommel&rsquo;s attention, both during the time span of this game and the following year.  As historian W.G.F. Jackson describes Rommel&rsquo;s mindset before this battle,<br/><br/>&ldquo;Contemporary evidence suggests that Rommel became more and more obsessed with the problems of attacking Tobruk and refused to accept the possibility of the British forestalling him.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Before the battle began, Italian proclamations that the British were about to attack were dismissed as &ldquo;excessive Latin nervousness.&rdquo;  Indeed, even after the battle began, Rommel refused to believe that it was anything more than a reconnaissance in force.  He only changed his mind when he heard an announcement of the offensive on a British radio broadcast out of Cairo!  It was this mindset that led to some of the unique circumstances of this battle.<br/><br/>",

The game will use the same basic set of rules as the other games* in the series  and also has a few separate rules to account for the time period and way of war in the early 1700's. The map depicts the border area in southern Norway and Sweden, from Trondheim to Gothenburg.<br/><br/>As the Swedish player your goal is to force a Norwegian surrender by capturing Christiania (modern-day Oslo) and at least two major fortresses.

        "description": "&quot;Rules and resources for wargames in the period AD400-AD700.&quot;<br/><br/>The name comes from a line in the Welsh epic Y Gododdin, &quot;He glutted black ravens on the walls of the fort, but he was no Arthur.&quot;<br/><br/>Daniel Mersey, the designer, is a British archaeologist who wanted a set of miniature wargame rules that specifically captured the style of warfare in Dark Ages Britain in the period between the Roman departure and the coming of the Vikings; the age that was dominated by the legendary war-leader Arthur.<br/><br/>The armies represented in the rules are mostly the British kingdoms that arose after the Romans left Britannia. However, there are also the external enemies of these kingdoms: the Irish, the Picts, and the Saxons. There is also an army list for Romans.<br/><br/>Figures are mounted in multiples on stands that represent warbands. Warband types can be Heavy Cavalry (HC), Light Cavalry (LC), Heavy Infantry (HI), and Light Infantry (LI). The warbands are further distinguished by a set of three &quot;characteristics&quot; that play an important role in movement and combat. These characteristics are Formation, Aggression, and Strength and are represented by a numerical value that can fluctuate during the game. Based on warband type and nationality or kingdom, there are set maximums for each of these characteristics. If the value for any one characteristic decreases to zero, the warband is lost.<br/><br/>Players control their armies through Command Points that are determined by a die roll. Using his Command Points, a player can move his warbands or increase their Formation and Aggression values up to the maximum allowed. (The Strength characteristic represents the number of warriors in the warband. Once a Strength point is lost, it stays lost.)<br/><br/>Armies are divided into two distinct categories of warband. The Comitatus represents the personal retinue of the leader, the trained warriors whose only job is to be fighters. The Contingent represents levy troops who are not primarily warriors but can be pressed into service to swell the numbers of an army. The maximum Formation and Aggression values for the Comitatus are higher than those for the Contingent.<br/><br/>When choosing the warbands that make up his army, a player must use all the Comitatus warbands in his army list (there are always five). However, he may choose any number of the Contingent warbands from none to all. The number of warbands in the army is a critical pre-game decision a player must make. The starting values for Formation and Aggression are assigned to the warbands from a pool of 30 Command Points that a player starts with. Even if he chooses only the Comitatus, he will likely be unable to start with his warbands at maximum values and must build them up during the game using his Command Points. This &quot;building up&quot; of the warbands represents the need for a leader to organize and inspire his warriors for them to be at their maximum effectiveness in battle. If a player divides his 30 Command Points between too many warbands, the starting values will be very low and he must spend several turns building up his warbands.<br/><br/>Combat is divided between missile file and melee. Every warband has some kind of missile weapon (javelins, slings, bows). Firing is done by comparing a firing warband's Strength to the target's modified die roll. If the die roll is lower than the firing unit's Strength, some effect is made against the target.<br/><br/>The values that warbands use for melee depends on the nature of contact: warbands that move into combat use their Aggression value, warbands who are stationary when contacted use their Formation value, and warbands that are continuing a melee (no initial contact this turn) use their Strength--the combat has degenerated to a slog bewteen mobs of armed men.<br/><br/>As a result of combat, warbands may Stand, Rally Back, or Retreat in addition to varying losses in Formation, Aggression, and Strength. A very successful warband may actually increase Aggression as a result of combat. Warbands are never eliminated outright in combat unless their losses reduce one of their characteristics to zero. In many cases, a warband has to get hammered for several rounds of melee before it is lost.<br/><br/>Glutter of Ravens is based on the Dark Age Infantry Slog concept that was featured in a volume of Wargames Illustrated magazine. The rules also seem to borrow from the De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA) rules from WRG. However, the nuances in the rules create enough distinction that you get the feel you are not simply playing a version of DBA.<br/><br/>The rules also contain a great deal of background information about the period that include notes about the armies of the era, color plates of warriors of the period, a very good bibliography, and a presentation of the debate, &quot;Arthur: Fact or Fiction?&quot;<br/><br/>",

This deck of playing cards feature more than thirty random elements, even a full set of Werewolf roles! <br/>Every element is explained in detail in the bits page (on dicecards.com) and in the accompanying instructions. The cards are designed so drawing a card from the pack has exactly the same probability distribution as rolling the dice, so the results are always fair.<br/><br/>While you can play many games using the elements on the cards. There are instructions to play 3 unique games exclusive to Dicecards:<br/><br/>Pirate Dice<br/>The aim of the game is to collect the most treasure. To collect treasure you'll need to sail the high seas, avoiding rival pirates, following treasure maps, and finding keys to unlock the treasure chests. Each player takes their turn to collect as much treasure as possible by drawing cards and pressing their luck. When every player has taken their turn, the player with the most treasure wins.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawl<br/>A &quot;dungeon crawl&quot; themed timed game using several elements on the cards.<br/>Dungeon Crawl can be played solo, or competitively among any number of players. When played with multiple players, each player plays on their own, in turn, and the highest scoring player wins. Players choose a Brawler, Archer or Mage and this determines what elements they use from the cards in order to defeat 'monsters' and score points.<br/><br/>DiceCards Mini-RPG<br/>Thee Dicecards RPG is a generic action resolution and character development system for tabletop role-playing games. The different elements on the cards are used for conflict resolution.<br/>The game is split into scenes, which are continuous chunks of action, separated by times when the characters can take a break and recuperate. During a scene, a player may play one of her character&rsquo;s cards to carry out some action in the game. When playing a card, the character declares which attribute the card is being played for. Once a card is played, it cannot be played again for the remainder of the<br/>scene. It also has rules for character development.<br/><br/>There are many other games that can be played with the cards, including: Werewolf, Cities of the World, Craps, Dreidel, Slots (Fruit Machine), Dominoes, Word Maker etc<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grab Your Goat! is a board game for 2 to 4 players and takes an average of 30 to 45 minutes to play &ndash; your rascally goats depending! Play as one of four goatherds whose prized goat has escaped atop the nearby mountain. The paths are constantly shifting and the mountain full of pitfalls and perils, preventing you from quickly bringing your beloved goat home. Using your wits, and a bit of luck, you may just be the first to win bra-a-a-aging rights over your fellow shepherds!<br/><br/>To begin, each player should choose their house. Place the 'Top of the Mountain' card in the center of the play area. Create the game deck by shuffling together the directional and effect cards. Building outwards from the 'Top of the Mountain', deal a 7x7 grid from the game deck with the cards dealt face down. Place the houses as the corners of the square grid.<br/><br/>Finally, deal each player 3 cards as their hand. Place all goats on the 'Top of the Mountain'. Place each shepherd on their respective house.<br/><br/>ON EACH TURN:<br/><br/>1) Move your goat<br/><br/>Roll the directional dice. Move your goat in the direction rolled. The 'Top of the Mountain' acts as the game's compass.<br/><br/>2) Your move (choose one of the following)<br/><br/>Option 1: Move your shepherd<br/>Shepherds can only move in the four cardinal directions, following the path formed by face-up cards. If you move onto a face-down card, reveal it and align two arrows to discover the path. If it is an effect card, resolve its effects immediately.<br/><br/>Option 2: Play an advantage card<br/>You may exchange a card in your hand for any face-down card on the board. Play it face-up and keep the face-down card in your hand. If the card played is an effect card, resolve its effects immediately.<br/><br/>Option 3: Rotate your current card<br/>You may rotate your current card by 90 degrees. This can break existing paths and need not form new paths.<br/><br/>MONARCH OF THE MOUNTAIN (Resolving collisions)<br/><br/>If a goat enters an occupied space...<br/>...with another goat, nothing happens. Goats love to hang out together!<br/>...with a shepherd, the goat does not move from its original space. The shepherd is instead moved in the direction rolled (think of it as the goat headbutting the shepherd to the adjacent square).<br/><br/>If a shepherd moves into a space with...<br/>...a goat that is their goat, you win if the occupied card isn't an effect card that will cause you to lose your footing.<br/>...a goat that is not their goat, throw that goat onto an adjacent card of the shepherd's choice.<br/>...another shepherd, throw that shepherd onto an adjacent square of their choosing.<br/><br/><br/>    The entering shepherd always throws the occupying player or goat.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when a shepherd has caught his/ her accompanying goat!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

There are 3 gameplay variants in one set: Original Play, Bluff, and Boba the Builder. Choose a variant to suit your cravings, just like your boba orders!<br/><br/>In Original Play, match the ingredients to the ones shown on the drink card to fulfil drink orders, then draw reward cards after you&rsquo;ve completed them. Deftly dodge your competitors&rsquo; sabotage tactics, and be the first to earn 11 points worth of drinks.<br/><br/>In Bluff, think of it as Original Play, with a twist! Inspired by a wrong order, how do you know if the ingredients used to make a drink are correct? No one knows until someone gets called out. Will the temptation of a yummy reward risk a game of lies and a ruined reputation? The first to complete 5 drinks will end the game, but the one with the highest points will win.<br/><br/>In Boba the Builder, manage and build your inventory to fulfil the market demand for boba!

Since the game is heavily player vs player, it requires both Pioneers and Bandits in similar numbers. A single Round consists of the Pioneer turns (rotating player order) and then Bandit Gang's turn (any order). Either the Bandit Gang team or the Pioneer with the highest Reputation at the end of 25 Rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>For Pioneers, Reputation is mostly earned by doing a job (Panning or Mining for Gold, Herding Livestock, Trapping for Furs). For Bandits, Reputation is primarily gained by robbing the Pioneers. Additional cash and Reputation can be earned by robbing the Train, Saloon, and Bank or by performing a Jailbreak. Cash allows you to load up with Weapons, Items, and Pets. Power Cards that grant extra abilities, upgrades, and utility bonuses can be collected around the map at the Indian Village, Saloon, and Ghost Town.<br/><br/>Pioneers move using Movement Cards and can also ride the Train that travels around the map every Round. Bandits move either by using Movement Cards or Ambush Cards. Ambush Cards allow a Bandit to secretly hide on a space on the board. Battling is primarily dice-based, but also includes Power Cards and character abilities.<br/><br/>",

They have brought with them some of their advanced technology, instructing the humans to make use of it in order to evacuate the Earth which, according to the aliens, will become uninhabitable in approximately 100 years. Aided by the scientists at the Institute, the aliens unlock G.O.D.O.S., an AI they have brought with them from their galaxy. They claim G.O.D.O.S. will help all of humanity... but the aliens seem to have a personal mission linked to G.O.D.O.S. as well; one which they haven&rsquo;t revealed to anyone else. On the 27th of August, G.O.D.O.S. is activated.<br/><br/>A council is formed and, with the help of the aliens, they begin work on Project KARR. The goal is to build at least five ships that are not only capable of carrying about 1 billion people each, but can keep them alive for hundreds of years. The KARR also serve as colonization units. The news of the aliens and of Project KARR is shared, bit by bit, with the humans, and by 2067, the ships are ready to launch.<br/><br/>In 2068, the ships leave earth, leaving behind all those who refuse to go.<br/><br/>Each ship heads towards a different point in space in the hopes of finding a suitable planet to serve as a new home. They cannot go to the aliens&rsquo; solar system, since humans can not survive such a long journey or the interstellar travel required to get there. After several years in transit, the KARR-5 ship collides with a huge meteorite and is heavily damaged. Hundreds of thousands of humans die, and many of the ship&rsquo;s sectors are damaged beyond repair.<br/><br/>In his desperation, a certain human decides to take matters into his own hands. Owning the only copy of G.O.D.O.S., a man named Deacon Padjin, the Prime Commander of the KARR-5, uploads G.O.D.O.S. to the KARR-5 ship&rsquo;s operating systems. G.O.D.O.S. takes over the entire ship!<br/><br/>With the help of G.O.D.O.S., the ship is saved. Humans learn how to resurrect the dead by placing the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; of deceased individuals into androids. The newly-resurrected individuals, known as the Resurrected, remain ignorant of their death and subsequent resurrection. This technology becomes so advanced over the years, that it is almost impossible for someone to tell if they&rsquo;re human or a Resurrected. The KARR-5&rsquo;s population begins growing back to its original size.<br/><br/>G.O.D.O.S. secretly develops a semi-functional time-machine, but after extensive testing, the results are grim: it can only send people to the past, but it can&rsquo;t bring them back, and it cannot send anyone into the future. G.O.D.O.S.<br/><br/>A few years pass; the KARR-5 is still stationary. Deacon Padjin, who is still deeply involved with the time-travel project, develops a module that allows time-travel to the future. After managing to remove G.O.D.O.S. from the ship's systems, he uses the time-machine to escape to the past, safely, taking the AI and some other people back with him.<br/><br/>The remaining leaders of the KARR-5 assess the situation and, after 10 years of testing and many different iterations, manage to partially replicate the time-machine.  Having done so, about ten years later, they send a group of KarrSEC agents after Deacon and G.O.D.O.O.S. armed with a state-of-the-art tracking device, capable of following someone through time.  As there have been no changes to their timeline, it is a widely-believed hypothesis that Deacon succumbed to an untimely death, either during the jump or as a result of it.  However, the KARR-5 Council, and the KarrSEC, want to ensure that G.O.D.O.S. be dismantled so that it can&rsquo;t make any modifications to the timeline, thus changing the course of History forever.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the CeDI engage in secret meetings with some of the scientists from the Institute, informing them that the loss of G.O.D.O.S. will most likely have disastrous consequences. The CeDI finally reveal their true intentions: they need G.O.D.O.S. to break through a time bubble that has been placed around their planet in which an intergalactic battle is being fought. Without G.O.D.O.S., the CeDI will likely lose the battle, which could easily spread to other parts of the galaxy, a threat that none but the CeDI is prepared to face.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Two campaign games allow the battles of the 16th and 18th to be played together, as well as a grand campaign that combines all four battles.<br/><br/>While there are multiple scenarios presented in the game, each with its own special rules and conditions for victory, most battles are won by inflicting nine demoralizations on an opponent&rsquo;s army, before they do the same to you. Combat is a back and forth affair, using specially designed decks of playing cards. Combat is simple, fast and straightforward, but has a number of subtle wrinkles that you&rsquo;ll discover during play.

        "description": "A new land has emerged from the ashes of the old empire. Factions have risen to compete for the throne. Can you be the first to lay claim to the island of Ibyron?<br/><br/>Develop your land from farm to city and be the first to build your civilization from the resources the island of Ibyron offers... Come, discover a new world...!<br/><br/>Ibyron: Island of Discovery is a two-tiered worker placement game wherein players all work the land of a newly-discovered island to build their city the biggest before the other players. Using resource gathering, building construction, exploration and movement mechanisms for the Wilderness Phase, supported by an additive Worker Placement mechanism during the Village Phase, each player will design their own city; each building adding to options in game play.<br/><br/>Each player will start out in the Wilderness phase each round. Actions will consist of using workers tokens on the island tiles, some actions requiring 1 or more workers to be used to perform that action. Players will continue in the Wilderness phase until they run out workers to perform said actions. But if a player finishes their wilderness actions before others, they don't just sit around; they head into the Village phase and may get better placements for their workers on the Village board.<br/><br/>In the Village phase the players will use the same workers that worked for them in the Wilderness phase in this phase as well, but will instead perform money-making, shipbuilding, hiring horses, taxing, and farming actions. Each space in the village requires 1 more worker for each additional use, no matter the player. After the workers are again spent, they go into the rest box to wait to be paid to work again in the following round, in cash or food.<br/><br/>Each building that is constructed will require permanent residence i.e. worker tokens will be used as the building itself. Using worker tokens as buildings will cut down on a player's supply of workers available in following rounds, so knowing when to construct buildings is an important timing constraint.<br/><br/>There is a race to the end game, but getting there will support many strategies. The first player to build a complete working city (all but 1-3 worker tokens used in buildings), wins.<br/><br/>It was heavily inspired by the Splotter games: Roads &amp; Boats and Antiquity. It was not designed to replace those games, but to deeply entrench you for a good 2 hours. The second edition of the game uses tri-hex tiles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Beyond Humanity: Astrominers&rdquo; is a board game for 2 to 4 players (up to 6 with an expansion) in which players manage competing groups of space miners extracting minerals from the asteroid belt. The challenge comes in planning how to manage your personnel and resources through a variety of missions to extract minerals and outmaneuver the competition. Build the wealth of your Corporation, and fuel financial and material success. Be careful to not be left behind, for to the victor go the spoils.<br/><br/>According to the current scientific knowledge of potential space mining missions, players extract seven resources: Water, Xenon, Plasteel, Tungsten, Nickel, Palladium, and Gold, on three different types of asteroids: S-Type, C-Type, and M-Type.<br/><br/>The game uses a collection of custom six-sided dice (7 for each player) with icons representing four types of workers: miners, automatons, geologists and inspectors.<br/>Workers availability is determined by the dice rolls each round, and a skillful management of those worker dice is necessary for effective resource extraction. Players draw Mission cards to their hand and then perform the Missions by placing the Mission card on the Mining Barge in the Dock and gradually filling its fields with worker dice. Order cards are first drawn to the player hand by placing a die with a geologist icon on the Refinery field, and then redeemed at the end of the round by paying the cost indicated on it to receive the victory points marked on the card. In addition, the game features a resource exchange, an Achievement set collection and a set of Executive Cards, providing more possible actions and ways to victory.<br/>Orders, Missions, Achievements, and gathered resources are the means to collect Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

(To get full use out of this expansion, the Hippos & Crocodiles: Buffalos expansion for H&amp;C is recommended.)<br/><br/>Each game board in Pool, Lagoon and Trunks provides a differently-shaped playing area with its own challenges for players. The additional hippo and crocodile pieces allow for two-player games on the entire game board in the original Hippos &amp; Crocodiles or the larger game board included in the Buffalos expansion (which is otherwise meant for use by three players).<br/><br/>When using the larger playing areas (or the smaller ones if you're feeling masochistic), players can choose to place 1-4 tree trunks on the playing area prior to the start of play. These trunks act as obstacles during play, and no piece can be placed on top of them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hitler Strikes North is a remake and facelift of a classic game from the 1980's by Quarterdeck Games, and licensed to Hobby Japan. Many of the changes from the original reflect research I have conducted since the original game design and are reflected from our co-authored book Hitler Strikes North. Errors have also been corrected. The game map shows portions of the North and Norwegian Seas.<br/><br/>In April, 1940 World War II was locked in a &quot;Sitzkrieg&quot; - a phony war. There were naval activities and limited air operations, but the Allied Armies faced Germany on her border where little was going on beyond training and planning. Attention was drawn north to Norway because of vital Swedish high-grade iron ore resources feeding both side's weapons industry through the ice-free port of Narvik and brought further into focus with the Russo-Finnish &quot;Winter War&quot; that had just concluded. Great Britain, with ally France, had a preponderance of ships and naval support, even if the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) was more modern. Britain was on the defensive, though she had advanced plans for invading Norway to cut off the supply of iron ore going to Germany. But the British did not know when or with what that the Germans might try to break raiding warships out into the Atlantic to attack her vital convoy routes, or marshal an attempt to overwhelm a tragically weak and under armed Norway.<br/><br/>Hitler Strikes North allows you to explore the various possibilities of this highly charged strategic situation.<br/>Can you break through the vaunted Royal Navy to unleash your raiders?<br/>Can you successfully use all the elements of modern war - air, sea, and land to swiftly subjugate an entire nation in the world's first modern &quot;Joint&quot; operations?<br/>Can you, as the Allies, respond to the German thrust with your forces to stop the German objectives?<br/>Hitler Strikes North not only has these historical scenarios but also includes optional and hypothetical units, including the Danish navy, that allow you to play alternative plans and operations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Ziplock Contents:<br/>1 24-page rulebook (pages not numbered); There is a single line of errata on the inside back cover at the bottom left by the way.<br/>1 Player Aid Card #1, PAC #1, Weather Levels, Weather Table and Turn Record Chart<br/>2 Player Aid Card #2, PAC #2, Gunnery Table (two-sided)<br/>2 Player Aid Card #3, PAC #3, Tables for Torpedo Attack, Critical Flotation, Bombing and various other tables (two-sided)<br/>1 Player Aid Card #3A, PAC #3A, Contact Table, Evasion Table and Norwegian &amp; Danish Entry Table (single-sided); also printed on back of rulebook<br/>1 Player Aid Card #4, PAC #4, German Goal Determination Table and Sequence of Play (two-sided on lighter stock)<br/>1 Player Aid Card #5, PAC #5, Historical Set Up For The Game (actually 2 two-sided cards on lighter stock)<br/>2 Allied Ship Logs sheets, two-sided<br/>2 German Ship Logs sheets, two-sided<br/>1 Countersheet, two-sided, unpunched containing 216 counters (no blanks) in crystalline sleeve<br/>2 Game maps, identical<br/>1 Ziplock bag, thick<br/><br/>",

The deck of battle cards features Action and Upgrade cards to enhance Transformers character cards.<br/><br/>Transformers TCG: Rise of the Combiners features the debut of combiners &mdash; character cards that combine to create a single giant robot! This expansion contains six combiner groups, including Predaking. Characters combine using new &quot;Enigma&quot; cards and by having all parts of the combiner in bot mode on the battlefield or in the KO area. Each section of the combiner may have an upgrade, and all damage from each section carries over to the new combiner bot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Box:<br/><br/>Land of the Free is a simulation of the political turmoil in America during the period of the Great Depression, 1930-1941. The economic devastation caused by the financial irresponsibility of the Roaring Twenties created massive job losses, business failures, and a crisis of confidence in the political institutions of the day, including democracy itself. Many people sought a solution to their problems through simplistic &lsquo;set the world right in ten lessons&rsquo; schemes such as the Technocracy or Social Credit movements, but others put their trust in radical political movements of the far left and right such as the German-American Bund organization, the Wobblies, and the Communist Party. Still others learned the value of simple corruption and demagoguery, as Governor Huey Long did in Louisiana.<br/><br/>&ldquo;In the game, two or three players represent extremist political organizations trying to gain power through covert means, at regional and (when they are strong enough) at Federal level. A process of patient organization and propaganda will result in an accumulation of influence, which will translate into power, which has its own rewards. It is also possible to try and muscle one&rsquo;s way into power by intimidation and strong-arm tactics.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Historically, this game lies somewhere between realism and fantasy.  Players try to build committees and fronts, gain control of the local police, aim to gain political control of the states, and eventually influence the national elections for President.  Along the way there are mobs, vote-rigging, and assassinations &ndash; Maybe Upton Sinclair will be elected governor of California this time . . .<br/><br/>The game comes with 280 counters and an 11&rdquo;x17&rdquo; map of the continental United States divided into 20 regions (combinations of individual states in to regions with names like &ldquo;Minneconsin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kennesee&rdquo;.)<br/><br/>",

It opens many doors to ingenious and practical methods of doing battle with model soldiers, raising the pastime in some sense almost to the level of chess.<br/><br/>Microbadge:<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From website:<br/><br/>ZynVaded!&trade; is a tabletop miniatures game unlike any you&rsquo;ve likely seen before, because you literally fight battles on a table top (or desktop, or counter-top, etc.)! In it, you assume the role of one faction of the Zyn, an inch-high, insectile alien race determined to <br/>conquer our planet, one cluttered surface at a time!  You can choose to play as either the Kyll&rsquo;al, the militant arm of the alien invasion, or the Sav&rsquo;m, the  rebellious faction looking to halt the invasion.<br/><br/>Players control small teams of 28mm miniature aliens, usually 3 or so figures per side, one Leader, one Support and one Scout or Assassin. These figures represent the alien factions fighting to either get a foothold on Earth or to stop the invasion.  Since these figures represent inch high aliens the battle field can be your desktop, itchen table, or any suitable surface, using what ever happens to be there as terain to give your figures cover as as they battle.<br/><br/>Figures are given stats such as Speed, Melee Combat, Ranged Combat and Body Points (hit points) and can have special abilities.  Combat is D10 based and rules allow close combat and ranged combat.  Players roll against each other for initiatie each turn.  The winner gets to use each figures action points to perform move or combat actions.  Once done the next player does the same.<br/><br/>Playsheets are included.  Players use these to track the status of their figures, one per sheet.<br/><br/>There are simple campaign rules allowing figures to gain special abilities or improve their stats over a course of several games.<br/><br/>Play is scenario based and each side is given objectives, the winner is the side to first complete their objectives or alternately the last side standing.  Scenarios can be found on the publiher's web forum.<br/><br/>The game comes with six figures, two Stat Card sheets (which may be copied and should also be available on the publisher's website), two pencils, two 10-sided dice, one measuring tape and the rules.<br/><br/>",

In this battle Ottoman forces advanced northwards, towards the present day Bulgarian-Romanian frontier. Russian infantry and cannons were able to stall the polyglot Ottoman army, and although they managed to eke out a marginal victory their commander, General Kutuzov, chose to yield the key town of Rousse to the Ottomans, convincing them they had won a great victory. The Czar was not pleased.<br/><br/>Slobozia 20 focuses on the latter battle of 2 October 1811. In this engagement Kutuzov conducted a surprise march which cut off and surrounded the bulk of the Ottoman army, trapping it on the northern (Bulgarian) shore of the Danube. The result was a decisive Russian victory that permitted negotiations to end the war. This had the dual advantage of allowing Russia to transfer key reserves to oppose Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of Russia in 1812, and also prevented Austria from contributing more forces to support the French invasion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "2040: An American Insurgency simulates a US civil war in the 21st century. In this 2-player, 3-hour game, the blue team is the Federals, agents of the government in Washington. The red team is the Rebels, militia groups trying to seize control of states, highways, and cities. The conflict spreads across the entire continental US, from Miami to Seattle and from Los Angeles to New York.<br/><br/>Two scenarios are presented. One depicts a rebellion that emerges from rural areas in the Midwest and South. The other puts the rebellion in urban areas along the coasts. As such, the game is open to multiple interpretations of future politics in the US. The game was designed not to make political statements of one kind or another, but rather to accurately model counter-insurgency operations in the continental US, regardless of who the rebels happen to be.<br/><br/>Many of the game mechanics are familiar from the existing body counter-insurgency sims. The resources and operations available to the two players are different; the insurgency is depicted as an asymmetric conflict. Gameplay is card-driven, however with events depicting situations that may arise in the US context. For example, if a civil war to occur, the Supreme Court is likely to make rulings that affect the conflict. Therefore, there are SCOTUS cards involving the Second Amendment and the government&rsquo;s ability to make arrests. Other uniquely American features include truck stops as information networks, police brutality events, and the sports-entertainment complex.<br/><br/>While some of the game&rsquo;s mechanics are familiar, 2040 brings many new mechanics to the table. For example, there is a fully fleshed-out social media system that affects the power of the rebellion. The Rebel player does his recruiting and fundraising through the internet, so that Federal online control measures can dramatically reduce the Rebel&rsquo;s money and troop levels. This net-based conflict adds a third dimension to the insurgency, one that has not been extensively modeled in previous commercially-available simulations.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy feature, unique to the US, is that the suburbs and central cities of an urban area can be at diametrically opposite poles of the revolution. This creates a difficult strategic problem, in that operations that pass between two urban cores must necessarily go through the suburbs of both cities along the way. If those suburbs are enemy-controlled, the transit may be blocked. Forces inside cities can effectively be trapped by hostile suburban forces. Thus, the suburban / urban political conflict in the US has important implications for operational effectiveness.<br/><br/>The game components include a 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map of the continental US, broken down by regions, cities, suburbs, and highways. Wooden pieces represent Militias (red) and Federal Security Agents (blue). Counters are used to indicate the status of a given space, from Order (pro-Federal) to Revolt (pro-Rebel). Each player has a Player Aid that summarizes the possible actions of both players.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>    Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>    Solitaire suitability: 8 out of 10 (similar to games like Twilight Struggle)<br/>    Time scale: Not specified, but approximately one year per turn, covering a 4 to 5 year conflict<br/>    Unit scale: one unit = paramilitary cell<br/>    Players: one to two, best with two<br/>    Playing time: 2-3 hours<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each character is assigned to 1 of the 6 towers at the start of the game. If that tower is destroyed, the character is lost, and the player must continue without that ability.<br/><br/>Players will need those abilities too, since there are now quests that the players must try to survive to win the game. At the start of the game, players choose 1 Standard Quest and 1 Endgame Quest. Until both of those Quests are completed, the pile of Monsters will refill over and over.<br/><br/>Standard Quests include searching for magic scrolls, looking for a cure for a plague of madness, holding off magical stones that cause the Monsters to spawn closer and closer to the Castle, and much more. Once the Standard Quest is achieved, players move on to the Endgame Quest, which they either complete or perish trying. Endgame Quests feature challenges such as collapsing caves to stop the flow of Monsters, racing against time to destroy a cursed obelisk, and placing magical portals to teleport the entire Castle to safety.

Raid Decks are specially designed pre-constructed products used for a cooperative experience. They combine elements from the World of Warcraft (the team-based questing), and Dungeons &amp; Dragons (the Raid Master). One player, the Raid Master controls all monsters and foes, while 3-5 other players control the characters participating in the raid.<br/><br/>A Raid Deck typically contains epic boss cards, decks for the boss characters, tokens to represent minions, custom rules for the raid, and a treasure pack, intended as a reward for players who are victorious in the raid. The treasure pack contains holofoils and sometimes contains a random insertion of a loot card. Upper Deck Entertainment also made treasure packs available from their UDE points store, although the cards in these packs are not holofoil.<br/><br/>",

The game being played with these dominoes should be agreed upon before the game starts (the rules recommend playing &quot;double sixes&quot;), and the scores should be kept track of on a piece of paper.<br/><br/>Whether the result of each card was successful or not, a word from the bottom of the card is written down, and at the end of the game the group tries to come up with a poem using these words.<br/><br/>The end of the game should be agreed upon by all players before starting, or by setting up a house rule to that effect.<br/><br/>",

Experience a dynamic ecosystem where food is scarce and predators lurk. Adapt your species with traits like Fast to evade predators, Nesting to grow your population, or Climbing to reach fruit high in the canopy. Welcome to the beauty of Nature, where every game brings new worlds to explore!<br/><br/>Nature is easy to get to the table.  The modular system means Nature can be tailored to any group.  Do you want a more aggressive environment? Add the Jurassic module to assert your dominance with a huge apex predator. Do you want a less aggressive environment? Add the Flight module where flight brings the freedom to evade predators and fly to a safe haven island to raise your brood.  Are you introducing Nature to casual gamers? Don't add any modules and the game can be taught and played in less than an hour. Each module adds a layer of complexity and 15 - 30 minutes to the game time. At launch, the Nature game system will support 22 unique configurations of modules.<br/><br/>NorthStar will support the Nature game system for the next decade with 1 - 2 modules a year. The Climate module and the Disease module is slated for release in 2026. After the release of Climate and Disease, the Nature game system will have 71 unique configurations to explore. Each new module added to the system will generate an explonentially increasing number of combinations!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Get notified when the Kickstarter goes live:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/northstargames/nature-a-standalone-game-in-the-evolution-series?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/northstargames/nature-a...</a>?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Donald Featherstone is one of the cornerstones of modern miniatures gaming.  His first book was published in 1962 and the last one I've seen was published in 1998, but there may be later ones, too.<br/><br/>This &quot;game&quot; is only a book - no figures, terrain, dice, etc., are provided.  It contains his rules for skirmish miniatures gaming.  In skirmish wargaming, each figure represents one man (or woman or animal).  Consequently, they tend to represent small action warfare.<br/><br/>The book has a chapter of basic rules common to all the scenarios, then provides detailed scenarios (even with an entertainingly written fictional account) and special rules for the following eras:<br/><br/>The Vikings (850 AD)<br/>English Archers in France (1429)<br/>English Civil War cavalry action (1643)<br/>Pirates in the Caribbean (1715)<br/>The Peninsular War (1813, Napoleonic)<br/>The French Foreign Legion in Mexico (1866)<br/>British Colonials vs Zulus (1879)<br/>The Old West (1888, USA)<br/>First World War trench raid (1916)<br/>Street fighting in Cassino (1944)<br/><br/>A typical battle will feature 8-12 men per side.  Team play is possible.<br/><br/>The basic system requires a player to issue orders to his troops, such as seize a certain objective.  It may take a few turns for the troops to get there, and in the meantime, the situation may have changed.  It takes a full turn to issue new orders, during which the troops continue towards the old objective!<br/><br/>Rules are given for movement, ranged combat, melee combat, wound levels, troop quality levels, morale, etc.  A record sheet is needed to keep track of these things (plus orders), but due to the small number of troops, it's not a problem.  Very fun system if you have access to miniatures and terrain.<br/><br/>Microbadge:<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "UNSUNG WORKHORSES<br/><br/>MechWarriors receive all the glory; aerospace fighter pilots a close second; vehicles are considered the workhorses of any military; infantry are even given their day in the sun in the minds of the common citizen. But no battle could be waged, nor won, without the mammoth apparatus of support vehicles that feed the war machines of the Great Houses. From cargo trucks to tank airships, airborne MASH to communication satellites, armored transport rails to coastal patrol boats, hauler exoskeletons to LoaderMechs, even hover and wheeled police cruisers or civilian vehicles conscripted into the military: the support vehicle is the true backbone of any military machine. Built using the construction rules found in Combat Equipment, Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: Vehicle Annex provides a never-before-seen look at the support vehicles behind the militaries of every faction, as well as a slice of every day life in the BattleTech universe. From tracked land-trains to police cruisers, Luxury VTOLs to Fix-wing passenger planes, satellites, super-heavy naval surface ships, IndustrialMechs and more: the gamut of the BattleTech universe, fully illustrated for the first time.<br/><br/>",

Subsequent letters are similarly drawn one at a time. At any time a player may call out a word that can be formed from the available letters. Upon making a word it is placed in the scoring area of the respective player. Additional words can be formed either by using only letters from the pool, or by poaching one or more letters from the pool of an extant word in another player's scoring area. If a player uses another player's word, that word is taken and given to the player forming the new word. When no new words can be made, each player scores the words in their area. A word's score is equal to the number of letters in the word minus one.<br/><br/>",

This printed version was made available as a Kickstarter incentive to supporters of Shenandoah's project.<br/><br/>Game covers the entire area of the conflict, and runs from December 16th through the 28th. Units are generally divisional in scale, with some brigade and regimental units.  Map is divided into areas, regulating movement and combat. Multiple turns during each &quot;day&quot; are performed IGo-UGo, starting with the player having initiative for the day. A single area is activated, and the units within are given the option of moving. A player may also choose to &quot;pass&quot;. Each &quot;day&quot; begins at 0600hrs, with an interesting mechanic of rolling for the amount of elapsed time for each turn, where a turn can be as short as zero minutes to as long as three hours. Each &quot;day&quot; ends when the time record for the day passes 1800hrs (or both players pass). Combat occurs at then end of any turn where units of opposing sides occupy the same area. Combat is done by rolling 10-sided dice for each strengthpoint of either infantry or armor in the combat, with simultaneous losses. Victory is gauged by the accumulation of points for enemy casualties, objective spaces, and Axis across the Meuse/exiting the western map edge, with daily sudden-death victory point levels.<br/><br/>Components consist of an 11' x 17&quot; mounted map, 180 mounted counters/markers, a 12-page rule booklet, terrain effects chart, hours in the day and victory point charts, plastic bags for counter storage, and four ten-sided dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Explore the dangerous ruins of post-apocalyptic Venice to bring back its legendary treasure !<br/><br/>It is the not-so-distant future, and humanity has come close to extinction. Numerous ecological disasters and incessant wars have caused it to regress to almost prehistoric levels. Nature has reclaimed its rights, invading the former world, the remains of which are barely visible under the luxuriant vegetation. Yet, little by little, a new civilization is emerging. And it is sending explorers to the ruins of the old world to try to discover its secrets. One of these cities, which was once Venice, is the focus of much interest. For a long time, it was inaccessible, almost entirely submerged under waters teeming with predators. But a few months ago, the sea level began to drop, revealing an ancient city just waiting to be explored. Several tribes have sent their best trackers to follow rumors of a mythical treasure and numerous artifacts from the past. But the city holds many threats, including a mysterious half-man, half-machine guardian known as the Doge.<br/><br/>In The Last Doge, you play as the champion of one of six tribes living on the outskirts of the city, each with a good reason for wanting to explore the city and find the treasure, the nature of which changes according to their legends. This will not be easy, but you can also be satisfied with bringing back artifacts from ancient times, or simply getting in the way of the other champions...or at least escape with your life !<br/><br/>To win, you must be the player with the most trophies at the end of the game but also survive long enough to escape the wrath of the city's dreadful guardian.<br/><br/>",

The majestic world is a big palace protected by a wall with Heimdall standing as a gatekeeper to the land. In Ragnar&ouml;k, the nine worlds of Yggdrasil collide and people of Midgard, giants of Jotunheim, Dwarves of Svartelfheim, Elves of Alfheim, Odin's riders of War and warriors of Asgard clash in the battle.<br/><br/>Warriors of Asgard is a 40-card deck and an enormous, detailed miniature of Heimdall. The deck adds a brand new type of units, that possess magical powers, shared by &AElig;sir gods with their people. The new type of warriors is supporting other warriors by making it easier to activate them. There are different types of Asgardian warriors, each wielding one kind of weapon. But each of them, when activated, affect other warriors who require the same type of weapons. Some warriors make it easier to activate others, and some just automatically activate a specific type of weapon. So you can imagine the combo possibilities with that expansion. If you build up a team that works well together, you can easily activate much more cards than usual. We've playtested that expansion and we love the way it affects the decision-making in the game!<br/><br/>And the other thing the expansion brings is a Heimdall miniature. There is a rule change, where the losing player gets the Heimdall after the battle. Heimdall protects a player's team for one round, and also may give him/her special powers if he decides to attack. The expansion has special cards in the deck, that affect Heimdalls movement as well as his powers. One expansion brings new, big things that add a lot to the game experience and expand the replayability even more!<br/><br/>--description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

That said, acting doesn't pay the bills (like, ever).<br/><br/>For Zee, the chance to perform his greatest works across the Seven Seas appeared when their troupe was embarked on a voyage to the New World. Their ship came under chase by pirates, who would certainly have taken the hapless merchantman, had not Zee stood upon the taffrail and delivered a glorious ad-hoc discourse on the nobility of all free-thinking peoples in the character of Brutus from Caesar.

        "description": "A modern arms miniatures game that seems to have grown out of the advances made in the BGWWII rules. It includes scenarios for WWI, WWII, Angola, Vietnam, and the Boxer Rebellion. The scale is 1:1 skirmish.<br/><br/>Arc of Fire (AoF) is intended for games employing forces up to company level, with from one squad to three platoons on each side using 10mm-28mm miniatures, often with armor or artillery support. One of the prime design goals of AoF was to find a level of detail that was fun and easy, but still captured the flavor of skirmish gaming. If rifle magazine capacities, tanks&rsquo; power-to-weight ratios, or the quantity of high explosive in particular shells are the type of factors you really want in a game, you should probably not be looking at this book. The basic assumption of AoF is that leadership, training, organization and motivation are more important than minor technological advantages in deciding who wins. By concentrating on these rather than on &lsquo;kit&rsquo;, AoF produces a fast and exciting game that is more realistic than many games that obsess about technical detail.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    The Face of Battle: The Hill Battles – Khe Sanh, Vietnam: 1967<br/><br/><br/>",

Each move taken and resource cards added to or taken from a common pool for any spin are related to the traditional Dreidel game. Movement can be modified by use of desert cards. That movement is round the six points of a star or magen David, and an action is associated with each space on the board.<br/><br/>Each time a player completes a cycle round the board, a plague is turned over which  restricts actions in the game, and the game lasts until all ten plagues-- based on the traditional Jewish view of the plagues described in Shemot or Exodus-- have been played out. During the coarse of the game, players free slaves, but they also have to make matza with which to feed the freed slaves.<br/><br/>The winner is the player at the end of the gave who has the most freed slaves who also have a corresponding matza.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Shortly after the Allies jointly vanquished Nazi terror, the former partners settled into two mutually opposing camps and began a four-decade-long Cold War. At the heart of that protracted struggle lay the fate of the central and eastern European countries &quot;liberated&quot; by the Soviet Union. One of those unfortunate countries, Poland, had been cynically divided between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany via the Molotov&ndash;Ribbentrop Pact, as the opener for World War II. Despite the valor and sacrifice of over 200,000 Poles fighting for the Allies, their interests were betrayed at the Yalta and Potsdam conference, and as a consequence, the Soviet Union ruled Poland through a puppet Socialist government for the next 45 years.<br/><br/>Unlike most other Panzer Grenadier titles, Red &amp; White explores one of the &quot;what ifs&quot; of history; in this case, what if the Poles had been able to return home and set up their own government in the postwar era? Looking at the turbulent history of uprisings in the territories under Soviet rule, perhaps a conflict would have emerged pitting a rearmed Poland, supported again by America and the rest of NATO, against the Red Army. We offer you some more historical background, and 40 scenarios to see if Poland can keep its sovereignty against the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Red &amp; White includes 77 mounted and die-cut Polish playing pieces. The 40 scenarios require the use of the pieces and boards from our Cassino, Elsenborn Ridge, Hammer &amp; Sickle, Patton's Nightmare and Road to Berlin games.<br/><br/>",

In August the Malta garrison was on the ropes, with critical supplies nearly exhausted. Allied forces were in full retreat towards Egypt following their defeat in the Gazala Campaign. The Axis forces realized the Pedestal Convoy could very well be the battle for &quot;all the marbles&quot; and mobilized tremendous air, submarine and surface fleet assets to contest its passage. The Allied convoy was savaged but enough ships made it through, including the tanker Ohio whose ordeal was a true epic of wartime heroism, to enable Malta to hold out.<br/><br/>Can you do better?<br/><br/>",

Plain and simple, they are incredible at soaking damage up.<br/><br/>But their play style is more than just being hit. They excel in late game as they generally have superior numbers left at this point, but their mid-game is also strong due to their knockdowns and board control.<br/><br/>Not the most synergistic in terms of combo play, they do enjoy some degree of team buffing. Brewers generate the most momentum when pushing opponents in to and out of position with buffeting blows and plays.<br/><br/>Relatively slow up and down the field, the Brewers rely on long reach weapons and easy access to pushes and knockdowns, thereby giving them huge board presence and control.<br/><br/>Drinking and Guild Ball have always gone hand-in-hand. Most of the big championship matches will have street vendors selling a range of home brewed poisons to the gullible and the desperate. The Brewer's Guild has elevated the twin arts of drinking and playing far beyond the familiqar stumbling of the Sunday league drunks. Fueled by the pure amber nectar produced and aged within their secret distilleries, a Brewer's team is a maelstrom of physicality, a drunken wrecking ball staggering its way across the pitch.<br/><br/>Using the Brewer's Guild is a lesson in violence and survivability. They can both absorb and deal out a tremendous amount of damage, whilst all the time knocking their opponents to the floor and sticking a tactical boot in.

Each model is simply strong at what it does, and doesn&rsquo;t require assistance to do it. This is a team with little to no buffing.

What they do know is that The Union is a major player and here to stay. On any given day it is impossible to predict the style of play you will be up against. The Union has both the power and the skill to pound you into the ground or dance around you like leaves on the wind.<br/><br/>Variety is the spice of a Union coach's life. Able to call upon the services of a wide range of degenerates, thugs, assassins and ballplayers, you must weigh up the options and make the right choices. The mysterious and deadly Blackheart can often be found in the company of his psychotic, fanatically loyal first mate, Gutter, and frequently employs the deadly blades and footballing talent of the mercurial Decimate.<br/><br/>This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Union.<br/><br/>",

Their fearsome captain, Skatha, commands the pitch with slick footwork and a passing game as unrelenting as winter's howling winds. Opponents had best be wary with the ball against her pack. One misstep and their watchful protector Snow will fetch the ball and pass it to their feral striker, Ulfr. This lone huntsman lives for the rush of an ambush, targeting prey who stand between him and the goal post. To ensure their striker makes the shot, Veteran Hearne lies in wait, ready to ensnare his prey and show them the cruelty of winter. His furs now matted with frost, Hearne proves even the most ardent supporters of the Sun Father can be swayed by the Winter Queen.<br/><br/>",

Only one is chosen during the Setup.<br/><br/>The game is divided in four phases, performed in the following order: Expansion, Intrigue, Coronation, and Assassination. During the Expansion Phase the players place Ally Tiles to create a 6x6 grid. During the Intrigue Phase, the players can swap positions of Ally Tiles to enhance the position of their Allies. In the Coronation Phase the Houses gain points, according to the Objective, and the Ruling House is the House with the most points. Then, in the Assassination Phase, the players votes to eliminate the player who they think owns the Regent House.<br/><br/>The game ends right after the Assassination Phase and the winner is the player that represents the Ruling House, in case the assassination failed; or the player that represents the House with most points among the assassins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each infantry stand represents 360-foot soldiers while each cavalry stand represents 180 mounted troopers. Ground scale is 120 yards to each inch, while all game turns represent 30 minutes of actual time.<br/><br/>This is a &ldquo;Big Battle&rdquo; game where you will command multiple divisions, not battalions. This makes engagements of over 150,000 combatants a playable reality.

Both the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary periods are supported.<br/><br/>&bull; Fully developed from the original Fire &amp; Fury ACW rules with clarifications and updates to produce a completely new stand-alone product.<br/>&bull; Irregulars, skirmishers, massed artillery, national doctrine, while unique Initiative and Reserve Movement phases replicate Army level C2.<br/>&bull; The rules are black and white with full color outside covers, 96 pages long in addition to a two-page tables and charts sheet.

        "description": "&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>&quot;Kiev 1943&quot; is a wargame by Nicolas Stratigos, the third game of the &quot;Storms in the East&quot; VaeVictis jeux d'histoire series.<br/><br/>After the failure of Zitadelle in mid-July 1943, then the loss of Kharkov on 23 August, the German armies surged back on the Dnieper with the Soviet forces at their heels. The Voronezh Front of Vatutin had the mission of charging on Kiev and destroying the 4. Panzerarmee.<br/>On 21 September, the 3rd Guards Tank Army reached the Dnieper and established a bridgehead at Bukrin, near Kanev, soon joined by the 27th and 70th Armies. On 26 September, the Soviets dropped two paratrooper brigades on Kanev. The operation was a disaster. Meanwhile, the 38th Army forced the river at Lyutezh, 20 km north of Kiev.<br/>The Soviets launched another operation from Bukrin mid-October with no result. The Stavka realised the tactical impasse of this bridgehead and decided &ndash; in absolute secrecy &ndash; to transfer Rybalko&rsquo;s 3rd Guards Tank Army into the pocket of Lyutezh.<br/>Vatutin prepared a large-scale attack on Kiev. On 3 November, more than 2000 canons discharged a flood of fire on the units of the VII. and XIII. Korps; the 68th and 88th infantry divisions were impotent against the 38th Army supported by Kravchenko&rsquo;s 5th Guards Tank Corps. Farther north, the 60th Army attacked in the direction of Korosten.<br/>Despite the counter-attacks of the 7. and 8. Panzer and of the 20th Pz.Grenadier, Rybalko&rsquo;s men entered Kiev and completely liberated it on 6 November. Fastov fell on 7 November, and the Soviet troops advanced on the entire Front. Jitomir fell at the hands of the 1st Guards Cavalry Corps on 12 November. The Soviets advanced more than 120 km to the west!<br/>The Germans sent reinforcements from everywhere. The 25. Panzer somehow slowed down the Soviets at Fastov with numerous losses; the 1. SS, the 2. SS and the 1. Pz Divisions blocked the Soviet advance in the south.<br/>On 13 November, Von Manstein launched a counter offensive with the 48. PzKorps toward Jitomir and Brusilov in the southern flank of the Soviet penetration.<br/>As a Soviet, will you be able to liberate Kiev for the anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution ? As a German, will you restore the front of the 4. Panzerarmee ?<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>A game turn represents two days of real time.<br/>One hex covers approximately 6 km.<br/>The units represent divisions, brigades, regiments, KGs, battalions or HQs, with their organic elements.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Un jeu de Nicolas Stratigos dans la collection VaeVictis jeu d'histoire.<br/>&quot;Kiev 1943&quot;, est le 3e volume de la s&eacute;rie &quot;Orage &agrave; l'Est&quot;.<br/><br/>Apr&egrave;s l&rsquo;&eacute;chec de Zitadelle mi-juillet 1943 puis la perte de Kharkov le 23 ao&ucirc;t, les arm&eacute;es allemandes refluent sur le Dniepr, talonn&eacute;es par les forces sovi&eacute;tiques. Le front de Voronezh de Vatutin a pour mission de foncer sur Kiev et d&eacute;truire la 4. Panzerarmee.<br/>Le 21 septembre, la 3e arm&eacute;e de chars de la Garde atteint le Dniepr et &eacute;tablit une t&ecirc;te de pont &agrave; Boukrine, pr&egrave;s de Kanev, bient&ocirc;t rejoint par les 27e et 70e arm&eacute;es. Le 26 septembre, les Sovi&eacute;tiques larguent deux brigades de parachutistes sur Kanev mais l&rsquo;op&eacute;ration tourne au d&eacute;sastre. Pendant ce temps, la 38e arm&eacute;e force le fleuve &agrave; Lyutezh, 20 km au nord de Kiev. Le 30 septembre, Le groupe d&rsquo;arm&eacute;es Sud a enfin franchi le Dniepr. Mi-octobre, les Sovi&eacute;tiques lancent de nouveau une op&eacute;ration &agrave; partir de Boukrine mais sans r&eacute;sultat. Se  rendant compte de l&rsquo;impasse tactique de cette t&ecirc;te de pont, la Stavka d&eacute;cide le transfert &ndash; dans le plus grand secret &ndash; de la 3e arm&eacute;e blind&eacute;e de la Garde de Rybalko dans la poche de Lyutezh.<br/>Vatutin pr&eacute;pare alors une attaque d&rsquo;envergure sur Kiev. Le 3 novembre, plus de 2 000 canons d&eacute;versent un d&eacute;luge de feu sur les unit&eacute;s des VII. et XIII. Korps, Les 68. et 88.

Pz.Grenadier, les hommes de Rybalko entrent dans Kiev et la lib&egrave;re totalement le 6 novembre. Fastov tombe le 7 novembre, les troupes sovi&eacute;tiques avancent sur tout le front. Jitomir tombe aux mains du  1er corps de cavalerie de la Garde le 12 novembre. Les Sovi&eacute;tiques ont alors avanc&eacute; de plus de 120 km &agrave; l&rsquo;ouest ! Les Allemands envoient des renforts de partout. La 25. Panzer ralentit tant bien que mal les Sovi&eacute;tiques &agrave; Fastov avec de nombreuses pertes, les 1. SS, 2. SS et la 1.

Right from the outset, however, the campaign was beset by bad weather, slowing the advance against the Allied forces led by the famously cautious and canny Prince John of Sweden (formerly French Marshal Bernadotte and Napoleon&rsquo;s brother-in-law).<br/><br/>Many &ldquo;what ifs?&rdquo; are explored in this game, as so much of war&rsquo;s friction occurred during this campaign. Grossbeeren 20 features only modest complexity and a focused scope employing low unit density on the map (20 pieces or less) and dramatic, fast playing turns. It is the addition of &lsquo;story-driven&rsquo; random event cards and night game turns that provide the operational pauses and &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; that give players a great feel for the parry-and-thrust of a Napoleonic grand battle as the armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/>Complexity: 4.5 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 corps, each hex is about 800 meters, and each turn is roughly 3 daylight hours (or 10 night hours).<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>&bull; One 8-page, color instructions booklet, with Standard and Optional rules included<br/>&bull; One sheet of Exclusive rules.<br/>&bull; 32 color, die-cut 5/8&rdquo; mounted game pieces<br/>&bull; 12 random event cards<br/>&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map<br/>&bull; Two color player aid sheets<br/>&bull; Polybag packaging and component storage<br/><br/>",

Units can be used to defend a player's castle, attack other players, or complete specific goals to earn victory points.<br/><br/>Victory points are acquired by accomplishing goals to better your kingdom. You can choose to take control of the center of board, prove you can keep your civilians safe during times of war, build immaculate parks, or even fulfill the quest for the Holy Grail, there are many strategies you can pursue to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Every player has a leader who helps them in a unique way. Leader drafting happens at the beginning of the game, starting with the player who goes last and ending with the first player. There are 10 unique leaders including one that gives you extra turns throughout the game, one that lets you buy &quot;blindly&quot; off the top of a deck, and one that lets you increase the maximum health of your units.<br/><br/>Between the ever-changing market, the unique leaders, and the constant unit interactions, every game of Furtherance is different! And, with the streamlined action system and rules, it takes less than 15 minutes to learn and 30 minutes per player to play.<br/><br/>Furtherance can also be played in solo mode. In solo mode, the lone player must defend their castle from ever growing armies in an attempt to make their mark on history by acquiring enough victory points to win before they become overwhelmed with enemies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>In June 1967, Israeli forces struck first against the Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian forces massing on their borders for a final invasion of the Jewish state. For six days, battle raged along all fronts with the Israelis inflicting massive defeats on their Arab foes before the United Nations brokered a cease-fire agreement.<br/><br/>1967: Sword of Israel is a military history board game based on the battles of the 1967 Six-Day War, in which Israel held off and then defeated the combined armies of Egypt, Syria, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organization. There are fifty scenarios, portraying each of the important battles that took place in this war that set the course of modern history.<br/><br/>The game system is based on the very popular Panzer Grenadier system, and will be instantly familiar to anyone who&rsquo;s played any of the games in that series. Units represent platoons of tanks and infantry, batteries of artillery and anti-tank or anti-aircraft guns, and flights of three to five helicopters or aircraft. Designer John Stafford has provided fifty scenarios from the Six Day War. There are eight new maps by Guy Riessen, and 909 playing pieces.<br/><br/>",

If you can manage to do this without a specific number of the locations (see Phase 4: Siege Loss below) being overrun by the Siege Force or without losing all your Spirit you win.<br/><br/>Each turn (4 per round) has 4 phases:<br/><br/>1.

If an &lsquo;or&rsquo; location, choose location with fewest markers<br/><br/>2. Movement - Move your marker 1 to 3 locations in clockwise order around city [or use passageway if doubles rolled during previous Phase 3: attack]<br/><br/>3. Attack - Roll attack dice, add modifiers, and compare to siege force attack strength + a/s bonus. spells may be used this phase<br/><br/>You lose [you &lt; baron]:  consult spirit loss table<br/>You win [you &ge; baron]: consult siege force loss table<br/><br/>One special action may be used in phases 1, 2 or 3<br/><br/>4.

All you have to do is make one movie a year, simple right?  By the end of the contract, only the director with the most of the prestigious Oskie awards will get an extension, so watch out for your competition.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s a Wrap is played over four rounds, each one represented the cycle of a movie&rsquo;s production.  As directors, the players build the movie from scratch, first choosing a genre after seeing the list of actors and scripts available for purchase.  Each genre, actor, and script have different values that reflect their ability to make money and win awards, with some cards being more specialized in either field.  After players choose their genres, they purchase scripts and hire actors via bidding.  Before any movies can be released, they have to go through a bit of studio meddling; each player plays a card that may help their movie or hinder others&rsquo;.  If a certain movie is a passion project, a player may elect to keep their film from being meddled with once per game.  After movies are shot and finished, they go to market, where each movie makes some amount of profit.  However, the season isn&rsquo;t over until the Oskies are awarded.  The highest box office film takes home the Audience Choice award, and the more artistically inclined ones can vie for three different awards, including for screenplay, performance, and director.  Each director will go through this cycle four times, making a different film each time, and progressively getting access to more impressive genres, higher quality scripts, and A-List actors.  At the end of the game, the director with the most Oskies wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Despite it's 'English' sounding name, you &amp; your opponent are vying for control of the 'Emerald Isle' in this fast paced, futuristic contest.<br/><br/>The components for this game consist of the following: a Colorful Gameboard; a set of RULES(4-Pages); 2-Sets of plastic Miniatures(including Jets, Helicopters, Tanks, Hover-Tanks, Hover-Craft, Mobile-Rocket-Launchers, Mobile-Helo-Base, &amp; Mech-Infantry); plastic 'chips'; 6-sided DICE; a Set of printed cardboard 'chits'; and 2-Sets of 'Casualty Cards'-one for each player.<br/><br/>You might be pleasantly surprised at how relatively easy this game proceeds and there are bound to be comparisons made between it and others. This game stands on it's OWN merits for it's unique individuality, while providing a quick game on an otherwise 'touchy' subject. Each game will be different, since only after 'Set-up', THEN it will be determined which of the Players is going to begin the game! The 'Sequence of Play' is as follows: 1.Jet Combat-a)Air Superiority, or b)Bombing; 2.Movement; 3.Resolve Combat; 4.Collect Counters; 5.Purchase &amp; place 'Chips'. Those folks with a limited group of 'gamers' available will be especially pleased with this, since it is designed for just 2-Players.  <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "'The area that the Odyssey&sup2; may be best remembered for was its pioneering fusion of board and video games: The Master Strategy Series. The first game released was The Quest for the Rings!, with gameplay somewhat similar to Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and a storyline reminiscent of J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings'. (from Wikipedia).<br/><br/>Without explicitly mentioning names, this game presents itself as a playable sequel to the 'The Lord of the Rings'.<br/><br/>This semi-cooperative game is a 'DVD' type board game (but done before invention of the DVD). The game is played on a game board, but battles are resolved using the Magnavox Odyssey&sup2; video game console.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, one player is determined to be the evil Ringmaster player: that player sets up the game board by strategically hiding the 10 'Ring' tokens under the (four secret types of) Castles, accompanying some of them with 'Nightmare' or 'Dragon' tokens.<br/><br/>The game board is used to track the locations of the 10 hidden Rings, the castle types (dungeon, crystal cavern, shifting hall, or infernal inferno), and the monsters. Dragons, once revealed, can be moved to adjacent unoccupied castles by the Ringmaster. Movement on the board is point to point (city to city, or port to port).<br/><br/>The (cooperating) hero players have a set number of turns (tracked via a token on the game board) to recover the 10 Rings of power; if they cannot, the Ringmaster wins.<br/><br/>At the start of a battle, buttons are pushed corresponding to the state of the tokens on the game board: this programs a configuration (location and enemies) for each battle. The players have to choose which characters to use (max of two: wizard, warrior, phantom, or changeling) to enter each battle. The Ringmaster can spend from a limited supply of 'Possession' tokens to take over a character for a battle.<br/><br/>In the two player version, one of the players plays both the Ringmaster and a hero, and has a modified rule-set for his allowed behaviors.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Rulebook (full color)<br/>Game board (laminated hardboard)<br/>23 'Castle' tokens (raised-plastic): printed on underside as 4 types: Dungeons, Crystal Caverns, Infernoes, Shifting Halls - there is room under each Castle for two stacked metal tokens.<br/>17 round tokens (raised-metal !): 3 Dragon, 3 Nightmare, 10 Rings, 1 Quest<br/>1 rectangular 'Hourglass' token (plasticard?)<br/>8 rectangular 'Possessions' tokens (plasticard?)<br/>1 Keyboard Overlay (laminated)<br/>1 Magnavox Odyssey&sup2; game cartridge<br/><br/>",

        "description": "2016 marked the 140th anniversary of the Little Bighorn Campaign. This struggle has been depicted in numerous conflict simulation games; it is certainly one of the most fascinating subjects in the wargame hobby. One-Minute Little Bighorn is a microgame attempting to portray the battle with a small map and a limited number of counters.<br/><br/>One-Minute Little Bighorn is a solitaire challenge. The entire battle can be fought in a minute or two. However, the game offers a player most of the tactical choices available to Custer in 1876.<br/><br/>The player represents the commander of the 7th Cavalry and army units represent battalions containing several companies. Tribal warriors like Crazy Horse are included in the groups of Native American fighting men swarming out of the village to block the advance of the cavalry. Historical factors like the escape of tribal noncombatants and the arrival of Benteen are contained in the rules. Victory is determined by the level of success achieved by Custer... if he survives the battle.<br/><br/>This companion game to the previously released One-Minute Bulge is a free Print &amp; Play game with a single 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; map, charts, rules, and two dozen playing pieces or markers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Squarriors: The Card Game is a tabletop game based off of the comic book series, Squarriors. In Squarriors TCG, there is no deck of cards to draw from, instead all cards start either in play or in your hand.<br/><br/>Your &quot;deck&quot; (known as your Tribe in S:TCG) consists of 20 points worth of creatures, three domains to defend (your Council, Army, and Vanguard), and 10 Tactic cards that start in your hand; all of which are chosen by the player.<br/><br/>At any given time, each of your creatures are on the battlefield in one of your three domains, and each of these domains have a power variable that will be modified as the game progresses. If a domain reaches zero power it is destroyed, and creatures there must move to one of the remaining domains controlled by that player. When a player has lost two of their three domains, they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>Each creature has several base statistics: Blood (hit points), Might (damage), Will (various uses), Upkeep (the amount of power required to keep the creature alive), Tribe Value (the numeric value of the creature) and many various abilities, keywords, and game texts. These creatures can take various actions and make different types of attacks (Dominance, Leadership, Stealth, or Manipulation) depending on what domain they are in.<br/><br/>Tactic cards, which start in a player&rsquo;s hand, serve two functions. Initially, they can be used as an action, trap, instant etc. But after they have been played, they serve a second function by being added to your strategy. Each of your three domains can host a strategy chain and each chain adds more layers of abilities and enhancements to your tribe. Each card in a strategy chain can gain new abilities or functions depending on the other cards connecting to them in the chain.<br/><br/>",

Beyond the seas, beyond the woods, and beyond high mountains was a fortress ruled by a stern and powerful king. This stronghold was unbreakable and the king's army was undefeatable.<br/><br/>Every year the king held an event called &quot;The Royal Games&quot; for his noble subjects to train to become highly skilled knights. Beneath this fortress lay a dungeon used to test their wits and strength. These knights faced rigorous obstacles including traps, weaponry, and psychological tactics. Only the most resilient knights prevailed. Whoever was worthy during the treacherous journey earned the rank among the king's elite.<br/><br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>~~~~~~~<br/>In Knights of Glory, you play as one of the king&rsquo;s knights seeking the ultimate goal of becoming a Royal Games victor. Advance through a treacherous dungeon through the art of bluffing. Each player will try to make their way to the exit through deception and deduction. More than one knight may prevail. Exit the dungeon to win the Royal Games and become Elite Knights.<br/><br/><br/>TURN OVERVIEW<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>The most experienced knight will play first. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, with each player taking a series of actions until the game ends.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the first player will take the Rook piece. A game of Knights of Glory is played over several rounds, each consisting of three phases:<br/><br/>Action Phase<br/>Voting Phase<br/>Refreshing Phase<br/><br/><br/>TURN IN DETAILS<br/>~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>ACTION PHASE<br/><br/>1) Pass - Pass your turn to next player in the rotation. This will end your turn.<br/><br/>2) Discard - Discard your Weapon cards face-down up to or equal to the Tier Level  you are currently on. This will end your turn. Example: If you are on Tier 2, you may discard up to 2 cards. All discarded cards will be placed in a pile known as the &ldquo;Discard Pile.&rdquo;<br/><br/>3) Advance - Advance by looking at the Destination card ahead of you. If the card is face-down, reveal it by flipping the card over to see what trap you must overcome. Roll as many Weapon dice as shown on the Dice Indicator  and play a Weapon card or KOG token for each dice. If you were successful after the Voting Phase, you may decide whether to push your luck and perform one of your turn actions again.<br/><br/>VOTING PHASE<br/><br/>Players will vote to determine if your play was the truth or a lie. If you were telling the truth and Players disagree, you will reveal your Weapon Cards and advance as normal but Players that disagree will retreat back to the previous Destination card. If you were bluffing, you will reveal your Weapon Cards and retreat back to the previous Destination card and Players that disagreed will advance to the next Destination card. Players who agree will do nothing. If all Players agree you will not reveal your cards.<br/><br/>REFRESHING<br/><br/>When the last player&rsquo;s turn ends, it is time to start the new round. The player in last place on the Destination Cards is now the first player in the new round and will claim the Rook.Players will keep any remaining cards that they still have. It is time to replenish every player&rsquo;s hand back to 5 cards again.<br/><br/><br/>GAME END<br/>~~~~~~~<br/><br/>There may be more than one winner. When a player successfully arrives to the Exit Path, they are considered the winner, but other players have a chance to win as well and play one final turn. The game continues, starting with the next player in the rotation.<br/><br/>Each time a player successfully advances to the Exit card, the Journey Paths will gradually collapse starting with the Cell, Start, and all of Tier-1 together; and then, when another player wins, Tier-2; and finally, Tier-3. If players are standing on a collapsed Destination card, they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>When all the Tiers collapse or the last player fails to exit, the game then ends, and players that successfully advanced to the Exit card are considered the winners as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>精霊回路ドライヴEXE (Spirit Circuit Drive EXE) (Seirei Kairo Doraibu EXE) is a new professional publication by Hobby Base in Japan of the original doujin game 精霊回路ドライヴ (Seirei Kairo Drive). The development of the base game (its own 3rd edition was in 2016) includes:<br/><br/>     English rules and card list included.<br/>     12 unit cards added.<br/>     1 enemy card added.<br/>     2 boss cards added.<br/><br/><br/>The rules set has been slightly modified and the balance between the cards has been adjusted. A set of rules for a short game have been introduced, and a hard mode included. The artwork is slightly altered and some components are changed.<br/><br/>The publisher says &quot;Spirit Circuit Drive EXE, the publisher edition, is quite different from the doujin editions. Especially, the number of unit cards, the core of the game, greatly increased from 20 to 32, substantially influencing the game play. In addition, English rules and card list are included for overseas players. Spirit Circuit Drive EXE is produced as another game and not another edition. Nonetheless, there are no major differences in the rules, number of players, victory conditions, etc. Also, all doujin editions (including the expansions) are currently out of print. If new expansions are to be released in the future, they are likely to be for the EXE edition.&quot;<br/><br/>NOTE : whilst the game includes English rules, there is still substantive JP text on the cards themselves.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>The players choose unit cards of various spirits to form parties. Each unit card has unique effects and can be played in various combinations.<br/><br/>Holding circuit cards with numbers 0 to 4 and 4 colors as your hands, play the cards with numbers and colors matching those of the cards in the play area. If you have a unit card matching the played card in your party, that unit will attack the enemy.<br/><br/>Thus, play cards to attack and destroy the enemies that appear one after another. You can also gain magical power by card plays and use that power to activate your unit's special ability as well as raise the unit's level to lead the battle advantageously. The enemies' final boss is very powerful. The players need to cooperate and support each other for victory.<br/><br/>プレイヤーは様々な精霊のユニットカードを何枚か選んでパーティーを結成します。<br/>ユニットカードはそれぞれ固有の効果を持っていて、様々な組み合わせで遊べます。<br/><br/>ゲームでは、0～4の数字と４つの色が描かれた回路カードを手札に持ち、場札の数字や色と同じものをプレイします。<br/>プレイしたカードと同じ色のユニットカードが自分のパーティーにいれば、そのユニットが敵に攻撃を行います。<br/><br/>そうやってカードをプレイして、次々と現れる敵に攻撃を行って撃破していきます。 <br/>またカードプレイによって魔力を獲得でき、その魔力を使ってユニットごとの特殊能力を使ったりユニット自身のレベルを上げていくことで戦いを有利に展開できます。<br/>最後に登場する敵ボスキャラクターは非常に強力で、プレイヤー同士で協力・サポートし、力を合わせて勝利を目指してください。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forty Below is a card game where the goal is to score the fewest points, usually tallying the score over multiple fast-playing rounds.<br/><br/>The deck is comprised of eight copies of each number from -1 through 10, and four copies of -10.<br/><br/>In a given round, each player is dealt six face-down cards, which are then arranged in a 3x2 grid.  Two of those cards are turned face-up.  On a player's turn, he or she will do one of three things:<br/><br/>1.  Flip a face-down card so the number shows<br/>2.  Draw the top card from the deck<br/>3.  Draw the top card from the discard pile<br/><br/>If either of the latter two happen, the player will have a choice: discard the just-drawn card, or replace one of his or her six cards with it (a replaced face-down card becomes face-up at that point).<br/><br/>This continues until one player has the numbers of all six cards showing.  Play continues until everyone has an equal number of turns, and then they move on to scoring.<br/><br/>When scoring, if the top and bottom number of the player's grid matches (e.g. both a 7) then the numbers are negated and they become 0.   Alternately, if a player can form a &quot;square&quot; of numbers - both top and bottom match on four consecutive spaces - then the player scores -40 points ---- they just went Forty Below.<br/><br/>",

Getting a solar panel on your roof increases the overall amount of electricity produced and thus increases the frequency. Getting an electric car in contrast consumes more electricity, hence lowering the frequency.<br/><br/>Furthermore, events like unexpected and extreme weather influences how much wind and solar energy is produced and can unbalance the frequency which players need to rebalance through their choices.<br/><br/>Players have secret goals that award victory points at the end of the game and try to win by having most. However, if the frequency is too unbalanced and players fail at rebalancing it, a blackout happens and all players lose immediately. Concluding, players need to cooperate at least a bit to prevent a blackout. Or should you focus on your own personal goals and hope that other players will prevent a blackout?!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!<br/><br/>Whereas Love Letter included only 16 cards, Love Letter: 2nd Edition consists of 38 cards: the original 16 cards, 6 cards included in later editions of Love Letter, and 16 new cards. Players can either swap out original cards for new ones or simply add new cards to the deck for a wilder game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bide is a combinatorial, abstract strategy game for 2-6 players played on a hexagonal or square board which is initially empty (hex-hex base 5 is recommended). Bide was designed by Alek Erickson in May 2020.<br/><br/>Players can skip turns to get extra turns later: <br/>Players take turns placing stones of their color in the hexagonal cells. At the beginning of your turn, you are given a new stone. You can either play it, or &quot;bide&quot; (meaning wait). If you bide, set the stone aside and your turn ends immediately. The stone remains in your hand. If you play the new stone while having at least one stone still in hand, you may &quot;release&quot; (meaning play every stone in your hand in succession). If a player releases, all opponents must immediately release next turn, including their stone for that turn.<br/><br/>Stones create shock waves:<br/>When a stone is placed, it creates a &quot;shock wave&quot;: all adjacent stones move one space in the direction radially outward from the placement. If there are multiple connected stones adjacent to the placed stone, positioned directly in the line of the shock wave, they all move one space. If this movement causes a stone to bump into another stone directly in the line of the shock wave, that stone also gets pushed one space (becoming adjacent along a different grid line does not count). However, stones cannot be pushed past the edges of the board, and lines that are full between the edges and placed stone do not move.<br/><br/>Players get points for owning the center:<br/>When the board is full, players score the position. Each stone is worth points equal to its distance from the nearest edge (starting at zero). Groups consist of connected, adjacent stones of a single color. Groups are worth the sum of their stones. The player with the highest scoring group wins. If tied, remove the outer-most ring of pieces and re-score, repeating this process until there is a winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Blinks with neighbors on opposite sides are &ldquo;locked,&rdquo; as are Blinks that, if removed, would fracture the cluster into more than<br/>2 pieces.<br/>SCORING:<br/>Examples of locked Blinks<br/>               At the end of each turn, the active player earns points for the presence of certain shapes in a singular color.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION:<br/>The first player to score ten or more points is the winner. However, if a player ends their turn with all 6 Blinks set to the same color, they are the winner.<br/><br/>This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Munich War: World War II in Europe 1938 is a two-player game. One player commands the Axis, controlling Germany and the countries aligned with Berlin. The other is the Allied player, who controls the anti-German forces. It is an operational level simulation of a hypothetical World War II in Europe that began in the fall of 1938. The assumption is that the British and French governments did not back down at the September 1938 Munich conference when Hitler demanded the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia and instead went to war with the Third Reich. The ensuing conflict finds the powers partially prepared for war. In Munich War, alliances are determined at the start of the game, representing the wider political-military situation. Each turns represents one week of operations. The game covers the first two months of the war, since beyond that time the onset of winter and logistical shortages would have brought an end to operations. The objective is for each alliance to seize a position from which it can then dominate Europe in the ensuing war. Each hex on the map represents 65 kilometers or 40 miles from side to opposite side. Units are at the corps and army level.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Published in World at War magazine Nr.74 (Oct-Nov 2020)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This first expansion for The Thing adds cards, a 5th &amp; 6th player, new Encounters, specific Blood Testing of other players, and other ways to expand your adventures in Antarctica circa 1982; cards like: &quot;I ain't going with Windows. I ain't going with him,&quot; &quot;And everybody watch whoever you're with - real close,&quot; The Thing on the Ceiling, &quot;If you are all these Things then you just attack me right now. So some of you are still human,&quot; and &quot; This Thing doesn't want to show itself, it wants to hide inside an imitation.&quot; Also, a new mechanism has been added whereby up to 2 Outpost players that have been assimilated, may reveal their alien nature and actively work alongside the original Thing, against the remaining humans.<br/><br/>The 5 and 6-player game plays slightly differently, in that the Thing player does not draw 5 or 6 cards per turn - she draws 3 cards, but has 3 new elements with which to thwart and upset the Outpost players:<br/><br/>Bad Blood: Each turn, during the Blair-saucer phase, one player (chosen by the El Capitan) must put a card from their hand under the Bad Blood card. Failing to do so makes unpleasant things happen....<br/><br/>Thousand Miles to the Coast Like the Blair-saucer, this is a play-area objective, giving the Thing another path to victory. If the players ignore for too long the lone dog's run for the coast, they may very well find that humanity is in deadly peril of being assimilated.<br/><br/>Somebody blew a fuse in the lab: This can be a particularly harrowing encounter for the Outpost players, if they're not ready for it. During this stage of the game, infected-player-Things may have the opportunity to infect another Outpost player, unbeknownst to the others, while the lights are out...<br/><br/>Due to the cost of printing the number of cards required for the base 2-4 player game, it was decided to release the additional player cards as a separate card expansion. Most of the cards can be added straight into the decks for 2-4 player games - with only a handful of cards designed specifically for 5-6 player games.<br/><br/>Please note: This game is strictly for adults - with profanity and horrific imagery on many of the cards.<br/><br/>",

When this was designed, One Day International matches would last for 50 overs to be bowled by both sides. There is a certain hit and hope element when compared to full Test Matches. In 50 overs you don't have time to build an innings. So a player's One Day rating will be very different to a player's Test Match rating. This designer designed games for both codes of cricket.<br/><br/>Play is straightforward. A player metaphorically bowls a ball which has to be checked with dice against his rating, to see the outcome. Then a batsman rolls dice, against his batting ability, to see if he has hit it. Chances of 'Outs' could be decided by a briiliant delivery, or a mis-timed hit or a fantastic bit of fielding.<br/><br/>",

There are even rumors of Sultans who are summoning Djinns to their court hoping to obtain their power to conquer you. You have decided to summon your own Djinns to protect yourself and defeat your foes. The Djinns exist in clans, however, and will seldom work with another clan; they will often actively sabotage the efforts of the other Djinn clans. The only exceptions are the noble Jann Clan, who ally themselves with any of the other Djinn clans. Summon your Djinns for victory, but watch out for their trickery and the cunning of your neighbors.<br/><br/>Object of the Game: The object of the game is to have the highest total points from the cards in your Palace (the play area in front of you) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Turn Order: On a player&rsquo;s turn the player may Summon (play a card) with its associated actions) or Make a Wish (discard 3 cards). At the end of the player&rsquo;s turn he/she draws a card from the Draw Deck.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends when a player begins their turn with 8 or more cards in their Palace. One more round is played and then players calculate their scores. The highest total score is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lockpick is a solo game in which the player attempts to work with randomly-drawn cards to create Rummy-style sets of three in various columns. The theme is one of breaking in to a security system via lockpicking and computer hacking. Designed for the Looney Pyramids family, Lockpick requires a Zark City deck (or other five-suited deck from with values from 1-13), 15 pyramids in five colors, and two dice: a standard D6 and a specialized color die.<br/><br/>In more detail, the card deck is separated into five piles by color with space left below each pile to form a column. Space for a discard pile goes off to the side. Each turn, the player begins with an empty hand and rolls the two dice. The numeral on the D6 determines how many cards the player must draw, and the color die determines what color pile the player must draw from. With these cards in hand, the player must now distribute them among the columns beneath the color piles, using a mancala-style distribution that wraps around and will cause newer cards to cascade down, partially covering previously-placed cards. Any three-card sets that are created within the columns are now removed along with the colored pyramid that sits above that column.<br/><br/>Once a color pile is depeleted, subsequent die rolls of that color allow the player to remove a matching color card from one of the columns and reposition it at the bottom of any column desired, thus allowing for the possibility of sets being created through the joining of two previously unconnected groups of cards within a single column, along with the rare opportunity for two sets to be formed at once. Victory is achieved when a player has successfully defeated all 15 security measures (represented by the 15 pyramids). Defeat occurs when all the cards have been depleted while there are pyramids still standing.<br/><br/>",

Keep taking turns until no player can go. Whoever has the largest orthogonally connected group of marbles wins.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can decide before starting that a player's score will be the product of the sizes of all of their groups.

        "description": "2-6 players battle it out battle royale style in a race to craft the strongest weapon! Players play the role of a warrior that must combine different grips, guards, and blades to create a fantastical weapon!<br/><br/>Game Prep:<br/>Each player has a space in front of them known as the Forge where they place different card types including blades, grips, guards, shields, and gadgets. Each player starts with an Adventurer blade and wooden grip in their Forge. Each player starts with an attack die (starts at d4) and a health die (d20 set to 20). The Armory (draw pile) is shuffled and 6 cards are dealt to each player. A starting player is chosen.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The objective of the game is to be the last player standing after all others have been defeated. The goal as the game progresses is to place grips and guard onto your blade in order to Reforge. This allows you to upgrade your attack die (d4-&gt;d6-&gt;d8-&gt;d10-&gt;d12), giving the benefit of more possible damage and allowing you to use more powerful blades (Forge level requirements are marked on cards).<br/><br/>Attacking is done by selecting a target player and adding up all the attack modifiers (red number) on your blade, grip, and guards. This is your base attack. You then roll your attack die and add it to your base attack to determine the total attack. Subtract your target's defense (blue number) to calculate damage dealt to the target player.<br/><br/>Blocking can be performed if the defending player has at least one part (guard or grip) in play attached to their blade. To block, both players roll their attack die (blade and part modifiers are ignored). If the defending player rolls higher, they take no damage. If the attacking player rolls equal to or higher, the defending player takes the damage they would have AND discards a part of their choice from their Forge.<br/><br/>Shields can be placed on a player's turn. If an attack meets or exceeds the shield's stability (marked in the corner of the card), the shield is discarded and the defending player takes no damage (there is no overflow damage to player). If the attack is less than the shield's stability, the player takes no damage and the shield remains. The stability of the shield is reset after each player's turn (it does not decrease like health).<br/><br/>Turn Flow:<br/>1) Draw a card.<br/>2) Recycle (discard two cards to draw one).<br/>2) Use gadgets (as many as you'd like).<br/>3) Place or replace a part (one per turn).<br/>4) Reforge or attack (you cannot attack if you Reforge).<br/><br/>When a player's health reaches zero, that player is out. The player that dealt the killing blow &quot;loots&quot; the defeated player and takes all cards that were in that player's hand and Forge.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It was part of the northern pincer of the Rzhev-Sychevka Strategic Offensive (Operation Mars). The Soviet objective was to liberate the Russian city of Velikiye Luki and to cut the north-south rail line to the west of the city.<br/><br/>Rather than attacking the town directly, the Soviet forces advanced into the difficult terrain to the north and south of the town. Despite heavy losses, they successfully cut the land links to the city, trapping the garrison. Hitler demanded that all the surrounded formations hold out while relief forces counterattacked to open a route to the encircled units. The garrison held out against repeated and determined Russian assaults. In the meantime, Soviet attempts to take their main objective, the rail lines at Novosokolniki, had been frustrated by the counter-attacks of the relief force. An attempt by the Germans to reach Velikiye Luki in late December ran into stubborn Soviet defense and was halted. The German garrison finally surrendered on January 16th.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player is one of the Arcanis, a powerful mage that is the ruler of its own Realm in Arcania.<br/>As one of them, you'll use powerful spells, command troops, magic creatures and fleets of ships. Everything to win the race to conquer the lost Arcane Towers of the missing Zairon, the Last Maximus Arcani.<br/><br/>The object in Arcania is to conquer a certain number of areas, according to the number of players. Each player play his turn, which is divided in 4 phases:<br/><br/>1. Deploy<br/>2. Movement<br/>3. Battle<br/>4. Dominion<br/><br/>1. Deploy: This is the phase where the active player can summon his units to the board from his supply. To do so, he need to spend power.<br/><br/>2. Movement: Here, the active player can move and use abilities from his unities already in the board. Each unity has a different power, and each Realm has different units.<br/><br/>3. Battle: If the active player moved to an already occupied hex by other player, there will be a battle. Each player sums all unities' strength in that hex and roll a die for additional strength. They compare strength and the loser must discard a unity from that hex. The battle goes on till only one player or none have presence in that hex.<br/><br/>4. Dominance: If the active player fulfilled the object of the game, then he is the winner. Otherwise, he just gain power according to the number of towers he has, and his turn ends and the next player plays.<br/><br/>This go on till someone emerge victorious from the war and claim the position of the Maximus Arcani, the ruler of Arcania!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The shocking defeat of France in 1940 created a unique opportunity for Thailand to regain territory it had lost decades before. When Vichy France refused to give it back, fascist leader Plaek Phibunsongkhram launched a blitzkrieg attack in January 1941. The fighting stopped eighteen days later, and with Japanese mediation, Thailand won back her lost provinces.<br/><br/>This obscure conflict is the subject of designer John Gorkowski&rsquo;s The Lost Provinces. This is a simple, small, and soloable game that can be played in an evening with new wargamers and grognards alike. It often utilizes traditional mechanisms but with twists and nuances that make them fresh again. For example, combat strengths are compared, to arrive at odds ratios, but those ratios are expressed via a die roll modifier rather than a column on a CRT, which results in greater uncertainty about how a given battle might turn out.<br/><br/>The attacking Thai forces use army, artillery, and air power to bear in along three separate thrust lines. The French forces are more concentrated and have the advantage of defending along interior lines. They&rsquo;ll have to know when to retreat and when to make the Thai Player fight for every hex.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Monkeys that reach the opponent's side of the board score points. Knocking opposing monkeys off the board also scores points.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling and exchanging dice in order to bring new monkeys onto the board, move their monkeys, or throw coconuts at opposing monkeys. Monkeys move in one of two ways, either climbing directly up their current bamboo stalk or leaping to the next one while dropping down one or more spaces in the process.<br/><br/>Monkey Duel is a game of positioning and timing. Monkeys positioned higher up the bamboo stalks hold an offensive advantage, but every move requires giving up some altitude. Monkeys can also keep one another safe, so deciding when to stick together and when to make an individual break for it is key to victory.<br/><br/>",

Unbeknownst to them, the reinforced 95th Guards Rifle Division was moving into positions overlooking the village of Krasny Oktabyr. As the Germans moved up from the river&rsquo;s edge, the two forces collided under a summer squall, mutual surprise giving way to ferocious fighting. The Russians charged through the rain into the midst of the German force. Fighting was at point blank range; tanks often shot each other at less than one hundred meters. Both sides lost several vehicles before they each fell back. The Germans aimed themselves at Hill 226.6, which clearly dominated the local landscape. This fight was only the first of several fought this day as the Russians struggled to hold them back...<br/><br/>",

Players alternate turns until none of the towers can move, at which point the game ends.<br/><br/>Players then score each group of their connected towers. To do this, count the number of towers in a player's group, then multiply it by the number of red towers this group touches.

There are multiple strategies to earn victory points and win the game.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/>Retail Edition of Cauldron: Bubble and Boil<br/><br/>1 Rulebook<br/>1 Lore book (with stories by Kickstarter backers)<br/>4 Cauldrons<br/>4 player mats (with diablerie score and turn order guide)<br/>1 Victory Point scoreboard<br/>49 Crone Tokens<br/>32 Green cubes<br/>32 Orange cubes<br/>32 Red cubes<br/>32 Yellow cubes<br/>32 black Corruption discs<br/>2 player markers for 4 players (8 total)<br/>80 cards<br/>10 Advanced Victory Cards<br/><br/>Each card has three types of game information: hex, ingredient and recipe.<br/><br/>The players have a number of choices each turn.  They may chose to cast a hex spell which has various effects (e.g. stealing resources, lowering or raising victory points, etc.).  Casting a hex raises your position on the &quot;Diablerie Track&quot; which yields victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>They may take cards in their hand that produce the same resource and plant them in a garden (minimum 2 cards).  A garden is a set of cards that produce ingredients for brewing recipes at the end of the game.  You may have a maximum of three gardens.  gardens cannot normally have cards added to it once it is planted.  The player takes ingredients from their garden every turn and places it in their cauldron.  These are used at the end of the game to brew recipes.  Additionally, each time a garden is successfully harvested completely (i.e. no resource remaining in a garden)the player receives a Crone Token (each worth 3 points at the end of the game).<br/><br/>The third option a card provides is for a player to play as a recipe card.  Each recipe lists a victory point total and the ingredients required to brew it.  If a player chooses to save a recipe, the player places it face down under the player's cauldron.  no one is allowed to look at recipes once they are placed under a cauldron (this is called &quot;recording a recipe in a cook book&quot;).<br/><br/>Additional information:<br/>Casting a hex requires paying the listed cost.  Often the cost is accepting a black corruption token.  A corruption token is placed in your cauldron and at the end of the game each corruption token destroys one resource of your choice.<br/><br/>The game ends when two resources are depleted or when one player has recorded seven recipes. For a quicker game or longer game, adjust the number of recipes that can be recorded.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Insider Trading, which has been dubbed Pacific Northwest Rails II, focuses on the five major lines that served Spokane and surrounding vicinity.  It is the first Gandy Dancer game featuring the hauling of commodities.<br/><br/>As in the prior two Gandy Dancer releases, players earn money by making runs with their railroads and by buying and selling shares on the stock market. Players take turns investing in railroads and using those railroads to ship goods in this acquisition race.<br/><br/>Insider Trading has the added features of hauling commodities for additional profits, and as its name indicates, manipulating the stock market by using insider knowledge.  But don't get caught up in a scandal or it will cost you dearly.<br/><br/>Players start with a stock portfolio of $100 and some cash (the amount varies depending upon the number of players). In turn, a player may play a movement card, roll a die or pay to move around the gameboard. The space on which a player lands may allow that player to buy and stock in a railroad, use that railroad for shipping, draw and trade commodity cards (sets of which can result in big rewards) and draw insider trading cards (these allow stock manipulation). There are penalty spaces but these can only be landed on because of a die roll.<br/><br/>The game ends when one railroad has hauled one load of each of six commodity groups or when one player goes bankrupt. The player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Here is the description from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:<br/><br/>This six-scenario pack revolves around a single, day-long action, in the heart of bocage country between the American 30th Infantry Division, and the German SS-Panzer Division 2 &quot;Das Reich&quot;. Many of the scenarios are ideal for tournament play. <br/> Scenario #1- The US 2d Battalion 120th Infantry Regiment had rejoined its regiment, ready to head the day&rsquo;s attacks. Despite the threat of German counter-attack, the 2d Battalion slowly advanced towards the village of Quesnel. As the Americans entered the village, they came under machine-gun fire from several unseen locations. Unable to call for artillery or armour support and under increasing fire from the village, the American company commander was about to withdraw... <br/> Scenario #2- A small probing force from SS-Panzer Division 2 &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; struck the US 30th Division&rsquo;s right flank near the village of l&eacute; Desert. The 743d Tank Battalion, which was on the right of the 30th Division, was enticed by a pair of Panzer IVs to advanced down a minor farm road towards a fork. When the 743d's lead tanks were within 200 yards of the fork, the German armour struck...<br/> Scenario #3- The US 30th Division HQ began to receive reports from the 117th Regiment that German infantry, supported by self-propelled assault guns, was attacking the right flank of its 3d Battalion. At the same moment, the 120th reported that Company B, 743d Tank Battalion had just had a brush with German tanks. The engineers of SS-Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 3, &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; supported by the panzers of SS-Panzer Regiment 2, &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; had managed to infiltrated through the bocage undetected... <br/>Scenario #4- The Americans continued their southern advance towards the high ground of Hill 32. The 117th Infantry Regiment reported only light resistance from stragglers, but nothing they could not handle. Then late in the afternoon, the Germans launched a counterattack with elements of SS-Engineer Battalion &ldquo;Das Reich&rdquo; supported by assault guns...<br/><br/>Scenario #5- The US 120th Infantry Regiment's  first objective was Hill 32,  and the initial advance progressed relatively calmly, with the leading platoons meeting little, or no resistance. Then as the 120th approached the forward slope of Hill 32, the German resistance stiffened considerably... <br/> Scenario #6- This scenario joins scenarios 1,3, 4, and 5 together as combined game. By 1000-hrs, the US 2d Battalion, 120th Infantry Regiment began its advance with Company B of the 743d Tank Battalion moving ahead of the infantry. Hill 32 was their first objective in the 120th&rsquo;s zone, and the German resistance began to stiffened considerably with heavy artillery strikes, slowing  the 2d Battalion's advance as it approached the high ground...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The appearance in the sky of the Great Comet (Halley's) foretells much bloodshed; battles will ravage the land when three kings lay claim to the throne of England!<br/><br/>1066: The Year of the Comet is a block wargame covering the crucial campaigning months of 1066, the year Britain was invaded twice, first by the Vikings and later by the Normans!<br/><br/>The map covers all of England proper. The Viking player invades  the eastern shores, while the Normans invade from the south. Favorable winds for one invader means the other must stay in port. Once ashore, invaders are faced with the prospect of fighting pitched battles or a guerrilla style campaign, depending on the English player's response.<br/><br/>This is a strategic level treatment. All of the 1066 campaigning season is represented. As such, the battles of Stamford Bridge and Hastings will not necessarily occur. It is up to the players to determine when, where, and how they fight.<br/><br/>This is a low complexity, three player wargame playable in an hour or two. Contains rules, map, battle board, and 56 blocks in three colors. Rules include invasions, mustering Fyrdmen, pitched battles, skirmishes, routs, etc.<br/><br/>Salient features include: buckets o' dice combat resolution, a battle board, a relatively small number of blocks... and no cards.<br/><br/>This game is provided &quot;as is.&quot; Although the designer has enjoyed many plays of 1066, the game has not been through a blind playtest. In a sense, this is the blind playtest.<br/><br/>Any problems with the game should be noted in the General forum, but the designer makes no guarantee that they will be addressed. Players should feel free to explore patches, and if they find something that works, please mention the fix in the appropriate thread.<br/><br/>",

SS-Panzer Division 1 Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler (LAH) received new orders for the upcoming spring offensive. The objectives of the new offensive were the encirclement of the Soviet infantry divisions standing in front of the 46th Panzer Korps and the destruction of the tank units of the Soviet 1st Tank Army, found facing the German 3rd Panzer Korps.

With the link up, the encirclement of Cherkassy was complete. Inside a 40 by 100 kilometre oval-shaped &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; were some 50,000 German troops of the XI, and the XXXXII Corps. Fearing a repeat of the disaster that befell the Germans at Stalingrad the previous year, Field Marshal Manstein acted quickly, stripping forces from other parts of the front to form a breakthrough force aimed at relieving the two encircled German Corps.<br/><br/>Forces: (Russian) 8x Squads, 3x AFVs; (German) 10x Squads, 5x AFVs; Boards: 5, 47<br/><br/>LSSAH 35 FEDIOKOVKA RUSSIA, 9 February 1944: The Germans launched their attack, to relieve the Cherkassy Pocket, on the morning of February 4. The northern push to relieve the encircled six and a half German divisions inside the pocket was spearheaded by a mighty phalanx of 34 Tigers and 47 Panthers of Schwere Panzer Regiment B&auml;ke. The phalanx&rsquo;s flanks were covered by the 34th and 198th Infantry Divisions on the left, and SS-Panzer Division 1 LAH on the right.

Then again, at 0700-hrs, the Soviets attacked the position in Votylevka from all sides, supported by heavy artillery pieces, tanks, assault guns, and planes. Stretched dangerously thin and lacking any support, SS-Panzer Aufkl&auml;rungs-Abteilung 1 LAH, was once more threatened with annihilation, as the Soviet forces streamed steadily southwards.

The roads consisted of liquid mud deeper than the soldiers&rsquo; boots. While the T34 could slither its way across the waterlogged terrain, few German vehicles could, and hundreds of vehicles had to be blown up and abandoned while their crews squelched westward on foot.

The Soviets immediately launched an attack with their spearheads, stabbing deep into the fragile German line. The crossroad village of Swinne became a fiery cauldron, as its importance in the control of movement was well identified on both German&rsquo;s and the Soviet&rsquo;s maps&hellip;<br/><br/>Forces: (Russian) 17x Squads, 10x AFVs; (German) 10&frac12;x Squads, 1x Gun, 12x AFVs; Boards: 3, x<br/><br/>LSSAH 39 NORTH OF VOLTOVZY RUSSIA, 11 March 1944: Marshal Zhukov's 1st Ukrainian Front attacked at 0800 hours on March 4. Within 48 hours, and despite the clinging mud, the Soviets had broken through on a 160 km front, and Zhukov's tanks and motorized infantry had reached a depth of 40 km. Meanwhile in the German Headquarters of Army Group South, Field Marshal Manstein was developing a plan, but it hinged on his panzer forces continuing to receive their supplies of fuel and ammunition.

In an effort to prevent from being encircled, Field Marshal von Manstein was forced to order Army Group South to pull back west towards the Carpathians and southwest into Romania.

        "description": "This game, which is very popular in India and Pakistan, has several names. The name Court Piece is sometimes written as Coat Piece or Coat Pees, Pees being a Hindi word meaning to deal. In Pakistan this game is often known as Rang, which means trump. In some places, for example in Goa, it is called Seven Hands: in India the English word &quot;hand&quot; is sometimes used to mean a trick - i.e. a set of cards, one played by each player in turn.<br/><br/>Players and Cards<br/>There are four players in fixed partnerships, partners sitting opposite. Deal and play are anticlockwise.<br/>The dealer deals a batch of five cards to each player. The trump-caller player looks at his or her five cards and chooses and announces the trump suit. Then the dealer deals out all the remaining cards in batches of four, so that everyone has 13 cards.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>The object of the game is to score courts by winning the majority of the tricks. The team that wins at least seven of the thirteen tricks (hands) wins the deal, and a team that wins seven deals in succession scores a court.It is also possible to score a court in a single deal by winning the first seven tricks, while the opposing team scores none. The overall winners of the session are the team that has scored most courts after an agreed length of time.<br/><br/>Variations<br/>Some play that the card indicating the trump suit is kept face down, so that the players other than the trump caller do not know what the trump suit will be.<br/><br/>Some play that the trump indicator card is selected at random from the first player's first five cards without looking, so that even this player does not know what the trump suit will be until the card is revealed.<br/><br/>Double Sir<br/>Double Sir or Double Sar is a variant of Court Piece: the word sir (sar) means trick (hand). An online implementation of this variation can be found here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://runng.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://runng.com</a><br/><br/>The deal, choice of trumps and rules of play are the same as in Court Piece, but in this variant, a player who wins a  trick does not gather in the cards, but turns the cards of the trick face down in the centre of the table. Cards are only gathered in when the same player wins two consecutive tricks. Until then the tricks pile up in centre.<br/><br/>When a player does win two consecutive tricks, that player takes all the cards from the centre (the trick just won and the pile of previous tricks), adds them to his team's face down trick pile, and leads to the next trick. Scoring is then similar to Court Piece.<br/><br/>Variants of Double Sir: Be-ranga Double Sar <br/>In this variant the dealer deals all thirteen cards and the play begins without trumps until some player is unable to follow suit. As soon as a player cannot follow suit, the suit of the card they play instead becomes trump for the rest of the deal. No tricks can be collected until the trick after the one in which trumps are determined.<br/><br/>",

It is said that the Vietnamese mathematician Mạc Hiển T&iacute;ch discovered số ẩn (negative numbers; literally: &quot;hidden / secret number&quot;) in 1086 by playing &Ocirc; Ăn Quan.<br/><br/>The game was first described in a western language (French) by Ng&ocirc; Qu&yacute; Sơn in 1944. It seems to be identical to &Ocirc; L&agrave;ng described by Lynn Rohrbough in 1955. A Vietnamese mancala game was also mentioned in Viltis (&quot;Hope&quot;) in 1984 (January-February issue), a magazine of folklore and folk dance published in Denver, USA.<br/><br/>There is a Vietnamese mancala board in the Mus&eacute;e du Quai Branly (Paris, France) called pan u ao, which comes from the Muong people in Hoa Binh in northern Vietnam and was collected in 1938. Perhaps it was used for &Ocirc; Ăn Quan. The game itself seems to be related to mancala games found in Yunnan, China, such as Laomuzhu and Ceelkoqyuqkoqiji.<br/><br/>&Ocirc; Ăn Quan is a traditional Vietnamese children's board game.<br/><br/>The board is an oval with five squares per side and, in addition, a bigger one at each end. The small squares are called &quot;citizen squares&quot; (&ocirc; d&acirc;n), &quot;ricefields&quot; (ruộng) or &quot;fishponds&quot; (ao ci) and the big ones &quot;mandarin squares&quot; (&ocirc; quan). The board is drawn on the ground.<br/><br/>Each player or team controls five farmer squares, while the mandarin squares are neutral. Each player puts five pebbles (fruit seeds or other small objects) in each square he owns and a big stone, the &quot;mandarin&quot; (quan), on the mandarin square. The pebbles are known as d&acirc;n (&quot;people&quot;, &quot;citizen&quot;).<br/><br/>On his turn a player picks up the contents of one of his ricefields and distributes the pebbles, one by one, in either direction on the following squares (including both mandarin squares). This is called rải (&quot;to scatter&quot;).<br/><br/>When all pieces are distributed, the player repeats by taking up the pieces of the following square and distributing them.<br/><br/>When the next square to be distributed is empty, the player wins all the pieces in the square after that.<br/><br/>The game ends when the two mandarin squares are empty, which is called &quot;fall of the mandarins&quot; (hết quan). The winner is the player who has more points. Pebbles count 1 point, mandarins 10 points.<br/><br/>",

Advanced rules are also provided for things like RADAR, smoke screens, critical hits, fleet morale, night fighting, and destroyer flotillas.<br/><br/>All distances in Grand Fleets are given in thousands of yards (kyds), giving you the flexibility to adapt the tabletop scale to whatever size miniatures you have on hand. The rules are also written to accommodate hex-based play, if desired.<br/><br/>The rulebook contains 160 ship data cards representing over 50 different classes. Best of all, you'll never have to wait for official publication of your favorite ships: comprehensive, step by step guidelines are provided to generate game stats for any vessel that put to sea during the battleship era.<br/><br/>So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes &mdash; your destiny awaits!&quot;<br/><br/>Grand Fleets: Third Edition Rulebook is a set of naval miniatures rules that can be used for ships from 1:1800 to 1:6000 scale.  The system can be played on a tabletop or hexes.  Certain aspects of the system have been streamlined for the third edition, such as separate gun mount arcs have been combined and armor piercing values have been reduced from three to one.  The rules can be used to simulate naval battles from the Spanish-American War era to WWII.  The main rulebook includes scenarios from the Russo-Japanese War, WWI, the Spanish Civil War, and WWII,<br/><br/>",

Hunters that have survived an encounter with Vibora report it is the snake&rsquo;s writhing dance that captivates them, not Vibora&rsquo;s charms.<br/><br/>The Jararaca are not of the true Vampire bloodline and don&rsquo;t live as their own clan. They are simply Vibora&rsquo;s most recent victims, unfortunate humans that persist in the undead state for a short while after they have turned. They are weak and tainted, not surviving long at best, and expiring quickly if separated from Vibora and the pack: what little life force Vibora passes on to them seems to be sustained only when they are together.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Congkak (also known as Sungka and Chongka among others), is a multi-lap sowing game likely derived from Mancala in the 15th century.<br/><br/>Most Congkak or Sungka boards have seven pits on each of two sides, with a storehouse on each end of the board for each player.  However, some boards have more or less pits.  Each side of the board belongs to one player.  Boards are usually made of wood and carved into different designs.  The seeds are cowrie shells, though other items can be used.<br/><br/>The game is played similar to Mancala with some notable differences.  The goal of the game is to obtain the most seeds. The game starts off with seven seeds in each pit. Players get seeds by placing seeds into their storehouse.  Players take the first turn simultaneously.  During a player's turn, a player picks up pieces on their side of the board and drops a seed in each pit clockwise, placing a seed in their storehouse, but skipping the opponent's storehouse.  If a player drops the final seed in a pit with seeds, the player picks up the seeds in the pit and continues their turn, distributing the picked up seeds in another lap.  If a player drops the final seed in an empty pit on their side of the board, they capture all the seeds in the corresponding pit on the opponent's side of the board (as well as the seed they placed in an empty pit).  A player's turn ends when a seed lands in an empty pit regardless of which side it lands.  Play proceeds until all the seeds on one side of the board are empty.  If there are still seeds on a side of the board, the player who owns the side gets all those sides.<br/><br/>Games can also be played in rounds.  At the end of a round, each player fills up each pit on their side with the seeds they had in their storehouse; each pit gets seven seeds as in setup.  Leftover seeds remain in their storehouse.  If there are not enough seeds to fill a pit, the pit gets burned and removed from play.  Players cannot put seeds into the burned pit.  The series of rounds can be finished when a player can no longer sufficiently fill one pit with seven seeds.<br/><br/>",

They expand the trading routes of these families and establish trade relationships with other families. The player who gains the most victory points with relationships and goods will be the winner at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players either marry into a merchant family or expand the trading route of a family they are already married into.<br/><br/>To marry into a family, the player pays the cost of the family. Only two players may marry into each family. To expand the trading route of a family, the player must be married into the family and may pay for the route with the money of the family. The goal is to meet other families not met before (gaining trade relationship markers) and to reach goods spaces first (gaining goods tokens).<br/><br/>When all families have established at least one trade relationship or one family has established five trade relationships, the game ends. Each player scores their goods cards with the corresponding goods markers they have acquired, the trade relationship markers they have collected, and their money.<br/><br/>Family expansion:<br/>Family ties are established even tighter now. Being merchants, the players equip their sons and daughters with goods and gems and send them out to travel the trading routes. The only thing still missing is the adequate partner. Which marriage is most promising?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Storm: Stalin's Barbarossa<br/><br/>What if the Soviets Attacked First in 1941? <br/>(OS for short) is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic simulation of the campaign that could've resulted had Stalin agreed to Gen. <br/>Georg Zhukov's plan for a preemptive attack against the Germans. The Soviet player is mainly on the offensive, attempting to win the game by seizing key objectives within the territory of the Third Reich. At the same time, though, the situation allows for--and at times demands--the launching of sharp counteroffensives by the German player.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 16 miles (26 kilometers) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with a few units of other organizational sizes. Each full game turn represents from two weeks to two months, depending on the season. By telescoping time in that way, the turn-by-turn movement and combat capacities of the units can held as a constant. The game map illustrates the militarily significant terrain found in the border area between the Third Reich and the USSR in mid-1941 when viewed at these time and space scales.<br/><br/>The initial orders of battle for both sides are drawn from the forces historically available to both sides in early June 1941. Similarly, on the Soviet side, the reinforcement schedule is based on what was generated by them during the historic campaign, minus only the historic emergency mobilization of the militia divisions.<br/><br/>The Soviet player is generally on the offensive, striving to win by seizing important areas on the map while causing heavy casualties on the opposing side. The German wins by preventing his opponent from fulfilling the Soviet victory conditions. Unless one player assesses his situation to have become hopeless, and therefore capitulates to this opponent, victory is only judged at the end of Game Turn 10. There are no &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; victories in this game. Soviet performance in that regard is based on that side side&rsquo;s accumulation of victory points.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>3 Sheets of 9/16&quot; die-cut, full-color, double-sided counters<br/>2 Full-Sized 22x34&quot; Maps for a total play surface of 44x34&quot;<br/>1 Book of Rules<br/>Multiple Sheets of Charts and Tables<br/>Dice<br/>Storage Bags<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>",

Them Red Devils are going to fight before day.&rdquo; &ndash;Comment by a member of the Indiana Militia on the evening of November 6, 1811 at the Tippecanoe Bend of Burnett&rsquo;s Creek, near Prophetstown.<br/><br/>By early 1811, tensions in the western portion of Ohio and the remaining Northwest Territory were increasing almost daily. Conflict with Great Britain loomed, and the Native American inhabitants were also alarmed regarding increasing US settler encroachments on their lands in violation of the 1795 Treaty of Greenville. Tecumseh and his brother, Tenskatawa (who many Americans nicknamed &ldquo;Prophet&rdquo;), traveled amongst the various tribes and nations seeking to unite the diverse native inhabitants into a force that could counter the growing US threat. Many of the followers of the brothers&rsquo; messages flocked to Prophetstown, where Tenskatawa took up residence, in the Indiana Territory. US General William Henry Harrison, alarmed at the growing force of Native American warriors, assembled an army and began moving towards Prophetstown.<br/><br/>Tecumseh counseled that war had to be avoided until the British initiated hostilities with the US, which he believed would occur in 1812. However, Tenskatawa claimed in his visions that an earlier battle with Harrison&rsquo;s army would be successful. When Tecumseh set out in late October 1811 to travel one more time to meet with the Native American leaders that were not at Prophetstown, the Prophet took the opportunity to order a daring night time attack on the American army encamped nearby. One of the most epic battles fought between the US and the Native Americans was about to take place. Can you do as well, or better?<br/><br/>Each copy of A Dark and Dastardly Fight is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    One 8.5 by 11 inch map with Turn Record Track.<br/>&bull;    90 double-sided counters.<br/>&bull;    This set of rules with Game Turn/Record Track.<br/><br/>Players will also need a standard deck of playing cards (a custom card set for this and all of the other games in the Battles of Old Northwest series is available from the publisher) and a six sided die are needed to play the game.<br/><br/>",

In Le Torri di San Gimignano, a.k.a. サン・ジミニャーノの塔, each player represents a noble family in medieval Tuscany who is trying to build more towers that are higher and more beautiful than those of your rival.<br/><br/>Players start with five cards in hand and four cards in a face-up market from a deck that contains five 5s, six 6s, and so on to ten 10s. They draw and swap cards from an open market, looking to lay out cards of the same value (a plain tower) or of rising values in a run (a colorful tower). Players can add to existing towers, too. After building a plain tower, they receive a bonus effect (a donation) based on the rank of that tower. Players can complete towers by setting them aside as an action; they can no longer add to these towers, but each scores an additional 5 points at game's end.<br/><br/>In the final scoring, players score for having the highest tower, for plain towers that are taller than the opponent's tallest tower in the same rank, and for their colorful towers (# of towers x # of floors total in these towers). The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>The game also includes a set of noble cards for an advanced game, with the nobles having special effects in the game.<br/><br/>",

By drafting cards, you accumulate resources (money, tools, training, and networks) in order to enter and occupy one of the empty houses on the game board. To do this, you need to spend the resources that the housing cards demand. Once inside, you have to resist for as long as possible police and law enforcement in order to try to win the game.<br/><br/>But wait! You can't do it alone. If you want your project to survive thugs and speculators, you need the support of your teammates, either because they're good or because they have no choice. They will give you resources, they will help you to overcome the letters of order and law, and they will (sometimes) even give you their victory points. Resisting an eviction for as long as possible and helping your teammates earns you points, and that will be the key to victory.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>A les vostres mans estar&agrave; escollir un dels sis col&middot;lectius: Centre Social Okupat, Sindicat d'Habitatge, Casal Popular, PAH, Fam&iacute;lia del barri o fins i tot, la M&agrave;fia.<br/><br/>A trav&eacute;s d'una selecci&oacute; de cartes en forma de draft.

The uprising was timed to coincide with the retreat of the German forces from Poland ahead of the Soviet advance. While approaching the eastern suburbs of the city, the Red Army temporarily halted combat operations, enabling the Germans to regroup and defeat the Polish resistance and to raze the city in reprisal. The Uprising was fought for 63 days with little outside support. It was the single largest military effort taken by any European resistance movement during World War II.<br/><br/>Game covers whole uprising, since the first to the last days of fights, giving players a chance to see if there was any way to win this possibly pointless battle. German player controls Whermacht, SS and eastern collaboration forces, while Polish player controls all the major underground resistance units as well as pro-soviet Polish People Army that tried to help the uprising.<br/><br/>Game is drived by command points - each player has a limited number of these. Players spend command points to perform certain actions like movement, attack, resupply, introduce reinforcements, pacify, ruin or build the barrickades. There also cards depicting various events that happend throughout the uprising.<br/><br/>",

Your goal as a player is to surpass Patton&rsquo;s original record, thereby possibly forestalling Germany&rsquo;s Ardennes Offensive and thereby gaining glory as a great general.<br/><br/>In the game, you control US and other Allied units assigned to the Third Army. The game system plays the Germans. You will have to deal with a wide variety of situations, from battling against fierce panzer counterattacks, to figuring out ways to extend your lines of supply. Your objective: Germany!<br/><br/>The game has two levels: the Standard Rules, which gives a quick wargame, and the Optional Rules, which give more realism for more complexity.<br/><br/>While Patton&rsquo;s Third Army is a solitaire game, multiple players can play as the US team, making decisions by consensus, or each managing operations along one of the &ldquo;Axes of Advance&rdquo;. However, one player should always be the Commander of Third Army, and his decision is final!<br/><br/>Patton's Third Army FAQ<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters<br/><br/>Magazine: World at War #43<br/><br/>",

Abandoning the Italian divisions in the South, Rommel ordered a withdrawal to Fuka. Throughout the day the Western Desert Air Force mantained a continual bombardment and strafing of the mass of vehicles retreating along the coast road. The hairpins climbing the scarpment at Fuka and Mersa Matruh proved a deathtrap for the Axis. German and Italian fighters were thrown in to stem the tide of Allied bombing.

        "description": "Time's Up! Academy 2 is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring old TV series, music and movies and chooses some of them. Each player's cards and shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds.<br/><br/>In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names and titles as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!<br/><br/>",

This terrifying new chapter in the history of the Old World is revealed over two softback tomes.<br/><br/>Warhammer: Nagash Book 1 is a 296-page volume which provides a narrative sweep of the events surrounding the return of Nagash. From Bretonnia and the Empire, to Nagash&rsquo;s birthplace in the Land of the Dead, vast battles are fought, the dead rise and nothing will ever be quite the same.<br/><br/>Warhammer: Nagash Book 2 is a 96-page volume that contains new scenarios and rules based on the events in Warhammer: Nagash Book 1. It includes the full rules that will allow you to field Nagash and his loyal subjects - along with all-new rules for some of the most powerful heroes of the Old World, such as Valten and Vlad von Carstein - in your games of Warhammer.<br/><br/>Armies of the End Times can also field more Lords - to up 50% - and the brand new spell lore - The Lore of Undeath - allows every wizard, mage and sorcerer to wield the fell magic unleashed by Nagash. There are also army lists that allow you to create a unified army of Tomb Kings and Vampire Counts known as the Undead Legion.<br/><br/>",

Arrange your team to suit your play style, and call your plays to outsmart your opponent. And when we say fast playing, we mean it&mdash; Fury Hardball can be played in as little as ten minutes, perfect for playing through a league or season!  Available in both hard copy and print-and-play formats, its the perfect fit for any game collection!<br/><br/>Fury Hardball has elements of baseball, cricket, and plastic vent-ball. Set up is simple. One or two players select a slinger (pitcher), two fielders, and four batters for each team.<br/><br/>The game only lasts for one inning of nine outs for each team. The visiting team bats first and scores as many runs as they can before the home team comes up and tries to outscore them and win the game. The slinger can throw heat, junk, stuff, or try to catch a person on base who is stealing. The batter chooses between no swing, a reach swing, or a big swing. A roll of a d10 determines the result of the play either from the main game card or from one of the players: slinger, fielders, or batter.<br/><br/>There are ways to score multiple runs on the same play and to record multiple outs. The action is fast and furious. If the home team can score more runs in the bottom half of the inning than the visitor managed in the top half, they win the game.<br/><br/>",

The object is to gain control of the three major cities on each of your opponent's boards.  It takes some luck and a great deal of skill.  Strategy depends on you alliances and whether you have a Land, Sea or Air Nation.  Each Nation has an advantage in either land, sea or air capability.  Deciding what to produce, where to deploy and when to attack will determine your success or failure.  You can become an effective player after one game and a master player after only a few games.  War Machine is designed for two to three players, but can be expanded to four players by borrowing a board from a second game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1861 - First Manassas (American Civil War in 3D)<br/><br/>The first battle in our series of the American Civil War games in 3D sees the Union army under General McDowell meet the combined armies of the Confederation under General Beauregard and General Johnston.  The battle is fought just north of Manassas Junction across the stream called the Bull Run.  The Union hope for a swift victory to end the war, but a delayed attack by the Union has allowed the Confederates to combine its two armies.  The Union still outnumber the Confederates, but only just, so let the drums roll and the flags fly, it&rsquo;s time for brother to meet brother.<br/><br/>The game can be easily played over 2-3 hours and there is a 16 bound time limit on it.  Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game that gives a flavour of the American Civil War period.  A simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit.  You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion.  The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in four quadrants, the First Manassas six page Battle Report, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice.  The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.<br/><br/>Can you start this great series of battles with a victory?  Play North or South in this the first of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.<br/><br/>&gt;Source: wargamesdownload.com<br/><br/>",

Each round, new shop tiles are added to the bazaar, and the players then take turns moving their apprentices around the various shops to collect coins, alchemical ingredients, formulas and special actions.<br/><br/>Each apprentice can move to one adjacent shop for free, after which the player can pay a coin to have the apprentice move to another adjacent shop, then two coins for another shop, and so on. Once an apprentice is finished moving, the shop where the apprentice ends it turn is unavailable for other apprentices to use, but other apprentices may move through that shop freely.<br/><br/>Formulas can be completed with certain combinations of ingredients, resulting in the alchemist gaining wisdom (by drawing wisdom cards). Each player also has a secret goal card, which will give bonus points at the end of the game. The player with the most wisdom and bonus points at the end of the game is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Purple version is a drawing game that contains 240 cards with line drawings, sorted by difficulty (level 1: a belt, level 4: Pegasus for example).<br/><br/>In a round, each player takes a card, places it under a transparent paper - making sure to hide it behind the cardboard screen - and draws on it things that would help other players to guess what's on the card.<br/><br/>After finishing the drawing, the drawer removes the card and shows only the transparent paper to others. The other players have to guess what's missing on the transparent paper, in other words, what was on the drawer's card. The player who first guesses correctly earns 1 point, with the drawer losing 1 point if no one guesses.<br/><br/>To win, being clever is more important than being a good artist. Young drawers can give other players a clue based on what kind of things are on the card.<br/> For those who own the first yellow version of What&rsquo;s Missing?, you can double the number of cards up to 480, the number of players up to 12 and the fun with this second version!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players bid to win the route by each simultaneously playing a card from their hands. Highest untied card wins the route. The highest cards, winning cards, court cards and low cards (whose definition varies depending on number of players) are discarded after each bid. As each route is won it is coloured on the map to show its ownership, a la crayon rail games.<br/><br/>Each route is worth between 1 and 5 distance points. The winner is the player with the longest continuous route on the map when the 25 routes have all been won (or when all players are out of cards).<br/><br/>Simple but fun.

There were two gods &mdash; the god of the sea and the god of the mountains &mdash; who created the world, but each loved their own creations more than anything else, so they came into conflict.<br/><br/>In Minimal Creation (a.k.a. 小さな創世記), players are these two gods and to end their conflict, they each decide to send one of their followers deep into the other's territory to steal a relic that sits there. Over the course of the game, you lay terrain tiles on the game board to expand your territory and lead your follower, moving it along the terrain to the opponent's temple in which the relic lies. The opponent loses a lot of victory points if you successfully steal their relic, but you also need to place tiles to accumulate small points along the way. How much effort you commit on expanding territory and stealing the relic will determine the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>When a follower successfully reaches the opponent's temple, the temple is removed and the game ends. If you have made any 2x2 squares of your territory, each square is worth one point. The temple is worth points if not removed (the invading follower destroys it). The player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>Designer's summary<br/><br/>貴方たちは世界を創る海の神と山の神です。ある時二人は争いを始めてしまい、冒険者を相手の領域に送り込み秘宝を奪わせることで決着としようと決めたのでした。<br/>　「小さな創世記」では相手と同一のボード上でタイルをつなげて配置して世界を創りながら、その世界の上で自分の冒険者を導き相手の神殿に向かわせます。限られたアクション数の中でこの二つの行動をどう配分するかで勝敗が分かれるでしょう。<br/>　いずれかの冒険者が相手の神殿に到達した時点で、秘宝を失った2&times;2のマスがなくなりゲームが終了します。自分が司る地形が2&times;2マス以上にまとまっていればその面積が得点となり、得点が高い方が勝者となります。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lovecraft's Revenge is a tabletop game by Two Hour Wargames that plunges you into the world created by horror writer HP Lovecraft. It's about persons who dug a little too deep, driven mad by knowledge never meant for mortal minds. It's about places with thoughts and souls of their own. And it's about things whose very existence cackles at the laws of nature. These creatures defy accurate description, view people as mere insects, and can drive you out of your mind (sometimes literally) simply by standing before you.<br/><br/>This game can be played by any number of players; either solo, same side, or head to head.<br/><br/>In Lovecraft's Revenge, players control one or more characters in an rpg-like Lovecraftian adventure. Each adventure has a goal and the goal is attained by collecting clues and managing to survive the ordeal with mind and body intact. The game unfolds through a number of scenes at various general locations. Each location will likely have some kind of encounter. Some encounters will surely be of a combat nature, but others might involve solving puzzles or interacting with npc's within the adventure.<br/><br/>",

(Or 1 x A2 map).<br/>     One air placement auxiliary sheet.<br/>     One rulebook with playing aides.<br/><br/><br/>Although the battle was mainly a one sided business, with the Paraguayan conducting three successive envelopments (thanks to initial Bolivian command sclerosis and lack of reserves), the Bolivian player still has a lot to do, husbanding his forces and trying to save as much as he can from the Paraguayan onslaught.<br/><br/>On the other side, the Paraguayan player must at least accomplish what historically was done: envelope and force to surrender two, out of three, Bolivian divisions and tear down the front, forcing his opponent to abandon the battle area. And this means having the noose tightened up to the end, and sticking to a strict schedule.<br/><br/>Being the Chaco an extensive bush country, intelligence on your enemy is a key to carrying out enveloping maneuvers. Remember that this was &rdquo;MG time&rdquo; and you couldn&rsquo;t just walk naively into an entrenched killing ground.

        "description": "Presidents versus Trump is an action-packed, fun-filled, 30-minute card game for 1-4 players. The American presidents, from George Washington to Barack Obama, are so offended by Trump sitting in their chair that they&rsquo;ve all come back together to kick him out. But while the portal to the past was open, a rogue&rsquo;s gallery of villains from American history, from Benedict Arnold to Bull Connor, have come back to defend Trump. The battle for the honor of the American presidency is on!<br/><br/>The game is shamelessly Ameritrashy, with keywords, variable powers, stuff from real history, light deckbuilding and lots of dice. It's suitable for casual play - with a partner, with coworkers and friends, as an offbeat filler option on game day, or during the commercials when streaming presidential election debates.<br/><br/>The designer ran a successful Kickstarter to fund artwork for the game. Final art is expected before the November election. The images uploaded here on BGG are samples of the final art.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/presidentsvtrump/presidents-v-trump-relaunch-a-fun-filled-30-min-card-game?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/presidentsvtrump/presid...</a><br/><br/>The core of the game is 24 presidents, divided up evenly among the players. Every turn, you draw five cards out of your deck and play them. Each president has a presidential power based on that president&rsquo;s actual strengths (integrity, popularity, party building, policy leadership or maneuver). Presidents can also gang up to attack villains or recruit new cards into your deck.<br/><br/>After the other 12 villains have been defeated by the players, it&rsquo;s time for a massive Final Showdown with Trump himself. If Trump captures all the presidents, he wins; if the players defeat him first, the player who is holding the most captured villains wins &ndash; but Trump himself counts as three villains for determining who wins. With this system, you can&rsquo;t afford to sit back and let the other players do all the villain-fighting during the game before the Final Showdown, but in the end, victory will still hang on how well you do in that Final Showdown!<br/><br/>The game is already fully designed, playtested and web-published, so you can download it for print and play.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Of course, players can be killed enemy forces before the final battle by hiring ninjas and change the outcome of the battle in their favor.<br/>Finally, the cards that the player collects from different colonies enter the battle face to face with each other, and finally, the winning cards are determined by adding the remaining card numbers.<br/><br/>",

Join the Blinkers on their adventure as they attempt to avoid a grisly end to their unplanned journey.  If the Blinkers escape Triclopia, catch them in the next episode - Eye vs Eye.<br/><br/>The number in the top-left-hand corner of each card indicates the number of Viewpoints the card is worth and the text at the bottom is the action to be performed. In turn, players simply draw a card from the Draw Pile and play a card from their hand into their Field of View.<br/><br/>At the end of their turn players count the Viewpoints of the cards in their Field of View, the first player to collect 100 or more Viewpoints wins. Viewpoint Revisioned gameplay is swift to dive into and deceptively strategic. Each card provides you with Viewpoints towards your objective as well as changing the game state in a variety of ways.<br/><br/>",

Remember to put them in the correct bin and collect treasure to play special powers!<br/><br/><br/>     Trash Marketplace - Players first collect Trash Cards from the marketplace. You can choose what to collect, but you place gems on what you skip! When you pick cards, collect gems too!<br/>     Take Out The Trash! - Once you've picked cards from the marketplace, then you can drop them in the correct Trash Bin. Either play 1 Trash Card or play any number of gems for special actions!<br/>     It's Garbage Day! - Here's the catch - Only 6 Trash Cards fit in a Bin then it's full! Also you must play the cards in a number sequence only! Gems, however, give you special powers to strategise and win!<br/>     Let's Talk Trash! - If a player puts trash in the wrong bin, you can challenge them. The loser must wear the Raccoon Hat! Best to refer to the Trash Table Card to learn Trash Item goes in which Bin.<br/>     Lowest Score, Wins! - Once all the bins are full and no players can play any gems, the game ends!

To do this, you need to bring the right things together to think outside the box, clear obstacles out of the way, and work together to stop the insane Professor Knix, the former mentor of the ChronoCops.<br/><br/>The players explore different timelines, which can be opened up only gradually by successfully solving puzzles. Each timeline has different jump markers that players can travel to, some in the past or future, others in alternate realities. There are clues and objects hidden everywhere that the ChronoCops can collect and combine with the Chrono Decoder to use at a specific location. The group can also get tips on the back of the chrono-decoder if they get stuck.<br/><br/>In ChronoCops: Jules Vernes Parallelwelt-Paradoxon, mad Professor Knix has hidden himself in an inaccessible timeline. In order to stop him, the players must find Atlantis, where all timelines converge. Jules Verne can help them, but the way to him is blocked because Professor Knix has conquered the most important of all timelines: Gemini.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Player options are now expanded into the realm of technological development (to make each civilization more distinctive), and development of Planetary Systems allows for some critical modification of the economic and military lay of the map.<br/><br/>With the enhanced narrative provided by the addition of Events each Galactic Cycle, social and political considerations are brought into play along with some old-fashioned surprises. Both sides have new Defense Satellite units, plus their own unique ships for both factions including those with Keel Guns, Torpedoes, and Phase Defense Arrays. New Planet markers add spice to the variety of discoveries, and a special Long Game scenario is also included for even more epic-ness!<br/><br/>There is a great new feel to the game courtesy of the smooth, elegant systems and components included in Imperial Stars II Expansion Kit 1.<br/><br/>",

Together they want to revive the legendary Woodstock Festival. But when the commune's guru is murdered, it's all over with Love, Peace and Happiness.<br/><br/>The host invites his guests to a communal dinner, where everyone assumes the role of a murder suspect. One of the guests has committed the murder, but they all have secrets they'd rather keep to themselves. Over three rounds, they try to get behind the secrets of the other players without making themselves suspects. The common goal is to solve the murder case - or get away with the bloody deed.<br/><br/>A game of Deadly Dinner consists of three rounds, in which each player gets new secret information about the crime. Players must discuss their information and clues as a group in order to identify the perpetrator in the end. To prepare, each player should receive their character's starting information a few days before playing the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You will need to grow an army of pyramids, make best use of your hand of cards, and even invoke the powers of the board itself. Can you retain your stake at victory against your opponents&rsquo; competing endeavors?<br/><br/>Dectana reimplements the Icehouse games Zarcana and Gnostica (which use Tarot cards) for use with the Decktet. As in Zarcana and Gnostica, cards are played to create an abstract network of territories.  Players use card powers from their hand or the board to manipulate their pyramid minions.  The four suits of the Tarot are replaced with the six suits of the Decktet, making for more and different suit powers.  The endgame is triggered when someone hoards, then discards, three Aces.<br/><br/>Complete rules and player aids available at:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://ceruleansgames.tripod.com/dectana.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://ceruleansgames.tripod.com/dectana.htm</a><br/><br/>",

They are similar to the regular dice, with one big exception &ndash; they X symbol is changed by a new, special symbol.<br/><br/>If you activate a Rider of War in your battle party, you get one Rider's die, roll it and add to the pool. If you manage to activate a second Rider of War in the same battle, you get 2 Rider's dice more, roll them and add to the pool.<br/><br/>Those special dice allow you to arm your warriors since they have regular weapon symbols.<br/><br/>But if you roll the special symbol, it can activate a Rider's ability. So besides adding dice to your pool, and adding strength to the battle, they also may activate a special ability.<br/><br/>A lot of new gameplay variability and exciting decisions in the battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 6-card combo pack that allows you to combine Agropolis and Naturopolis (to mix farmland with wilderness).<br/><br/>Unlike the original rules for both standalone games, this variant eliminates the use of card-passing. Rather, players shuffle each game deck individually, flipping a single card from each to reveal 2 scoring conditions. Then, a 3rd card is drawn at random from the 6-card combo pack to reveal the 3rd and final scoring condition. A separate card from this pack is used as the starting tile, displaying 2 &quot;blocks&quot; from those terrains included in each game respectively.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they draw 1 card from each game deck and must choose 1 to play and 1 to discard. In this way, both game decks with run out at the same rate. End game occurs after the last 2 cards are drawn and played/discarded.<br/><br/>Players score for the largest 2 block groups from each game, lose points for individual roads, and score/lose points according to the 3 scoring condition cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take it Away was published in A Gamut of Games. A word by Sid Sackson:<br/>&quot;Take it Away is the name of the game and not, I hope, the verdict of the reader. Compared to Focus and Network, which demand extreme concentration to be played at the highest level, Take it Away can, and should, be played in a relaxed manner.&quot;<br/><br/>Take if away is based on Solitaire but is designed for up to four players. It uses a checkers board and poker chips in different colors. The first player take the first chip and creates a hole in the board, then the play continues with each player doing a solitaire-like move. Each chip captured counts to that player score, different colors have different values.<br/><br/>Any player can give-up playing at any time, except the last, that must continue play until no more moves are allowed. This last player has a penalty to his score based the chips remaining on the board.<br/><br/>",

The goal of both of them is to take control of the Duchy of Milano and Venetian territories hold by the Empire, win pitched battles or major sieges, and neutralise the opponent's allies.<br/><br/>One key element of the game is collecting enough resource each turn (the gold) to pay all the mercenaries troops (the steel); German landsknechts and Swiss soldiers. Otherwise they will quit the battlefield&hellip; The money can be used to neutralize enemy allies as well.<br/><br/>This is both a strategic &amp; tactical game with armies and garrisons evolving on the main strategic map representing Northern and Middle Italy and units fighting on a tactical map featuring a typical XVIth century battleground. Units are men-at-arms, pikemen, crossbowmen, halberdiers, harquebusiers, swords &amp; bucklers, jinetes and stradiots (both light cavalrymen) pioneers, cannons, from 1,500 to 2,000 men at full strength, 750 to 1,000 horsemen or 100 cannons of all calibres. The specifics fighting elements of that period are added with tactical chits (rolling shots, infantry or cavalry charges, harassment, ditch, fence, clash of pikes, feint, hedgehog, cannon battery, etc.), arms combination &ndash; early Tercios - and events such as rain, snow, minor ally no fight or betrayal, no wing deployment, no money no mercenaries, Alle Freunde (all friends).

The game's rival factions delve into four versions of the Necronomicon, and a host of new characters seek to gain power from its secrets. Meanwhile, the ignorant masses continue their mundane routines, blissfully unaware of the Ancient Ones, monsters, and magicians who seek this dark knowledge to manipulate reality itself. While the key to the fate of the world may lie in Abdul Alhazred's dread tome, the &quot;Revelations&quot; cycle moves toward its climactic finale. Sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) deepen the game's eerie Lovecraftian horror as cultists, lunatics, and investigators all delve into The Unspeakable Pages!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Second World War is a grand-strategic, historical simulation game about World War II. Players represent the major powers involved in the conflict and have at their command the forces with which to wage war and achieve victory for their country or alliance.<br/><br/>The game covers the European, North African, and Pacific Theaters on three maps and four counter-sheets.<br/><br/>Difficulty is rated at a 6 out of ten, ages 12 and up.<br/><br/>Design Notes:<br/>The Second World War was prototyped by Peter Bertram and Randall Mac Innis in 1985. It was originally envisioned as a medium-complexity wargame to fall somewhere between the existing designs, Axis and Allies and World in Flames, which were either too pedestrian for us hard-core, grognard wargamers or too massive to be played within the confines of our housing. This final version is exactly what we envisioned when we started: a fun game about WWII with a lot of meat, but not so complicated that you need to be an accountant to enjoy it.<br/><br/>The game scale, the 3-map composition, and the use of megahexes to regulate naval movement were originally set by Peter and Randall. They are the only elements that remained intact throughout development. While designer John D. Powers had to make many trade-offs between realism and playability, the latter was the primary concern. Once the nuances of the system are understood and exploited by all players, you will find that historical strategies will yield surprisingly historical results.<br/><br/>I hope that players find it to be enjoyable, and despite its high-level, granular view, the most accurate grand strategic game about WWII yet to be published.<br/><br/>What You Get<br/><br/>     2 22x34 inch full color maps<br/>     1 17x22 inch full-color map<br/>     4 Full-color, die-cut sheets of 5/8 inch counters<br/>     1 Book of Rules<br/>     1 Book of Scenarios<br/>     Charts and Tables<br/>     Dice<br/><br/><br/>(source: One Small Step website )<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Planet Hysteria is a game of hidden identities for 5-15 people. Depending on a few modular game mechanics, it can take anywhere from 1-3 hours to play.<br/><br/>In the game, you are a group of specialists sent to terraform a new planet, and the survival of the human race depends on you. On the last day of your mission, your shuttle was destroyed. This left you stranded on a planet that is about to be transformed, killing you but terraformimg humanity's new home. At that moment, you realized the planet was already inhabited by a shape-shifting alien race, and it's natives won't give up without a fight.<br/><br/>The game is broken up into two phases, a morning and an evening. In the morning, players take actions to repair equipment and maintain the group's health and sanity. In the evening, players discuss a course of action. Those two phases make up a day, and players only have a few days to root out the aliens that have infiltrated the group.<br/><br/>The game ends when the shuttle is repaired and players vote to leave. If all people on board are human, humans win. But, if humans failed to test enough players, and even one hidden alien is on board... Aliens win.<br/><br/>And to make the game even more panic ridden, each in game location is in a different real world location. That means that every morning, things are happening in secret; and you have to judge for yourself if the other players are lying or telling the truth. Two humans may go to a location, but if one is a hidden alien, two aliens might come back. Without developing tests and merciless interrogation, you will never know.<br/><br/>Only trust what you've seen with your own eyes, because even the most helpful human might be an alien vying for a seat on the shuttle.<br/><br/>",

Mining, trapping, stealing and fighting through the uncharted passages beneath the city of Stonewatch, players race to be the first to find the legendary King&rsquo;s Gift, a vein of ore so valuable the Dwarf that finds it will be crowned ruler of all the Dwarves, if they can survive both the monsters and their own colleagues...<br/><br/>Only time will tell if you have what it takes to survive what lies beneath.<br/><br/>Beneath is easy to set up. Each dwarf has a unique player board to track their equipment and abilities. Each scenario map in the campaign shows exactly how to set up the challenges your dwarves will face, creating a uniquely 3D board for each step of your adventure.<br/><br/>Once players select their Dwarves, each with unique abilities, they can further personalise their strategy by purchasing weapons, items and skills from their local merchant. Whether you prefer your treasure hacked from the lifeless bodies of your enemies, or thieved from the pockets of your fellow Dwarves, Beneath lets you Dwarf the way you want to Dwarf.<br/><br/>Fully equipped, players they take turns as they journey through the mines, digging through rock and ancient granite, searching for treasure that all Dwarves crave and monsters to slay. A streamlined skills system keeps play dynamic and exciting whilst allowing incredible breadth in how your particular dwarf faces the dangers below.<br/><br/>But what good is treasure if you&rsquo;re not alive to spend it? Each foray into the world of Beneath is also a race to find your way back out and do so with pieces of ancient scroll that show the way to the King&rsquo;s Gift.<br/><br/>With enough pieces of scroll any dwarf will win the game, but there&rsquo;s no honour among dwarves in the dark catacombs, and no crown for second place. Pinching those pieces of scroll from each other? &lsquo;Accidentally&rsquo; blowing up your fellow miners, blocking the exit to tie your shoelaces whilst your friend is slowly devoured by a colossal tremor worm? First rule of mining &ndash; they can&rsquo;t submit a formal complaint if they&rsquo;re inside a giant worm.

It combines card collecting and trading with game play that requires both strategy and skill.<br/><br/>Two players go head to head in a game of football, with each directing their own personalized team. Through collecting uniquely designed footballer character cards, each with their own special skills, players have a limitless choice of strategies and tactics so no two games are ever the same.<br/><br/>Play centres on taking alternate turns to build your footballer character cards into attacking and defending moves whilst the footballer character special skills enable you to enhance your moves or disrupt your opponents.<br/><br/>There are no restrictions placed on formations or style of play. You can pick a team of bruisers with special skills like &quot;Body check&quot; and &quot;Thundering tackle&quot; or try to cheat your way to victory with &quot;Covert cynical tackle&quot; and &quot;Diver cheat&quot; or play the classy way with &quot;Playmaker&quot; and &quot;Attacking pace&quot; or blend them altogether.<br/><br/>It's a language-level2 game as play centres on the text on the cards, although once payers become familiar with their cards this text is seldom used.<br/><br/>The first release of cards is entitled &quot;Hell In The Pacific - The Unity&quot; and includes 81 unique footballer character cards from 40 countries. These first edition cards may be hard to come by as the publishing company is rolling the game out through Hobby stores, Bookshops and Football Club Shops in the UK on a regional basis.<br/><br/>Further releases of cards &quot;New Blood&quot; and &quot;The Final Conflict&quot; which increase the number of strategic and tactical permutations are scheduled for 2009 and 2010.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.footballresurrection.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.footballresurrection.com</a><br/><br/>",

Players have both Number and Money Cards and try to capture tricks where Money Cards have been played.  The side first scoring a total of a million dollars wins.  The privilege of naming trump color and collecting a face down widow go to the highest bidder.  Failing to meet a bid means that a partnership loses the amount of their bid from their score.<br/><br/>In addition to Number and Money Cards, players must reconcile with three special cards:  the Tiger, the Bull, and the Bear.  The Tiger card (the most powerful card in play) gives players an automatic highest trump, while at the same time functioning as a wild card.  The Bull allows players to double the value of the current trick, while the dreaded Bear cancels the values of the current trick.<br/><br/>Rules include variants for 4, 6, and 8 players.<br/><br/>",

There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king.&quot; &ndash;George R.R. Martin, A Game of Thrones<br/><br/>Fantasy Flight Games is proud to announce the upcoming release of The Kingsguard, the third Chapter Pack in the &quot;Kingsroad&quot; cycle for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game!<br/><br/>A man&rsquo;s word can be broken. A knight&rsquo;s honor can be tarnished. Any man can harbor secret ambitions, even a member of the Kingsguard. The seven Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard wear white armor and take vows to serve the crown, and only the crown. However, each Sworn Brother is a man at his core, and susceptible to the temptations and ambitions and doubts that plague all men. Each has his secrets, and the sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) in The Kingsguard lend shape to their ambitions, their deceptions, and their deadly talents.<br/><br/>Like each of the Chapter Packs in the Kingsroad cycle, The Kingsguard returns players to a Westeros changed by the War of Five Kings, countless treacheries, and new alliances. The balance of power between the game&rsquo;s six Houses has changed, as have the faces of those Houses. As part of this return to Westeros, each Chapter Pack in the Kingsroad cycle explores one or more of the game&rsquo;s existing themes or mechanics, adding new depth of strategies and deck-building options while remaining light on new rules.<br/><br/>Accordingly, as it explores the secret ambitions of the seven active Kingsguard, The Kingsguard adds new depth to the game&rsquo;s Shadows mechanic, featuring not only Shadows-crested versions of the Knights of the Kingsguard, but of other characters and locations, as well. In total, no fewer than twelve of the Chapter Pack&rsquo;s twenty different cards feature the Shadows crest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Girl Genius: The Works is a non-collectible card game that consists of several standalone decks of cards. You can play the game with any one of those decks, while also being able to combine some or all of those decks into a single deck for a longer game or a game with more players. Each deck contains many unique cards, but the gameplay is the same in all cases.<br/><br/>Each player gets a five-card hand and twelve cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern. Each card has colored symbols along each side, as well as a point value and special instructions. On your turn, you reveal one face-down card, then spin any face-up card 180&ordm;. After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols. &quot;Popping&quot; a card means that you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful), then (usually) add it to your score pile. Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards. The game is played until one player has 70/50/40/30 points with two/three/four/more than four players.<br/><br/>Master Payne's Circus of Adventure contains story elements from Agatha's time in the circus as well as her visit to Sturmhalten. Unique character blocks in this deck include Circus Cards, Mimmoths, and some fairly nasty Villains. Roughly ten cards in this deck are part of Master Payne's traveling circus. Although these Circus Cards have different effects, popping some &mdash; such as Andr&eacute; and Lars &mdash; grant you an automatic win if you have five or more Circus Cards in your score pile!<br/><br/>Many of the other cards are designed specifically to help you get closer to the Circus Card goal. Baba Yaga, for example, lets you steal a Circus Card from another player's score pile. The Horse Monster Beastie, on the other hand, scares all the Circus Cards from play back into the deck!<br/><br/>The Mimmoths &mdash; tiny, wooly, adorable mammoths &mdash; travel in herds, so whenever you pop one of them, you get to steal all the others from every player's score pile! Though Mimmoths are only worth three points each, there are six of them in the deck, and they can snowball into an 18-point block.<br/><br/>",

For the 12th Anniversary of the Game, Sierra Madre Games published an updated version of the game now called Airships at War 2nd Edition (12th Anniversary 2005 Edition).

Imperial Japanese Navy units are included, and a dozen scenarios cover hypothetical War Plan Orange actions and re-implements Luftschif.  As stated this was made available seperately for owners of Luftschif.<br/><br/>In support of the Luftschif 1st edition, Sierra Madre Games published the Expansion Riesenflugzeugabteilungen.  Which include the large bombers of the war.   The 1st edition is an expansion for Luftschif.  It was updated at the same time the 2nd Edition (12th Anniversary 2005 edition) of Airships at War was released and they updated the cover thus reflecting 12th Anniversary 2005 Edition.

        "description": "Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...<br/><br/>Once again, unsuspecting vacationers begin disappearing in the waters off the small resort of Amity, and also further up the sun-drenched coast. Only a few people know the truth.<br/><br/>Each player takes on the role of a desperate mayor, managing a small seaside town in the midst of a blood-soaked crisis, fending off an unknown number of Great White sharks.<br/><br/>Jaws: Deep Red Sea is a fast-playing, non-authorised, non-profit, and non-collectable card game based on the films: Jaws, Jaws II, Jaws 3D, and Jaws: The Revenge. For 2-6 players, this game is a shark-filled, blood pumping experience, where all players draw from the same central deck. Each player manages their hand of cards - to defend their beaches with Fend off with High-pitched Screams, Brody's Service Revolver, Improvised Explosives, Rifle and Gas Cannister Ploy, Crushed Beer Cans, Kick feet desperately, while shrieking, The Orca, and Undersea Power Cable Trick, etc, as well as play scarily large Great White Sharks against their opponent's swimwear-clad vacationers.<br/><br/>Each player may also recruit grizzled experts from around the world to safeguard their beaches from closure. Such shark hunters include Quint, Matt Hooper, Philip FitzRoyce, Hoagie Newcombe, and Chief Brody.<br/><br/>The mayors can also utilise, to save themselves from monstrous fish, some of the following example cards: &quot;Sh-sh-sh-shaaaRRRRKKKKK!&quot; and Eat Screaming Woman - Brandishing a Flare gun while soaked in petrol and Moonlit feed, and the strutting Adonis, Shelby Overman, and Eat Powerboat Water-skier, and &quot;That's some bad hat, Harry,&quot; and Eat Diving School and &quot;Overman was killed inside the park. The baby was caught inside the park. Its mother is inside the park,&quot; and &quot;Love to prove that, wouldn't ya? Get your name into the National Geographic,&quot; and Consume Rescue Helicopter and Pilot, and &quot;You tell Shelby Overman for me he can take a flyin' leap in a rollin' doughnut on a gravel driveway, you hear?&quot; and &quot;Don't be silly. That would indicate a shark of some 35 feet in length,&quot; and Bite off leg, and &quot;Lens my ass!&quot; and &quot;Karateing the Picket Fences,&quot; and &quot;I don't believe it! Two barrels, and he's going down again!&quot; and &quot;Bad fish. Not like going down the pond chasin' bluegills and tommycods. This shark, swallow you whole,&quot; and The Indianapolis Yarn, and &quot;This was no boat accident!&quot; and &quot;You're gonna need a bigger boat,&quot; and lastly &quot;What d'ya have there - a portable shower or a monkey cage?&quot;<br/><br/>Money is spent in the game buying Shark Hunters and equipment. Players can also, at any time, spend cash to alter Shark Attack dice rolls, setting the situations up whereby opponents' bathers may be devoured by monstrous Great Whites. Also, some cards, like &quot;Beach Closed,&quot; cost the target mayor cash, from revenues lost, forcing them to buy less Anti-shark gear. Money is generally in short supply. Steal or swindle it from other mayors if you can.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 vacationers and $10,000.<br/><br/>Last mayor with his beach still full of bathers wins.<br/><br/>NOTE: There is no player elimination. When a mayor has run out of holidaymakers, all his cards and poker chips are removed, and then he can only play Shark Attack cards on the players remaining - attacking the mayor with the most vacationers left in play (he's got the most bathers in the sea). If there is a tie, the player playing the Shark Attack card decides who to devour.<br/><br/>",

These missions can be accomplished by other players because we are playing on a public Altar, so make sure to pay attention to what your opponents are heading on! Players also can score from &ldquo;Sacrifice&rdquo;, placing totems and form the indicated shapes with the Totems of each color. Furthermore, players may hire helpers to help placing totem. Some helpers may provide extra totems, some may give you ability to knock out/ transform/ rearrange current totems on Altar, and some can provide different ways of scoring. After a few rounds of competition (depend on the number of players), the player with highest score wins the fame and good luck as the supreme high priest of Baruka!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Using the hulls of standard warships, the &quot;Forge&quot; managed to develop a new mix of capacities according to the requirements of their customers. As a Commander of the Hegemony of Amycles, you can now add the dangerous class 2 Assault-ship and class 3 Gun-ship to your fleet. As a Phoeban Commander, count on the fast Strategic Cruiser and the sturdy Turtle Ship to master the battle zone. Finally, intelligence agencies intercepted transmissions about &quot;specific special weapons&quot; inbound to system PA-FF-104. Has the &quot;Forge of Fendrix&quot; already equipped Battleships with such unique devices, or are they still only plans? The answer is in the battle to come.<br/><br/><br/>",

Ideally the players should regard the game as set in some distant future time.&quot;<br/><br/>With this &quot;Tranquilizing Myth&quot;, 2-4 players are invited to partake in Credibility Gap, a political satire game published during the time when the term &quot;credibility gap&quot; was in greatest vogue.

They are aided by cards which, in proper combination, will permit them to give opponents Good or Bad advice, make Demands, gain access by phone or mail to the Big Wheel, or seek for the Big Wheel's Truth Vault itself to attain the elusive Truths.
