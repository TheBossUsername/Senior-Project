On each turn, Agencies roll their dice and move their tokens around the board, acquiring the reports &quot;naturally&quot; by landing on the proper spaces. Reports can also be stolen from rival Agencies who have already acquired that particular piece of the puzzle. This is achieved by sending spies to their facilities. Players must balance spy missions with the need to conduct counter-espionage against the other agencies' spies.<br/><br/>But beware -- not all of the reports collected are authentic, so it'll require the powers of observation and skills of a true agent to smoke out the false data and avoid spending precious resources on mere decoys!<br/><br/>As they race against the clock, Agencies will recruit the help of Super-Agents and Super-Spies, get mission-disrupting directives from Headquarters, and receive situation updates via state-of-the-art Telex communications!<br/><br/>The first agency to get their hands on six authentic classified reports (one for each Government area) will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player sets out four cards face down to form the playing surface. (Choosing these cards adds an element of deck building to the game.) Each player takes six of the remaining cards from their deck. The first player &quot;serves&quot; by placing a card on one of the opponent's hitting zones and draws a replacement card from his deck. The opponent then moves his player marker to the ball and selects what card he will use to hit the ball back. This continues until one player manages to place a fourth card in a particular hitting zone, or a player is unable to return the ball.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player has won the set, i.e. six games.<br/><br/>Hit It! has abstracted tennis into a quick tactical card game, but retains the feel of the sport.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These wargame rules have been designed so that players can fight typical small battles between European Colonial armies and their opponents during the period between 1875 and 1910. They use a square gridded battlefield, which removes the need to measure both move distances and weapon ranges, thus speeding up the whole process of fighting a wargame. It also removes any doubts or possible disputes as to whether or not a unit has moved too far or if it is in range or not. They also incorporate simple combat resolution systems that likewise speed up game play. The armies needed to fight battles with these rules are small by most wargames standards. This means that players can &lsquo;raise&rsquo; lots of small armies rather than a couple of big ones.<br/><br/>- Description from Publisher<br/><br/>",

Its immediate cause was the decision of several southern states to leave the Union of States. This 'secession' was the result of years of rivalry between north and south and friction between the federal Government and State governments, particularly over the issue of slavery. Some 50,000 books and articles have been written about this epic conflict that re-forged the American nation.<br/>This is a rules system that enables players to re-fight some of the 2,500 battles and skirmishes that made up of this dramatic episode of history.

Or, your opponent&rsquo;s row contains all of the pyramids, in any legal arrangement and in any or all cells.  In either case, the arrangement of pieces must arise as the result of using all of your allocated movement points.<br/><br/>On each turn a player takes two actions:<br/><br/>1. Make a *controlled roll* of the die<br/><br/>2. Move some number of pieces some number of squares orthogonally<br/>connected squares in the game arena<br/>On each turn the player to move is allocated a certain number of movement points as shown on the top of the die.<br/><br/>A *controlled roll* is a method of choosing the value of the movement die by twisting, or manually tumbling it along the cells in a 3x4 grid.  This action allows players to plan for certain numbers occurring in the future or to prevent certain numbers from occurring that might benefit their opponent.  By using a *controlled roll* mechanism, Pungo eliminates chance entirely, but still maintains the feel of a dice-driven game.<br/><br/>",

There will be 4 cards left over: these are simply discarded.<br/><br/>The value of each card is as follows:<br/><br/>- Aces are worth 1<br/>  - Number cards are worth their face value<br/>  - Jacks are worth 11<br/>  - Queens are worth 12<br/>  - Kings are worth zero<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A campaign game of Regimental management in the 18th century.<br/><br/>This is game that was originally designed to be played in a club or group context over a series of sessions, the aim being to build up a &lsquo;campaign&rsquo; of experiences and a context for a number of small 18th century skirmishes involving just a handful of battalions a side.<br/>In the game the players represent colonel proprietors of British Infantry regiments in the mid-eighteenth century. The premise is that in this period, Colonels were, in effect private military contractors to the state &ndash; contracted to provide a battalion for the King.<br/>The game is a development of an original idea developed by Brian Cameron and Jim Wallman in June 1996 and subsequently played by the enthusiastic members of the Chestnut Lodge Wargames Group.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>The British Army in this period (the date is deliberately not specified, it is &ldquo;Seventeen forty-something&rdquo;) consists of a variable number of regiments (usually 50 - 60) each of which is normally a single battalion.<br/><br/>For administrative purposes each battalion consists of 10 companies, 9 centre and 1 grenadier. In effect the colonel owns the regiment and is paid by the government to recruit and maintain it.<br/>Each player makes up a character name for their Colonel. This is, in many respects, a roleplaying game, so players are encouraged to define such things as age, marital social status, background and previous military experience (which is not required to hold a colonelcy). If in doubt about what the period was like watch the film Barry Lyndon.<br/><br/>The colonel should be regarded as being the player in person &ndash; so risk to the colonel in battle is risk to the player.<br/><br/>",

In both cases, each player takes command of two armies or associations operating. It receives the relevant boards of the army and pools chips and card deck of cards generals of staff. For the game on the board influenced these cards staff, especially the generals who lead our armies into battle. At the beginning of the game we have such a scenario which determines - that is suitable for autumn 1914, during the game we can not change them. Generals have characteristics that affect the gameplay. The most important is an initiative of deciding on the order of execution of commands the army and orders, informing us how many orders we can spread the chips on the board. Cards and indicate how many cards of Staff tighten at the beginning of each turn. These factors can be modified by other cards of Staff, which assign the army (up to 3 cards), putting them on these boards army generals next card. In addition, staff can use the card in a different way - by playing them as an action during your turn or turn another player. The applied procedure allows us to influence the strength and mobility of the army, and thus develop their own, each time another strategy. Cards staff played as stocks allow us to accelerate the arrival of reinforcements such as on the board, or on the contrary force the opponent deploy the neighboring front of any of several units.<br/><br/>The game consists of six or eight turns, and each of the four phases. The first three are played simultaneously by all players. In the preparation phase we select the appropriate number of cards, we draw card of weather, check supplies, we join the army staff card or change the generals at their stations. In the phase of aviation spread the chips on the board planes that make us the third phase. This is the instruction phase, in which we place our units orders - march, spread, defend, retreat, reorganization, support, or crossing. If the field with our units appeared aircraft orders, we must spread face up - in a transparent manner. It was not until the fourth and final phase of motion play as an initiative of the cards generals - from highest to lowest. We then move orders or spread. If you meet the armies opposing players battle occurs. This is to be decided on the basis of the points of strength and modifiers. The final outcome of the battle can affect tightens card battle. Emotions provide the card with the arrow symbol - they require tightening next card, the count of all modifiers. Thanks to the great happiness we can overcome the enemy an advantage of more mesh than allowed by the cube d6. After all, is not familiar with such episodes of military history. In contrast to the loss of power affects individuals involved in the battle - of course, bears attacking them proportionally more. All the time, we can also use the cards of Staff.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player (or the site in the case of 4-seater variant), which scores more points wins. Most gain for controlling individual identified in the scenario, cities. The Russian side can further plunder the fields of the German Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary - action is causing the loss of points by Austria. Extra points goes to sometimes get as a result of the great victories or destruction of the enemy army staff.<br/><br/>",

Afterwards the food token must be returned to your home base.  The aim is to block other players' paths and be quicker than the others to deliver food to the own base or just steal from other players. The first to collect four different tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Aerial Assault is inspired by the 2014 competition.  With Aerial Assault, you can now work through a four-month season in 30 minutes by building a robot, training your drivers, and competing against other teams in matches.<br/><br/>In the build phase, players select robot parts (cards) and build their robot. For driver training, players build their action deck and draft cards that represent special capabilities.

        "description": "Project Football is a game that tries to deliver the full feeling of football. The game starts with a draft to fill the 18 man squad with every player having their abilities. Players alternate performing actions by activating one of their footballers. The game simulates almost all possible real life situations from fouls, throw ins and corners to penalties, injuries, hand balls or yellow and red cards.<br/><br/>Attribute test are made in one of two ways (agreed before kick off):<br/>1. By rolling a 20-sided die<br/>2. By flipping the top card of Your &quot;fate&quot; deck.<br/><br/>The first thought of this game was in April 2013, but not until February 2014 that I found the mechanics that I want to use to fuel my ideas. After that a working prototype has been made, and during several test the game had gotten a good reception. Now it's in a very advance test shape.<br/><br/>Recently a 4th prototype version was printed with minor changes in game mechanics, and with prototype card layouts, and new game board preparing the title for release.<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt six cards and six more cards are placed face up on the table. In his turn, a player places a card from his hand  below one of the six face up cards, forming a column, or expanding an already created column, with just one condition: all the letters in a column must always form a correct word (not taking into account the order of the cards); then receives a new card from the draw pile. When a column reaches five cards, the cards are retired and placed horizontally in the correct order; then all players can attempt to form a longer word with their hand cards, and whoever makes the longest word gains the cards. When the draw pile is empty the game ends and the winner is the player who has formed most words.<br/><br/>",

After that they can gather Short Range capability, Second Strike, Long Range and ultimately Superpower. Firing at another player instantly eliminates the other player from the game (unless he owns Second Strike, which allows for one last attack)<br/><br/>The game is sold with an inbuilt expansion about biochemical weapons, which work likewise: when you own Superpower and gather Lab and Plague, every other player is instantly dead unless he owns Lab too.

        "description": "Custodial Trap: The Game is a game created to show off the Custodial Trap move type seen in a number of games designed by Rich Hutnik. The move type is akin to Custodial Capture seen in Tafl family of games, or Custodial Conversion seen in Othello/Reversi. The custodial trap move involves two pieces bookending a line of enemy pieces, and freezing them so they can't move. In a future turn, one of the two pieces freezing enemy pieces, which isn't also trapped, can then move one space and occupy an enemy piece that it is freezing, and capture it.<br/><br/>Custodial Trap: The Game, is played on an 8x8 chessboard with 18 pieces each in two different colors that are identical.  Chess pawns or checkers work.  In the basic game, the pieces are set up in a 6x6 alternating pattern of of opposing pieces, that form a checkerboard pattern.  Pieces on the corners are the only ones free.   Object of the basic game is to either prevent one's opponent from having no legal moves or capturing at least 12 of their opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>The advanced version of the game, introduces a new win condition of a player connecting all their not capture pieces into oone orthogonally connected group of piece.  In addition, players also can start with pieces off the board, and one player sets up the pieces for both players, and the other player picks what side to play, utilizing a Limited Dutch Offer (this is an extended version of the pie rule).<br/><br/>",

Players take turn rolling 3 dice at a time and placing them in burgers based on a set of simple rules (must have buns, no duplicate ingredients, etc.). You get to score points for completed burgers when you end your turn. Any die you cannot play is considered waste and moved to your waste pile. If at any time you have 4 or more waste dice your turn is immediately over and you score no points.<br/><br/>The game is driven by the custom dice, each one featuring 2 buns and 4 ingredients (burger, pickles, ketchup, and cheese). Using these with the burger building rules the players make their rolls and place the resulting ingredients to create burgers. Players can stop any time they want (before rolling) and score points for their completed burgers (1 point per die) or they can keep rolling and risk losing it all!<br/><br/>",

You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.<br/><br/>",

Over the course of this combat-centered and highly interactive Deckbuilding Game players will build, enhance and expand their decks by recruiting new Minions and buying supporting Weapons, with the ultimate goal of reducing the opponents' Masters Life Points to zero, before your opponents do so to you!<br/><br/>What makes DoD unique and special is that each card has two sides, one representing the Divine and the other the Demonic aspect or incarnation of any Master, Minion or Weapon you can choose, recruit or purchase. The initial choice of Divine or Demonic will heavily influence the various winning strategies you will be able to pursue, but fear not: There are plenty of ways to switch your cards from Divine to Demonic or vice versa, and building decks using cards from both &quot;Factions&quot; is an option as well... DoD can hence safely be called a game &quot;With a TWIST&quot;.<br/><br/>The game will come with custom card sleeves which are mandatory to use in order to keep your hand etc concealed from your opponents.<br/><br/>",

Players score points for being the first to fill the Ark, collecting the most mammals, collecting sets of three different birds, reptiles or amphibians, etc. They should also remember not to place herbivores next to predators, as carnivores will simply try to eat other animals. The game has various difficulty levels, introducing the possibility to balance the Ark's sides and managing grain supplies.<br/><br/>The Alternative Board  is a promo sheet available at SPIEL 2014 at the publisher's booth.<br/><br/>The new board with a bigger number of spaces is given to the player with the fewest points after each of three rounds.

        "description": "And Away is a Tabletop Novel, a solitaire card game.<br/><br/>It is the story of The Wanderer, who is stuck on a desert planet learning Kung-Fu from various teachers, some of which are not human, some of which are very much just a skull, or maybe even a cactus.  Above the desert is a green verdant moon called Paradise.  The Wanderer is learning Kung-Fu in hopes to somehow defy the impossible and reach this moon.<br/><br/>In the desert player&rsquo;s will find familiarities to the world of Spell Saga.  As if the same world had two reflections.<br/><br/><br/>From the Introduction:<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of And Away: ~ Tabletop Novel~<br/><br/>This is a card game for anyone to play alone.  It contains magical items, mysterious places, and dangerous battles. Your hero will have to grow in order to reach the goal of the game, but don&rsquo;t worry, the hero will grow as the world around them is explored.<br/><br/>This game is also a story. The major plot of And Away is always the same, but what you do during the game and if you survive is up to you.<br/><br/>It can be played an endless amount of times, without ever experiencing the same game twice.<br/><br/>And Away consists of one 41 card deck, which represents the first act of the story. Players will start with all the cards FaceDown in a pile, and two marked &ldquo;starting cards&rdquo; flipped FaceUp in a second pile.<br/><br/>Progression through the game occurs by Flipping FaceDown cards and either Acknowledging (bringing them to the FaceUp pile) or Ignoring (Cycling them back under the FaceDown pile) based on the game state until each card in the Deck is FaceUp.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Extraordinary is a superhero-themed strategy card game by designer Roger Alan Cotton for 2 players, ages 12 and up.<br/><br/>PREMISE<br/><br/>Players each control a team of seven super-powered characters who battle through an episode from an original comic book issue story line.<br/><br/>Each Episode is comprised of seven Hero Objectives and seven competing Villain Objectives.<br/><br/>In order to complete an objective, a hero or villain must use a requisite super power (listed on the Objective Card) to perform a specific Feat (listed next to the super power on the Objective Card).<br/><br/>To complete the Feat, a character must roll a result that equals or exceeds the Objective's target Completion Point Value (CPV).<br/><br/>Should the character successfully perform the Objective Feat, an opponent's character may still attempt to thwart it. This is accomplished in the manner explained above.<br/><br/>If the Thwart Feat roll result equals or exceeds its target CPV, it is successful, and the opponent's Objective Feat fails. In addition, the thwarting team gains a two-point advantage on its next turn, when attempting to complete its own objective.<br/><br/>Either team may attempt to complete their unfinished objectives on their subsequent turns.<br/><br/>However, as soon as either side completes an objective that isn't thwarted, that part of the Episode story line is &quot;locked down,&quot; and the Objective Card is &quot;won&quot; by the team that completed it.<br/><br/>______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>Win four or more of the Episode's seven objectives.<br/><br/>______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/><br/>GAME SET UP<br/><br/>1. Decide who will play the Heroes League and who will play the Villains League. Place the appropriate Player Mat on the playing area in front of you.<br/><br/>2. Decide which Comic Book Issue you will be playing. Bring out this issue&rsquo;s corresponding Issue Cover Card and place it off to the side of the play area, between the players for reference. Next to this card, place that Issue&rsquo;s Episode Card, and the corresponding Episode Objective Cards (stacked face-down and in sequence).<br/><br/>3. Each Player selects (7) super heroes or super villains and places them face-down on the playing area before them. These characters should have power icons and keywords on them that match as many power icons and keywords listed on the Episode Objective Cards.<br/><br/>Shuffle each of these characters&rsquo; (5) Action Cards in with the (25) core cards in your League Deck.<br/><br/>4. Take all of the Resource Cards and separate them into four face-down card stacks: NPCs, Powers, Tech, and Upgrades. Shuffle each card stack and flip face-up the top card of each stack.<br/><br/>5. Determine First Player<br/><br/>Each player rolls (1) die. The player who rolls the highest result is the Active Player during Turn 1. Reroll any tied roll results.<br/><br/>From Turn 2 onward, players alternate being the Active Player.<br/><br/>6. Both players flip their characters face-up.<br/><br/>7. Draw (7) cards each to form your starting Hands.<br/><br/>______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>GAME TURN PHASES<br/><br/>Each game turn in XO! is divided into five phases:<br/><br/>1. Status Check Phase<br/>2. Card Discard/Draw Phase<br/>3. Attack Phase<br/>4. Feat/Thwart Phase<br/>5. Turn Resolution Phase<br/><br/>______<br/><br/>1. STATUS CHECK Phase<br/><br/>(This phase is skipped during the first turn)<br/><br/>Remove Status cards tagged to any Characters or Objects in play who were &lt;Blinded&gt;, &lt;Short-Circuited&gt;, &lt;Staggered&gt;, &lt;Stunned&gt;, or &lt;Winded&gt;.<br/><br/>Characters or Objects in play who are tagged with the &lt;Damaged&gt;, &lt;Injured&gt;, &lt;Incapacitated&gt;, &lt;Prone&gt;, &lt;Sabotaged&gt;, or &lt;Trapped&gt; Status Cards retain their Status cards until other cards are played that instruct players to remove them.<br/><br/>2. CARD DISCARD / DRAW Phase<br/><br/>On the First Turn, both players draw (7) cards to form their Hands.<br/><br/>At the start of every turn thereafter, players may each discard up to (2) cards from their Hands, and then draw back up to (7) cards.<br/><br/>3. ATTACK Phase<br/><br/>During this phase, the Active Player may attack with as many characters as he wishes (as long as those characters are able to do so, and have the requisite Energy Cards to use cards from the Active Player&rsquo;s Hand).<br/><br/>NOTE: Card play may change the order of some attacks, regardless of who the Active Player is at the time.<br/><br/>- Combat Rounds<br/><br/>Each Combat Round is divided into three segments: Hit Determination segment, Damage Effect Determination segment, and Counterattack segment.<br/><br/>Each attack is resolved in whatever order the Active Player desires. The Responding Player may play applicable defenses and modifier cards to counter the attacks.<br/><br/>The Active Player indicates which character in play is attacking, and who the defending enemy character or target will be.<br/><br/>Hit Determination Segment<br/><br/>During this phase segment, you determine if an attack hits or misses.<br/><br/>The Attacking Character (Attacker) rolls the number of dice indicated by the value on his or her card&rsquo;s Attack Icon. The Defending Character (Defender) rolls the number of dice indicated by the value on his or her card&rsquo;s Defense Icon.<br/>The Attacker&rsquo;s attack roll result (plus any applicable modifiers) becomes his/her Attack Combat Value (ACV). The Defender&rsquo;s attack roll result (plus any applicable modifiers) becomes his/her Defense Combat Value (DCV).<br/>Compare the DCV to the ACV:<br/>If the DCV equals or exceeds the ACV, the attack fails, and the Defender takes no damage, and suffers no attack effects. The Attack Phase immediately ends.<br/><br/>If the ACV exceeds the DCV, the attack hits, and the Defender takes damage. Proceed to the Damage Effect Determination segment.<br/><br/>Damage Effect Determination Segment<br/><br/>During this phase segment, you determine how much damage the Defender sustains, and what effect, if any, the attack has on the Defender&rsquo;s Readiness Status.<br/><br/>The difference between the Attacker&rsquo;s ACV and the Defender&rsquo;s DCV is the amount of damage the Defender sustains. This Damage Value (plus any Attack Effect Damage) is compared to the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value which is listed within his/her card&rsquo;s Health Icon:<br/><br/>If the amount of damage sustained is less than the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value, the character remains in play. If the attack has a listed effect, that attack effect is now applied (see Attack Effects).<br/>If the amount of damage sustained is equal to the Defender&rsquo;s Health Value, the character remains in play but is tagged with the &lt;Stunned&gt; Status card.<br/>If the amount of damage sustained by the Defender is greater than his/her Health Value, the Defender is &lt;KOd&gt; and placed on top of the League Deck discard pile.<br/><br/>- Attack Effects<br/><br/>Different attacks have different effects. For &lt;Blinded&gt;, &lt;Burned&gt;, &lt;Frozen&gt;, &lt;Horrified&gt;, &lt;Knocked Back&gt;, &lt;Staggered&gt;, or &lt;Stunned&gt; attack effects, tag the Defender&rsquo;s card with the appropriate Status card.<br/><br/>Tagging a card means to attach a Status Card to it.<br/><br/>Follow the instructions on attached Status Cards to determine their impact on characters and objects for the rest of the turn.<br/><br/>- Moffed Attacks and Defenses<br/><br/>If a Defender or Attacker rolls (1) or more dice, and all of the roll results equal (0), that defense or attack is considered to have &ldquo;monumentally failed&rdquo; (moffed).<br/><br/>When the Defender&rsquo;s DCV is moffed, s/he sustains (+1) Die of Damage during the Damage Effect Determination segment.<br/><br/>When the Attacker&rsquo;s ACV is moffed, the Defender has the opportunity to immediately counterattack.<br/><br/>Counterattack Segment<br/><br/>A Defender may only counterattack if s/he has the Counterattack ability, or if the Attacker moffed his/her ACV.<br/><br/>To resolve the Counterattack, follow the standard combat resolution steps listed above. The Counterattack&rsquo;s Damage Type is determined by the Defender&rsquo;s Superpower Icon (listed on the Character card&rsquo;s upper-left corner).<br/><br/>Once all of the Active Player&rsquo;s attacks have been resolved, his Attacks Phase ends.<br/><br/>- AOE Damage Effects<br/><br/>Some attacks indicate they are AOE Attacks. This means they are Area of Affect attacks which affect both the defending target of the attack and any characters adjacent to the Defender.<br/><br/>5. FEATS COMPLETION Phase<br/><br/>During this phase, the Active Player assigns a ready character in play with the requisite Power icon (or Keyword) to attempt a feat that will complete his league&rsquo;s current Episode Objective.<br/><br/>- Resolving Feat Attempt<br/><br/>The Active Player rolls as many dice as s/he can to attempt the feat (based on the numbers indicated on the acting character&rsquo;s card, as well as on any applicable cards from the Active Player&rsquo;s Hand):<br/><br/>If the Feat Attempt roll result (plus any modifiers) equals or exceeds the Feat Completion Value (FCV) indicated within the Completion diamond, the feat is successfully completed.<br/>Otherwise, the feat attempt fails, and the phase ends.<br/>Should the Active Player&rsquo;s feat attempt succeed, the Responding Player may assign a ready character in play to attempt to thwart the feat.<br/><br/>To do this, the Responding Player&rsquo;s character must have the requisite Power icon or Keyword to attempt the thwart:<br/><br/>If the Thwart Attempt roll result (plus any modifiers) equals or exceeds the Thwart Completion Value (TCV) indicated within the Completion diamond, the feat is successfully completed.<br/>In this case, the Responding Player gains a 2-point bonus on his or her next turn, when attempting to complete his or her League&rsquo;s Episode Objective.<br/>If the thwart attempt fails, the Active Player &ldquo;wins&rdquo; the Episode Objective Card. The card is removed from the Story Line, and placed in the Active Player&rsquo;s Victory Area.<br/>SCORING<br/><br/>Once all seven Episode Objective Cards have been completed, the player with four or more of them wins the game.<br/><br/>6. TURN RESOLUTION Phase<br/><br/>Once the Active Player has finished attacking and attempting a feat, his turn is over. If all seven Objective Cards are completed, the game ends, and you proceed to Scoring.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the next player becomes the Active Player, and the game proceeds.<br/> ______________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>COMBAT DICE<br/><br/>Each player gets (7) six-sided dice to use during the game. The Heroes Player uses the White Mask dice and the Villains Player uses the Black Mask dice.<br/><br/>Each combat die has six sides with different values listed on them. One side has the (0) value, two sides have the (1) value, two sides have the (2) value, and the last side has the (3) value.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is about a competition between witches and or warlocks in the quest to find the greatest potion maker amongst them.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing ingredients from the bag to use with ingredients already in the cauldron to fulfill recipes of all kinds. The board changes a lot during the turn instead of discarding unwanted ingredients back to the bag they are discarded to the cauldron. This burys ingredients that your opponent may need or burys ingredient(s) you are trying to make sure is safe for you to dig up later with a special Metamorph. Maybe you want to try and set up ingredients for a more complex potion hoping that it will still be there when it comes back around to you. Some of the potions allow it's maker to affect actions during the game.<br/><br/>The first witch or warlock to complete the required number of potions ends the game. Each person tallies up the points of the completed potions and subtracts the points of the uncompleted recipes in their hand and whomever has the highest score can claim victory as the world's greatest potion maker.<br/><br/>",

Once a unit is connected to unit of a different element, the two units clash.<br/><br/>When all elements have been played, the player with the most units wins.<br/><br/>The players take turns to play element tokens to a hexagonal board. Although the players represent one element each, they start with tokens of all elements at hand. Units are formed when 7 tokens are grouped and units are connected when there is a path of tokens between them.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Each element has a supporting relation to another element; one that it supports and one that it is supported by. This relation is used to break ties between the elements. The tokens of the weaker element are removed from the board. However, the tokens of the stronger element are weakened and this may result in the supporting element taking over the unit.<br/>&nbsp; <br/>The challenge of Iconoclasm is to play elements, own and supporting, to obtain a majority at the right time and at the right place.<br/><br/>The unique mechanism of Iconoclasm is the so called circular relation between the players where A supports B, B supports C etc. This mechanism, in combination with the players playing each others' colors, opens up innumerous strategical paths. Should you build a strong unit of your own element? Should you support another element only to take over its unit? Or should you form other units, see them deformed and among the ruins form your own unit? You must find the answer yourself!<br/><br/>",

But watch out, it's Survival of the Fitness, where new rules and new dicks can lead to some awkwardly situations. With original pics of the TPB characters, its the perfect game for those smokey cheeseburger liquor parties. Guaranteed to make your night extra greasy! *This game is supported by the People&rsquo;s Freedom of Choices and Voices Act.<br/><br/>The deck contains cards ranked from 12 to 1, along with two Jokers, Cory and Trevor. Each card bears a number, which is not only its rank, but also tells you how many of that card exist in the deck. The lower the number, the better the rank.<br/><br/>The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (although Jokers are wild, and may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. The person who first got rid of all his cards becomes the Trailer Park Supervisor. The last becomes the Shit Puppet. Players change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round.<br/><br/>TPB: Supply and Command also includes two optional decks, Supervisor and Trailer Park. These cards are used to provide additional advantages to the Supervisor or to make the Shit Puppets' life more miserable.<br/><br/>",

Your hand consists of one card only that tells you your current role. The card is played through three distinct phases:<br/><br/>1. Vote: Selected players vote secretly for or against freedom.<br/><br/>2. Committee: If the vote says freedom, the selected players vote again but this time openly. If they succeed in identifying the word of freedom all except the informer win. If they fail, the dissident player is revealed and an easier target for the informer in the third phase.<br/><br/>3. Interrogation: The players take turn to give or receive 1 card until all have 1 card again. The dissident tries to play his or her card to players who have not yet seen the card while the informer tries to play his or her card to the dissident.<br/><br/>The players may never reveal their cards.<br/><br/>The continuous change of roles makes the game unpredictable and keeps the players in uncertainty.

There are 36 different hexagonal bingo tiles and 6 hexagonal boards with 6 unique tile spots. When the dealer calls out an animal, each of the 2-6 players searches his or her board. The one who has that animal claims it. This continues until one player fills all six spaces on his or her board.<br/><br/>",

As the AI alerts the control crew to which systems are ready, power can be diverted, weapons reloaded, hardware destroyed, AI disrupted &mdash; all using a rules light system that is easy to understand but difficult to master.<br/><br/>Each player attempts to use his ships to destroy his opponent's ships and be the last player remaining.<br/><br/>In the distant future, mankind has spread across the stars of our galaxy. Matter configuration technology requires vast quantities of Osmium. Interstellar corporations are locked in a battle for control of Osmium reserves and, thus, control of the galaxy. Cryogenically preserved crew sleep for centuries, awaiting their awakening to the sound of klaxons as an enemy armada enters sensor range.<br/><br/>Battle will be joined. Ships will be destroyed. Men may die. When the cryopod opens only one thing is certain: only one armada can survive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With Tour du Jour you can organize one-day classics or your own multi-stage tour! Use a single racer or a team consisting of a maximum of four members. Whether you enjoy hills or mountains, cobblestones or coastal roads, Tour du Jour has it all. Find out how your team holds up under the onslaught of the gruesome secteurs pav&eacute;s of Mons-en-P&eacute;v&egrave;le or Trouee d'Arenberg and brutal c&ocirc;tes such as the Kapelmuur and Oude-Kwaremont. Prefer long or short or false flat stages? It's all up to you. Mountain top finishes? Check out the tiles for 3 infamous climbs: L'Alpe d'Huez (France), Alto de l'Angliru (Spain), and Plan di Montecampione (Italy). Rain? Snow? Got it covered. Labyrinthine, narrow city streets, complete with 90 degree turns, nasty road furniture that pops up unexpectedly? Tour du Jour has that as well. There's no end to the possible configurations: this versatile game contains enough tiles to lay out any type of race and blast off.<br/><br/>The gamebox itself&mdash;containing 6 teams of 4 racers, game token holders, a set of 40 cards, 45 terrain tiles, and a 20-sided die&mdash;has been reduced in size and weight in order to save on shipping charges.  Less box, more game!<br/><br/>The course is laid out from the terrain tiles each of which has a number indicating its degree of difficulty.  On a player's turn, they roll a die and if the die roll is higher than the difficulty, the player may advance.  If there are still unused pips to cover the degree of difficulty of the next time, the player may advance another tile until all the pips are used up (or insufficient pips remain to advance a tile.)  Unused pips are tracked and carried over to the next turn.<br/><br/>The cards are event cards which are drawn at the end of a turn.  Most are blank (no effect), the rest contain an event (usually bad, but not always) that impacts the race.<br/><br/>For a single race, the winner is the first to cross the finish line while for multi-stage races, the lowest aggregate score (aka time) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

This new 108-card deck allows you to play rummy, but also can be used to play games like poker, solitaire, and bull$#@! (aka Cheat).<br/><br/>What sets this apart from past combinations of rummy and word games is the scoring system.  Very much similar to classic rummy, letter cards are colored according to their rarity, and thus their points.  The most rare are 15 points, like aces.  The less common are 10 points, like face cards, and the common cards are 5 points.  There are also 4 wilds, which score 0 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game has a very interesting &quot;back story&quot; in the convoluted early history of the Monopoly game.  It is based on the expired 1904 Elizabeth Magie patent for The Landlord's Game.<br/><br/>In 1934, Charles Darrow tried to sell his version of Monopoly to Milton Bradley, but they passed on it, knowing the real history of the game.  He took Monopoly to Parker Brothers and the rest is history.<br/><br/>As Monopoly began to become very popular in 1935, Milton Bradley came out with their own &quot;property trading&quot; game, Easy Money.  This was based in part on Monopoly and also Finance, which was another very similar game that had been on the market since 1932.<br/><br/>A race ensued to see who could patent this type of game first.  The patent office decided that these games were derived from The Landlord's Game.  Parker Brothers purchased the second Landlord's patent from Elizabeth Magie Phillips in November 1935, and Charles Darrow was granted a patent on Monopoly (as an &quot;improved version&quot;) the following month.<br/><br/>Parker Brothers then pressured Milton Bradley to change Easy Money, and remove what they considered aspects of the game that infringed on Monopoly.  This included the use of property cards.<br/><br/>Milton Bradley went along with this, but in 1937, perhaps as a bit of &quot;payback,&quot; they briefly marketed this game Carnival, based on the earlier (expired) Landlord's Game patent.  This game has what amounts to property cards (the &quot;Concessions&quot;).<br/><br/>So, it may very well be that this game was put on the market by Milton Bradley largely to thumb their noses at Parker Brothers.  There was nothing Parker could do to prevent it.<br/><br/>The iconography on the game board also ties it in directly to Easy Money, since the exact same Bank illustration is used.  There are also references to &quot;concessions&quot; and it's very possible this is all in the nature of &quot;subtext&quot; as part of a dialogue between the two major game makers.<br/><br/>It was only available for sale for a brief period of time, perhaps just long enough for Milton Bradley to make their point about patents.  Parker Brothers had been attempting to get a third trading game patent (and actually did so in Canada), but they gave up on the effort in the United States, and this game may have played a part in it.<br/><br/>If Milton Bradley had challenged the Monopoly patent in court, it likely would have been invalidated, and Parker Brothers knew this.<br/>Some of the other early Monopoly-related variants are quite valuable (the Knapp/Electronic Laboratories &quot;Finance,&quot; &quot;Boondoggling,&quot; Rudy Copeland's &quot;Inflation,&quot; Cadaco's &quot;Movie Mart,&quot; the 1935 version of &quot;Easy Money,&quot; etc.) and this game is just about as rare as these are.<br/><br/>",

Grecia it is not necessary an adult game, although by experience I have noted that when is the case of having only adults playing it, mostly end becoming one.<br/><br/>Every player must choose one among the eight characters available for playing; they impersonate a Hero or Heroine who wants to become a God. In order to do that, the player must advance his pawn through the game board to the finish place, Mount Olympus. The player  simply throw the dice and moves across the game board, adding or subtracting modifiers as he can, using his Drachma coins to gather advantage over the other players.<br/><br/>There are several things that a player can do in order to win some extra points for boosting his pawn and get first to the finish line. He can win extra Drachma coins by winning some challenge, for example. Besides that, that are some events that can punish the player who lost a challenge, or simply got unlucky on the dice toss. The punishment often involves some drinking or some nudity but, as always, that all can be avoided spending some Drachma coins. In the end, the &quot;temperature&quot; of the game tends to increase, but it will depends on the group of players because the limits are decided before by the players.<br/><br/>Description from the back of the box:<br/>Welcome to ancient Greece! A fascinating place where gods vie followers as heroes struggle to get a seat on Mount Olympus. In this game, you will play a hero with a great ambition: Becoming a god. For this you should go through a tortuous path, full of intrigue, riddles and many wine-fueled orgies.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the first to reach Mount Olympus. Players will have to go a long way to go facing obstacles, challenging mythological creatures and doing rituals and offerings to the gods to get to your destination.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are an apprentice sorcerer in this new CCG. But can you master the elements when put to the test? So begins your Quest for Arete!<br/><br/>Quest for Arete (Are-a-Tay) is an Elemental card game of sorcery and duels.  This beautifully illustrated game is suitable for players age 12 and up. The game is designed to be simple to learn, but with multiple layers of complexity that may be added based on player experience and ability. In the game, each player is a sorcerer&rsquo;s apprentice charged by their master to make their way in the world seeking to increase their Arete &ndash; or excellence.<br/><br/>The back story of the game sets it in the pre-history of modern chemistry when magicians and sorcerers were actually trained in the undiscovered properties of the natural elements.<br/><br/>As an apprentice, you must duel any other sorcerer you meet using magical elements (represented by the cards) that combine make potions and spells. Each duel, won or lost, increases your experience and understanding of the elements and therefore, increases your Arete.<br/><br/>With additional rules applied, the challenge increases as players contemplate element stacking, spell interactions, time constraints, character cards and special character abilities.  Decks are custom built by the player to suite their style of play and the strengths of their chosen character.<br/><br/>The game is available in a Starter Set that contains everything needed for two players. The kit includes 2 play mats, a full-color 24-page rule book, a timer, 4 character cards, two starter decks (identical) and two expansion decks (unique).<br/><br/>Once they learn the basics using their starter decks, the players can duel for first draw from Expansion Deck A. Each player chooses 5 new elements and customizes their deck. They may then duel again for first pick until Expansion A is depleted. As they repeat this process with Expansion B, their decks become more and more different - focusing on their unique preferences and character strengths.<br/><br/>Did they choose wisely? Have they mastered the elements and gained Arete?<br/><br/>Can you do better?<br/><br/>Quest for Arete can range from a simple game to high levels of complexity that will satisfy even the most avid gamer!<br/><br/>To locate a Quest for Arete  distributor or retailer near you, visit <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.QuestForArete.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.QuestForArete.com</a><br/><br/>",

Each more fantastic than the last all given life and connected by the pure power of thought, creativity, and terror harnessed in a mystical energy source called &quot;Aether&quot;. These Realities exist tethered together in a tumultuous ever growing and ever changing Multiverse. While most worlds are blissfully ignorant many know of it's existence and even travel between the Realities seeking knowledge, riches or power.<br/><br/>Twisted Skies is a Steampunk card game of Adventure and Intrigue set in the fabulous adventures of the AIRSHIP ISABELLA. Players cooperate to complete daring missions at the start of the game but will double cross and challenge each other as they near victory. Can you master the Steampunk Multiverse?<br/><br/>Players take control of an elite airship. By manning and equipping the ship and crew, players take turns attempting to complete mission cards in an attempt to earn enough Victory Points to win.  Other players can try to Interrupt the current player from succeeding at a mission, or can form alliances to help each other.<br/><br/>Twisted Skies is played in a sequence of Phases that make up each player&rsquo;s turn. Players take their turns one at a time proceeding clockwise around a table. The active player taking<br/>their turn is known as the Mission Attempter The Sequence of play for the phases of a turn are as follows:<br/><br/>1. Ready all Exhausted Cards<br/>2. Draw one Manifest Card<br/>3. First Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card<br/>4. Open Trading. Players openly trade cards with the Mission Attempter<br/>5. Draw one Catalyst Card.

Players blindly trade cards from their hands with the Mission Attempter<br/>8. Second Drop. Place one Crew card into play or Equip a Tech card<br/><br/>Once a player has made the Second Drop (and resolved any effect of that Drop) then their turn is over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This card game is based on the game theory of the Prisoner's Dilemma. The theory explores why two purely &quot;rational&quot; individuals might not cooperate, even if it is in their best interest to do so.<br/><br/>In the prisoner's dilemma story, two prisoners are separated and have the option to confess to the crime or deny any involvement. If both prisoners confess, they will get 2 years. If one confesses and other denies involvement, the one who confesses will get 10 years. If they both deny involvement they both get 3 years.<br/><br/>When the story plays out, the prisoner's choose their self interest over the risk of possibly getting less jail time if they both confess.<br/><br/>Our card game uses that same idea but expands on it to allow for up to 5 prisoners and includes some added incentives to keep things interesting.<br/><br/>PLAYING<br/><br/>Each player draws an Incentive Card, looks at it and places it face down in front of them. Dice are rolled and placed on the Jail Card and Reward Card. Each player selects a Color Card from their hand and plays it face down in front of them. The Witness Color Card is turned over so that everyone can see the color. All players reveal their Color Card and Incentive Card at the same time.<br/><br/>Starting with the player color card who matches the Witness, any player who can play a Incentive Card decides how to use it: Alibi, Bribe, Double-Cross, Bully, Outsmart, Threaten.<br/><br/>Colors Cards are counted up by color. The player whose color has the most cards gets negative points matching the die on the jail card. The player whose color has the least cards gets positive points matching the die on the reward card. If there is a tie, all of the tying players each receive the negative points.<br/><br/>Points are recorded for each player and the round is over and everything starts over again.<br/><br/>First player to 21 points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt an equal number of the 86 cards showing division problems.  Like in war, each player then turns over a card.  They must then solve the division problem displayed on the card.  The player with the highest answer wins and takes all the cards.  If a player's answer is wrong, he or she gives her card to the player to the right.  A wild card automatically gains all the cards in that round for the player who plays it.  Like in wars, equal answers result in a &quot;war&quot; where players play two face-down cards and the an face-up card, and the winner wins all the cards.

You must balance your efforts between sponsoring knights (who may yield you honor and glory) and managing the subtle manipulations of the king&rsquo;s court after each day&rsquo;s battles.<br/><br/>Lavish the powerful with gifts, ply the gullible with a tapestry of empty promises, publicly humiliate your rivals, or back the people&rsquo;s champion in the arena -- nothing matters except royal favor, and if your enemies are dragged down in the process, well&hellip; they knew the risks.<br/><br/>King's Tournament is a card-driven game that sets a random assortment of unique knights onto a play mat styled after a single-elimination tournament. Gameplay centers around the ebb and flow of two recurring phases: the action- and auction-based Festival Round and the card dueling-oriented Tournament Round.<br/><br/>Festival Rounds are play-or-pass affairs wherein players use actions, cards, tokens, and written abilities to sponsor knights, sabotage their foes, or benefit from the tournament in more subtle ways. The Tournament Round follows, during which the knights battle one another using their printed attributes and special maneuver cards played by their patrons. Victorious knights advance further down the bracket, and a new Festival Round begins afterward.<br/><br/>Play continues until a single knight has been crowned the tournament's champion, at which point players compare the favor tokens earned over the course of the game. Bonuses are doled out for reaching certain conditions, and the player with the most favor tokens is then declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

E.g., a lone defender or one at the end of a line is disrupted (or eliminated if already disrupted), but one with two undisrupted neighbors merely retreats. The neighboring units may suffer effects as well.<br/><br/>Optional rules allow for different ways of using the command points and the possibility of saving them from turn to turn.<br/><br/>",

These brilliant tacticians have decided to play a game of &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot; to see who is the toughest pirate because, you know, what else are you gooing do in the middle of the ocean facing certain death? The game is played in two rounds. In the first round, each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one and resurfaces in round two who is the winner. What about the losers? Who cares, they are losers. But if you really want to know, well, they dove down and ran out of oxygen before they could resurface, so now they are just &quot;resting&quot; underwater until the next game, okay? But we digress... Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot;, and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before he runs out of air and therefore decides to take a rest. Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive and dove the deepest is the winner. Be careful, though, because if you dove the deepest in the first round, you will surely have the toughest time getting back to the surface since A) you swam the deepest and B) no one else wants to see you make it back alive.

These people have telepathic abilities, which allow them to read the minds of others and exchange and extract memories from there.<br/><br/>Every year, the greatest of these Mind Masters meet in a battle for sanity. During these tournaments, they try to bring the most precious memories of each opponent into the foreground, so that they can access and delete these thoughts forever. Only the ones who keep these hidden until the end will stay sane.<br/><br/>Mind Masters is a competitive card game, where each player has an identical 40 cards deck at the beginning. Inside these decks, there a five &quot;Precious Memory&quot; cards, which each player has to protect. They will play cards forcing the others to discard or even trash cards, to finally remove all of their &quot;Precious Memories&quot;. Therefore, the deck gets thinner and thinner over game play. The last player keeping at least one of his &quot;Precious Memories&quot; wins.<br/><br/>This game was created for the March 2015 24h design contest at BGG (theme: confusion).<br/><br/>",

It's a game that have the spirit of Pong hau k&rsquo;i or Tic-Tac-Toe; it's a little abstract that can be solved but that you can play with your children, or in a pub with casual gamers, because the original idea was to make it on a coaster. You need a little board game and only ten coins, that forms two towers of five coins each.<br/><br/>Players build two towers, five coins each tower. Each player places, per turn, one tower on an empty space on the board.<br/><br/>The first turn is for the player who placed the first tower on board. Per turn each player moves any tower one or two cells on the same row or column, without changing direction. When a player moves a tower can carry as many coins as he wants to the target cell, but he must leave at least one coin in the origin cell. The target cell must be empty and in his movement the tower cannot jump over other towers or other coins. Every move will create new towers, which can be moved in next turns. A tower consists of at least two coins. A coin on a cell cannot move, but can block the movement of other towers.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player on his turn cannot move a tower. The player who made the last move is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A German card game played with the 32-card deck composed of the values seven through ace in the four suits.  This game is a simplified version of the German game Skat - in that the trumps are fixed (always hearts), but the ranking is still the same:<br/>A-10-K-Q-J-9-8-7.<br/><br/>Depending on how many players you have, you reduce the 32 card deck further.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Players<br/><br/>         Cards In Deck<br/><br/>         # Dealt to each player<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         5<br/><br/>         32 (7 -&gt; A)<br/><br/>         6<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         4<br/><br/>         30 (remove 7&hearts; &amp; 7&diams;)<br/><br/>         7<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         3<br/><br/>         26 (remove all 7's + 8&hearts; &amp; 8&diams;)<br/><br/>         8<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         2<br/><br/>         20 (10 -&gt; A)<br/><br/>         9<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Players take turns after dealing to see if they want to make a go of a play.  Goal of making a go at it is to get 66 or more points in the tricks you capture.  If you make 66, you get your wager (fixed, say 1 pt).  If you make a go and fail to get 66 pts you loose 2x wager (say -2 pts). If you make a go and fail to get more than 33, you loose 4x the wager (say -8 pts). If you make a go and succeed and keep the sum of everyone else to 33 or below, you win 3x the wager (say 3 pts).<br/><br/>The points are: A=11, 10=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2, and 7,8,9 =0.<br/>So there are 120 points on offer, and you need to capture 66 of them.  Remember the 10 is better than the king, and there are rules for using trumps and playing trumps and suits - so if you don't think you can make it, pass the option to make a play to the next person.  If the question to play goes around the table fully and no one takes it, its a bust and reshuffle ( There is no Skat like option of playing with a crappy hand).<br/><br/>Once cards are dealt there will be 2 cards left over - leave those face down.  Whomever makes a play, gets to draw those 2 card into their hand and discard 2 cards, to set aside.  Those set-aside cards count in the scoring of the player  making a play.  So its important what you discard - consider the rules of when suits and trumps need to be played.<br/><br/>First player left of the dealer plays first card (regardless of who decided to make a go of it this hand).  You have to play the suit led with, if you have it.  If you don't have it, but have hearts, you must trump with a heart (your choice which).  If you don't have hearts either, play any card - but you won't get that trick.  If hearts is the first card played, you MUST play hearts if you have it and you MUST play a higher heart if you can.<br/><br/>This way, you can see that its possible to force others to play hearts at certain times and get the trump cards out of play, and then still control play and be able to bring home points with less valuable cards like face-cards.<br/><br/>It sounds very complex, but its not nearly as bad as it seems, and a great light version of Skat.  Unlike Skat that requires exactly 3 players, this plays with 2-5 players.<br/><br/>",

You can either play independent or with allies. During the race each player can be detoured by an opponent. The play of a Trump Card, Mystery Card, or landing on a Wormhole can send you into a galactic U-Turn. The secret to success is strategy. The player with the most orbs wins the game. It may sound easy, but it's not. Your strategic thinking will be challenged around every bend.<br/><br/>Each Player begins the game without Orbs, Trump Cards or Mystery Cards. That's right, empty handed. Players can collect Orbs from either game spaces, other players, Trump Cards, or Mystery Cards.  Players have the opportunity to purchase Trump Cards from the bank to add to their arsenal, however there are purchasing rules.  The Trump Cards are used for offensive and defensive plays during the game play. The secret to success is strategy, so keep your cards hidden and try to make some allies.  Remember, it's not about who finishes first but who finishes with the most Orbs.  The enticing bonus structure maybe just what a player needs to finish in the lead and be declared the winner. So get the popcorn ready, four players can finish in forty-five minutes.

Some cases only rewards the player who actually resolved it (ie, beat the threshold to resolve it with the die/dice), and others rewards every player who participate.<br/><br/>To spice up things, each hero has a hand of skill cards to either boost his capacities or mess up his partners' plan.<br/><br/>While it is important to cooperate to overcome the different cases, in the end, there can be only one winner, so this isn't a cooperative game.<br/><br/>",

It is also a time of revolutions, imperialism, piracy and political intrigue. In this game, you start out as a young Officer serving in the British Royal Navy. As you complete missions, you will gain experience, honor and hopefully promotions. In time, you may command a Ship of your own. This game is for fans of the Nautical Fiction Series of Horatio Hornblower, Richard Bolitho and Jack Aubrey.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>In TRADITION OF GLORY each player creates a Player Officer starting out in what will, hopefully be, a long and glorious career in the Royal Navy. During, play, Player Officers (POs) will be assigned to Ships and conducting a variety of Missions as they move along the Career Track Game Board. The Career Track consists of Ports, Sea Travel and Ship Duty Assignments. These Assignments will result in a variety of situations and encounters including Naval Battles, Port Assaults, Land Skirmishes, Shore Bombardment as well as a variety of other Missions in which the Player&rsquo;s Officer must resolve. The outcome of these Encounters and Situations determine whether the Player&rsquo;s Officer advances along the Career Track. While the Officers conduct Challenges, they might gain or lose Merit Points, which are used to improve their Attribute Ratings and Rank. The Player Officer with the Highest Rank after reaching the Ending Space on the Career Track, is the Winner. If this is tied, then the Officer with the most Merit Points remaining is the Winner. If this is tied then the Officers may conduct a Duel to determine the Winner.<br/><br/>",

Light Bobs is written at battalion level where the player commands four or more units called Companies. Companies are small (4 to 12 figures). This scale is larger than a man-to-man encounter, but below a brigade or multiple battalion engagement.<br/><br/>A basic game is between two leaders called Leaders of Worth with each commanding 4 to 6 Companies. Action is fast and sharp with the different Companies being of mixed arms and varying moral types. This is the scale of small units led by individual officers. To bring out the individuality of the scale and the period personality rules are used from which allow players to  watch their Leader of Worth grow as a commander as they go from battle to battle.

It sounds tough, but The White&rsquo;s Tale makes learning child&rsquo;s play.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game was created as part of the ATA&rsquo;s &ldquo;Explore Bowhunting&rdquo; program, which teaches kids of all ages the basic skills of hunting with a bow and arrow. Students in &ldquo;Explore Bowhunting&rdquo; play The White&rsquo;s Tale to learn how animals follow patterns when traveling, eating and mating. Students then use that knowledge to their advantage while hunting.<br/><br/>With this classic-style board game, players learn the natural history of white-tailed deer. Players must collect food and water through all four seasons, and breed successfully by collecting five fawns while avoiding predators, hunters, diseases and other unexpected dangers. It&rsquo;s recommended for two to six players 8 and older.<br/><br/>Although The White&rsquo;s Tale doesn&rsquo;t teach players specific hunting tactics, it educates future hunters.<br/><br/>",

Whenever a flea card is turned over and a new flea is found on the reverse side, that player wins the flea card.  Blank flea cards remain on Pluto.<br/><br/>Players continue until all fleas on the board have been turned over or removed. Players count their own fleas and the player having most is the winner<br/><br/>",

You can't put a bigger monster on a smaller monster, though, and little monsters won't be able to hang on to a small ledge.

It teaches arithmetic in a fun manner and can be played a number of times in a short time frame.<br/><br/>The player who is able to arrange 3 pieces in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line wins the game. However, when there is a draw, the player whose pieces are placed on tiles with the highest total number of dots wins. If this number is the same, the person with more pieces on the 3 colored tiles wins. There is no draw.<br/><br/>The tiles making up the board are randomly shuffled each time the game is played, so the strategy involved is not simple. This makes for a game that is equally enjoyable for adults and children.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>小さな子供でも簡単に覚えられる3目並べゲームに算数足し算の要素を入れ<br/>た、短時間で何度でも楽しく遊べて計算力が身に付く算数ゲームです。<br/>縦横斜めに3目並べば勝ちですが、引き分けの時は駒を置いたボードタイルのドット数の合計が多い方が勝ちになります。同点の場合は3枚の色タイルにより多くの駒が載っている方が勝ちになります。引き分けはありません。<br/>毎回ゲームごとにボードのタイルをランダムにシャッフルするので、戦略は単純ではなく子供から大人まで対等に楽しく遊べます。<br/><br/>",

Once the story is told, a judge is picked from the other players at the table and the story is ranked on a scale of likelihood. The player then must make a die role to determine the attempt's success or failure for that encounter. Other players may also toss in a coin to challenge the original story and a roll-off ensues.<br/><br/>Rules guide the players in basic mechanics such as movement, but the story-telling aspect opens up the game to nearly limitless possibilities.<br/><br/>",

The game currently includes nearly 160 cards.<br/><br/>Each player represents a mountain which is vying for the title of Greatest of All Mountains. To achieve this, players must acquire the most victory points in the three phases of the game, using various abilities and events to gain an advantage over the other players.<br/><br/>In hopes of achieving the high honor of being named Greatest of All Mountains, each player must first form the terrain of their mountain. By adding slopes, lakes, cliffs and more to their mountain they craft the foundation of their strategy. Players may also compete to gain the all or nothing &quot;Tallest Mountain&quot; award for additional VP.<br/><br/>Next, players must build facilities on their terrain. This is where strategy becomes very important as the facilities built greatly effect how the next phase will play out. Build the best facilities on the faces of your mountain or choose to build sub-par facilities on your opponent's mountains.<br/><br/>Finally, each player must attract tourists to their mountain. The goal is to get tourists to your mountain's &quot;Safe Zone&quot; where they will be scored at the end of the game. Tourists frequently change hands, so players must employ a variety of strategies and abilities to make sure their tourists are safe from the other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Freely translated from the back of the box:<br/>&quot;Sune and Sophie has taught their friends how to allure somebody and today they have arranged a competition of that art. Everyone wants to be in it. They have written down the names of the students and given them a score based on how easy or difficult it is to allure them. In order to succeed in their competition you have to play your allure cards cleverly, because then you get the chance to allure some of the most advanced girls/boys and than means extra points.&quot;<br/><br/>The gameplay is fairly easy and quite creative:<br/>Cards worth different amounts of points are placed on the squares of the board. Your job is to move your piece to the squares that hold the highest points. Because, whatever square you land on, you get the card that is placed there (and its value is added to your score).<br/><br/>The tricky part is the way you move your piece. See, there is no die, so you move by playing your 4 &quot;move cards&quot; in a particular order that you decided before the round started. You don't know the order of the other players' &quot;move cards&quot; until they are actually played, so it's tricky to plan ahead how you should move in order to get the most points.<br/><br/>A game consists of 7 rounds. After that, the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players will impersonate a pirate sailing the high seas among isles to conquer them all. Pirates will hunt treasures, loot merchants and sell goods to the colonies, avoiding dangerous storms, reefs and shoal-filled waters. They will trade ships for better and bigger ones or improve them with sails, crew and weapons in order to fight each other.<br/><br/>Every pirate starts the game with:  <br/><br/>     a standard ship card of 100 doubloons value with: movement of six, basic weapons, one crew man to repair the damaged tokens and empty slots where to put markers of canvas or every other markers in the hold; <br/>     twenty doubloons; <br/>     a command token, that let the pirates do special action during the play; <br/>     a load pawn and a ship pawn (to represent the ship on the board); <br/>     four pirate coves tokens, to put on the national flags when a pirate has conquered that national city.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Sailing around the modules, every player can freely attack the colonial ships, that are moved by the wind, or the other players, to steal doubloons or equipment tokens. The attack start when two ships are on the same tile. Every contender takes his three combat cards, that match the weapon token on his ship (or the basic weapon) and chose secretly one of them. When both the contenders had chosen their card, they flip them at the same time and they compare the two cards to see the result.<br/><br/>At the end of his own turn, each player has to generate one of the six events spinning the Wind Rose and immediately has to perform the related action: Diplomacy, Kraken, Castaway, Buried Treasure, Storm, Colonial Ship.<br/><br/>Once the game ends the scores are assigned to the players according to the following conditions: <br/>Retained doubloons;<br/>Owned ship;<br/>Retained command tokens;<br/>Owned cities<br/>Equipment tokens, even if damaged<br/>The player who has got the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The onset of Prohibition means it&rsquo;s a race to see who will become the best bootlegger in the business! Recruit the right ne&rsquo;er-do-wells to your side and undercut your rivals at the right moment to ensure that your syndicate comes out on top.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the player with the lowest score after five rounds of play. Cards left in your hand at the end of a round will add to your score. Play smart and leverage your cards&rsquo; special abilities if you want to win!<br/><br/>Shuffle the deck and deal five cards to each player.<br/>Place the remaining cards in a face down stack in the center of the playing area. This is the stockpile.Flip the top four cards of the stockpile face up and place them north, south, east, <br/>and west of the stockpile. These are the recruitment stacks.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The game lasts five rounds. In each round, players take turns in clockwise order until the round end is triggered (see ROUND END).<br/><br/>On your turn, you may take any number of the following actions, in any order:<br/><br/>     Play a kingpin (12) from your hand to start a new syndicate stack in an empty space on one of the four corner positions around the stockpile (NE, SE, NW, SW). <br/>     Play a card from your hand to any stack. The card you play must be the next lowest in rank, but opposite in color (e.g., You can play a red 10 on a black 11). <br/>     Move an entire stack onto any other stack. This is only possible if the bottom card of the stack being moved is one rank lower and opposite in color to the top card of another stack (e.g., a stack of R4-B3-R2 can be moved onto a stack of R6-B5). Recruitment stacks can be moved onto syndicate stacks, and vice versa.<br/>     Play any card from your hand to one of the original (N, S, E, W) recruitment stacks that has become empty.<br/>     Discard a femme fatale card to play a different card from your hand to the bottom of any stack. The card played must be one rank higher than the card currently on the bottom of the stack, and opposite in color. <br/>     Play a hideout to any stack. This is only possible if the top card of the stack is a 1 and opposite in color to the hideout. <br/>     When you play a card, resolve its special ability (if any) immediately. If the ability cannot be resolved, simply ignore it.<br/><br/><br/>If, after playing a card, you have none left in hand, the round ends. If you have cards left but cannot or do not want to take any more actions, end your turn by drawing a card from the stockpile.<br/><br/>If the stockpile runs out during the round, continue to play as normal but do not draw.<br/><br/>ROUND END<br/>The round will end either (a) when one player manages to get rid of all the cards from their hand or (b) when the stockpile has run out and all players have passed consecutively&mdash;whichever comes first.<br/><br/>Score all cards remaining in your hand at the end of the round (taking all special abilities into account). The scoring value of each card is indicated in its bottom right corner. Add your score for the round to your running total.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/>After the fifth round is complete, the game is over. Players should then compare their scores. The player with the lowest total score is the winner&mdash;the true kingpin! If there is a tie for lowest total score, the tied player who won the most rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

There are four starting points, each marked by a ship and leading to a different track.  Each player chooses a ship and places his or her starting marker on it.  More than one player may choose the same ship.  Players take turns rolling the die and moving their marker along the track, following the directions on spaces where they land.  Spaces may move players forward or back on the track or cause gain of loss of turns.  When a player reaches the pirate treasure on an exact roll, he or she then heads back the starting ship.  The first player back to his or her starting ship wins.<br/><br/>",

You can even move them on the table and in the air. With the person card Luca, for example, it is easier to portray a racecar driver in his car or a parachuter under a slightly bended card.

On the game board, there are cherries, oranges, plums, bells, and 7's, separated by pots of gold. If the chip lands on a pot, then the chip is added to the &quot;jackpot&quot;. If the chip lands on one of the other symbols, players mark off that symbol on their score pad.  After marking off any of the symbols for the fifth time, a player wins the current jackpot, and then that symbol will no longer win a jackpot for any player.  The game ends when a jackpot is won for each of the five symbols, with the player with the most chips being the winner.<br/><br/>There is a unique game board design in Pot'O'Gold, where the board is actually 5 giant jigsaw pieces.  This does not effect game play, is simply an alternative to having a game board that folds for storage.<br/><br/>In the 1990's, Video Lottery Terminals, or VLTs, became legal in the Canadian province of Alberta, and most bars and lounges had them installed.  Different games could be played on the VLTs, including a five wheeled slot machine where you won by matching up cherries, oranges, plums, bells and 7s on a line.  Pot'O'Gold is themed after the slot machines on those VLTs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A strategy card game about well intended people in bitter competition over exactly how to save the planet from climate change...and how to serve their own special interests while doing so.<br/><br/>Take on the role of a special interest group trying to save the world from a changing climate. However, while all the interest groups want to maximize positive impact, they all have different priorities for how to go about it. Are you advocating clean energy, habitat protection, or island nations that might get flooded? Will you pass laws to create subsidies, institute a carbon tax, or maybe attempt an ambitious geo-engineering project? Every method has its own benefits and drawbacks, and you will need strategic planning and political cunning to lead your organization to success.<br/><br/>Mechanics:<br/>Players attempt to pass bills into law, both to have an impact in general and to further their own special interest's goals. However, all players will need to pursue a mixed strategy to succeed -- your special interest does not dictate your strategy. For example, a player might be rewarded for seeing enough geo-engineer projects succeed, regardless of who plays those cards -- so they might play those cards themselves or negotiate for someone else to play them.<br/><br/>Carbon Copy Politics uses a novel &quot;clock&quot; mechanic to track the progress of activities over time. Players play cards onto the clock, which ticks down each turn. Cards that reach the end of the clock resolve, building variable delays into the play of every card. The delay requires players to plan ahead, allow them to set up combos, and creates opportunities for disruption by opponents. For example, bill cards are typically delayed by 3 turns before they are evaluated, so you might play it one turn, play an action to boost public will-for-change the next turn, play a modifier on it the next turn, and then discard cards as the bill resolves to pay the rest of the cost.<br/><br/>Bill cards are rated by their difficulty (cost) and impact (score). Different types of bills offer different ways to pay the cost. Carbon Tax bills get easier to pass as more taxes are passes, while Cap and Trade bills are easier if several are played at the same time by different players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Squish is a fun, family friendly, dexterity game for 1 to 6 players in which you drop player order cards (also referred to as boot cards) in an attempt to squish bug cards that are on the ground. You try to be the player with 10+ points at the end of a round. The bug cards are thrown into the air at the beginning of the game and fall where they may. After, you are ready to get Squishing!  You go in number order according to your player order cards. You drop your player order cards from shoulder height, number side up, in an attempt to completely cover a bug. Bugs range in size and value. The bigger the bug, the more points it is worth. Beware though, because if your player order card lands boot side up someone can cover your number and take one of your squished bugs from you. You squish the bug and your friend steps on your toes and takes it from you. This could turn a win into a loss or a loss into a win.  Getting 10 points is easy, keeping them is tough.  Some dropping techniques can make it so that your card is boot side down and keeps you safe from anyone's nefarious plans of stepping on your toes.<br/><br/>A variant for younger crowds makes the game a bit easier by the requirement to cover a bug goes from, covering the entire bug, to covering just the head or body.<br/><br/>Squish: The Dexterity Card Game of Bug Squishery is a fun and easy game for kids of all ages and plays in only 30 minutes.<br/><br/>",

Each player should also start the game with 7 Quality Street sweets!<br/><br/>Starting with the youngest, the players turn over two cards. If the property on the two cards is identical, the player keeps the cards and turns over two others. When two cards which do not match are revealed, they are turned over face down again, and the player&rsquo;s turn is over.<br/><br/>Hidden in the playing cards are a number of &lsquo;Community Chest&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chance&rsquo; cards. If revealed, the player accepts their reward or fine, and if it is the first card turned over, that player still turns over a second card as part of their turn. These cards are removed from the table once revealed.<br/><br/>There is one &lsquo;Go to Jail&rsquo; card. If this is revealed that player&rsquo;s turn is over (even if it is the first card turned), and they must miss their next turn. Unlike the Chance and Community Chest cards, this card stays on the table, so you are wise to remember where it is!<br/><br/>The cards have a value on them (related to real values on a traditional English Monopoly board).

An exact throw is not needed.<br/><br/>MOVEMENT: players take turns rolling the d8, moving that many spaces counter-clockwise. Several spaces are connected by arrows-if you land on the end of one, go to its head; if on its head, go to the tail. If you land on another player, that person goes back to 'start.'

        "description": "Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure is the ultimate dungeon crawl! It combines true elements of D&amp;D table top roleplaying using ver3.5 Dungeons and Dragons rules with a versatility of a card game dungeon crawl. If you&rsquo;ve ever played the original computer version of Dungeon Hack and loved the endless possibilities, then this is the game for you. It allows for solo or CO-OP play within a randomly generated multi-level dungeon. Just like in the computer game, you explore a never ending dungeon with monsters, treasure, traps, and glory! It&rsquo;s you against the dungeon and everyone is out to get you! Dungeon Hack uses actual monsters, traps, treasures and equipment directly from the Dungeon and Dragons universe. Story lines and game play is taken from actual D&amp;D modules! If you&rsquo;ve wanted to play D&amp;D but couldn&rsquo;t find the group, well look no further&hellip; Dungeon Hack is here! You create actual characters with abilities that you will use during your adventure. All the while you earn experience and fortunes to help level up and grow your character to much stronger and higher levels.<br/><br/>Dungeon Hack: Dungeon Adventure is a solo D&amp;D game on a micro level using 4&rdquo;x4&rdquo; tile cards representing dungeon rooms, corridor rooms, corridors and junctions while colored cubes represent your characters and the ever increasing monsters. A multitude of cards depict and define the monsters, treasures, encounters, and obstacles you will face within the dungeon.<br/><br/>Most D&amp;D rules apply, with many of the mundane and complicated rules left out to create a smoother and more stream lined game play.<br/><br/>The goal is to descend each level facing new encounters that will bring you face to face with puzzles, doors, traps, monsters and treasures at every turn. Before every two levels you will have a QUEST card that depicts special requests for the town asking for specific items you can find during your adventures through the levels of the dungeon. If you find or collect all of the items on the QUEST card you receive the stated reward from the town.<br/><br/>Each level of the dungeon you descend will end up providing your character with a level of experience; if you survive to the lowest level of the dungeon, you will have reached the level of hero to be able to challenge the Big Boss!<br/><br/>As you descend deeper into the dungeon you will encounter stronger and more dangerous monsters. When you reach the lowest level you will finally come face to face with the Big Boss of the dungeon which could be a dragon, a demon, etc&hellip; basically the challenge of your life!<br/><br/>Survive the dungeon, make it out alive, and you will become the dungeon master! You&rsquo;re victory score will be based on the level you reach &ldquo;experience points&rdquo;, the gold pieces you&rsquo;ve earned &ldquo;total gp&rdquo;, the treasure you&rsquo;ve accumulated &ldquo;gp value&rdquo;, and the monsters you&rsquo;ve killed &ldquo;total monsters destroyed&rdquo;!<br/><br/>",

Unusually for a Mancala game the aim of the game is to empty your side of the board rather than win the most seeds.  It is played on a board with 2 rows of 6 holes and a storehouse at each end, starting with 4 seeds in each hole.  Turns must start on your side of the board, there is no capturing, but seeds are sown in a player's own store.  Sowing the last seed in the player's store gives that player another turn.  Waurie can easily be played with a Kalah set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The village of Piquant was a very happy place. They had five bountiful farmlands that each produced a different type of food. All of the people had lots of delicious food to eat. But the evil wizard Captious grew jealous and cursed each of the five farmlands. The food grew to a monstrous size and began to attack the village. The people had only a limited supply of cannonballs to defend themselves against the humongous food! Thankfully a giant from the land of Epicure volunteered to guard the village and eat any food that got too close to the village - even though it was food that giants didn't normally eat. The wizard's magic is limited so your challenge is to defend your village until it runs out.<br/><br/>This is a co-op game designed to be played together by a parent and one child. The game contains a single-sheet board, tokens, and a small deck of cards. Players will also need to provide one 6-sided die and about 10 small candies or snacks that the child likes to eat such as M&amp;Ms, Fruit Snacks, or Fish Crackers. The parent should also choose five foods that they would like the child to try eating. I recommend choosing one food from each of the five food groups but any combination of foods will work.<br/><br/>Each section of the board contains a track leading towards the village and is marked by an icon of one of the five food groups. Before the game, assign one of the five foods to each track (markers are provided to help you remember which food is on which track). Each turn, players will draw a card from the deck that will indicate what tracks are attacking the village that turn. Move that marker one space down the track.<br/><br/>The village can defend itself by rolling a die and trying to get a higher number than the advancing token. At any time, the player may use one of their &quot;cannonballs&quot; (candies) to automatically win a battle. If they use a cannonball it is lost forever (the parent gets to eat it).<br/><br/>The giant marker can move along the red line between the &quot;1&quot; spaces. If a giant and a food monster are ever in the same space, the giant may immediately remove that piece by eating it. The child must taste the associated food for this action. The child can push back the food monsters by tasting the associated food.<br/><br/>If any food monster is ever able to enter the village it squishes all the villagers, the game is lost, and the cannonballs are lost (the parent gets to eat them). If the child is able to defend the village until the draw deck is empty, he or she gets to eat all the remaining candy cannonballs as a reward.<br/><br/>This game is inspired by Israeli Independence by Darin A. Leviloff.<br/><br/>This game won 3rd place for Best Co-operative game in the 2015 Children's Game Print and Play Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

Each ring must include 6 different color tiles.  When all the tiles have been drawn and no player can form any more rings, the game is over.  Highest score wins. <br/> Uniquely simple yet challenging, this exciting game of logic requires strategic planning (and a little luck) to win.  For a variety of gameplay, some optional Rules can be used -- and because there are 2 methods of scoring points (standard and advanced), Hexlinx is FUN for children and adults of all skill levels !<br/><br/>",

The British Empire, passing through an interdimensional portal, has found a new world, the Gruv, chock-full of resources and land to be exploited. In the process, though, they've run headlong into the Samsut, descendants of ancient Babylonians who've been living there for over three thousand years. Now the might of the Empire clashes with the weird science of the Samsut. The Saurids, a reptilian race native to the new world, contest with both empires to retain their ancestral lands. Who will control the Gruv? That's up to your battles to decide! This miniatures game focuses on the military aspects of the period providing the Universal 18 ruleset and basic information about the British and Samsut forces, and a series of Forcebooks detailing the various military forces on Earth and on the Gruv.<br/><br/>",

After all pawns are placed, the players may move one pawn to an adjacent spot on their turn. When someone creates a wiekslag he removes one (or more) pawns permanently from the game. It's not allowed to remove pawns from an existing wiekslag.<br/><br/>When a player has only three pawns left, he is allowed to jump with his pawns to any free spot on the board. When a player with three pawns left, loses another pawn, he or she is elliminated from the game. The game ends when there is only one player left on the board.<br/><br/>",

Starting Out<br/>    2. Meeting that special someone<br/>    3. Settling down with that special someone<br/>    4. Kids arrive (by birth, adoption or otherwise)<br/>    5. Kids grow up to be teenagers<br/>    6. Kids leave home, the nest is empty<br/>    7. Getting old<br/>    8. Approaching this life&rsquo;s end<br/><br/>The game is played on a five by five tile 'city' - with 13 fixed tiles (representing CBD, four inner suburbs, four outer suburbs and four corner 'holiday home' locations) and 12 Modifiable (Mod) tiles which represent different landmarks (for example restaurant, art gallery, rubbish dump etc).<br/><br/>Each Mod tile has a scoring value each turn, which can change depending on the turn (phase of life) you are in. For example living near a retirement home scores well in later rounds.<br/><br/>You start the game with a house in an inner suburb. Players draft a hand of 'mod' tiles which allow them to modify the landmarks on the board (for example turn a park into a 'fancy' park, which scores more highly) - they also receive one temporary closure tile (means a tile is not scored for the current round) and one demolition tile (which permanently removes a Mod tile and replaces it with one from the side of the board).<br/><br/>Your objective is to optimise where you live in relation to your particular stage in life, and this is scored at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>Each turn you either:<br/>1. Move house<br/>2. Buy a holiday home (allowing you to place a second home on a corner of the board and then score the adjacent tiles each turn) - you may only perform this action once per game, or<br/>3. Modify a Mod tile<br/><br/>You cannot pass in Living.<br/><br/>Each turn you then score the tiles orthogonally adjacent to your home and your holiday home (if you have one).<br/><br/>At the end of the eighth turn, the highest score wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview<br/>Eastern Blades is the samurai card dueling game we have all been waiting for. Players will adopt one style of the characters dealt to them at the beginning of the game. Then all players will battle for supremacy using their character to defeat all comers. Game play is designed to depict extremely faced paced sword duels on the battlefield. 2-5 players will take part using only the core game. Games last 10 to 15 minutes. Expansions are planned to begin in early 2017.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/> After selecting their character players get  ready for the coming onslaught by selecting stances, choosing an attack or item and finalizing their plan of attack. However, we all know that on the battlefield even the best laid plans do not survive contact with the enemy. Players will simultaneously select their actions and who they will attack each round. Upon being attacked combatants will be able to parry or even redirect the attack just like in a true sword fight. This &ldquo;ebb and flow&rdquo; of combat will persist as long as it takes to declare a winner. This is no easy task as every decision will devastate either your enemy or yourself. You will inevitably find yourself asking questions like what stance I  need to be in next, should I block or should I hold for a bigger attack, is the opponent faking their threat level, and can I get my attack off before theirs? In any event this high stakes sword fight will have you coming back again and again.<br/><br/>How do we know you will like it?<br/>BC Games focuses on making quality games over a quantity of games. For this game we consulted Marty Katz Shihan, Shichidan (7th Dan in Bushido), founder of Bushido Karate Dojo in an effort to add a large shot of realism to the flow of the game. We even had the maneuvers translated into Japanese (with subtitles) and cross referenced them so some of the maneuvers block and counter others specifically like they do in the real world. You will enjoy this game for its realism and attention to detail regarding the art of Bushido and the way of the warrior. The Samurai put all they had into their training and ability as an honorable but lethal force at the altar of war. Now you can live out your dream of an amazing duel of your own.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeon Crawl is a solitaire RPG card game designed for use with a standard deck of playing cards. It was developed by Marc Case for the 2012 Instructables Toy Contest 2.<br/><br/>Dungeon Crawl uses a standard deck of 52 playing cards with the Jokers removed and a character stat and score chart. Gameplay begins by selecting a Mage or Warrior character class and drawing cards from the deck to determine stats. Mages draw cards for hit points (HP) determining health and mana points (MP) for casting spells. Warriors draw cards for hit points (HP) determining health and shield points (SP) determining defense.<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses through a series of rooms each of which contains a single monster encounter. You begin the room by drawing cards to determine the stats of the monster including hit and damage points. Next you draw for initiative with the higher card determining the order of the battle between the player or monster. The monster and Warrior turns consist of drawing an attack card with the value determining the strength of the attack followed by an opposing evasion card with the color determining its success. The Mage turn consists of either a one point Melee attack with opposing evasion draw or an attack spell with opposing evasion draw. A Mage may cast an attack spell by turning over a mana card during the players turn or a shield spell by casting during the monsters turn. Player and monster alternate turns until one of them is defeated.<br/><br/>You progress to another room by defeating the monster. The defeated monster's HP is added to your cumulative score and all cards played during the round are shuffled back into the deck. Mages may sacrifice 10 score points at any time to regenerate the mana pool. Gameplay ends when you die in combat or choose to leave the dungeon.<br/><br/>",

Every player plays on every turn and no one ever performs alone. 2-person teams change constantly.<br/>This game requires quick thinking and spontaneous creativity. The scoring is every man/woman for himself/herself in the end, but the crowd can influence both the score and the pace of the game. There is constant hilarious action and interaction. It's super easy to learn.<br/><br/>The game comes in a wine tote bag because the makers of the game think wine makes game nights better, and you may want a spot to put your bottle. It also makes for a great gift. This is not a &quot;drinking game&quot;, nor does it have &quot;adult content.&quot; It just comes in a different type of package than most party games.<br/><br/>",

If the players agree to peninsulas and/or bottlenecks, there are septillions of configurations &mdash; nonillions if the players agree to cover unavailable cities as in the base game.<br/><br/>The map hexes are &quot;sliced&quot; into equilateral triangles, so that connections pointing off the edge of the map can be removed by flipping over the edge triangles. Additionally, the connection costs were determined according to the first-edition Funkenschlag rules, based on the terrain the connections traverse.<br/><br/>Because the base game's gameboard is no longer required for the map, this expansion includes an octagonal board to replace the resource market, heptagonal boards to provide distinct city connection tracks for the different player counts, and a hexagonal turn order / auction status track.<br/><br/>Finally, to provide extra variety, the expansion includes a deck of 32 resource cards, which can be used to randomize the starting resource market.<br/><br/>",

Most of the squares have a large K or M on them in five different colours. There are also special Horseshoe (Opportunity), Lightning Bolt (Crisis), Light Bulb (Bright Idea) and Superdilemma squares.<br/><br/>When they land on K or M square, they must choose a card of the colour they landed on from a box divided into 18 groups. These cards describe moral dilemmas (brief case studies) on one side, with four multiple-choice options and the real solutions for both the K and M philosophies on the other.<br/><br/>These cards are divided into three major categories based on age (Youth, Adult and Senior), each of which is divided into six colour-coded sub-categories based on the type of dilemma one must solve (Business/Professional, Biomedical, Social/Political, Environmental, Personal/Sexual, Superdilemmas).<br/><br/>The K squares ask players to answer a dilemma according to the duty-based ethics of Immanuel Kant. The M squares ask you to solve the same dilemma according to the utilitarian ethics of John Stuart Mill. The game comes with summary cards for Kant and Mill listing their seven key ideas in each case.<br/><br/>Players can use either the easy multiple-choice option, or answer the dilemma in their own words, with the other players voting on how close they came to matching the true solution. In the case of a Superdilemma, no solutions are given, so players propose their own, with others voting to determine whether it&rsquo;s correct. They can also time the game, giving each player 3-5 minutes to answer a dilemma.<br/><br/>If you get the right answer, they can move forward next turn. If they get it wrong, they move backwards when they roll again. The winner is the first player who gets to the end of the spiral track.<br/><br/>",

The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.<br/><br/>All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.<br/><br/>Core Set: Includes 50 sentence cards and 146 noun cards. Designed for the novice French learner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This cooperative game is based on a classic austrian children's book &quot;The grandma in the appletree&quot; by Mira Lobe. In the book Andi is sad, because he doesn't have grandmother. He retreats to the appletree, where he imagines all kind of zany adventures with an equally imaginatory and zany gandmother. Later on he meets his new neighbor Mrs. Fink, an elderly woman without grandkids, so in the end, he has two &quot;grandmothers&quot;. In the game the players try to help Andi tell Mrs Fink about his adventures with his grandma and then tell his mother about how he helped Mrs. Fink.<br/><br/>The game is played over 8 to 10 rounds, depending on playercount. Each player has a hand of three cards. In each round, the active player flips an apple token from the tree, revealing either grandma (green) or Mrs Fink (blue). Depending on the colour he tries to fulfil as many of the cards of that colour until a timer runs out. To fulfil a green card the player has to roll a certain combination with four coloured dice as fast as he can. To fulfil a blue card the player has to stack the dice in a certain way. Whenever the active player finishes a card in front of him, the next player in turnorder lays another one out in front of him and the active player continues.<br/><br/>Once the timer has run out the active player has to shut his eyes immediately. On each green card is a word, on each blue card a chore. So the active player either has to tell a story with the words on the green cards or recount the chores he did on the blue cards. He has to do both in order. Each card correctly remembered goes into a scoring pile. Once a mistake was made, the rest of the cards are put away, and the next player becomes active player. After the last turn all the saved cards are counted up, and the group can rate their score based on a scale. The goal is to save as many cards as possible for scoring.<br/><br/>",

All players lose if the apocalypse number reaches 13, or players take total of four damage.<br/><br/>You may play a card if that card matches its color or number to the top-most card of the discard pile, or draw a card if you cannot or don't want to play. The apocalypse number fluctuates according to the cards played, so sometimes you have to draw a card even when you have an eligible card. But you cannot draw too much, because you take damage if you have more cards than your hand limit. All of you should discuss who will be an attacker who gets rid of cards, and who will be a healer who draws cards and keeps away from apocalypse.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>協力型のウノです。誰か１人でも手札を出しきれば全員の勝利となります。手札の出し方のルールはウノと同じで、直前に出したカードと色か数字が同じなら出せます。しかしカードを出すたびにダメージが溜まっていきます。時にはダメージを回復すべく、あえてカードを引く必要もあるでしょう。誰をアタッカー（手札を出し切る役）にし、誰をヒーラー（限界まで手札を溜めてダメージを回復させる役）にするのか相談しながらゲームを進めましょう。<br/><br/>",

There are several paths to gaining VP - wealth and political power are the two main roads - and players must choose which of these they will take to win.<br/><br/>The Big Apple requires players to master various types of games all at the same time. The building portion of the game requires players to adapt spatially to the changing environs for in each of the three eras of the game. In addition there is a population management aspect where new immigrants are constantly coming ashore and need to find housing. This leads to a constant friction between the building of housing to hold voters... I mean population versus the creation of lucrative businesses versus the migration of the populace into the boroughs of Brooklyn, Queens &amp; The Bronx. Finally the game is full of dirty political tricks that can set your opposition back and create opportunities for you.<br/><br/>The Big Apple is for 2-4 players and plays in about 45 minutes per player. It is easy to learn but full of nuances that make mastery slightly more difficult.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alligators, Dice &amp; Doors is similar to Snakes &amp; Ladders in game play, although generally faster.  It's made to be a simple dice-rolling game to help familiarize youngsters with larger numbers and simple arithmetic, and the goal is simply to get from Start to Finish across 69 squares between them.<br/><br/>It uses polyhedral dice (4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 sided) and a rolling mechanic for backwards steps - if a player lands on an alligator square, they roll the 6-sided die and move backwards.<br/><br/>The &quot;Doors&quot; in the game refer to portals similar to the ladders in Snakes &amp; Ladders. Under basic rules, these are one-way and treated the same. Alternatively, each door has a number. Upon entering, the player may roll an eight-sided die to determine the output location.<br/><br/>",

Players shuffle the cards a construct a 6x6 grid by looking at the cards before placing them face down with the first card in the middle of the table. As other cards are placed have to touch the edge of another card. Doorways however are placed face up to begin with and where possible should not be placed next to each other.<br/><br/>The last player to add a card picks the doorway they wish to start on and the remaining doors are turned face down. Players move around the board by moving to the next face down card in a straight line (Up, down, left or right). Face up cards or spaces can be jumped over.<br/><br/>During play if a monster is flipped over and the same monster is also in the row or column then the player gets &quot;scared&quot; and has to take the monster card they landed on. The player then runs to a face up door card that has no current players on it. There are also bonus cards that have special effects when activated.<br/><br/>The game ends when players can no longer move as there are no cards remaining face down. To win players count the scores on the monsters they collected and the lowest score wins. If there is a draw then the last player that had a turn wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player rolls a die and moves his or her player piece. Depending on what space the player lands on it dictates what they do. If they land on a &quot;?&quot; Block they will get coins or, if they are lucky, powerups. If the player lands on an enemy space they must defeat an enemy using items or face losing a turn or coins. Finally, to move from World 1 to World 8 a player will have to successfully complete a mini-game to beat each world. Players collect coins as they journey to World 8 to defeat Bowser. Only with powerups picked up or purchased with their hard earned coins can a player defeat Bowser and rescue Princess Peach. The first player to defeat Bowser is the winner!<br/><br/>In the mini games you have to beat various enemies using die rolls and augmenting them with powerups players purchase at Toad Houses or find along the trail.

In a drinking party in Japan, 'reverse' means &quot;to reverse what you have ingested&quot;.

Their favorite beverage's alcohol counts zero, and hated one counts double toward their capacity.<br/><br/>Each turn, you may choose to quaff a beverage (draw a card), and if the total amount of alcohol exceeds your character's capacity, the character 'reverses' and you are out of the round with no victory points. You should stop drinking before your character 'reverses'.<br/><br/>When any character would quaff a beverage (after drawing a card but before resolving it), you may make an 'alhara' (alcohol harassment) to force any character (including yours) to quaff that beverage. You have limited times of 'alhara' attempts.<br/><br/>At the end of round, each non-'reversed' player gains victory points according to beverages their character has quaffed.

Players are given events to complete that are located around the city board. They have to navigate their way to these locations by moving their character and twisting the rings on the board. Any areas that are not defended succumb to darkness and the maze becomes harder to navigate<br/><br/>It is a mid-level game taking around 60-90 minutes to play. The length of the game can depend on the rule variation used by players. The key reasoning for that is that the use of the timer (whilst recommended) is not compulsory. This, among other rules, allows flexibility among players to play Everdark in a way of their own choosing.<br/><br/>",

The board size depends on the level you wish to play - the bigger the board, the deeper the game.<br/><br/>You control a block by controlling the tower of the block and you control the tower by having the top house of the tower. On a standard 8x8 board, you win if, at the start of your turn, your tower is the highest and has a height of at least 8 houses. Alternatively you win by defeating other towers and taking at least 4 sets of prisoners.<br/><br/>Take turns to place one of your own tiles in an empty square or any number of tiles of any color beneath already placed tiles to build a tower.<br/><br/>There may only be one tower in a block and its colors must correspond to the colors of the block, i.e. two black tiles in the block allows two black tiles in the tower.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>When two blocks grow together, an equal amount of tiles is removed from the two towers, leaving only the strongest tower but potentially with a new controlling color.<br/><br/>The challenge of Lucca is to time the tower building and removal so that your own color prevails in the end.<br/><br/>The unique mechanism of Lucca is the four dimensional thinking where not only the block area and the tower height must be taken into account but also the timing of the removal. All this is accomplished in a pure and elegant setting where luck plays no part.<br/><br/>",

In AD1153, Earl Harald Maddadson and a group of his men sheltered there during a snowstom. The sagas tell us that Rognvald found treasure there and that two of Harald&rsquo;s men went mad. When the Victorians opened the tomb in 1861, they found Runic graffiti demonstrating that both of these episodes were based on real tomb-breaks. This game combines the two events from the 1150's and casts you as Harald and Rognvald.<br/><br/>The game uses a deck of cards, a player board and tokens to simulate your escape from the tomb. The player has a limited number of health and action tokens, which can be removed through normal play or through negative card effects. The player plays cards from hand and these can be positive as well as negative - removing passage tokens (leading to victory) or gaining extra action or health tokens.<br/><br/>",

The Action Bar contains Evade, Target Lock, Cloak and Sensor Echo Actions. The ability to cloak and sensor echo is what makes the Vor&rsquo;cha class ship so dangerous. The generic version of the ship loses a shield and a Weapon Upgrade slot for 2 less SP. The I.K.S. Toh&rsquo;Kaht has a special ability that allows you to take an action to place a Scan Token and an Auxiliary Token beside your ship. Since the I.K.S. Toh&rsquo;Kaht normally lacks the Scan Action, being able to perform a Scan Action sets this ship apart from other Vor&rsquo;cha class ships. Kaybok is a level 3 Captain that allows you to re-roll a number of your attack dice equal to the number of Tech and Weapon Upgrades deployed to the defending ship. Kaybok will make sure your attacks find their mark, especially against ships with lots of Tech and Weapon Upgrades. The Elite Talent Upgrade in this blind booster is Covert Mission. As an action, you may disable all of your remaining Shields and target a ship at Range 1-2 that is not Cloaked and has no Active Shields. Discard this card to steal 1 Weapon Upgrade on that ship with a cost of 5 or less.<br/><br/>",

To please their masters, they decide to form a band and create some nice music, which they think will attract their masters' attention.<br/><br/>However, the pets have only a smidgen of musical knowledge from looking at their masters' practices &mdash; five lines, notes, basic beats, etc. &mdash; so they find it very difficult to compose music. Therefore they decide to start from the simplest point and use their masters' instruments to make a piece of music. And they name the band following the great musician Mozart as &quot;MONZART&quot;! After all, the pets are animals, so they cannot control their temper properly and sometimes just release their temper for no reason.<br/><br/>During Monzart, players act as one of the pets, trying to use their hand cards to place as many music notes in clef as they can to score points from the notes and the combinations of notes. If you found yourself in a hard position, don't worry! You are a pet and are allowed to release your temper! You could be angry, or you could be upset! Either way, you can use this reason to override your situation!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, whoever has the most points &mdash; from the game itself plus the final number of the notes &mdash; can attract the masters' attention as the &quot;Best Composing Pet&quot;!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wizards and Unicorns is a fast-paced card game about battling unicorns, wizards, unicornwizards, elves, and pegasus set in the city of Unicornopia. You dive into the role of one of them trying to gain control over the Stone of Sigma. In order to achieve this, you try to gather fans among the wizards in town.<br/><br/>In a match of Wizards and Unicorns, you battle with your foes for fan markers by playing showtime cards and hoping to keep them on stage. As the players take their turns, the draw pile will soon run empty. The game ends as soon as a player manages to get a certain number of fans or the draw pile runs empty.<br/><br/>The game consists of roughly 50 uniquely styled and funny cards, each featuring many different effects, offering you the possibility to play the game with many different strategies. The vast options of combining them and the growing intensity as the draw pile shrinks lead to many new and exciting situations.<br/><br/>",

All you need is to demonstrate a firm hand and fruitful estates. A strong sword and loyal followers are also required to maintain your lands and ensure the villagers are providing the proper taxes. You must also be able to defend your territories from rival Lords and invading Normans and plundering Vikings.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE<br/>Players assume the roles of Saxon Warlords in Dark Ages Britain (AD 980-1080) with the goals of expanding and improving their territorial control. Warlords do this by raising Retinues and conquering neighboring territories. Warlords can, also, improve their holdings by building Hamlets, Manors and Castles. A Game consists of up to 10 Campaign Seasons. Players may agree to play fewer or more as desired. The Player, who at the end of any Campaign Season (Spring, Summer or Autumn) controls the greatest Settlement Value from their Hamlets, Manors and Castles, is the Victor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spice Planet is a card game for three to eight players, playable with two standard decks of playing cards.<br/><br/>&quot;He who controls the Spice controls the Imperium!&quot;<br/><br/>The Galactic Imperium is completely dependent on the addictive Spice produced on only one world, the Spice Planet. From time to time, the Great Houses vie for influence on the planet with both armies and intrigue.<br/><br/>Objective: Be the first faction or alliance to control four cities, or control the most cities before a ceasefire ends the game. Control a city by building a stack of cards that is larger than all opposing card stacks on that city. Obtain more cards by controlling cities, trafficking in the spice harvest, and engaging in reputational intrigue.<br/><br/>Turn Sequence: Repeat this sequence each turn until the game is over.<br/><br/>1. Weather: determine the first player in the turn order by flipping cards from the top of the draw deck to the harvest pile until a player&rsquo;s suit is drawn; the first player starts the action phase and decides if turn order proceeds clockwise or counter-clockwise. Each time a face card is drawn, alliances may be made or broken.<br/><br/>2. Action: each player in turn order either takes an action or passes; when all players consecutively pass, the phase ends; then, check for military victory.<br/><br/>3. Harvest: player or players tied for the most cards in pile draw 1 for each enemy suit present in pile then take 1 of own cards from pile.<br/><br/>4. Intrigue: reveal the intrigue pile; player or players tied for the least cards in the pile draw 1 for each enemy suit present in pile then take 1 of own cards (if any) from the pile.<br/><br/>5. Income: shuffle and place all discards at the bottom of the draw deck; give each player 1 card, then award 1 card for each controlled city, then award 1 card for each adjacent pair of controlled cities.<br/><br/>Military Victory is declared at end of the Action phase by a single player or an alliance that controls 4 cities. The victors seize control of Spice production, forcing an end to the hostilities, and the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>Ceasefire is declared if the draw deck is depleted.  The player who then controls the most cities wins a Political Victory, but a tie is a Stalemate with no victors. Exception: see victory conditions for The Nomads and the Guild.<br/><br/>",

The Confederate Army have been caught attempting to cross the passes over South Mountain in to Maryland.<br/><br/>Historically the Union came into possession of the Confederate Special Order 191 which showed the disposition of the Confederate Army in the Maryland Campaign. Acting of this information General George B McClellan sent the Union Army to attack them at the passes of South Mountain.<br/><br/>South Mountain is a single day battle that has a time limit of 7 bounds, 13 with extended play option. The Union must capture the six marked objectives. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 1-2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in two halves, the South Mountain seven page Battle Rules, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty one page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice. The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.<br/><br/>Can you continue this great series of battles with another victory? Play North or South in this the twenty third game of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.<br/><br/>",

However, it has layers of depth that will please the more experienced gamer.<br/><br/>During each turn a player may take one of two actions, that of playing a Soul Token or switching an existing Soul Token's Position. Once the Soul Token is placed or a Soul Token is switched, the turn then goes to the next player. When you have 3, 4, or 5 of your Soul Tokens in a Row or Column, you remove them and score points equal to the number of tokens you remove.  All Tokens above the removed Soul Tokens fall to the bottom most portion of the board.  The first player to reach 15 points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Litterarum is a compact word game inspired by Tim Fowers' Paperback and Shh of Chris Handy.<br/><br/>Players try to score as many points as possible by building the most valuable words from available letters that are changing every round.<br/>Letters are drawn from every players' hand and played simultaneously. Then a player on the left of the one holding the &quot;inspiratione&quot; card must create the most valuable word from letters in play, being followed by player on his left. Letters in a word may repeat freely.<br/><br/>Instead of standard letter cards players can play wild letters that can be used instead any other letter that is not currently in play. However, every wild letter card can be used in a word only once and does not score a point.<br/><br/>Every standard letter is worth a point. A player with the most valuable word (in case of deuce a player with the least amount of wild letters used in a word or a player whose word value was not beaten) becomes a winner of the round.<br/><br/>If a player doesn't want to score in a round, he may choose two other actions: getting an inspiration and passing. Inspiration can change owner only once per round, passing can be played anytime.<br/><br/>The winner of the round adds one card from draw pile among letters in play and then takes two of them back to his hand. After that, a player on his left hand picks one letter and so on until all the letters are taken. Then a new round begins.<br/><br/>When the winner of the round draws a &quot;+1 littera&quot; card, he puts it above the vowels card. From now, players repeat letter-picking phase for every such card in play, playing more letters, giving them more possibilities.<br/><br/>Game ends when the draw pile is empty. Players play one last round, winner gets the vowels card and then every player counts the amount of cards in hand.<br/><br/>A player with the most cards is a winner. If more players have equal amount of cards, a player with more wild letter cards in hand wins. In case of deuce a finalist sitting (clockwise) nearest to the player with inspiration card (or a player with an inspiration card himself) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

After the first player has visited four out of the six municipalities in the game, and defined one of the six as an end goal destination, the first player to get there wins the game.<br/><br/>(The name Munkki translates roughly as Donut in this context, but instead of driving in small circles to leave skidmarks, in the local slang it refers more to cruising ie. driving some popular short repetitive route, such as driving around the block. Often in the company of other such drivers - a pastime that has always been popular among the youth of this region.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A party game for literate degenerates. Mash up epic quotes!<br/><br/>EndQuotes lets you mash up hundreds of unforgettable lines from movies, tv, songs, books, and more! It consists of two decks of cards: one with quotes with their endings missing, and one with those endings. Each round, the active player draws a quote card, then the other players each secretly choose an ending card in their hand to end that quote with and plays it face-down on the table. The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the ending card that, in his opinion, is the best ending for the quote. The winning player gets the quote card.<br/><br/>Once a player has won a pre-determined number of quote cards, that player wins.<br/><br/>",

The game starts by the players making puns out of their own names. Whoever has the best pun becomes the Pundit. The Pundit has a hand of 5 Topic cards, they draw a Scenario card from the deck and read it aloud to start the round. Each Scenario shows a unique fictitious situation. The Pundit then plays a Topic of their choice from their hand and the players must make as many puns as possible by combining. At the end of a round the Pundit awards the Scenario card as a point to whoever made the best, worst or most puns. The game ends when a player reaches 10 points. <br/>At any point in a game, if a player makes a pun that causes everyone to cringe they can be awarded a Cringe card as a reward. Depending on how you're playing these may count as a point.<br/><br/>",

The object is to win five points (cards) by being the best or worst at completing short phrases. In this game players get points for being awesome or terrible. The Judge decrees who are the best and worst Scribes in each round, while a Bomber, a Scribe who modifies others&rsquo; responses, hopes to gain the advantage and win the round.<br/><br/>FINISHIT is like Cards Against Humanity and Balderdash had a baby, a very funny baby.<br/><br/>It has lots of player interaction, like eruptions of laughter, suspicion, accusations, and clever jabs.  It's full of surprises, like when grandma and little johnny both win, or when your shitty answer suddenly turns out to epically awesome. FINISHIT is flexible too, so you can play with the family, or the guys at the hunt camp, or at the sweet sixteen party. And the artwork and branding is great... it says shit right on the box!<br/><br/>",

It celebrates 67 years of events and characters of Sanremo's Festival, setting them in a fantasy universe.<br/><br/>(The Sanremo Music Festival, or &quot;Festival della canzone italiana di Sanremo&quot;, is a popular Italian song contest and awards ceremony. It is held annually in the city of Sanremo, Liguria, Italy.)<br/><br/>PURPOSE OF THE GAME: Being able to bring your opponent's life points to 0<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>It is played exclusively in two (1 Vs 1) and with a single deck of cards. The two players (Challenger A and Challenger B), after having shuffled the deck, draw 5 cards each.<br/><br/>The remaining cards remain available to Challengers who at the end of each round of play will draw one or more cards, depending on how many will they play, so you always have 5 cards. Each Challenger has 5000 Life Points to start.<br/><br/>In the first round, the Challenger A plays his first card, chosen among the 5 in their possession. The Challenger A is in the process attack, then the ATK (Attack) points of the card played will be those to be taken into account. The Opponent B, vice versa, is located in defense phase, and then play one of 5 cards in his hands, considering the DEF (Defense) points associated with it. If the ATK points of the opponent A will exceed DEF points of the opponent B, the Challenger to win the turn and the difference between ATK of A and B will be the DEF points to be subtracted to the Opponent's Life Points B. If the ATK points are equal to or lower than DEF points opponent, no Life Point will be subtracted from the Challenger B.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, played cards are collected in a new deck (the discard pile), and the two Challengers will fish from the draw pile as many cards as they were played before moving in round next. He will fish for the first Challenger will play in the Attack phase (in our case, it is for the Challenger B).<br/><br/>This continues round after round, until the the deck runs out. Then all the cards collected in the discard pile will be reshuffled and put back into play. Repeat for 5 times at most.<br/><br/>The winner will be the one who will manage to bring the Life Points of the opponent to 0, or the one who at the end of the 5th phase of the game has higher Life Points.<br/><br/>",

It also features Team Galactic's Pok&eacute;mon and various Trainer cards based on them. Platinum also introduces two new mechanics to the Trading Card Game. The first new mechanic is a new type of Pok&eacute;mon known as Pok&eacute;mon SP. The second new mechanic to be introduced is the Lost Zone. The Lost Zone is essentially a second discard pile: however, it is not located in the play area. Hence, cards that are moved to the Lost Zone cannot be retrieved by cards which specify the recovery of cards from the discard pile.<br/><br/>Platinum features 130 new cards. Theme Decks feature a full 60 Pokemon card deck with special holographic foil card , metallic coin, and damage counters.<br/><br/>Platinum roughly corresponds to the contemporaneous Japanese-language expansion Galactic's Conquest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the Battle of Kursk began a large-scale offensive of the Soviet Army. On leaving in 1943 to the Dnieper the Soviet command had decided immediate crossing it. This option does not have any time to the Germans to strengthen the left bank of the river and turning it into an impregnable &quot;East Wall&quot;. Due to the haste of the operation craft sorely lacking, so the main forces crossed the Dnieper on improvised means: fishing boats, makeshift rafts of logs, barrels, tree trunks and planks. The entire burden and forcing the first battles on the left bank fell to infantry units. About heavy fights indicates the following fact - for the crossing of the Dnieper in 2438 soldiers were awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union, which is more than the total amount awarded for the entire previous history of the awards. This title was awarded to not only the commanders of battalions and regiments, but also up to the distinguished junior officers (NCOs). Such mass awarding a single operation was the only one in the history of war. In memory of all the fallen Soviet soldiers dedicated to this game. We remember.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The game is designed for two players - one led by the Red Army, the other - Wehrmacht troops entrenched on the banks of the Dnieper. Soviet Player has 6 turns not only to cross the river and take a foothold, but also to keep it to the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game has simple rules and takes 30-60 minutes. Released in the PPP format in the second issue of the magazine Stratagema (Стратагема)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take on the role of an elite Machinist and drive your Wreckers in full metal, robot on robot combat! In The Third Law you are one with the machine, riding the grid, dealing and receiving life-threatening feedback as you strive to cripple your opponents' mind. Control the Nodes or annihilate their Wreckers; either way only one Machinist will walk away with the prize.<br/><br/>With a dynamically shifting battlefield and an unparalleled level of immersion, The Third Law marks a new peak in skirmish level, miniatures wargames. Constant interaction between players anchors a fluid combat system; subroutines are assigned and executed in devastating assaults. Unleash your custom code as lethal programs drive your Wreckers onward in a brutal frenzy of destruction.<br/><br/>There are 4 initial factions in The Third Law, each with their own back-story, motivations, look and play style.  With in-faction options for Machinists, Wreckers and upgrades, each Array selected will be unique to you and the strategy you determine.<br/><br/>The Third Law is a skirmish level, sci-fi miniatures wargame where players take on the role of a 'Machinist'; selecting and controlling their Wrecker Arrays to do battle against rival factions in a dark, near future world.<br/><br/>Starting with your choice of Machinist, you will select, upgrade and control a small team of robotic combatants (Wreckers) in tabletop combat.  Your ultimate goal is to inflict enough feedback damage to the opposing Machinist (while minimising the feedback you endure) to ensure that it is them and not you that is removed from the battleground in a comatose state.<br/><br/>You can inflict feedback in a myriad of ways but most commonly damage to a Machinist is done through the temporary loss of a Wrecker, through The Grid itself (by controlling the strategically significant 'Nodes') or through direct Machinist attacks.  Depending on the faction you chose, you will discover a wide range of options and specialisms that can help you emerge victorious.<br/><br/>With its innovative 'subroutine' resource allocation system, The Third Law is an unparalled tactical challenge for even veteran gamers.  Your choice of Machinist, Wreckers and upgrades will determine the type and quantity of resources available to you in battle.  With each Wrecker making a contribution to the global subroutine pool you begin defining your strategy as you select your Array.<br/><br/>Futher strategic depth is delivered through an ever changing battlefield; as Nodes change hands new fronts open up and astute Machinists can take advantage of the ebb and flow of power across The Grid to inflict further punishment on their opponent.  It may not be enough simply to dominate by weight of metal, often victory is seized by those who can best control the currents of energy and create crippling waves of feedback.  By using your Wreckers to secure and hold Nodes deep in enemy territory you can ensure the safety of your neural pathways while inflicting untold damage on the mental capacity of your foe.<br/><br/>Finally, as the controlling Machinist you are able to bring your own range of special abilities to bear on the outcome of the battle.  With each Machinist equipped with their own custom code you can take advantage of more efficient programmes to drive your Wreckers.  Depending on your class you may find yourself able to support your Wreckers with more effective subroutines or cripple your enemies with devastating viral strikes.  Whoever you chose to play as, you can create a bespoke package of abilities that reflect your playstyle and tactical preferences.<br/><br/>",

If a figure reaches or overtakes an opponent figure, this figure loses it's hat and can't move until the player rolls a 6. At the marked spaces the figures of the same color advance to an inner circle. The colored spaces between circles are safe spaces. The figures may stop there, even if they rolled more than is required to reach that space.<br/><br/>2. The players have to build their figures by rolling a die for the parts they need to assemble their figures.<br/><br/>3. This is a combination of game 1 and 2.

        "description": "Publisher's summary<br/>Safari-Dual is a kind of Chess game, using three kinds of pieces; Lion, Elephant and Giraffe. The board and pieces are made of ceramic.<br/><br/>The Lion is the King and the Elephants and Giraffes are the Pawns. The winner is the first to capture the opponent's Lion, or to move their own Lion onto the opponent&rsquo;s Lion's base area.<br/><br/>Pieces have dual natures; one is their shape and the other is their species.<br/><br/>Players move their own pieces and try to sandwich any of the opponent's piece or pieces. If the player's pieces making the sandwich are of the same species, this is a capture and the captured animals are removed from the board. A Lion can sandwich and capture any opponent&rsquo;s pieces, using their own Elephant or Giraffe piece as the other end of the sandwich.<br/><br/>But the dual nature of the pieces gives the game more complexity.<br/><br/>For example, a player's own Elephant piece will sandwich and capture the opponent's Giraffes and Lion by using the opponent's Elephant. The same specie will work together! Likewise, the opposing Giraffes will work together to capture the opponent's Elephants and Lion. Only the two Lions will not work together.<br/><br/>This dual system is a unique and very interesting system first invented by the designer Mitsuo Yamamoto in 2008, and the game was first produced in 2011, a small and a large edition. A new edition is being produced in 2017 for a Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>",

They are prepared in such a way that you can take command of a squadron of Ships of the Line, or on larger games with many players you may be given command of but one vessel. We would recommend that each player should have up to 3 vessels under his command. Experienced players could probably handle more once they have got an understanding of the game system. The basic rules are quick to learn, and there are a host of optional extras to give the feel for the period.<br/><br/>The basic rules are designed for games set around the turn of the 18th to 19th Century, however they are equally able to be used for the Dutch Wars of the 17th Century, and there are rules covering this.<br/><br/>The game sequence is managed using a card system, which randomizes when, and whose, command and action phases happen. There are advanced and more detailed rules for actions using frigates and smaller vessels.<br/><br/>9 Scenarios and 25 typical ship classes are provided to get you into the game, as well as an easy to follow system to create your own ships based on historical research.<br/><br/>&bull; recommended scale 1/600 to 1/2400<br/>&bull; complexity: 6/10<br/>&bull; level of detail: 6/10<br/>&bull; avg game length 2 hours<br/>&bull; dice required: D6<br/><br/>",

Players take turns moving stones by picking up all the stones in a well then dropping a stone in each well until they run out, moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on the position of the well. A well with only a single stone cannot be moved.<br/><br/>After your move, starting with the well you last placed a stone into, any wells that have exactly two stones may be placed in your scoring well. If there is a well that you cannot score (it has a number of stone other than two and cannot be your well), then any that come after it in sequence may not be scored either.<br/><br/>The game ends when neither player can make a legal move. Any stones left on a players side of the board are added to those in his scoring well. Whoever has the most stones is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1796 the charismatic Irish rebel, Wolfe Tone, convinced the Revolutionary government of France and one of its finest generals, Lazare Hoche, that Ireland was poised for rebellion. Ireland would rise, he insisted, if France would only lend its support. That year, a force of 14,000 Frenchmen on 43 ships evaded the British fleet and sailed into Bantry Bay, Cork County, Ireland where rough weather forced them to abandon their operation and return to France.<br/><br/>Two years and three audiences with Napoleon later, Tone tried again. Three waves of French landings were planned to coordinate with a general rising of the United Irishmen (Protestant and Catholic alike) all across the island. Unfortunately, word leaked and key leaders were arrested in Dublin, triggering an early rising, quickly and brutally put down by a combination of professional troops, recently raised fencibles, local militia and orange order yeomen. The rebellion staggered on through September but only in County Wexford and later in County Mayo with minimal French support, did the rebellion meet with any success.<br/><br/>As for the French, the first wave of 1100 men under the able command of Jean Humbert, stormed ashore in County Mayo in August, 1798. A smaller force landed in Donegal in September under the command of Napper Tandy. Humbert enjoyed a few successes but soon surrendered to the overwhelming force Lord Cornwallis brought to bear. Soon after, Tandy abandoned the Emerald Isle when he realized he could no longer be of service to Humbert. A month later and further North off the coast of Donegal, a second wave of 3000 men under Jean Hardy and Wolfe Tone himself met with disaster.  Hardy&rsquo;s fleet ran afoul of the British fleet and Tone was captured. Imprisoned and condemned to hang, Tone committed suicide. The third and largest wave of French soldiers never sailed.<br/><br/>Without determined French support the Irish rebellion of 1798 stood little chance of success. Historically it was a bloody great uncoordinated fiasco made worse by the early demise of Tone&rsquo;s benefactor, General Hoche to consumption. History might have been different if the stars had aligned, if those key Irish leaders had not been captured and their plans revealed, if the rebels had received a sizeable number of French and British arms, if Hoche had survived. If a second and even a third wave of French regulars had landed, and if those French regulars had landed while the rebellion was still vibrant, then &ndash; then, as WOLFE TONE&rsquo;S RISING reveals, England would have had a serious problem.<br/><br/>WOLFE TONE&rsquo;S RISING puts the aforementioned what-ifs into play. A short game of seven turns pits English regulars and loyalist militia against the Irish rebels and their French allies. Here, the French play a shell game with the British attempting to land troops in Ireland not once but three times. Here, unknown morale plays a vital role to the outcome of every battle. Here, Local leaders are not cookie cut-outs but individuals who enjoy unique abilities in battle. And here, each battle is assisted by a battle board utilizing fresh mechanics that make each battle a mini-game unto itself.  A note on the leaders used: British and French leaders are key historical leaders, whereas Irish rebel leaders are largely representational.  Anonymous loyalist leaders represent a mixture of militia and yeomen. Loyalist hierarchy was either nonexistent or too confusing to identify specific names.<br/><br/>",

Starting with only Air, Earth, Fire, and Water as ingredients, play Formula cards from your hand to make valuable Materials. These Materials are worth Coin towards winning, but can also be used as ingredients for Formulas that steal, transform, destroy or regenerate cards.<br/>      Alchenemy combines elements of resource management (cards that count towards winning can be discarded to perform actions), &ldquo;take that!&rdquo; (inevitably, someone breaks out the Aqua Regia and dissolves something you were really attached to), and a novel mechanic that gives players some control over when the game ends: you choose whether to draw from a common, limitless deck of basic resources or a limited, personal deck of more powerful cards &ndash; with the catch that the game ends when any personal stack is exhausted. Two, three, or four people may play and it should take first time players about an hour to finish.<br/><br/>",

There are four pieces to every record A,B,C and D. A and B make the song name and C and D make up the first line of the single. You have to then make up, oh and also, sing the next line for your single to make it into the charts.<br/><br/>Whilst moving around the board you can steal, pass and lose un-used pieces of the record. But once it's created and in the charts you start to move up the charts and cash in on the popularity. Game play moves clockwise around the board and spaces and action/question cards indicate what the players must do to move play along. create the most successful records and collect money at the right time (preferably before the records slumps) to win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Journey of Existence is a three to five player card game in which players journey through a world filled with dreamy art. Each choice a player makes affects them as the game proceeds.<br/><br/>Key Features of the Game:<br/><br/>Friendly Player Interaction: Journey of Existence is a bit friendlier than most games of its type as there are no discarding or stealing mechanics. It isn't free from all chaos however as its main mechanics of sharing and passing valuable cards around can be just as scary. Strategic players will usually win the game by planning out what cards to pass and which to keep once the inevitable passing happens.<br/><br/>High Replay-ability: Journey of Existence is a game that has so many combinations of card plays that every game experience is unique. The core game mechanics, victory point combination possibilities, and card passing theme ensure that every game is different from the last.<br/><br/>Journey Goals: The game revolves around the theme of Journeying through your Existence by picking up Life Traits important to your style of play. Depending on the type of Journey you decide to have and how it relates to the other players will decide the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>Life Actions: In Journey of Existence your time is limited. Each turn provides 4 Life Actions which can be used to do a variety of things. To do well you will need to balance your plays and keep a close eye on what other players have done in their Journeys so that you can win the Journey Goal Cards at the end.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to visit your 3 sights  and return to the starting point. To win the game you need to do it first. Main difficulty is to recall what subway station is the closest to sight. On the back of the sight card there are 3 hints which can be earned during the game.<br/><br/>In order to move players need to answer quiz question about Moscow and make stakes on the right answer. Every turn player can make secretly a stake or not to bid. After all bids were made variants of answers are revealed - participating players choose their answers. Those who answered correctly can make a move (no bid - 1 station, otherwise - according to the number on their bid). Those whose answer were wrong lose their appropriate bid tokens. Those tokens can be replenished on the specified areas of the map. For 2 moving points player can instead receive a hint about one of their sights. For each sight there are 2 hints, for the 3rd hint player receives exact location of the sight. Also there are cards with random events which are revealed at different locations.<br/><br/>",

The counters indicate the resources to be gain at that location or restrictions/advantages conveyed by that location.<br/><br/>Each player gets a set of counters of a unique colour, plus one unique counter that designates their homeworld. Players share a common set of resource tokens and a common deck comprising two types of card &ndash; basic technologies (of which there are 12 with each player starting at level 1 in each) and special technologies (which do not have levels &ndash; players either have them or they don&rsquo;t).<br/><br/>Each turn has 8 Phases. Within a phase, the start player goes first and play proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/>1. Draw Phase.  <br/>-  Each player draws 2 cards from the Tech Deck.<br/><br/>2. Trade Phase<br/>-  Players may trade/gift Tech cards and resource tokens, as well as make promises and alliances. <br/>-  The player with the highest trade level may steal a random card from any target opponents hand. <br/>-  The player with the highest diplomacy level may declare one target player as an ally. The Ally may not jump fleets onto the diplomat&rsquo;s currently occupied spaces.<br/><br/>3. Tech Phase<br/>-  Each player discards one Tech Card from their Hand and increases their level in that tech by one.  Alternatively, a player may discard one Special Tech Card from their hand and gain that special ability. <br/>-  Any player then may discard 2 cards of the same type to increase their level in that tech by one.<br/><br/>4. Mine Phase<br/>-  Each player gains Resource Tokens (RT) for star fields, clusters and homeworlds occupied, and for Tech cards discarded.  The RT gained is modified by the manufacturing level of the player.<br/><br/>5. Build Phase<br/>-  Players may buy fleets. A fleet costs 4 plus your attack and defence levels minus your miniaturization level. All fleets start stacked on your homeworld.<br/><br/>6. Jump Phase<br/>-  All movement is simultaneous. All players must write movement (jump) orders which are revealed at the same time. An order moves 1 fleet or a stack of fleets you control from one space to another space. Players must include the start and finish coordinates as well as the number of Fleets jumping in the Jump Order. Jump distance and fleet size is dictated by jump level and logistics level<br/><br/>7. Fight Phase<br/>-  If 2 or more opposing fleets occupy the same space, there will be combat until only one side remains. Attack order is determined by Initiative level and the damage delivered is based on fleet size, attack level and defence level of the opposing fleet.<br/><br/>8. Final Phase<br/>-  Max hand size is 3 + the player&rsquo;s research level. All players discard excess cards.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by occupying all opponents&rsquo; Homeworlds at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>",

From the makers of CARDS vs. DICE -CLASSIC- Strategically Lucky comes CARDS vs. DICE -DIABLO- Strategically Evil. A family card game for kids and adults.<br/><br/>CARDS vs. DICE - CLASSIC is all about collecting &quot;LUCKY&quot; cards. However, -DIABLO- works with &quot;EVIL&quot; cards which, by collecting, can lead to elimination.<br/><br/>The deck of cards is dealt evenly among all players. During each turn, players roll two dice, one red and one white. Players then try to match the dice with the cards in their hand. Depending on the exact dice roll and the cards played, players will either gain, give, or avoid an &quot;EVIL&quot; card. If a player acquires seven (7) &quot;EVIL&quot; cards, they are eliminated.<br/><br/>Win the game by ridding yourself of all the cards in your hand or by eliminating the other player(s) by giving them &quot;EVIL&quot; cards. Each game typically lasts 5 to 10 minutes. Prepare yourself to get strategically evil.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>ー　ＫＵＦＵ　ー (クフ) is a Japanese co-op game, where the players explore a Pharaoh's pyramid in the manner of I. Jones. The game was released (and sold out) at the Tokyo Game Market in May 2017 in a very small, home-made production run.<br/><br/>The explorers must discover three chambers within the pyramid; the King's chamber, the Queen's chamber, and the King's hidden chamber, and then find the exit and escape. To do so, they have an ancient document and must decipher its instructions to reveal the pyramid's secrets. Failure means the curse of the Pharaoh will strike!<br/><br/>They fail if they run out of time, or if they cannot explore any more, having misread the secret writings. Key to the game is the ancient book which the players hold. At the start of the game, the pages in the book are mixed up. The players can only read a few pages from the start, and then place a bookmark on a page. The pages have actions, traps, and some icons to discover.<br/><br/>If the bookmarked page is an action, it is activated. If it is a trap, it is disabled. But traps that are not bookmarked can be triggered. Some pages grant icons to be carried be a player, and some actions need icons to activate. Since this is a co-operative expedition, players may swap icons between them, but at the cost of a player's turn.<br/><br/>The players have a limited set of bookmarks, and so must choose carefully which pages to mark. They can continue deciphering the book from a previous bookmark, but only a few pages at a time.<br/><br/>When the start player's turn comes around, the time token moves, which might invoke the curse! If so, the players must escape the pyramid quickly or perish!<br/><br/>The pyramid is made from wood and plastic, the rooms from folded paper, and the ancient book is a filofax - a refillable pocket binder. The bookmarks are small post-it notes. The game is long and weighs a kilo.<br/><br/>Players comments on Twitter say the game reminds them a little of T.I.M.E Stories, a game bound by time. And that the home-made appearance is deceiving, the gameplay is very strong. The actual pages from the ancient book are not shown anywhere, maintaining the secrecy of the game (which therefore must be very language dependent).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>Excavate the newly found pyramid. Decipher the ancient document, deactivate the deadly traps and find your way to exit safely.<br/><br/>新しく見つかったピラミッドを探索せよ。　手元の古文書を解読し、危険な罠を解除しながら無事地上へ脱出するのだ。<br/><br/>",

The other player is the Machines. Each player has their own unique deck. Each deck has 6 suits. Each card has a force value and a special ability. Some special abilities require their ability to be activated, other abilities automatically take effect when the card is recruited or as a Free action discarded from the hand or in-play.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 3 Empire Tokens.<br/><br/>Each round has 6 Phases.<br/><br/>1.  Initiative Phase <br/>-   Players roll high on 1D6. High roll is the attacker. Low roll is the defender.<br/><br/>2.  Fate Phase<br/>-   Each player draws 5 cards from the top of his deck.<br/><br/>3.  Strategy Phase<br/>-   Each player may discard up to 2 cards and draw replacements.<br/><br/>4.  Battle Phase<br/>-   Players take turns starting with the attacker. On his turn a player can either Recruit (put a card into play face up in front them), Activate (use the activation ability of a card in play if it has one) or Pass. <br/>-   If both players Pass, one after the other, the Phase ends. <br/>-   Once a player passes, he must continue to pass, unless his opponent causes one of his in-play cards to be discarded or eliminated. <br/>-   Normally, during the round, a player can only recruit a max of one card from each of the six suits. Some cards as their special ability allow you to recruit more than 1 card of a particular suit. <br/>-   A card can only be activated once per round.<br/><br/>5.  Resolution Phase<br/>-   Add up the modified force values of all the cards in-play. The player with the highest score wins. If tied, players roll high on 1D6 to determine winner. <br/>-   The winner takes an Empire Token from the loser. <br/>-   The winner causes one target in-play card of his opponent to be discarded.<br/><br/>6.  End Phase<br/>-   Each player can allow up to 9 of their in-play cards to remain in play. Excess cards must be discarded. <br/>-   Max hand size is 3 cards. Discard excess cards<br/><br/>The first player to control all 6 Empire Tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A worker placement game for 1-4 players themed on the Pioneer Settlement of Kentucky in 1780.  Settlements simulate places such as Harrods Fort, Logans Fort, and Boones Station with each player representing the settlement leader.<br/><br/>Each player has a Resource Board, a Structure Board and a set of cubes/tokens to track resources and activities.<br/>-    The resource board is a 5x5 grid of 25 spaces and is used to keep track of the 25 different type of players&rsquo; resources (Folk, Housing, Clothing, Happiness etc.)  Each resource has a specific starting value between 0 and 10 and will go up and down during the game as a consequence of decisions made and a range of random factors. Resources are used to expand and develop the players&rsquo; settlement and their use will need to be balanced to ensure a positive outcome.<br/>-    The Structure Board is a 4x4 grid of 16 spaces and used to keep track of a player&rsquo;s structures.  Each player starts with 10 cabins and 2 corral pens but additional structures can be built to expand the settlement.  Structures will require varying combinations of resources (labour, wood and lumber) to construct but will generate benefits for the settlement once built.<br/><br/>Players share an Action Board.  The Action Board is used in the action phase and consists of a 6 x 5 grid of 30 spaces representing the 30 actions that can be taken by players.  Actions (e,g, clear land, hunting, soap making etc.) represent the activities undertaken by the settlers.  Most actions have limits such as resource availability or need for specialists but, if requirements are met, will lead to additional resources and/or advancement of the settlement.<br/><br/>Players can take their turns simultaneously with each turn comprising 2 phases:<br/><br/>1.   Growth Phase<br/>-    Roll once on the Growth Table per 20 Folk you have. Results will result in births or the arrival of immigrants (with some additional resources)<br/><br/>2.   Livestock Phase<br/>-    Gain additional livestock per 5 livestock you own.<br/><br/>3.   Boon Phase<br/>-    Roll 1D10 to gain benefits, normally in additional resources.<br/><br/>4.   Action Phase<br/>-    Players get actions equal to their Folk resource score. Cubes are placed onto the action squares of the Action Board to reflect actions taken.  Adjust resource levels up and down accordingly.  At the end of the phase all cubes are removed from the Action Board.<br/><br/>5.   Hardship Phase<br/>-    Roll 1D10 on the Hardship Table and resolve.  Hardship will result in loss of livestock, grain, food or folk.<br/><br/>6.   Mishap Phase<br/>-    Roll 1D10 twice on the Mishap Table and resolve. Mishaps result in the loss of resources.<br/><br/>7.   Raid Phase<br/>-    Roll 1D10 on the Indian Raid Table and resolve.  Results will be trade, fighting, theft of resources, and in certain cases the settlement might be overrun and the player eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>8.   Consume Phase<br/>-    Each of a player&rsquo;s folk consumes 1 Food and every 10 folk consume 1 salt.  Insufficient food or salt may lead to folk moving away or dying.<br/><br/>9.   Seasonal Phase<br/>-    Each turn represents three months - keep track of the seasons - Spring to Summer to Fall to Winter.  If it is Winter roll once on the Winter Table and resolve.  Dependant on the severity of the winter additional fuel (wood and lumber) may be required and there may be a loss of livestock or folk.<br/><br/>10.  Storage Phase<br/>-    A player adds up the total number of Grain, Food, Lye, Salt, and Gunpowder units he has. If this number is more than the number of containers held he must lose the difference.<br/><br/>11.  Happiness Phase<br/>-    Gain 2D6 Happiness. Gain or lose happiness dependant on conditions within the settlement.<br/><br/>12.  End Phase<br/>-    Ensure all counters and tokens are correctly placed, and no phases or players were skipped.<br/><br/>The game lasts 5 years (20 turns).  The Player with the most awards at the end of the game wins.  There are 5 awards: <br/>-    Population Award: Most Folk<br/>-    Happiness Award: Most Happiness<br/>-    Builder Award: Most Structures + Plots<br/>-    Prosperity Award: Most Money<br/>-    Hoarder Award: Most Grain + Livestock + Food<br/><br/>",

Most soldiers provide 1 to 3 skills (from a total of 18). <br/>-    Aid Deck - these are help and friends you acquire during the game.  Most aid cards provide 1 to 2 skills. <br/>-    Mission Deck - this is the one main objective you are trying to achieve in the last game turn. Most missions require 4 specific skills to complete. <br/>-    Encounter Deck - these are the foes and difficulties you encounter along the way.

If you are missing one or more skills, a random soldier is killed. <br/>-     If you needed to use one or more aid cards discard them. <br/>-     If you completed the encounter successfully roll 1D6: on a roll of 5 or 6 a random soldier is killed anyway (these are dangerous missions). <br/>-    If all the encounters are finished, the squad faces the final mission. When facing the final mission you may draw an extra 2 aid cards. <br/>-    You only win the game if the final Mission is completed successfully.<br/><br/>3.

The game is played by rolling a dice and then moving to feed your own animal with the grass thus the origin of the name CHIYAWA (which means GRASS in Hausa Language).<br/><br/>Player: 2-4 players<br/><br/>Time: 15 minutes average<br/><br/>Content:<br/><br/>I Game board<br/>40 Playing Token<br/>1 dice<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>1.    Players set their animal pen (each player has 10 animals which is signified by the same colour)<br/>2.    Players start the game by rolling the dice (any player can start the game)<br/>3.    Rolling 6 or 3 on the dice allows you bring your animal o the GATE. When players roll a 6, they play again. The difference between 6 and 3 is that, rolling a 6 allows you to roll the dice again while 3 doesn&rsquo;t.<br/>4.    Once animals are brought to the gate, any number rolled can move them on the board either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. They can also move forward and backwards. However, animals will move towards one direction at each turn. For instance, if a player rolls a 4, if they choose to move vertically, they cannot change direction until their next run.<br/>5.    Players can bring in as much animals to the gate as they want till there is no animal to bring as long as they are getting 6 and 3 or they can decided to move the animal already at the gate.<br/><br/>Moving on the board<br/><br/>1.    Players can move forward or backward<br/>2.    Players can move vertically, diagonally, horizontally but can&rsquo;t combine them at once in a turn. If player starts moving vertically, they have to finish it.<br/><br/>Eating Grass<br/><br/>Once any animal is eating grass (when an animal is on a grass box), it is considered that the space/grass is gone in the game and so will not be counted anymore. This means that when any player is moving their animal, they MUST JUMP the space that has another animal on it to the next available space in that direction.<br/><br/>Water<br/><br/>The water on the board is a bonus attraction. Once on it, it simply means to move one step immediately to any direction.<br/><br/>Balance of SIX (6)<br/><br/>If all your animals are in play (that means there are no more animal in your pen) or at the gate and you roll a 6, it means you would have to withdraw an animal that is not already eating grass back to the pen.<br/><br/>End of game<br/><br/>The game ends when any players finish feeding their animals.<br/><br/>To Win<br/><br/>The first farmer (player) to get all their animals to feed (eat grass) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Guardian cards have a base force between 1 and 5. In combination some Guardian cards will generate additional Force. <br/>-    The Adventure Deck.  The 12 Adventures have a force between 17 and 25 requiring multiple Guardian cards to be melded to complete them.<br/><br/>To start flip over the top card of the Adventure deck and deal 5 Guardian cards to each player.<br/><br/>Players take turns with each turn comprising 5 phases:<br/><br/>1.    Peril Phase<br/>-     If an Adventure was completed last turn, flip over the top card of the Adventure deck. Normally there will only be 1 face up adventure card at a time.<br/><br/>2.    Hero Phase<br/>-    If your hand is less than 7 cards fill it to 7.  Otherwise draw 2 cards.<br/><br/>3.    Action Phase<br/>-   You may discard a Tactics card to draw 2 cards (max once this phase). <br/>-   You may discard a Pirate card to look at one of your opponents&rsquo; hands and steal 1 card. <br/>-   You may discard a Place card to discard your hand and draw 7 new cards. <br/>-   You may discard a Ship card to look at next Adventure card.<br/><br/>4.    Adventure Phase<br/>-   You may play cards to make a meld. <br/>-   The combined force of all cards in the meld must equal or exceed the force of the current Adventure in which case you complete it and put it in your Victory Pile. Then discard all cards in the meld.  When making a meld, you can only use one card representing an individual Hero, or Ship, or Thing.<br/><br/>5.    End Phase<br/>-     Max hand size is 8 cards. Discard excess cards. You may also discard additional unwanted cards as well.<br/><br/>The game ends when all Adventure cards have been completed.  The player with the most force points worth of Adventure cards in your Victory Pile at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game for 2 players in which one player represents the West, the other Russia. The premise of the game is that since the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union as a Superpower, Russia has maintained an active war-footing with the West, using every means possible (covert, hacking, criminal, disinformation, hard force, etc.) to subvert and destabilise the Western powers and the new world order. The long term goal is to remain a major player in an illiberal, multi-polar world.<br/><br/>Players share a common deck. Some cards can be used by both players. Some cards can only be used by one side.<br/><br/>The game starts in the year 2000 with each turn representing 2 years. The game ends in 2020. There are a total of 11 turns which proceed as follows:<br/><br/>1.    Players are dealt 7 cards each.<br/><br/>2.    A player may reveal a spy card to look at his opponent&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>3.    Players can discard up to 4 cards and draw replacements.<br/><br/>4.    A player may discard an economic card to draw 2 cards.<br/><br/>5.    A player may discard a military card to make his opponent discard a random card<br/><br/>6.    A player may discard a political card to draw 3 cards and discard 2 cards.<br/><br/>7.    A player may discard a culture card to gain 1 Victory point.<br/><br/>8.    Players reveal their hands.<br/><br/>9.    The player with the highest force total wins the hand.  Every card has a force value but a player can only count cards that match his side or that can be used by both players. A player may only use 1 card of the same type, so for example, he could use one military card toward his total but not two. This is the &ldquo;One-Type-only Rule&rdquo;. If a player reveals a crime card, however, he may break the One-Type-Only Rule, once, unless his opponent plays a law card.<br/><br/>10.   Discard all cards.<br/><br/>If any player wins 3 hands in a row, they win the game.  Otherwise the winner of the first turn gets 1 Victory point (VP), the winner of the second turn gets 2 VP, the winner of the third turn gets 3 VP and so on.

Guests have arrived, orders have been placed, but chef is anxious because he had taken new pizza makers in training, and they don't know where things are in this kitchen.<br/><br/>In this memory-style game from the 90's, pizza ingredients are spread face-down across the board.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION:<br/>Skjuub is a combinatorial game for two players. The name comes from the playing pieces, which are 'skewed cubes'. Skjuubs are 'directional', meaning that their orientation is relevant to gameplay.<br/>Skjuub is in a sense a 'logical successor' to the Series: Tixel of games (Tix, Tixel and Regatta). The form factor is different but the 'gameplay structure' is very similar.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Skjuub is played on a 6x6 square grid. Each player has her own pool of 11 pieces, differentiated by color.<br/><br/>A PLAYER'S TURN<br/>On a turn, a player can either place a new skjuub or move one of her own skjuubs already on the board. The orientation of a skjuub (which side the 'overhang' is facing) is decided upon when placing it on the board. A skjuub can be active or inactive and only active skjuubs may be moved.<br/>A skjuub is inactive if at least one of its sides is fully connected to a similarly shaped side of another piece (regardless of color).<br/><br/>NORMAL MOVES; Placement<br/>When placing a new skjuub on the board you are not allowed make one or more opponent skjuubs inactive. A new skjuub may be placed next to one or more already inactive skjuubs in a way in which it becomes inactive itself as well. Such placement does not result in the player getting a bonus move (see section 'BONUS MOVES').<br/><br/>NORMAL MOVES; Sliding and tumbling<br/>A move can be either a slide (in which the orientation of the skjuub remains the same) or a tumble (in which in which the orientation of the skjuub does change - the overhang 'switches' to the opposite side).<br/>In a single move a skjuub may be slid as many squares as wanted (horizontally or vertically along its row or column) but may be tumbled only once (to an adjacent square from where it started the tumble, either in the direction of the overhang or in the opposite direction).<br/>When placing, sliding or tumbling, other skjuubs that are on the board may not be 'disturbed'; their locations and orientations must remain the same.<br/><br/>BONUS MOVES<br/>Chaining moves is important as this temporarily unlocks additional move types (besides placing, sliding and tumbling). If a skjuub that is slid or tumbled is made inactive at its end position - i.e., it's sacrificed - the player gets a bonus move. As a bonus move she can do one of the following:<br/><br/>        - one of the normal moves; place, slide or tumble one of her other skjuubs. These slides and tumbles (but not placements) can themselves result in additional bonus moves.<br/>        - pick up one of her other skjuubs from the board (not the one skjuub that was just sacrificed!) and place it back in her pool of available skjuubs.<br/>        - turn one of her active skjuubs a quarter turn clockwise or anticlockwise. The skjuub that is turned must also still be active after the turn (it may not be sacrificed by the turn).<br/>        - pass the bonus move.<br/><br/><br/>When turning a skjuub, other skjuubs that are on the board may not be 'disturbed'. When picking up a skjuub, other skjuubs may temporarily be moved aside to make picking up the skjuub easier but they must be returned to their original locations and orientations afterwards.<br/>One or more other skjuubs can also become inactive by a skjuub being sacrificed. Skjuubs may also be sacrificed adjacent to other skjuubs that are already inactive though (regardless of color).<br/><br/>NO BACKTRACKING<br/>Players are not allowed to undo their previous turn by playing it 'in reverse'. If the previous turn had one or more bonus moves, only the very last bonus move may not be played in reverse.<br/>The main point of the rule is to prevent players from tumbling or sliding one and the same skjuub back and forth in consecutive turns. Therefor it is allowed to pick up a skjuub that was placed in the previous turn. Players are also allowed to alternate between sliding and tumbling the same skjuub repeatedly.<br/>There is one exception to the rule: Backtracking is allowed if it captures an opponent piece (and the piece that does the backtracking becomes inactive itself too).<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME<br/>A player loses the game if, at the beginning of her turn, she does not have at least one active skjuub on the board that is both able and allowed to slide and/or tumble.<br/><br/>",

The originally designed game set in compact packaging with bright an unusual animal drawings is a great solution for this fun game and complementary for acquiring the basics of mathematics. Play and get smarter. This game is played in background mode, so you won&rsquo;t have to convince your child to sit down at the table. Not only will children learn how to count, but they will instantly learn to define the number of objects on a card as well, which definitely separates this method of learning from cramming in a positive light. Adding within ten can easily become second nature to your child. HurriCount is a great supplement for developing your child&rsquo;s attentiveness, logic, thinking speed, and reaction time. HurriCount has an application called HurriCount Mathitude where you will get to solve problems that are even more challenging. The cards from this game can be gradually added into HurriCount, making it more difficult, and you can also use it as a standalone playing set. When buying the two games at the same time, you will be able to receive a cut little bag that you can carry the games in.<br/><br/>",

Their objective is to memorize orders to gain tips, but in order to carry them it will be necessary to judiciously use the Event Cards, to thwart the plans of the other players.<br/><br/>The main difference with the original game is the goofiness of the ingredient names as &ldquo;Jus de limace&rdquo; (slug juice), &ldquo;Sodas Inconnus&rdquo; (a game play around &ldquo;Soldats inconnu&rdquo;, ie. &ldquo;Unknown soldier&rdquo;) or &ldquo;2 MiMoore&rdquo; (read in french as Demi Moore). This renders the orders far more difficult to memorize.<br/><br/>The game consists of 55 cards and is suited for 3&ndash;10 players Ages 7 and up (but is this a pun about the soda drink?).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spirit Realms: Tengoku-SR is a 2-4 player army fort builder card game that revolves around a retelling of the gods as animal warrior spirits called Spirit Masters. Each warrior is Ruler of 1 of the 9 realms in the world of Tengoku, SR Prime being the first realm. Each realm is represented by a Spirit Master who comes with his own deck of power, each deck with it's own strengths and weakness. Some decks are magic based, with tech elements some are Mental based with Earth elements while some decks are defensive and others are passive. You can choose which characters and deck(s) represent your goals and personal strategy, and play them as stand alones or combine them with other decks to create your own unique decks.<br/><br/>Players must protect their throne by defending their forts from being destroyed while attempting to capture their opponent's Throne. Players get to build forts and barriers while using minions to build armies, while learning basic gameplay players are able to invent unique strategies.<br/><br/>",

To start each player in turn places one of their four counters in any slot of the nine slots around the circle on the board.

The Bavarian chief of staff, Ludwig Freiherr von der Tann, met with the Austrian leadership and suggested that the Bavarian army march into Bohemia. There they would form the left wing of the Austrian North Army, and along with the Saxons would hold off the Prussian First Army at Jicin while the Austrians dealt with the Prussian Second Army.<br/><br/>Von der Tann&rsquo;s bold plan might well have given the Allies victory, but the Austrian commander, Ludwig von Benedek, turned him down and Bavaria pursued a separate strategy. By the time Benedek changed his mind and called for the Bavarians to advance, it was already too late.<br/><br/>Battles of 1866: Blood &amp; Iron is an expansion book for Battles of 1866: Frontier Battles. It adds the Royal Bavarian Army to the game, based on the Von der Tann plan. There are six scenarios included plus background on the Jicin campaign and the Bavarian proposal to participate. While this battle never took place, the scenarios are based on actual operational plans.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Fortune &amp; Folly, each player manages their own trading house in a fantasy world set roughly in the Elizabethan era. Grow your trading company by commissioning new ships and direct your fleets to win monopolies on key trade routes and harbors in a race to be recognized as the Queen&rsquo;s Royal Trading Company! <br/>&nbsp;<br/>SUMMARY: <br/>Fortune &amp; Folly is a worker management game with a rich nautical theme and very approachable rules. Event cards are drawn each turn and serve the dual purpose of normalizing game length and driving strategies that become more complex as players get more comfortable with the ecosystem at work in the game&rsquo;s mechanics. But getting into the adventure is easy. You start with three ships and move them between harbors and routes to score points based on the price of the goods moved over that route. Winning harbors allows you to place more ships and grow your fleet. When the last event card is resolved, the player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:<br/>Players start with a fleet of three ships on the board and can grow their fleet to ten by commanding monopolies on the harbor islands. Use trade ships to claim trade routes and gain Fortune points and direct pirates to harry your enemy company's efforts. Players will plan and then take each step of their turn with the help of their turn order card which includes a step to choose a world event card. Three of these events are shown next to the deck, so you'll have three shown options during this phase, or you can choose the top card of the deck at random. Once there are too few event cards to replenish the four options, the current player takes their turn and game is scored. Whoever has the most Fortune wins!<br/><br/>Each turn you will:&nbsp;<br/>1) Draw and resolve a card<br/>2) Move a ship to a route or harbor island sharing a way point&nbsp;<br/>3/4) Optionally, you may get to make additional moves, or move pirate ships around<br/>5) Score points for routes you monopolize&nbsp;<br/>6) Place new ships for each harbor island you monopolize<br/><br/>ATTRIBUTES:<br/>There are four dice, but they are used as counters for commodity prices.&nbsp;<br/>There are always the same number of turns because of the number of World Event cards and there's a mechanic called the Royal Court card that is used to speed up games that start to run a little longer due to players' deliberating more over their turns.  &nbsp;<br/>The World Event cards present the only real randomness in the game, but you'll always have four options (including the option to pick a card at random).&nbsp;<br/>A strategy guide is included in the rule book, so you can really hit the ground running.<br/><br/>Designer Notes:<br/>This game is meant to be super easy to get learn, even for those just getting into the hobby, but to introduce layers as you become familiar with the mechanics. <br/>You'll be carefully planning your move and thinking like a shrewd trade company manager in no time! <br/>This game was developed over the course of almost two decades and we're so proud of how it turned out. Many thanks to Erwin Arozza for his contribution of stunning artwork that we think really brings the rich nautical, sometimes piratey, theme to life. We hope you'll have as much fun playing fortune &amp; Folly as we do!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This sometimes eliminates players' lead spirits as combinations of some elements (such as fire and water) are volatile. If either row has a total of six cards, a scoring occurs. The player with the highest combination of lead spirit and dance partner chooses all cards of one color from the row that caused the scoring. The player with the second highest combination follows, and so on. Cards taken from the row are set aside to score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends at some point after the stock deck runs out of cards for a second time. Players then score the cards that they have collected over the course of the game. Each card is worth one point, but bonuses are awarded according to the number of score cards of the same rank that each player has. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An educational game to help students practice addition and subtraction math facts.<br/><br/>Choose one of the three boards available boards, each with slightly different rules.<br/><br/>In the basic form of the game, players each start the game with 10 cubes.  On your turn, you roll the dice, sum them, and find that space.  If the space is blank, put one of your cubes there.  If it has one cube of another color, bump that cube -- replace it with your cube and return the bumped cube to its owner.  If it has 2 cubes (of any color), miss your turn.  If it has one cube of your color, put a second there and 'lock' the space -- it is now safe from being bumped.  The first player to get rid of all their cubes wins.<br/><br/>On other boards, players roll 2 dice and take the difference or roll 3 dice and take the sum of all 3.<br/><br/>The game can be played with more than 2 players if each starts with fewer cubes (3 players use 7 each, 4 players us 5 each).<br/><br/>This game has been made freely available online as a print-and-play.<br/><br/>The game can be played in a less aggressive fashion by giving each player their own board.  On your turn, roll and cover the appropriate space.  The first player to cover a specified number of spaces wins.  In that form the game is called &quot;Roll and Cover&quot; instead of &quot;Bump&quot;.<br/><br/>",

When you make the right choice, the world moves in the right direction. The more I have more interest, the more transparent the politics. If we want a world where common sense is common, we must respect the importance of politics. And a small board game, Political World, that moves such a politicized book into a real sense of humor can make it easier and more fun for people to come into politics.<br/><br/>Basic rules<br/>Polytical World is basically a marble type game that moves on a dice and can be played from a minimum of two to four (recommended). All players start as members of parliament. The board includes a total of 24 arcades including starting lines and TV discussions, including districts that reflect real politics.<br/><br/>20% approval ratings in 5% increments will be substituted for currency and can be obtained using event cards and power cards. The approval rate certificate is held by the NEC, which replaces the bank, and when the NEC declines, it begins to take over and take away from other players. If you are in prison and lose your approval rate, you will be eliminated.<br/>The event card is the core of the game. It is a 72-card that combines the political and social issues of Korea with satire and humor. There is a variety of events and humor, including the approval rate certificate, loss, and imprisonment. The latest issue is updated every year for each edition.<br/><br/>When the presidential election comes back every 12 months during the contest, the person with the highest approval rating is the president. The president has powerful power and gets the rest of the rest of the players.<br/>The victory condition is to win the president three times in succession, to become the president, to purge the remaining players, or to become the president and have a 100% approval rating.<br/>It may be strange at first, but once the game is started, you can find yourself embroidering a chopper to become a president and defeat another player. This is because, unlike the conventional possessive games, the three-dimensional and extraordinary feelings of power and dominance can be felt.<br/>The game continues until one last winner is left. There are a number of factors, including the rules outlined above, the remorse of the conscience, and the privilege of the president. Please feel it directly at the Polytical World 2016 edition.<br/><br/>",

On the central gameboard you need to put down your tokens and get rid of all of them.  You can put a vehicle after a vehicle of the same color or the same shape.  As you lay out your pieces you create a big traffic jam across the board.  Some cars have no special function others make the next player to skip a turn, give the player an extra turn or makes the next player take more tokens.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get rid of all your tokens, when you have one token left, you need to shout something or you need to take a new token from the reserve.<br/><br/>The game is played totally on magnetic surfaces which is nice.  The players get their magnetic tokens on parking lot cards in their hands to keep them secret.  The board is laid out in the tin lid thus making it magnetic itself.  This makes it perfect to play everywhere.<br/><br/>There are 32 car tokens, 3 parking lots and one main board in the box.<br/><br/>",

Using the same components, you can also play Dice Maze (サイコロ迷路) (Saikoro Meiro).<br/><br/>Dice King Chess is an intellectual game that combines a dice puzzle game with mini Chess and Halma. The game is played on a Chess board, with a set of dice instead of pawns, and a poppel for the King. A player may move one of their dice pieces according to the number showing on the top face of the die. As the player moves the die, it is rotated in the direction moved - move one space left, the die rotates leftward - move one space forward, the die turns one side forward. In this way, the number showing is changed when the die ends its movement, and this new number dictates where it might move to next.<br/><br/>Dice pieces are captured by being landed upon. The first player to either take their opponent&rsquo;s King or have their own King move to the top corner wins the game.<br/><br/>Once you get familiar with the game, you can add extra rules, such as &ldquo;a player can only remove an opponent&rsquo;s die if both dice have matching numbers&quot;.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ダイスキングチェスは「サイコロパズル」と「ミニチェス」と「ハルマ」が混ざったようなイメージの頭脳ゲームです。<br/>サイコロは上になっている目の数だけマス目に合わせて転がり、先に相手の王を取るか自分の王が上の角に到達したら勝ちです。<br/>ゲームに慣れてきたら、「同じ目にならないと相手のサイコロを取れない」などの追加ルールを加えたり、別ゲームの「ダイスメイズ」をプレーできます。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CHESSaga is a fantasy/chess game where players take their chess pieces on story-driven journeys across custom game-maps!<br/><br/>The hero player controls 3 chess pieces -- a knight, a bishop, and a rook. On each map, they face 1 or more enemy pieces, controlled by the villain player.  An losses the hero incurs are permanent.  On the first 6 maps, the goal is to rescue the captured pawn(s) then escape the board via a specified exit square. On those boards, the pawns are stationary objects. Defeating the enemy piece(s) is not necessary.  On the final board, the pawns activate and join the hero to help them capture the enemy king.  If the hero players makes it through all 7 boards and capture the enemy king, they win.  Otherwise, the villain wins.<br/><br/>With more than 2 players, players split control of the hero pieces.  The rulebook also provides loose guidelines for playing solo and controlling both sides fairly.<br/><br/>The gameboards and rules are all contained in a thin comic-book sized booklet that opens up to different pages for different missions.<br/><br/>",

On some especially good moves you can get 2 or 3 tokens.  <br/>At the end of the game when the board is full of zombies, princesses and that kid next door, the player with the most tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Doppleganger is an expansion unit for Malifaux. He belongs to the Neverborn faction.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>The Doppelganger can be almost anything you need it to be. Doppelganger can (0) Mimic any action on a Non-leader models stat card or Upgrade as long as it doesn't list a model by name. It can be either an enemy or friendly model's action and there is no resisting if you want something from your enemy. Doppelganger can't declare Triggers with these actions but you can still make it a huge advantage, should you fail something important (Example: a Lure from a Beckoner, you basically get 2 more chances to that with the Doppelganger, if you get the right Trigger to Mimic (Tomes) you get to do the action 3 times).<br/><br/>The Doppelganger also brings more than that to your crew, with Ill Omens you get the possibility to cheat the Initiative flip before you or your opponent use Soulstones. This can be huge as usually in every game comes a time when it's crucial to win the initiative.<br/><br/>If that's not enough the Doppelganger also has the Ability Don't Mind Me which allows it to make Interact actions while Engaged, which in the right Scheme Pool can be a great advantage.<br/><br/>All this for a very reasonable price of 7 Soulstones becomes a bargain and should be considered in many Neverborn lists.<br/>Mobility<br/><br/>Doppelganger has a very respectable Walk of 6, which makes Doppelganger highly mobile to get where needed.<br/>Offense<br/><br/>While not having a very good offense with Fists (Ml5 and damage track 1/1/2) the Doppelganger can become furious in Offense with Mimic as you can copy the stats of the highest Ml beasts in the game. Should you get charged by a Ml oriented model and survive, you just Mimic the opposing model's offense and hit it back with its own damage track or Mimic another model within 8&quot;.<br/>Resilience<br/><br/>The Doppelganger has an average Defense of 5 and quite good wounds of 8. The main thing in its Resilience comes from Manipulative 14 which forces the opponent to pass a WP 14 Duel to target the Doppelganger. The good thing about Manipulative is that as long as you haven't activated the Doppelganger your opponent must make the duel with every action as you don't gain Immunity to it as you do with Horror Duels. This can deter a few models from targeting the Doppelganger.<br/><br/>Also, with (0) Blend In (Ca8 mask / TN: 15 mask) you can further up the resilience of the Doppelganger, with a 7 of any suit you get to choose from the following Conditions:<br/><br/>Chameleon: Sh Actions taken against this model receive a minus flip.<br/>A Familiar Face: Ml actions taken against this model receive a minus flip<br/><br/>Playing Against the Doppelganger<br/><br/>Best time to go after the Doppelganger is after it has activated as there is no Manipulative to protect it and in a turn it has used (0) Mimic as then it can't cast (0) Blend In. After that it's quite easy to take down with a big hitter with only Df 5 and 8 Wounds.<br/><br/>",

The renegades have seized control of large portions of Ghirapur. Led by Pia Nalaar and aligned with aether-pirates, essence-drainers and weaponsmiths, they seek to overthrow the authority of the Consulate. The Consulate responds with increased security and surveillance, the seizure of unregistered inventions, the monitoring of aether distribution, and the enforcement of a city-wide curfew. The Gatewatch and Ajani Goldmane support the renegades, while searching for the nefarious planeswalker Tezzeret.&quot; Look for all new mechanics in Aether Revolt like 'Improvise' that enables you to pay a generic mana cost with the help of your artifacts, also look for new cycles and themes to continue exploring the world of Kaladesh.

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Pok&eacute;mon Card VS - ポケモンカード★VS is a Japanese-language expansion; it has no corresponding English-language expansion.<br/><br/>The expansion includes 151 cards.<br/><br/>The VS expansion was distributed in a non-conventional manner. While the cards were still packaged in foil packs, each of these packs contained 30 cards instead of the traditional 10 cards. This was also the first time the term 'half deck' was officially used and became a recognized method of gameplay. There were three random half decks released: Grass &amp; Lightning - 草 雷ハーフデッキ, Water &amp; Fire - 水炎ハーフデッキ, and Fighting &amp; Psychic - 闘超ハーフデッキ. Each half deck contained a random assortment of set type Pok&eacute;mon (i.e. one could only get a Fire-type Pok&eacute;mon in the Water &amp; Fire half deck). Colorless-type Pok&eacute;mon and Trainer cards could be found in all half decks.<br/><br/>The 30 cards in each booster pack consisted of: 11 energy cards, 11 character cards, 6 trainer cards (2 of which were TMs), 1 holo character card, and 1 holo special energy card.<br/><br/>Wizards of the Coast officially stated that they had no plans to release the VS set, primarily because they had competitive play in mind. Some cards from this expansion were still released in English in the Tyranitar Half Deck; however, these cards were produced by MEDIAFACTORY and received a limited release to competitors of the 2001 Tropical Mega Battle. Despite this statement, Pok&eacute;mon USA localized the Generation IV equivalent, Pok&eacute;mon SP when they debuted in the Platinum expansion.<br/><br/>-- summary obtained from:  <a target='_blank' href=\"https://leonhartopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_VS_(TCG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://leonhartopedia.fandom.com/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_VS_(TCG</a>)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Community card poker refers to any game of poker that uses community cards (also called &quot;shared cards&quot; or &quot;window cards&quot;), which are cards dealt face up in the center of the table and shared by all players. In these games, each player is dealt privately an incomplete hand (&quot;hole cards&quot;), which are then combined with the community cards to make a complete hand. The set of community cards is called the &quot;board&quot;, and may be dealt in a simple line or arranged in a special pattern. Rules of each game determine how they may be combined with each player's private hand. The most popular community card game today is Texas hold 'em, originating sometime in the 1920s.<br/><br/>Also known as &quot;flop poker&quot;, community card poker is a variation of stud poker. Players are dealt an incomplete hand of face-down cards, and then a number of face-up community cards are dealt to the center of the table, each of which can be used by one or more of the players to make a 5-card hand. Texas hold 'em and Omaha are two well-known variants of the community card family.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>",

A very good exercise for kids to learn basic math operations!<br/>Some spaces on the board features a fixed number: in this case you only roll the +/- die and move forward or backward of that number of spaces. Other ones show only odd or even number: roll 1 die and advance only if you obtain an odd or even result, respectively.<br/>The track also features a closed loop with a single specific space allowing access to the final section. There's also a few shortcuts, nicely depicted as jumping on a crocodile back or on logs.<br/><br/>",

Once here, they will secretly grow and spread, damaging your crops and wilderness areas.<br/><br/>Fortunately you and your biosecurity team have the skills to stop them in their tracks! Intercept them before they arrive, or find them quickly and eradicate. Can you bust every invasion?<br/><br/>The Invasion Busters board depicts a simplified version of a real biosecurity system (based on that of New Zealand). A deck of cards represents invasive species which may arrive, grow and spread. Players co-operate to allocate dice to different biosecurity activities, then roll the dice to see if their actions have been successful. At the end of the game points are gained for the species successfully excluded or eradicated, and points are lost for any species which have become established. Players compare their score to a scale printed in the rulebook to see how well they did.<br/><br/>Invasion Busters was developed specifically for use in the classroom, to help teach concepts of invasion, biosecurity and population dynamics to 8-12 year olds, but has also been enjoyed by their teachers and other grown up invasion busters.<br/><br/>",

If playing Solo or Co-Op, share the inventory among all the members in your group. If playing competitively, each member attempts to climb the ranks on their own so each of them needs the inventory indicated.<br/><br/>CONTENTS &amp; GENERAL FUNCTIONS<br/><br/>1. MISSION CARDS<br/>The goal of the mission is stated on the Mission Card. Complete all the missions so that your secret society can grow.<br/><br/>Types of missions:<br/><br/>a) Score-Based Missions: reach a certain number of points before running out of 'Stache Cards.<br/><br/>b) Architect Missions: replicate a certain design before running out of 'Stache Cards.<br/><br/>c) Checklist Missions: complete the requirements on a checklist before running out of 'Stache Cards.<br/><br/>2. TOP HAT CARDS<br/>Disguised with a Top Hat, you can infiltrate a new country by revealing what is known as a Top Hat Card.<br/>Top Hat Cards are divided into 9 squares (1 flag and 8 location squares). While you cannot place anything on a flag square, you are considered to have set up a bureau on the flag square the moment you gain access to that country. For this reason, flag squares will count toward completing Secret Agendas.<br/><br/>3. 'STACHE CARDS<br/>Disguised with a 'Stache, you are able to set up bureaus across the world. Each 'Stache Card contains a location where you can potentially set up 1 bureau. To set up a bureau, you must discard the 'Stache Card and place your bureau on the proper tile.<br/><br/>If you cannot or choose not to use a 'Stache Card to set up a bureau, hide the card in your Vault. Rest assure you'll be able to use it later to make investments.<br/><br/>4. YOUR VAULT<br/>This is where ALL 'Stache Cards not used to place a bureau must go at the end of a round. On any later turn, you will be able to use the $ VALUE to make investments. A list of investments is found on the back of the Vault.<br/><br/>5. BUREAUS<br/>These unmarked buildings are setup locations so that your secret society may operate in that country. Be careful when setting your bureau. Should it lead to exposure due to lack of stability, you'll lose this bureau and likely others as well.<br/><br/>6. SECRET AGENDAS<br/>To accelerate your mission, try to complete Secret Agendas. Secret Agendas are patterns you'll want to achieve within any given country. These patterns are determined by the placement of the flag, the placement of bureaus, as well as the placement of decoys.<br/><br/>Generally there is more than one way to complete a Secret Agenda and you can reveal all your options by rotating the card.<br/><br/>Once you complete a Secret Agenda, you may choose to cover up your presence in that country and move onto the next. You can do this free of charge as long as the Secret Agenda has been achieved.<br/><br/>The Cover Up consist of adding a new Top Hat Card ON TOP the components required to complete the Secret Agenda. As long as you successfully manage to do this, you will also Cover Up your completed Secret Agenda Card with a new Secret Agenda Card.<br/><br/>7. TOP HATS<br/>A Top Hat is an opportunity to enter a new country without completing a Secret Agenda. You can gain a Top Hat by purchasing it from the 'Stache Cards in your Vault or you can also gain one by placing a Bureau on a tile with a Top Hat SYMBOL.<br/><br/>When using a Top Hat, you can either<br/>a) cover up component(s) from an already existing tower and climb UP.<br/>b) start a new branch by adding a new Top Hat Card on the ground floor.<br/><br/>8. DECOYS<br/>Decoys can be placed on the tile of your choice (except on a flag) without needing to play a 'Stache Card.<br/><br/>You can gain a Decoy by purchasing it from the 'Stache Cards in your Vault or you can also gain one by placing a Bureau on a tile with a SUITCASE SYMBOL.<br/><br/>Decoys count as a yellow square in terms of your Secret Agendas. They can also be used to provide stability in a country.<br/><br/>9. BRIDGES<br/>Bridges, when required, merge together separate branches within your organization. The need for bridges is determine by your chosen Mission Card.<br/><br/>There are no fees for placing a bridge(s). However, for a merger to be completed, you will need to cover the bridge(s) with a new Top Hat Card. Do this by using a Top Hat.<br/><br/>10. CRISIS CARDS<br/>These cards are for competitive play only. They enable you to run an interference in another member's plans.<br/><br/>Crisis Cards are purchased.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To move, a peg is placed in a vacant hole.<br/><br/>The aim is to take all the opponent's pegs. To take a peg, there must be an empty hole on the opposite side of it, so it can be jumped, and multiple jumps can be made.<br/><br/>The game was deisnged for blind and visually impaited players.

(Thus, there are no diagonal connections.)<br/><br/>On each turn, a player places 1,2 or 3 black stones on any vacant intersection. Alternatively, on his/her turn a player may announce &quot;take&quot;, after which the opponent continues with white and the taker with black, alternately playing single stones onto empty intersections.<br/><br/>Black wins by making a global loop. White wins by preventing this.  A global loop is a string of connected stones that circles the torus (either horizontally, vertically, or both horizontally and vertically) and connects back to itself.<br/><br/>A full guide to rules and tactics is here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/178192/looper-rules-and-tactics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/178192/looper-rules-and-t...</a><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

For example, could be used for 15mm figures if all measurements in cm are taken as inches instead.<br/><br/>Players alternate activating squads or vehicles, using dice to see if their troops successfully execute orders and to resolve combat. Troops are very simply defined by their quality (determining how responsive they are to orders and their accuracy), their armour rating (determining how likely they are to survive being hit), and what weapons they're carrying (determining range and rate of fire). A few extra rules exist to handle special weapons and vehicles: most notably, most antipersonnel weapons can't harm armoured vehicles at all.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/><br/>War of the Rings is a Diplomacy variant written by Jeff Key and published in Chimaera (Issue 13 - Mar 1976).  The basic game follows the 1971 rules, but with numerous exceptions.  The rules were accompanied by a custom color map.<br/><br/>The game supports six players and the named nations are Mordor, Rohan, Gondor, The Men of the North, The Elves, and The Dwarves.  Although fleets and sea travel are de-emphasized, the map presents five sea areas.  The initial setup does not contain fleets and fleets cannot be built.  However the buildable unit &quot;bunchaboats&quot; is functionally somewhat similar.  The land area is divided into an exceptional number of provinces, many of which have an indicated &quot;terrain&quot; that limits which types of unit may enter (for example, only Goblins, Ents, and Dwarves may enter mountain terrain).  There are thirteen neutral supply centers at the start of play, including The Shire.  The initial land setup heavily favors Mordor which starts with eight provinces; The Dwarves starts with two provinces; all other groups start with three provinces.  This forces most, or all, of the players to align against Mordor.  The initial units include special &quot;double strength&quot; and &quot;triple strength&quot; armies.  During play, only normal strength armies can be created.<br/><br/>There is an additional special piece, The Ring, that begins in The Shire region.  No player owns The Ring but any player can move The Ring with any army unit that moves from the area that holds it.  Alternately, some units may &quot;put on&quot; The Ring which then becomes inseparable, conferring some significant benefits (including invisibility - the unit receives orders as usual, but they are not made public unless the unit engages in combat).  If the unit &quot;wearing&quot; The Ring is destroyed The Ring remains in the province.<br/><br/>There are three separate victory conditions: (1) a player may move The Ring to Barad-Dur, destroying it; (2) the Mordor &quot;triple strength&quot; army (AKA Sauron) is eliminated; (3) the Mordor &quot;triple strength&quot; army and The Ring end a turn in the same province.  In the case of (1) or (2), Mordor loses and the relative strengths of the remaining players are compared to determine a winner.  In the case of (3), Mordor wins.<br/><br/>The rules also present several modifications to the standard rules, primarily regarding the &quot;double strength&quot; and &quot;triple strength&quot; armies.  Too, four turns per year are played.  Intended for postal play, the game supports traditional table play without alteration.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An early set of fantasy miniature tabletop wargame rules which were released in 1977 with an associated set of miniatures. The booklet itself is a 12-page A5 book, typeset with illustrations in black and white with colored card covers<br/><br/>As play progresses certain events are triggered. Combat is resolved through d10 rolls, and uses hit point locations to determine damage, while magic uses a point system and carries a chance of misfiring.<br/><br/>A scenario was defined within the rules. The hero player was required to raid through woodland and into a small pre-mapped dungeon area with a team of seven miniatures. Meanwhile the evil player had to use his army of eighty orc-like &quot;Sprites&quot; to defend against the heroes incursion.<br/><br/>From the Rulebook: We have devised these rules for use with the Thane Tostig range of fantasy figures designed and produced by Barry Minot, who also drew the illustrations.<br/><br/>They are intended to give an easy to play, fast moving, fantasy action game, which though ideal for the younger wargamer, will provide a basis on which older wargamers and fantasy fanatics can build, adding as many further complications as their fertile minds may devise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legio VI Julia Augusta is a set of miniatures wargames rules aimed to allow large battles of Roman Late Republican and Early Imperial periods (100 BC to AD 250) to be resolved relatively quickly. It's meant for 6mm figures but could easily be adapted to larger (or smaller!) figures.<br/><br/>The rules are derived from the same designer's Comitatus set of Dark Ages rules, but slimmed down to allow larger battles to be fought in less time. Troops are classed a relatively small number of troop types with minimal differentiation based on equipment; the focus is on troop quality and, especially, generals' limited means of controlling their forces.<br/><br/>The rules are freely available from the designer's webpage, along with sister sets covering adjoining periods:<br/><br/>Legio VI Macedonia, for 400 BC to 100 BC<br/>Legio VI Constantiniani, for AD 250 to AD 600<br/>Legio VI Diadochi, for Alexander and the Successors<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subtitled &quot;Mit Spa&szlig; und Fantasie durchs Moor&quot;, this is a game published as part of the Expo 2000 campaign &quot;Das Tote Moor soll leben&quot; (&quot;The Dead Moor Is To Live Again&quot;) to promote restoration of the Dead Moor area near Hannover, a historic peat stripping site. In addition to the rules of the game, the rulebook contains information on the biotopes, wildlife, history, archaeology and folklore of the moor, although the game itself is not of an overtly educational nature. Max Moorfrosch, the project mascot, also makes an appearance as a joker tile in the game.<br/><br/>The game is set in medieval times and is played on a board of hexagonal spaces representing the moor. Village tiles are placed on the perimeter, and a peat-mining tile is placed in the middle. By placing log road tiles, players race to connect their two villages with a causeway passing through the peat-mining site, and the first player or team to complete this connection wins the game.<br/><br/>Before each turn, a card is turned over to reveal the advice of the village elders, which may involve missing a turn due to bad weather, being restricted to playing a certain type of tile that turn due to a mishap, getting a double placement due to good weather, or some such. Obstacle tiles are also encountered on the board face down, and mostly have to simply be built around, although some when approached and turned up may also offer an opportunity to place a bridge directly across, or require expenditure of special resources (like an offering for the sacrificial site and using torch-lit roads to keep away the ghosts), or even provide the magical power of the Golden Helm to ward off hazards.<br/><br/>The game contains rules for one, two or four players; in the latter case, two players make up a team with partially shared resources, each joining up their village with the peat tile instead of working from one village to the other. There are also suggestions for any number of players to cooperate as one team or compete as two.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "迷いの森 (The Lost Woods) is a co-operative game from Japan. One to four players work together to try to keep Little Red Riding Hood safe from the Wolf, and get her to her grandmother's house. If the players can do this in under eight minutes, they win. If they run out of time, or connect LRRH to the Wolf by the paths, they lose.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to the Ravensburger game Labyrinth. A series of square cards are laid out, six between LRRH and Grandma's cottage. Two more rows of six are laid above and also below, making a grid of 30 squares. Some of the cards show a wolf, all of the cards have paths, turning and branching.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player takes one of the four remaining path cards, and inserts it into the grid from the edge of one of the four sides. This pushes all the path cards along, until the final one becomes open, and this goes into the player's hand for next turn. Players cannot insert a card on the line where LRRH or the cottage are sitting.<br/><br/>After moving the grid, players check to see if LRRH has a clear path to a Wolf, and then a clear path to the cottage. If she is connected to a wolf, they lose. If she is connected to the cottage but not a wolf, they win. If they cannot get LRRH to the cottage before 8 minutes are up, they lose.<br/><br/>Players can make the game harder by restricting the time available, or limiting the actual game turns, to 16 turns suggests the designer.<br/><br/>The game was released at the Tokyo Game Market in May 2018 and early buyers were rewarded with a special set of stickers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Storm Dragons is a competitive game for 2-4 players (2-6 if you use two decks). It plays in about 30 minutes.  The game starts by drafting dragons and storms for your army (beginners can just deal the cards).  The game is played over a series of battle rounds. In a battle, you take turns in clockwise order. On your turn you can add a dragon to your dragon flight, add a storm to your storm front, challenge, or pass.  Both dragon and storm cards have instant effects when played.  Some cards have ongoing effects if the they are the top card in your dragon flight or storm front respectively.<br/><br/>Each round is played either during the day or the night, as selected by the player who starts the round, but some dragon cards allow the player to change from day to night or vice versa.  Most cards have different combat strengths during day versus night and many cards have different abilities in the day or night, so control of the battle may switch back and forth. Play continues until all but one player has yielded. The last player in the battle round wins all of the cards played in the round and places them in their victory pile.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the most dragon cards in your victory pile at the end of the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each player drafts a pack of dinosaurs (dinos), wagers precious stones (tokens), and then watches as their dinos take on their opponents dinos in head to head duels.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of three cards which are arranged in a line face down. These cards are their pack of dinos. Players take turns successively replacing these cards from the deck or discard pile until one player is satisfied with their pack and knocks. The aim is to make a pack that can win the most head to head duels.<br/><br/>When you think you have the best chance of winning the round you can use your turn to knock instead of drawing to replace one of your cards. This causes the play to end after each of the other players has taken one more turn.<br/><br/>The game is played across five rounds and the player with the most stones at the end of those five rounds is the winner. If, at the start of a round, a player can not ante three coins the game is over and that player has lost. Alternately, before the game begins, players may agree upon a set time limit or number of rounds for the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "どうぶつトレカ (Animal Trading Card) is a two player card game with light easy rules. The players are battling each other using decks of cards with animals. One player has daytime animals, the other has nocturnal animals (some animals are both). Each player has seven stars. The first to take the seventh star off their opponent is the winner (you can vary this to make the game shorter).<br/><br/>The game is deliberately designed to be easy for new gamers to play a trading-card style game (like Magic: the Gathering) by learning deck-building. The theme, artwork and gameplay make this an easy introduction into deck building and combative style TCGs. But there is no actual trading involved. The game includes all the cards you need.<br/><br/>Each player's deck has various animals, from large and strong to small and weak. Each animal needs food and players collect enough food to be able to send the animal of their choice into combat on the player mat. Animals have values for strength and heart, the animal with stronger or equal values defeats the other. But food is consumed as they attack, and if the player exhausts their food supply, they lose.<br/>-user summary<br/><br/>The publisher says &quot;Easy to play! Easy to start!&quot;. They say the game is for children and adults who would not normally try a TCG-style game like this. The simple illustrations and easy rules make it a good introduction. The game has 80 cards, 2 play sheets and 1 instruction sheet in Japanese. There is some Japanese text on the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game takes place in 1667, after an edict signed by Louis XIV launched the construction of a canal to connect the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea. Pierre-Paul Riquet is tasked with coordinating this gigantic building project but he needs your help.<br/><br/>In the shoes of one of his engineers, you mission is to build as many sections of the Canal as you can, using available resources the best way possible. Players compete to measure the manpower necessary for each section and earn recognition from Pierre-Paul Riquet. But sudden reinforcements could change the game!<br/><br/>When the Canal du Midi is finished, the player with the most recognition points for the sections they helped build has won the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>Canal du Midi is a quick game played over 9 rounds in about 15 minutes. Players have 9 worker cards, representing varying amounts of manpower. Three of these cards are taken up into their hand, three are open on the table in front of them, and the remaining three form their draw deck. They also get 2 coins.<br/><br/>Each turn, a single section of the canal is revealed that is to be build this turn, and players bid a secret amount of manpower to help complete the section by playing one of the cards from their hand. If the total amount of manpower is enough to complete the section (i.e. beats the target set by the card), the player(s) who bid the most receive recognition points. However, before the section is awarded, all players get the opportunity to spend one of their coins to call up reinforcements. After players have decided whether or not to do so, each player spending a coin may draw a random card from the discard pile, and add the manpower on the card to their bid.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, players draw a new card to bring their hand size back to 3 (if possible). They can draw either the top card of their drawing deck (blind), or one of the 3 open cards (which will get replaced by the top card of the deck). Play continues until all 9 sections have been built (or at least started, if the manpower fell short), and players have played all of their cards. Whoever has the most recognition points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt 10 cards of the 40 cards that does not include the red Strip Tease suit (which are divided into two face up stacks as &quot;points&quot;: 12-7 in one and 1-6 in another one - 13 face down), and the dealer declares if he wants to Defend or Prosecute based on his dealt hand, the other players do the same in turn - until there are two on either side.<br/>The Defenders will try to get the Strip Tease act, by getting their stack moved from 7 to 12 thus revealing the 13th Strip Tease card, the Prosecutors try to avoid the strip tease show to be made by moving their cards on the Theatre's stack to make the stripper more dressed.<br/><br/>The game is then played in partnerships over three to four rounds (Trails) where you play in suits. However Defence can always play a Theatre (Green) card as a trump and Prosecutes can always play a Court (Black) card as trump card. If you can not follow suit you can either play a trump suit (to Object) or play a Prudie (Blue) card.<br/>Highest card wins the trick and places their top Strip Tease card on the other team's pile.<br/><br/>The second variant of the game is played without the Joker, but depending on players can also be wither Paul Pry and Constable cards.<br/>Here you try to avoid taking tricks containing the Theatre Manager (Three months prison), Procecuter (two months prison) or any Strip Tease card (one months prison). The one with least imprisonment is the winner.<br/><br/>No stripping is a part of this game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Scintillating<br/>Topical<br/>Rib-tickling<br/>Prresistible<br/>Thenomenal<br/>-<br/>Thrilling<br/>Ecstatic<br/>Artistic<br/>Surprising<br/>Entertaining<br/>The name describes the game<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of box<br/><br/>",

It's dangerous to go alone, drink this.<br/><br/>Hordor - Land of the Hoarding Dragons: One does not simply walk into Hordor... because there are a lot of useless objects blocking the way. Nobody told these dragons that they should be hoarding valuable treasure instead of this useless junk. Oh is that a yard sale?<br/><br/>Bosses Clubhouse: What luck! All of the toughest bosses hanging out in one place! It's time to save the DQniverse from a Beer-Holder, An Overly Attached Cyclops and Trent, the Bro Hive Mind.<br/><br/>Absolute Power is Awesome: This quest is interesting because you've just killed all of the serious threats to the DQniverse. You've already won. How will the heroes live out their days? Will they use their power responsibly or will you find creative ways to torment the wait staff because you're bored?

The locations on the board are businesses, shops and studios dealing in crafts, such as ceramics, paper and more.

        "description": "The game consists of a web printed on a turntable, 20 wood &quot;insects&quot; in four colors, a black wood spider, 30 spider cards, a wood die, and a wood dice cup.<br/><br/>There are two games described in the rules.<br/><br/>The basic game has players trying to move their pieces (insects) from starting positions around the web to the other side, always moving along a line of the web.  An insect will move either one, two, three, or four spaces (nodes) according to a die roll.  The first player to get all five insects across the board into opposite spaces is the winner.  Sometimes a spider comes up on the die; when this happens, the player draws a card and rotates the web according to the card's instructions.  Therefore the players face a changing board as they try to get across the web.<br/><br/>The advanced game is more interesting:  one player takes the role of spider in a contest between a single spider and up to four other players.  The players still try to get their insects across the board, and the board will still rotate now and then.  A player wins when just three insects make it to the opposite side.  The spider can jump around the outside of the board, or can also generate a web rotation, always looking to get close enough to the insects to devour one.  The spider has to capture three insects of the same color to win.<br/><br/>The die is six-sided with opposite faces:  1-spider, 2-spider, 3-4.  There are 10 cards which indicate a spin of 1 space, 10 with a spin of 2 spaces, and 10 with a spin of 3 spaces.  Half the cards indicate a clockwise direction, and half indicate a counter-clockwise direction (distributed evenly amongst the spin amounts).<br/><br/>",

Using a  deck building mechanic, players must defend their own deck whilst attempting to remove cards from their opponents decks, control fleet movements on a central board, and develop rule-breaking technology.<br/><br/>The majority of cards represent different characters in the Empire with different skills and abilities. Each card is numbered sequentially.Once the central supply deck is depleted the game ends, and the player with the lowest numbered card in play in front of them wins.<br/><br/>Unique player communication rules add to the pressure, meaning that players indulging in thinking time give their opponents opportunity to scheme against them, whereas players who think fast limit their opponents opportunities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Landpower: GAAT (the Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey scenario) is a wargame designed by LTC Patrick Schoof at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College and used for instruction in academic year 2018.<br/><br/>Landpower is designed to drive both sides to plan and conduct sequential operations in a large scale combat environment. Many parts of shaping and combat are intentionally abstracted to allow the intended training audience to focus on appropriate decisions at the division echelon as a division commander and staff. The mechanics of the game are intentionally minimized above and below the echelon of decision. A well-planned operation with its events synchronized usually works most of the time. A poorly planned large scale operation will likely result in failure. Friction is intentionally built in! Landpower was designed to meet educational learning objectives while still being able to stand alone as a wargame. Because of this, most of the instructions ask the reader to treat the conduct of it as an exercise. In the classroom, Landpower is not about the game, but rather the discussion the wargame elicits.<br/><br/>The exercise is conducted over a series of days. Each day is broken down into four, six-hour turns. During the turns each side will have opportunities to conduct operations to achieve their side&rsquo;s objectives.<br/><br/>The scenario in Landpower is conducted mostly in Azerbaijan based on the GAAT (Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Turkey) terrain. Each hex is roughly 6.5km across. The terrain has been abstracted for the division echelon of decision with consideration given to possible second order effects of a particular feature&rsquo;s inclusion or exclusion from the exercise. For example, the terrain at 39&deg;56'42.3&quot;N 48&deg;21'00.4&quot;E was treated as urban, and the northwest-southeast road was omitted because it would not change operations, though the bridge was retained.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The transport capacity of the cube and it's ability to move over the terrain depends on which vehicle the cube represents at the time. Movement of the cube is like a queen at Chess. Each player has 3 movements per turn. Before each movement the player may change direction and/or the mode of transport.<br/><br/>The tracks are stored at the factory at the middle of the game board. The resources (blue square tokens) are placed on the 3 terrain markers with the neutral side up.

Use smart play and nerves of steel to construct the King&rsquo;s steeple as efficiently as possible. Hazards abound and if the steeple collapses during construction or if there are insufficient workers to complete the job you will have failed your King!<br/><br/>Meeple Steeple is a cooperative stacking game played over a number of turns. A game represents an attempt to complete the construction of the steeple by playing through all 5 levels (decks) and successfully placing the steeple piece on top of the structure without it collapsing. Players fail to win if the steeple collapses or if the shared worker pool runs out before playing the steeple piece. You must exercise efficient use of your workers while also using smart play and steady hands to succeed!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Solo Module is designed to slowly reveal an automated plan of battle for the non-player side. The rules determine the command decisions of enemy, non-player generals. They may also be used to automate the decisions of subordinate commanders in one to one game play; adding to uncertainty and unpredictability in &ldquo;normal&rdquo; games.<br/><br/>The first three sections of the module will generate the non-player&rsquo;s dispositions, orders and battle arrays if the game has been generated by a campaign, or if it is a fictitious battle. Alternatively, if you wish to re-fight a particular battle, you can keep the historical dispositions and go straight to section two and then section three and possibly change the &ldquo;shape&rdquo; and events of the battle by varying the non-players` corps orders and consequently also their battle arrays.<br/><br/>The non-player will react in response to your grand-tactical movements or to changes in tactical situation. There is also a section which relates to the delegation of orders applying to minor objectives. Section eight, &ldquo;Tactical Systems, Dispositions and Divisional Battle Arrays&rdquo; is reproduced here from Grand Manoeuvre Miniatures Wargames Rules to provide solo players with more useful information on battle arrays, methods and unit formations used by various nations throughout the Napoleonic period.<br/><br/>Section nine is optional and allows for chance events that may occur in and around the battlefield area that may affect player&rsquo;s and non-player&rsquo;s decisions.<br/><br/>The module has 106 pages. The text is spaciously laid out and the rules mechanisms are very simple.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

In your quest to save the city of Sparta, you hear rumors of a powerful oracle at the temple of Apollo in Delphi.<br/><br/>A skillful memory game for young and not so young, with Medusa&rsquo;s and a dangerous dragon.<br/><br/>Can you remember where matching tiles are hidden on the 8 x 8 square board? Enhance your memory with the power of the oracles matches? Beware! Each time the dragon is found and not matched, it turns the board around, steals your matches and may even win the game.<br/><br/>There is also a TIME SLIDING ALTERNATIVE PLAY.<br/><br/>There are myths and rumors that Pythia mastered the mysterious art of time sliding. She drank the foaming waters that spurted from a chasm in the earth to start her slide through time and banish the darkness. Time sliding is when you experience the same events in a loop over and over again. When you die you slide back in time and start again. The loop can only be broken after success in some great challenge. Otherwise you are doomed to slide for eternity! The secret is to set yourself up for success in the next loop by what you do and remember in the loops before. Many do not believe time sliding exists and that it is possible to successfully escape the slide. Are you bold enough to find out yourself?<br/><br/>Play alone or with as many others as you like. The length of play is timed. Each turn you fail, you replace the tiles so it is easier to remember<br/>the matches. The unmatched tiles and all the tiles you have just collected are placed back onto any open square, before turning them over. Then you start another turn.<br/><br/>There is also a WORLD WIDE EXPANSION.<br/><br/>Pythia was renowned all over the world. Nothing was completely hidden from her sight. Your spatial conception is challenged in this fun experience of your favorite places.<br/><br/>Choose a play area, which may be a room, park, or wherever you want to play. All of the tiles are placed face down, in plain sight, scattered within the defined area of play. Tiles may be on the ground or different objects such as plants may be used to make it interesting to search for the tiles.<br/><br/>Time sliding and the world wide expansion can be played together for a unique experience.<br/><br/>THOLOS IS ONLY AVAILABLE AS PART OF THE ANCIENT WORLD MULTI GAME SYSTEM FROM PLAYFORD GAMES<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Christmas Tree: Essen Special Cards is a mini-expansion for Christmas Tree that consists of two extra objective cards.<br/><br/>Usable: With the normal and advanced game.<br/>Objective: 6 points for each formation containing 3 ornaments: 2 glass ornaments with the same color and shape on both sides of a gingerbread/wrapped candy.<br/>Setup: Shuffle the 2 Special cards into the deck.<br/><br/>During the game: At the beginning of the round, after  the ornament cards are dealt, if you have a Special card in your hand, put it face up into the middle of the table and draw a new ornament card from the remaining deck. After you have chosen your objective cards as usual, place them from the Special card(s) separately (in the advanced game, after the objectives went around.).<br/><br/>The Special cards are objective cards, but not in a standard way. During the evaluation of the objectives at the end of the round, you can choose one (or two) Special card(s) from the table (if there is any), instead of one (or two) original objective card(s). You will evaluate the chosen Special card(s), instead of the chosen original card(s) (but the other players still can use the original objectives).<br/><br/>This way you will score the same number of objectives as usual, but you will have the option to choose a Special objective card - which maybe better fits your christmas tree - instead of one of the original objectives.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>ミッキー&amp;フレンズ 5ファイブリンクス (Mickey &amp; Friends 5 Links) is a Japanese card game for children using the famous Disney characters. The deck shows the animated friends with some cards having more than one character. There is a bank of Mickey coins (including two secret gold coins worth more). Players start with one coin, and the first to get up to five coins wins.<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled and players are dealt three cards each. Some cards are placed face up to start the tableau. On your turn, you draw a card from the deck (no hand limit) and then you must try to add a card to a set on the table. You can play up to three cards, but each must be a different friend.<br/><br/>If you add the five friend to a set, you draw a coin from the pool. If you cannot play this turn, you pay a coin to the previous player (or from the pool if you have none).<br/><br/>プレイヤーは自分の番がきたらカードを1枚引きます。<br/>ミッキー＆フレンズの5キャラクターのカードを1枚以上場に出していきます。<br/>最後の5キャラクター目を場に出した人がミッキーコインを獲得します。<br/>このコインを誰よりも早く5枚集めたプレイヤーが勝ちとなります。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A hilarious drawing game designed by a psychologist to foster creativity.<br/><br/>Research shows that childhood creativity is on the decline and we should all be concerned. This game is designed to foster creativity through an old-school tabletop game that&rsquo;s simple, fun and expands your mind. While the decline in childhood creativity was the impetus for designing the game, it is extremely fun with or without kids and promotes creativity in all. To spice things up a bit for adult game nights, there is also an optional Adults Only Expansion pack.<br/><br/>Each round of Starting Lines provides a creative prompt (a category) and a constraint (the starting line). What happens next is creativity. Everyone gets the same simple Starting Line, but inevitably takes it in a completely different directions. You will be surprised by what kids see in a Starting Line and be brought to tears laughing at what your weird friends find. A judge reviews all players drawings and select the one they like the most. That player collects the category card from that round. Play continues until you decide to stop. The player with the most category cards at the end is declared the winner, and of course deemed the most creative.<br/><br/>The game play can be as quick as 15 minutes or can go on for hours. The game is great for large parties. While the game includes enough markers for 6 players, with more markers you can play with as many friends as you can find.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Censored Game is an adult party game that &quot;censors&quot; how teams of players act, draw and speak clues. It combines elements of Charades, Pictionary and Taboo but takes things a staircase of steps further by adding layers of difficulty and nonsense. With countless combinations of CHALLENGE and CENSORED cards, there&rsquo;s always something new. Can be played in teams or cooperatively and there are three different ways to play! Uncensored Play required players to act, speak and draw the &quot;non-clean&quot; meaning referred to in each Challenge Card. Self-Censored is where players agree on which Censored Cards they will use and remove the rest from the deck before playing. Cooperative Play has all players on one team working towards winning seven Challenge Cards in a row without failing once!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In &lsquo;The Cave,&rdquo; you will play cards from your hand into the dungeon, trying to defeat the monsters and bring home their treasure.<br/><br/>Equipment: A Pairs deck and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>To Begin: Shuffle the deck and deal a hand of cards to each player. The number of cards in the starting hand varies with the number of players, as follows:<br/><br/>Players:    2 3 4 5 6<br/>Cards:      7 6 5 5 4<br/><br/>Next, deal the &ldquo;Cave,&rdquo; a collection of five cards face up in the center of the table. Play will start on the dealer&rsquo;s left and proceed clockwise.<br/><br/>On Your Turn: You will play one card from your hand into the Cave. This card will capture one or more cards from the Cave, as follows:<br/><br/>If there are lower cards in the cave, your card captures the card(s) of the value that is closest beneath it. For example, if the<br/>board is 4-7-7-8-9, and you play an 8, you will capture both 7s.<br/><br/>If no cards in the Cave are lower than your card, you capture all cards of the highest rank (even if that rank matches your card).<br/>For example, if the Cave is 4-5-7-9-10, and you play a<br/>4 (or lower), you will capture the 10.<br/><br/>The card you played goes into the Cave. Set aside your captured cards, to be scored at the end of the round.<br/><br/>Refilling the Cave: If the Cave has fewer than five cards, refill it from the deck. If the deck is ever empty, the Cave does not refill, but play continues.<br/><br/>Scoring the Round: Play until everyone has emptied their hand. Then score the game as follows:<br/><br/>For each rank, the player who captured the most cards of that rank scores one point for each. Players with fewer cards in that rank do not score.<br/><br/>For example, if someone captured three 10s, and no one else had more 10s, then that player would get 3 points. If two or more players are tied for the most cards, they each score full points.<br/><br/>Record your score after each round, and play one round for each player, passing the deal to the left. Then the player with the highest total score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Player actions, including movement, are performed by rolling a single die, and comparing that result to the corresponding action card on the indicator board.

In this way, players can use their strategy to modify probabilities to their favor at the right moment.<br/><br/>When a player has collected all the articles on the board, if they can return to the residence of the tengu, they become the winners and the stars of the Gensokyo newspaper convention.<br/><br/>",

The game idea was designed in cocreation sessions with scientists, journalists, teachers, and various citizens. Then it was developed by the authors in collaboration with the science communication team in the CRG.<br/><br/>Saca la Lengua / Treu la Llengua is a cooperative game in which players represent members of the general population with certain characteristics of their microbiome (represented in game by 8 genera of bacteria, whose population is represented by the value of 8 dice). The goal is to keep the oral microbiome of the players as close as possible as the ideal equilibrium values (obtained in real life thanks to the research project).<br/><br/>During 5 rounds, the players do the following actions:<br/>a) Each player with 2 or more genera in equilibrium draws an action card, with which he/she can improve the microbiome of other players.<br/>b) Each player draws a &quot;Life is tough&quot; card and applies its effects on himself. Then a common &quot;Life is tough&quot; card is drawn and it must be applied to one of the players (cooperatively chosen).<br/><br/>Some cards add some additional &quot;infection&quot; dice or &quot;severe condition&quot; markers. When the players exceed a certain threshold of infection dice or severe condition markers, they lose the game. Otherwise, if they reach the end of the 5th round, they won and calculate points to know the degree of equilibrium of their oral microbiota.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

By creasing the bills, you communicate to your partner. However, if the opponents finds out the meaning of your secret crease, the strategy is a failure. Let's make a clever crease that deceives the opponent&rsquo;s eyes and transmits info to your partner.<br/><br/>Additionally, don't forget that creases accumulate as the game progresses!<br/><br/>The game is played in partnerships. Each pair of players secretly agree between themselves what marks they will use. One player draws five bills, and marks them to indicate which animal is the minority. The bills are laid out with the animals hidden. The opposing team places chips to show which bills are chickens or llamas. If they get it correct, they score points. If they get it wrong, the first team scores points.

The &quot;Sin&quot; was a target for all the monsters in the world, and to defend her child the Dragon Princes descended into the Abyss. After an unimaginably long time, the Abyss transformed the Dragon Princess into a monster, and she's coming to reclaim her child and destroy the world in the bargain. You have just five days to defeat her.<br/><br/>Each round has three phases: card acquisition, playing units, and deciding whether to challenge the monster. A number of cards equal to the numbers of players is dealt face-up, and everyone reveals which one they want at the same time. If there are any conflicts, the start player for the round decides how to resolve that, and it doesn't have to be fair. Next you play units that add to your battle strength. Some units can be played for free, but advanced units will require spending mana of right color from weaker units. Finally you decide if you're ready to challenge the monster. You only get to do this once, so you want to wait until you're strong enough, but not so long someone else beats the monster first.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you place the card, which you have previously taken, in front of you. Then you take a card from the table.<br/><br/>At end of the game, players score victory points depending on patterns of gears they coordinated. You score big points by making a larger chunk of connected gears.<br/><br/>If you took a card with a smaller number in your previous turn, you take your turn earlier. On the other hand, a card with a larger number has more gears than the smaller one in general.<br/><br/>You should consider your opponents' intentions when you take your card, and make full use of the card when you build your doll.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>『アリスアセンブル』は、機械の街の工匠となり、歯車を組み合わせて自動人形の少女を組み上げるゲームです。<br/><br/>プレイヤーは、場に公開される歯車の書かれたカードを獲得し、手元に並べていきます。<br/>手元のカードの列は、ゲーム終了時、そこに書かれた歯車のパターンに応じて得点となります。<br/>より大きな歯車の塊を作り、組み上げた人形により優れた機能を与えることで、高い得点を得ることができます。<br/><br/>手番で取得したカードに振られた番号が若ければ、次のラウンドでより早く手番が回ってきます。<br/>そして、歯車の多いカードには大きな番号が振られる傾向にあります。<br/>ほかのプレイヤーの動向を見据えてカードを獲得し、それを巧みに組み上げることが勝利の鍵となります！<br/><br/>",

He picked up a chainsaw for the first time and a lifelong bond was forged. It is quite likely that since that day he&rsquo;s never gone more than five minutes without at least one chainsaw in his hands &ndash; certainly, he&rsquo;s never been seen in public without one.<br/><br/>In 2483 it is the height of the chainsaw craze and Helmut Wulf has risen to prominence as a master of his craft. In a memorable match against the now-disbanded Bogstaff Beardlings, he broke a strong cage formation single-handedly by leaping into the middle and spinning around wildly. How he survived (especially considering how very slippery it suddenly gets) is a mystery, but there&rsquo;s no doubt that the man&rsquo;s got style.<br/><br/>Helmut Wulf is a Star Player who can be included in the following teams: Amazon, Chaos Renegades, Human, Lizardmen, Norse, Vampire. His unique brand of carnage and mayhem means that your opponent will be running scared from the first kickoff, and the revving of his chainsaw will haunt their nightmares for nights to come.<br/><br/>This is a complete, multipart resin kit which contains one Helmut Wulf. He is supplied with a 32mm Blood Bowl base, and his rules can be found in the Inaugural Blood Bowl Almanac.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
