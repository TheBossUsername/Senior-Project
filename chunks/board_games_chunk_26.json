A turn consists of each player throwing 3 darts and then moving a troop for each dart if the move is possible.<br/><br/>Troops can move from country to country through a common border (be it physical country border or square tile border). When a player arrives in a country where nobody has ever come, he earns a new troop which he places in this country.<br/><br/>When a troop arrives in a zone (earth or water) already occupied by an enemy troop, combat erupts. The conflict takes place on the target, the player whose dart is closer to the center is the winner and converts the other troop in one of his.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s purpose is to conquer your opponents&rsquo; homelands, clearing all their troops present there.  The winner is the last player to have protected his country.<br/><br/>When a player loses his homeland, he becomes the slave of his conqueror and carries on playing with his troops present in other parts of the world but has to obey his master.<br/><br/>This game won a prize at the 2005 International Contest of Boardgames Creators of Boulogne (France), and will be available at ESSEN 2006.<br/><br/>To have the best results in the sticking of the darts on the map, the map has to be hung quite high on the wall. A good height consists in putting the center of the small red and white target at the level of the players' eyes. In that configuration, the trajectory of the darts is optimum and they stick very well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Watch out, Mermaids! The Sea Witch is on the move! The object of the game is to move all 3 mermaids from start to Mermaid Island before the Sea Witch gets there. Because Mermaid Island is a cooperative game players play any of the mermaid tokens - no one player has a single mermaid she is trying to get back to the island. Players take turns spinning the spinner and moving a mermaid or the Sea Witch. Mermaids move 1 or 2 spaces at a time and can take the bridge short cuts. The Sea Witch moves only 1 space at a time and always goes the long way around. If the Sea Witch lands on a mermaid, the mermaid must go back to start. But mermaids can collect wand tokens which move the Sea Witch back one space. Players decide together when to use the wands and which mermaids to move to keep the mermaids going. Looks deceptively simple, but is a lively and strategic game of chase!<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     1 game board<br/>     3 mermaid  tokens<br/>     1 sea witch with stand<br/>     4 wand tokens<br/>     1 spinner<br/><br/><br/>",

When evil gets all fancy, they break that biz down...for hope!<br/><br/>In the Bravest Warriors Co-operative Dice Game, you take on the role of one of the Bravest Warriors or one of their best pals. Working together, you'll try to overcome Events and Encounters seen in Bravest Warriors episodes using your Portals and Special Abilities. Encounters require various symbols to beat them, and those symbols are found on the twelve custom dice, which are divided up between the players as evenly as possible. Each player rolls her own dice, but once rolled the dice are pooled together to use them as best you can as a team. If you don't roll what you need, you can play Portal cards (as seen in the &quot;Sugarbellies&quot; episode of the show) or use your character's Special Abilities. Conversion Portals, Re-Roll Portals, Gift Portals and more can make the difference between success and failure.<br/><br/>When you fail a challenge, the team suffers a calamity and the Encounter is placed into the Failed! pile. If you fail five Encounters, you lose the game! If you run out of Portal cards, you lose the game! If too many Bravest Warriors get K.O.ed, you lose the game! But if you score enough Victory Points or use up all of the Event cards, your team wins! (The actual number of VPs needed to win depends on whether you're playing easy mode (for younger or new players) or standard mode.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rive is a territory game for two players, Black and White. It is played on the cells of a small hexagonal grid with an odd number of cells, and the goal is to have the most stones on the board when it is full. The board is initially empty. Rive was invented by Mark Steere in 2010.<br/><br/>Definitions:<br/>A cluster is a connected set of stones in any combination of colors (only white, only black or both).<br/><br/>There are three kinds of placement, all of which consist in placing exactly one stone of your color on an empty cell:<br/>You plant when you place adjacent to no clusters.<br/>You grow when you place adjacent to only one cluster.<br/>You merge when you place adjacent to multiple clusters.<br/><br/>The only other kind of action is to shrink a cluster, which is to remove stones from it without splitting it into multiple clusters. This action will sometimes involve removing multiple stones, which may be of any combination of colors.<br/><br/>The basic structure of a turn is this:<br/>You must plant if you can, otherwise you may grow or merge. If you merge, you must also shrink, then move again. This means that you may not end your turn before you have made a non-merging placement.<br/><br/>Restriction on growing and merging:<br/>If you cannot plant (and therefore must grow or merge), you must choose a move such that the largest cluster you place adjacent to is as small as possible. This means that you cannot always choose freely between growing and merging, even though you aren't obligated to plant.<br/><br/>Restriction on shrinking:<br/>The cluster resulting from the merging placement must be shrinked down to a cluster of size one more than the biggest cluster that was merged.<br/><br/>",

First, two arch construction supports are placed on the base. Then thirteen color-coded cube compartments are placed on top of the supports to create an arch. The supports are then removed, so that the compartments support each other in a free-standing arch.<br/><br/>Players attempt to place 50 playing pieces of various colors and shapes into the color-coded compartments, without knocking the arch over. On a player's turn, they roll the two dice--one of which tells how many pieces they must place, and the second die tells the color of the compartment into which the pieces must be placed. When 'Arch Rival' is rolled on the color die, one of the player's opponents is allowed to select the color of the required compartment. Players continue placing pieces in turn, until the point where arch can no longer support itself and collapses. The player who causes this to happen loses the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Rick Thornquist (BoardGameNews.com)<br/><br/>This is a card game where players are promoting musical acts.<br/><br/>There are seven cards representing seven musical acts which are arranged in a column on the table. You get a hand of cards and each card corresponds to one of the acts. You start with one card face down in front of you. There is also a face-up pool of cards plus a draw pile.<br/><br/>On your turn, you turn up your face down card and play it beside the corresponding act. You then take on card from the pool and one from the deck. Finally, you place a card face down (which will be played on your next turn).<br/><br/>When one act gets three cards beside it, play stops for the 'Hit Parade'. Starting from top to bottom, each act moves up a number of spaces equal to the cards played beside it (this can push acts it passes down the column). The cards played are put into the pool and play continues.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck runs out. You get points for the cards left in your hand - if you have cards for the act at the top of the column you get five points each, for each card for the second act you get four points, etc. Whoever has the most points at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With Monopoly Empire, you can own some of the biggest brands in the world as every space on the game board is an iconic brand, including Xbox, Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Samsung.<br/><br/>As in the original Monopoly game, players start with cash in hand, roll dice, and move a token around the game board while hoping to purchase properties. Each property is represented by one or more billboards, with the more valuable properties having larger billboards. When you purchase a property, you place a billboard into your personal plastic tower; when you pass &quot;Go!&quot; on the game board, you earn income based on the height of your tower. Reach a value of $800 on your tower, and you win.<br/><br/>When you land on an opponent's property, you pay rent to that player based on the height of her tower. If you don't have enough cash on hand, hand over the top billboard in your tower instead but keep the cash you do have. This mechanism means there is no player elimination.<br/><br/>While players don't trade properties, you can effectively steal them through the use of Empire cards and the &quot;swap&quot; face on one die, which allows you to swap the top billboards on two towers.<br/><br/>To date, two editions have been released in the U.S.: The Second &quot;Silver&quot; Edition has some updated properties &amp; movers from the First &quot;Gold&quot; Edition, but gameplay is the same for both editions.<br/><br/>This game and Monopoly: Here & Now World Edition share many similarities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Abetto&rdquo; is a dynamic, exciting game, where players become gentlemen and ladies brought from Arsen Lupin's stories and compete with each other for the name of the greatest burglar, lover and fencer of the nobel underworld.<br/> There are several ways to achieve success. By means of committing burglary you can get trophies and gadgets that are essential to win the game. They also help you in overcoming challenges of the game as well as give you an opportunity to harm your  opponents. By shooting at rivals or dueling with them you can steal their chosen trophies but you may also lose yours.<br/> Mechanics of the game is based on modified roulette rules. Players bet the result on a special even/odd table and a number table (1-36). The probability of failure is small &ndash; only 25% - and can be further  reduced  by means of some gadgets. The esthetic wooden roulette is attached to the game.<br/> In order to smooth down certain randomness that accompanies burglaries, shoots and duels, so called task cards were introduced to the game. There is a different task for each round and after accomplishing it a player receives prize in the form of trophies and gadgets. Fulfilling the task depends solely on player&rsquo;s behavior.<br/> The game board is based on a tile system. Players arrange it themselves and each time they compose a different district in which the game takes place.<br/> Abetto game provides large interaction between players and a great deal of emotions. Even during another player&rsquo;s turn you take active part in the game.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guards! Guards! A Discworld Boardgame sees players taking on the role of newly recruited members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch. With the Eight Great Spells missing from the Unseen University, the future of the Disc hangs in the balance. Each player is tasked with collecting and returning a number of the spells to the university before it is too late. Each player selects one of four Guilds to infiltrate: Thieves, Assassins, Alchemists or Fools. Their chosen Guild Card will give them a specific selection of the Great Spells to collect and grants them a unique Guild Ability which can be used to hinder their opponents. It is also used to mark the players Charm, Guild and Magic abilities, which can be developed throughout the game.<br/><br/>There are twelve locations on the board where players may charm (or bribe) volunteers to join them on their quest.<br/>The characters are split into three Volunteer Decks each representing the range of inhabitants who might be found in different locations within the city: Lords &amp; Ladies, Man &amp; Beast and Shades &amp; Shadows. Each Volunteer is assigned a set of skill attributes which can be used individually to protect the Spells, or combined with those of other volunteers and used to complete the Wizards Challenges - five tests of strength, brain, and worthiness which the runners must complete in order to enter the Unseen University with the Spells. A selection of enchanted scrolls, weapons, armour and magical items can be purchased by players to equip their volunteers and boost their attributes.<br/><br/>A number of volunteer cards carry the &quot;Mark of the Brethren&quot;, the name of a secret society which aims to summon a greater dragon to the city in a plan to overthrow the powers that be in Ankh-Morpork. If a player holds three of these cards at any time, he may choose to call a dragon to a specific city quadrant. This effectively shuts down that area of the city until the dragon is driven off. (Handy if spells are located there that your opponents need.) Opposing players may choose to face the dragon individually or to co-operate with other players and send a combined squad of volunteers to see off the beast. (Dragons may also be called to the city automatically during the game on the turn of a fate card. If this happens, all players must send at least one volunteer to face it.) Members of the Brethren may also be secretly planted in city quadrants to operate as saboteurs.<br/><br/>When a player feels has recruited the right volunteers, he moves to collect and return the first required Spell (as marked on his Guild Card). You can send up to four volunteers on a Spell Run. Opponents may use magic, or Saboteurs if they have one in play, to try to stop a spell run. If all (or any) of your runners make it to the Unseen University, they must attempt one of the Wizards Challenges (resolved by totalling a specific attribute score of the successful runners, with any bonuses gained from items or magic and a dice roll). If successful they have returned the Spell. The volunteers used are seen to have fulfilled their duty and are discarded. The player then goes on toward his next spell (recruiting new volunteers along the way). The winner is the first to return the five Great Spells shown on his Guild Card. Being set in Ankh-Morpork, many other random hazards face players, but we don't want to spoil the surprise and tell you everything! Where's the fun in that?<br/><br/>",

Your opponents decide which they'd think you'd do as well, and record it by putting a token under their palm with either the &quot;Choice 1&quot; or &quot;Choice 2&quot; side facing up. Then you announce your choice, explain your choice, and try to guess which choice your opponents thought that you would make. Each time you guess correctly, you move your pawn one space on the board.

Each player gets 10 action points each turn to go back in time and collect dinosaurs.  You start your turn by rolling a die and putting out that many new dinos for hunting.  You travel to different time periods and hunt the dinos by rolling a die and comparing the total to a list on the card.  A good roll allows you to capture the dino but a bad roll can have other consequences including ending your turn prematurely.  Each dino cost variable action points to hunt and moving from one time period to another also costs action points.  You also collect various items that can help you and there are action cards that have good and bad effects.  When the stack of dinos has been exhausted and all dinos have been captured or have escaped the game is over.  Whoever has captured the most dino points wins.<br/><br/>The beauty of this game is not in game play but the cards themselves.  There is a large picture of the dinosaur and enough info to put a reference book to shame.  As a bonus there is also a phonetic spelling of the name.  Without the special cards this game can be played by 5 year olds with a little help.<br/><br/>",

This game was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #153, along with Zama.<br/><br/>Operation Felix is a &quot;what if...&quot; game on the invasion of Gibraltar by the Germans in 1940/41, shortly after the fall of France. Historically, it was the option Hitler elected against, putting political calculations ahead of military realities in his attempt to dominate Europe. This recasting of history assumes that Hitler made the defeat of Britain his top priority in 1940-41. Instead of angling for negotiations with His Majesty's government after Dunkirk, The Fuhrer issues orders to German High Command to take the war to the Commonwealth wherever it could. The one obvious target that is close at hand, and has considerable military and political value, is the Rock of Gibraltar, the gateway to the western Mediterranean Sea.<br/><br/>Scenarios cover a July 1940 attack, the more probable December 1940 invasion, and a Spanish assault (with a little help from German allies). Optional rules for SS reinforcements and greater German amphibious capacity.<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>hex scale = 250 meters/hex side to side <br/>time = one day per game turn <br/>strength = platoon/company/battalion sized units<br/><br/>",

Players out-maneuver and out-bluff one another so as to gain the riches of the region, while making sure they spend enough of the &quot;oil/money&quot; to ensure the safety of their state. The tension is kept up by secret deployment of forces and the continual angst of balancing resource spending with the saving necessary to come off the winner. It is, usually, the richest player, the one who has probably spent least on 'defense' throughout the game that will come off the victor. But, the twist is that the game can end in war or peace, and there are different victory conditions depending on which of the two outcomes it ends in. A very hard balance to maintain.<br/><br/>",

Each stack is shuffled separately, then the stack with the lower value mission cards (queen's deck, values 1-3) is placed on top of the other (king's deck, values 4-6).<br/><br/>Mission cards equal to the number of players are laid out, face up.<br/><br/>The card dealer shuffles the 42 paladin cards and hands out 4-6 (depending on the number of players) cards to each player. Paladin cards have values from 0-9.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>Each player, beginning with the start player, puts one of his/her paladin cards next to one of the mission cards, face down, and marks it with one of his/her player tokens. This paladin is called the leading paladin. When each mission card has a leading paladin, players continue playing cards clockwise until each player has placed a card beside each mission.<br/>Before placing a card, players may look at one of the cards another player has already placed. Each player can only play one paladin per mission. <br/>When each player has only one card left, the paladin cards are resolved, starting with the first mission and the first card that was placed there. Each player has the following options:<br/><br/>     Beat the leading paladin if your card has a higher value (or in case they are equal, if it is a red number).<br/>     Take the face-down paladin card back on your hand.<br/>     Discard the face-down paladin card.<br/><br/><br/>This continues until all cards at the first mission have been dealt with. The player whose card is the last to stay wins the mission and places it, together with the winning paladin card, in front of him/herself. The same is done for the other mission cards.<br/><br/>The player with the fewest honour points is the dealer of the next round and hands out paladin cards until everyone has the same number of cards as in the first round. The dealer then lays out new mission cards and determines a start player.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are not enough mission cards left for another round. Each player counts the honour points from the missions he/she won and adds bonus points for all paladin cards with red numbers that the/she has in front of him/herself. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Almost every time a card is played, you need to trade a card with another player, so although you may have a winning hand now, it may not be there when your turn comes around.<br/><br/>Just kind of makes you want to bash an Ogre on the head, doesn't it?<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a single banner in his castle but also takes the banners of any captured castles.<br/><br/>The cards act as die modifiers (General and Marshall), allow attacks one would not normally be able to make (Admiral), get armies at the start of a turn (Reinforcements), force temporarily non-aggression pacts (Diplomats) and look at another player's cards, discarding one in the process (Spy).

Each player tries to maneuver their four coloured pieces to their ending positions before the others. On your turn, you roll two dice and assign each die to a separate piece; doubles get you an extra turn. You can only move sideways and forward. If you get landed on by your opponent, your pawn gets sent back to the start. Spaces of your own color are safe, where you cannot be landed upon. First player to get all 4 of their pawns across the board wins. The endgame zone channels all pieces through a narrow passage, increasing the likelihood of mayhem.<br/><br/>",

Cowtown cards are always played on the table immediately in order to give the little dogies a place to settle.<br/><br/>On a turn, you play a card from your hand onto a stack on the table. The card you play must be one higher than the top card on a stack. (Cowtown cards are effectively numbered 0.) If you can play multiple cards in numerical order &ndash; a Horn-to-Tail Sequence &ndash; you can do so; in addition (or alternatively) you can play multiple cards with the same number &ndash; a Stampede &ndash; onto different stacks when those stacks have the same lower number. Playing a three-card Horn-to-Tail Sequence or a Stampede is worth 1 &quot;scorecow&quot;.<br/><br/>Whenever you play a card of matching color onto a stack, you're safe, but if you play at least one card of a different color &ndash; a bullish play &ndash; then you must draw and discard the top card of the deck. If that card shows a red bull's eye, then you've been kicked and must draw a card. Lay a 10 on a stack and you close that barn, getting to take another turn or pass one of your cards to another player.<br/><br/>The round ends as soon as one player is out of cards or the deck runs out.

Players take on the role of civil rights organizations (SNCC, CORE, etc) as they fight for equal rights and the end of segregation in the Deep South, circa 1960-1964.  It is not about Washington, DC, but the efforts of the people on the spot, whether that is Claiborne Parish, Louisiana or Mobile, Alabama.<br/><br/>Free at Last is a card-driven game in which each card has a number (used to activate special individuals) and an event, but uniquely, the color of the number also matters and affects the type of project (voting rights, accommodations, school desegregation) that can be attempted. Multiple-length versions can be played: 3 turns (ending with the Freedom Rides), 6 turns (ending with the March on Washington), or a 9 turn game covering this entire period in American history. Players take turns playing cards from their hand.  These cards let the players take actions to accomplish Projects--examples include working to desegregate schools in New Orleans; Fayette County voter registration; as well as the various Freedom Rides across the south.  They also can be used for a specific event on the card, granting special powers to the players--but also potentially creating future disadvantageous consequences or making cooperation between the players' groups more difficult.<br/><br/>While the game will eventually mean one organization/player 'wins', players must work together; if projects fail and are suppressed by the segregationists, then the Civil Rights Movement falls apart.  Thus, Free at Last is cooperative AND competitive.<br/><br/>Note: This game bears the same name and designer as Free at Last, but the designs each stand on their own, with this game being for 2-6 players while the previous game was for only two players.<br/><br/>",

The new neon-green-and-purple JX has blocks with slanted sides, allowing the players to construct towers that lean precariously to one side without toppling due to the weight distribution that the new blocks allow.<br/><br/>The game can be played as a competitive exercise where each player tries placing his block in a position so that the next player's block will make the tower fall over. Alternatively, it can be a cooperative exercise where the players try to make the tower go as high as possible without collapsing.<br/><br/>",

A typical card will have three boxes at the bottom and in each box there will be a number. For example, the first box might say 8, the second box 7 and the third box +12. The first box is how many spaces you go up the track on the board. The second box is how many you go back, so, in my example, you go forward 8 and back 7 (a gain of 1 forward). The third box is the risk number. If you decide to take a risk, you roll the three dice and if you roll or beat the number (12 in my example) in the third box, you avoid the minus amount in box 2. But if you don't roll enough, then the minus points are doubled.<br/><br/>At certain points when you cross spaces marked in red on the board, you draw the top card from the Teacher's deck and apply the numbers by adding them to the card played. This will normally result in higher moves, higher minuses and the dice roll needed if you decide to take a risk to avoid the minus number.<br/><br/>The one with the most advanced spot on the board when the 60 Pupil cards have been used up, wins.<br/><br/>Despite the common name and similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Silence in Class!<br/><br/>",

The Giant can crush his foes with his enormous strength, and he has his Magic Hen on his side, as well. But sly Snow White is no longer her sweet self, and she has some tricks up her sleeve, including the assistance of her Seven Dwarfs. Will the kingdom thrive under the rule of either of these challengers? A battle of enormous proportions awaits!&quot;<br/><br/>The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.<br/><br/>Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alpha Blitz consists of two different games.<br/><br/>Alpha is a word game for 2 players. there are 98 cards with letters on them and 10 blitz cards showing a lightning bolts. These are shuffled together and six are laid out between the players. Each player gets 3 cards in their start hand. On your turn you try to make the longest word possible with the six letters showing on the table using each letter as many times as you want. For example you could make the word letters with the letters L, E, T, R, and S showing. Each turn you must cover one letter with a card from your hand and then draw another card. You may do this before or after you make a word. If you cover a letter with a blitz card that pile is permanently out so as the game progresses there are less letters to use. You receive 1 point for making a word. 1 point for every letter in the word more then the number of letter piles. You also get 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z you use. The game ends when there are only 2 letter piles left.<br/><br/>Blitz is a word game for 3-6 players. Each player has a hand of 3 cards. 2 cards are placed face down in front of each player. All cards are turned up at the same time. The first player to call out a word that can be formed with the letters showing gets 1 point plus 1 point for each J, K, Qu, X and Z they used. The second player to call out a word gets 2 points but the word must be longer then the previous word. This continues until all players have called out a word or passed due to not seeing a legal word. Each round is started by covering a letter from your hand. The game ends when one player has both letter piles covered with a blitz card.<br/><br/>Alpha Blitz was awarded the title &quot;Best Word Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1999.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hack Attack is played with 12 plastic pieces in green, orange and purple. 6 of these pieces are cubes and 6 are pyramids. There are 12 board strips with green, orange and purple squares. The object of the game is to get one of each color (green, orange and purple) of your game pieces (one player is cubes and one player is pyramids) in a row (vertically or horizontally) on the matching colors of the board strips. The board strips are shuffled and dealt out 6 to each player. The first player lays one of their board strips and places one of their game pieces on one of the squares. Game pieces MUST be played on squares of the same color of the game piece. The next player may then either place one of their game pieces on the same board or lay down another board next to the first one long sides touching and places one of their game pieces on the board strip just played. After all 6 of a player's game pieces have been played, they may move any of their game pieces to a new position, either on a board that has already been placed or on a new board. After all of a player's board strips have been placed, they are limited to placing their game pieces on the boards already in play. So ...<br/><br/><br/>    You may ONLY play your pieces on a square that is the same color as that piece. (e.g. a purple piece can only be played on a purple square.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>    You may only place your board strips LONG sides touching with all squares aligned.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If you lay a board strip down you MUST play a game piece on that board.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If you choose not to lay down a new board strip on your turn, you MUST play a game piece on an existing board strip.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    The winning row of 3 game pieces may be all on 1 board or lengthwise over 3 boards, but it may not be diagonal.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Only one game piece may be played on each square.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    You can ONLY move the position of your game pieces on the board after ALL of your pieces have been placed.<br/><br/><br/>This is a 2-player game for ages 10 and over.<br/><br/>",

Explore the labyrinth in search of gold.<br/><br/>Players move around a room with sliding floor tiles, trying to collect 3 treasures at the center first. The board has a pattern of triangles, some are solid floor, the rest is empty space across which you cannot walk. Players start by laying floor tiles on the board. These tiles are rhomboid (diamond-shaped) and have snakes and walls to make things tricky.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may spend 3 action points sliding tiles, rotating tiles, walking over snakes, or teleporting, all in an attempt to reach the treasures at the center. Each player also has a blocking marker they can place at turn end which prevents movement. First player to pick their three treasures up and get back to the doors wins.<br/><br/>",

You can perform 1 of 3 actions on a turn.  Play a card that is higher than the top card on the discard pile (which ends your turn), Play a pair of same suit cards whose sum is less than the top card (this does not end your turn and you must then take another action) or draw cards from stock. (You must keep drawing till you draw a male and female card. These cards are shown to the other players. This does end your turn.)<br/><br/>Every time you play a pair you skip the next player in turn.  If you play 2 pairs you skip the next two players, etc.  You can never skip yourself so in a 3-player game if you play 3 pairs, then end your turn by drawing or playing a single card, you then take another turn.<br/><br/>When playing a pair you may place them in any order. When the stock is empty you shuffle the draw pile (except for the top card I would presume) and continue play.<br/><br/>A hand is won when one person is out of cards.  He receives the total points left in all other players hands.  The rules state that you play for several rounds.<br/><br/>",

As with a castle card another card may be taken from the pile after having picked up a fairy card, or the turn may be passed.<br/><br/>Diamond cards can be used to buy castle cards from other players. 3 diamond cards can be exchanged for a single castle card. A player may not refuse to sell a castle card. Furthermore, only a single castle card can be bought in a turn. A player is not allowed to take a card from the pile in the same turn in which she buys a castle card from an opponent.<br/><br/>If a player picks up a 'witch' card it's bad luck! Then a player must place the witch card, and 3 other cards next to the pile of cards in the center of the table and pass her turn. The 3 other cards can be diamond cards or castle cards, either from the player's right-hand side pile or from her own castle.

Playing cards allows you to score points or &mdash; in some cases &mdash; draw an additional card. As the pyramid grows taller, you have an opportunity to score more and more &mdash; but the higher the possible score, the fewer spaces you have to play your cards.<br/><br/>If you want to win, you need to be smarter than your opponents.

Prepare to find yourself on the other side of the barricade&hellip; Waves on waves of Goblins try to conquer the city of the humans, through debatable strategies, inconsistent plains and brainless &quot;Epic Death&quot;.<br/><br/>Goblins is a not collectible card game that melds the bases of the board game with those of the card game.<br/><br/>Raze the town to the ground and loot everything you can find on your way to leading a mob of stupid Goblins! Other Goblin commanders will collaborate on this task as well. Unfortunately, the idea of collaboration among Goblins is a little bit ambiguous. Dealing with useless subordinates and treacherous allies, the enemy will be the last of your problems.<br/><br/>Players must destroy the Town and conquer as many Land Cards as possible. Land Cards will award the owner Victory Points. The player with the highest amount of Victory Points wins the match.<br/><br/>To reach their objective players can rely on Goblin commanders, the alter ego of each player on the battleground; each of these has unique and particular ability to make every game different from the other.<br/><br/>Unlikely Machines, fearless Goblin heroes and a lot of Action Card make the game always unpredictable.<br/><br/>The innovative game system is based on &quot; Goblins flipping&quot;. Every choice you make will cause Goblin flip to determine its life or its death. Every Goblin is represented by a disk with two faces: every disk shows a Goblin face on a side and a Goblin skull on the other side.<br/><br/>The game is exciting every moment also when it isn&rsquo;t your turn. No player will ever be too strong or too weak and the game strategy will change turn after turn suiting better possible the situation.<br/><br/>Through the system of the exhilarating &quot;Epic Deaths &quot;, your Goblins can commit mass suicide in eccentric ways. The &ldquo;Epic Death&rdquo; can confuse every enemy and allows you to beat him for the dismay. No player is ever out of the game.<br/><br/>Let the fight for stupidity begin!<br/><br/>",

The slides are numbered one through thirty in the Milton Bradley editions and one through twenty-five in all other editions. each player or team chooses two numbered slides and reveal whatever items are beneath the slides. If the items match, then the items are removed to reveal parts of the rebus puzzle of which the team may hazard a guess. Solve the rebus puzzle and receive the value of all matching pairs possessed in play money. The side that has more money after three rebuses wins.<br/><br/>Puzzles in the Milton Bradley and Endless Games editions were designed by the people who created them for the series: Norman Blumenthal for the former and Steve Ryan for the latter.<br/><br/>Educational Concentration is made for classroom drills. It does not feature a rebus puzzle but it does have a plastic molded gameboard with twenty slots. The game comes with color matching, American history, American geography and homophone drills. More drills can be homemade easily.<br/><br/>Based on the long-running television series which was inspired by the children's card game.<br/><br/>",

The player with the horse in last place at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>On your turn - sequence of play is decided by auction - you play a card that controls two different colored horese. When every player has put down cards, the horses move; but only horses with an odd number of cards on the table!

On a turn, you play one or more cards against one of the enemies in play, possibly start that fight or possibly adding to the efforts of another Wonder Woman. When that enemy has had the right combination of actions played against it, players receive rewards depending on what and how much they contributed to that victory. Rescued civilians are your reward, and whoever has rescued the most civilians after all ten enemies have been defeated wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "3 to 5 players lead groups of South Seas pirates, angling for the captain's positions on five ships that make up a small pirate fleet. Why? Well, that's obvious: the captains get the bulk of the booty.<br/><br/>All cards (in different colours and numbered from one to fifteen) are shuffled and dealt out (fewer when playing with fewer players). After the trump colour has been determined, a traditional trick-taking game ensues. Whenever a player wins a trick, they get to place one of their sailors onto the captain position of the ship that matches the colour of the trick. If that post is already taken, then the other player must vacate the spot. That can sometimes end up with a sailor being tossed overboard - but they're not out of the game, they seek safety on an island. The more sailors this happens to, the better their chance of being hired again.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the captains and sailors on the ships are worth points - sailors stranded on islands worth minus points. Minus points are also awarded when a player wins many tricks during the game - which is why these won tricks can also be passed along.<br/><br/>",

Players are either the noble King Arthur or the nefarious Sir Mordred, and the Knights of the Round Table are the instruments of your influence in Camelot. Your chosen knights will advance your schemes as you trace the web of subterfuge and manipulate it to your own ends. The victor will wield the most influence when each Knight's loyalties are revealed.<br/><br/>The Round Table is formed by eight face-up Knights, with each player controlling four. Each Knight also bears a face-down Influence Card on top of it. On his turn, a player can look at the Influence Card of his Knight-errant or exchange that card with an Influence Card of any other Knight at the Round Table. Play continues in this manner until the turns have circled the Round Table twice. At that time, all of the face-down Influence cards are revealed, and the player who has the highest sum of Influence wins the round. A new round is set up and played again, and the first person to win two rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Who will hold sway in Camelot? And who will hold sway on the morrow? Only time will tell...<br/><br/>Guile includes the 'inspansion' &quot;Extended Cast&quot;, which adds even more possibilities for treachery and deceit.<br/><br/>",

The four horses race around the board jumping water and hedges as they sprint for the finish line.<br/><br/>One of the first illustrated race game after The Game of Goose, and The Game of Human Life (c1790). Perhaps the first Sport Race game, and probably of French origin. Several Parisian copies of the boards have been uploaded on the collector Alain Koli's blog, Collection de jeux anciens : Georges Tempier c1850, Nicolas Rousseau c1850, Alexandre Gautier c1851, Bernard Coudert c1860, Hippolyte Nar&ccedil;on c1860/73, Charles Watilliaux c1885. The game has been patented by Georges Tempier in 1851. R. C. Bell in his Games to play (1988) gives the board and the rules of a parisian version by Nar&ccedil;on (1820-1889) for English speaking people, with a lithography by H. Jannin.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First edition:<br/><br/>Rather silly party game, distributed by a certain coffee retail powerhouse that will remain nameless.<br/><br/>As one moves around the board, one can land on _Brainstorm_ (vaguely reminiscent of free-association Scattergories), _Survey Says!_ (a touch like the Family Feud TV game show), or present a short _Sound Bite_ to the other players, who will vote on presentation and persuasiveness.<br/><br/>To make sure no-one takes the proceedings too seriously, there's a _Skid Row_ space (lose all points, and beg the other players to donate.  Why would they want to, you ask?) and a _Party Change_ spot - where you change identities (color, score, seat, beverage?!?) with another player.<br/><br/>Like all such games, it works well with the right crowd.<br/><br/>Second edition:<br/><br/>Hear Me Out, in its latest form, corrects some of the major problems the first edition had. Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player's answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as &quot;Nuclear BLANK&quot;). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.<br/><br/>What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.<br/><br/>",

Undo the past and change the future in one sitting. Care to lobotomize a friend? Want to give them the plague? Or spray them with nerve gas? Play FaceEater, the post-apocalyptic game where death is your friend, mercy is a weakness and shafting your friends is fun.<br/><br/>The game of Face Eater comes with a FaceEater Deck containing four standard decks, consisting of 104 regular cards, 88 Power Cards, 8 Face Eaters and 8 Jokers. The Survival Guide includes the rules and a Power Card index with cross-referenced explanations of all cards and terms used in the game. Although two to six people can play, three to five players seems to work best<br/><br/>The object of FaceEater is to avoid having your face eaten while you shaft your opponents! A standard FaceEater game has three rounds, and the player with the lowest score at the end of the third round wins. Play as many or as few rounds as you'd like.<br/><br/>Call the game as desired in each round, except in two to three  <br/>player games where &ldquo;no limit&rdquo; is required for sets, straights, and runs. When &ldquo;no limit&rdquo; is chosen in four to six player games, the game is more dangerous and moves at a faster pace.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with eight gear wheels, one of which is the master and has rotational direction arrows on it. These wheels start on the row nearest each player with the master wheel being the fourth spindle from the left. The spindle spacing is such that any wheels on orthogonally adjacent spindles engage, but diagonally adjacent wheels do not.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player may move any one of their wheels one space orthogonally or diagonally onto an unoccupied space. At any stage in the game after moving, the player may elect to turn their own master wheel in any direction. If this succeeds in turning the opponent's master wheel in the direction of the arrow marked on it, then the active player wins; if the opponent's master wheel fails to move or goes in the wrong direction, the active player loses.<br/><br/>",

The actions are: drawing a stop, drawing a trail, and building a camping lodge. In order to draw a trail, the player must draw either a straight line or a line with a single 90 degree bend in it between two of their own stops.<br/><br/>The end of the game is triggered by the requisite number of boards being filled with camping lodges. Points are awarded for each area that a player's trails go through, animals that can be seen from their trails, and building camping lodges next to stops. Points are lost for any stops that are not connected at the end of the game. The player with the highest total points across all the boards wins.<br/><br/>Rift Valley Reserve is a highly tactical, no luck, game that offers much strategic depth whilst using a very simple ruleset meaning the game appeals to gamers and families alike. Try to score the most points while blocking off your opponents; no crossing, branching or using of other players' infrastructure is allowed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A family game of knights in search of the magical ring, set in the age of myths.&quot;<br/><br/>Each of the four states of Tirad, Urgad, Galad and Elgad has one large city.  Life in a city flourishes for the inhabitants only when the magical ring is there.  Unfortunately, the ring never stays long in one place.  A band of brave knights is gathered together in Galad where they hear rumours that the ring has been seen in Tirad.  The Quest begins...<br/><br/>Each player tries to find the ring and transport it to the cities.  As a reward, they receive the seals of these cities.  Collect three different seals to win.  Many obstacles are to be overcome and dragons slain before a knight's quest is complete.<br/><br/>This is a fairly abstract game.  Each player has three extra &quot;lives&quot; and loses one when defeated by a dragon or when attacking another player.  These lives are replenished by visiting cities.  The ring allows its bearer some significant advantages such as passing through obstacles.  Special spots on the map allow new obstacles to be placed or existing ones to be moved, so a player can be affected even by other players far from him.  The end game can drag a bit as all the other players coordinate their efforts against the leader.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box:<br/>In the beginning those that could master going between dimensions thought of it as novelty. There were worlds to discover, creatures to see and most importantly magic to master. But with all these things to keep them busy there was one thing they did not forget, Power. Soon it was easier to take from others than to find it on your own. The only place to hide was in great magical towers that they built between dimensions. All times in your world and in the others are at your disposal.<br/><br/>Will you be the last to Reign in Towers in Time?<br/><br/>Play overview:<br/>Each player represents a spellcaster, dueling with the other players for control of an abstractly defined extradimensional space.  Each player has five shields, represented by cards from that player's deck, that serve to anchor the player the dimension within the game's story, and as the player's presence in the game mechanically.  The goal is to eliminate the shields of all other players; when a player has no shields remaining, they are banished from the pocket dimension, and out of the game.  Victory goes to the last player with shields in play.<br/><br/>To combat one another, players play Source cards, representing connections to various natural locations, be they landforms, weather phenomena, or natural disasters.  These resource cards allow the player to access Temper, the main resource in Towers in Time, themed to the four elements.  Using Temper, players pay the costs to summon creatures to wage war, conjure magical objects and artifacts to enhance the effectiveness of recruited creatures, and cast spells to strengthen their minions and weaken the opposing armies.  Additionally, once creatures are in play, most of them can provide Temper as well, although typically less than Source cards; most cards in Towers in Time are resource generators in addition to their other game effects.<br/><br/>Source cards serve as the base for the titular Towers of Towers in Time.  Each Source has a default file of three ranks atop it, each space of which can be occupied by creatures and the cards they carry.  Creatures enter play within Towers, and must match the element represented by the Source atop which it stands (except for Neutral creatures, which may be played into any Tower).  There are rules to determine which creatures can enter play in which locations within a Tower, but once in play, most creatures can move between Towers, taking attached cards with them when they move.<br/><br/>Turns do not follow the turn format common to many contemporary CCGs.  Instead, several phases are completed simultaneously by all players, then players alternate initiating and resolving a single action until both players have passed.  Action resolution varies depending on their effect, with some actions initiating a separate resolution phase with its own actions and timing (such as combat) and others are single-step actions (such as playing a card).  Additionally, a number of supplemental actions (&quot;free&quot; actions) facilitate utility functions, such as drawing Temper to pay for spells.  The opportunity to act first during the action round is determined by the player who won initiative during game setup (for the first turn only), or the player who did not take the last pass action on the previous turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Across Africa is a cooperative game for the young players that are just starting their adventure with board games. The game is designed for two to four players of age 6 and up.<br/><br/>During their African expedition the young players will discover new routes through the wilderness and take photos of the animals they encounter on the way. If they are lucky enough, they will meet one of the legendary diamond seekers and perhaps collect some precious jewels themselves.<br/><br/>The game consists of players turns, during which each of them rolls the dice and moves his pawn by the shown number of spaces on the board. The pawn may stop on one of the eight kinds of spaces. The player fulfills the action assigned to the type of the space. This may be for example making a photo of animals, moving backwards in the next turn, drawing an adventure card, collecting the diamond, meeting the snake and many more.<br/><br/>In order to win the game children have to fill up the whole crocodile shaped photo album with photos they took during their adventure and reach the last space on the board.<br/><br/>Across Africa offers also the alternate mode of playing. This time the players will not cooperate but race to the finish line, trying at the same time to collect as much diamonds and valuable photos as possible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Backyard Builders Treehouse &mdash; released in the France as Way Up High &mdash; is a reimplementation of Yardmaster Express with players now trying to climb vertically to build a treehouse instead of adding cars to their train engine.<br/><br/>The game starts with the first player drafting a room card from their hand, attaching it to their tree, then passing the rest of their hand to the player on the left. This draft continues until all players have added one room card to their tree for each round of the game. The trick is, while each new room card must match the type or value of the one previously played, players always have the option to play any card face down as a &quot;wild&quot; room; wild rooms don't have much value, but they can be used to save a player in a bind or to thwart your opponents by &quot;hiding&quot; a card they need.<br/><br/>",

If it is the flavor that your character likes, you insert the slice into character's mouth. If it's another player's flavor, you return to the pie. If you draw the Dirty Sock pie piece, you return it and one of your own slices to the pie. The first player to fill their character's mouth with all three of its matching pie pieces wins.<br/><br/>",

Pirates are afraid of water but today is bath day and they all have to go into the ocean. But nobody wants to. Because for pirates, the rules is: he who washes and saves, loses. Nobody wants to go into the water, and so there's a lot of pushing and shoving on the plank. Each tries to stay as far back on the plank as possible and push the others overboard. Finally, a large shark was also spotted happily circling the ship in anticipation.<br/><br/>16 pirates in four colors stand in rows and columns on the plank. Each player draws a counter out a bag that secretly indicates which his color is. Now each player tries to move the pirates such that at least one pirate of his color is left on board at the end of the game. Players may move all pirates of any color. On a player's turn, he first turns the wind rose. It chooses the first move - if two pirates are exchanged, for example, or move one pirate to the head, the end of the line, or one space forwards, or no action at all. Secondly, a full row of pirates is always pushed on space forwards. So, over the course of the game, pirates fall off the plank - and into the mouth of the waiting shark!<br/><br/>",

Each dial has one of six symbols showing. To access the treasure cards beneath the lid the players alternate turns to twist the dials to show the combination of symbols which match the genie card that is in play. When the genie card has been matched, the player may take as many treasure cards as desired. If a player finds a snake card among the treasure cards taken then the player forfeits all treasure cards taken that turn. Whenever a player is done taking treasure cards a new genie card is put in play and the game continues.<br/><br/>The game ends when the final genie card is out of play or the final snake has been found. The player with the highest total in treasure cards is the winner. The game is in German, French, and Spanish.<br/><br/>This game is also published in an English version from Ravensburger as &quot;Open Sesame&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Ships are designed and built in secret, with weapons and upgrades remaining secret until each is used for the first time. The variety of mounts, ships, weapons, and upgrades gives players thousands of possible builds. Opponents duel in a deep space arena that may include asteroids, moons, and planets. Gameplay uses Newtonian space flight mechanics, including gravity wells, linear acceleration, orientation thrusts, and inertia.<br/><br/>",

Maybe there&rsquo;s a maverick inside you; can your friends predict what you will do?  Or will you keep them guessing while you expose their inner selves to the world?<br/><br/>In every round of Rorschach, each player picks an inkblot that answers a question asked on a card.  To win the game, you must pick the same inkblot as each other player at least once, and you must be the only one to pick an inkblot at least once. Can you figure out whether the other players are giving honest answers?  Or are they trying to pick the same inkblot they think you will choose?  Can you throw them off your scent so as to make a unique selection for an extra point? Subterfuge abounds in this game of skill, timing, and intrigue.<br/><br/>Rorschach contains 100 new and unique inkblot cards that are large, widely varied, and graphically stunning. The question deck covers a broad range of topics, keeping play fresh every time.

        "description": "This traditional children's card game is a game of very few decisions (none of which are meaningful).  Players are each dealt 10 face down cards which are arranged in spots from #1-10 to begin.  One player then draws a card from the top of the stock of remaining cards and uses it to replace a face-down card in the appropriately numbered spot if possible.  His turn continues until he draws a card that matches a card number already flipped or draws a Queen or King which cannot be placed in his array.  He discards the unusable card and his opponent can then choose to pick up that card and begin his turn by placing it into the appropriate spot in his array.  Jacks are considered wild and can be replaced by the appropriate number if they are already placed in one's array.  The first person to fill all of his spots with face-up cards wins the round and will play the next round with one less spot (so after round 1, for example, he will only use 9 cards).  The game continues until one person has no spots remaining at the beginning of his turn.<br/><br/>",

Each time you successfully answer a question, you get a piece of your pyramid, provided you answered with the required &quot;precision&quot;. The answers are given based on the map provided, so your answer is basically a geographical area which you feel applies to the question or statement.<br/><br/>The game is supplied with a reticle (map-reader), which provides you with the letter needed if you want to answer with &quot;triangular precision&quot;.  So you must answer with a number (for hexagonal precision) or a number and a letter (for triangular).  The four sides of the pyramid are earned by answering a question with triangular precision, one for each zone on the map (Americas, Europe, Water, and Universal - which is Africa, Asia and the other 3 zones).<br/><br/>The rubi (top of the pyramid) is earned by first having the four sides done, then answering a final question.  The zone is determined by rolling the rubi like a die, as the zones are inscribed on the rubi piece.<br/><br/>",

Each color set contains two cards of each number: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Blue and yellow also have one card numbered 6.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 5 cards and the rest of the cards are not used in the game. The cards represent balls being thrown from player to player, with the card's number showing its speed. The dealer places one face-up card in front of another player. That player then places one of their cards in front of another player. They may choose a higher-numbered card or a card of the same color from their hand. Alternatively, they may pick up all the cards in front of them, add them to their hand, then choose to play any of the cards in their hand. The winner is the first player to play the last card from their hand to a player who is unable to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is Hungarian version of the monopoly game that, like Parker Brothers', must have been issued around 1935, because the currency Peng&otilde; was in use in Hungary from 1927 till mid 1946. In addition the banknotes have a kind of &quot;engines-pattern&quot; that resembles that of Parker Brothers' but with 2 engines and 2 houses left and right from the circle-with-number-in-the-center. Everything indicates an imitation rather than a license of Parker Brothers.<br/><br/>The lid of the box shows a slightly reduced copy of the oblong game board in the colors red, beige and black.<br/>The long sides always have 12 fields between the corners whereas the short ones have 7 spaces. Therefore the streets of the 3rd and 7th group are on 2 sides of the board. The first group is made up of districts of PEST, those of the 5th group of districts of BUDA, whereas all other spaces are streets of BUDAPEST. The back side of the pretty beige colored property deeds is unprinted.<br/><br/>The streets have no prices on the game board, and the groups are marked by stripes, triangles, crosses and circles. There are but 3 stations which in addition are not situated in the middle of the sides. On the other hand there are also 3 public works, viz. besides the Electric- and Gas Works there is Telephone as well. There are 3 tax spaces. Really Hungarian is the reward of 500 P you get from each player on your name day (N&eacute;vnap).<br/><br/>The lid and the board's midfield shows an illustration of the New York skyline with the remark &quot;statutory protected&quot;.<br/><br/>In the center-area is only 1 space for cards being the 24 orange Chance-cards you have to pull arriving on a Wheel of Fortune space. Instead of &quot;Just visiting in Jail&quot; you are going to relax at the Margit Isle (in the middle of the river Donau). You are not sent to this place in the 3rd corner because there you'll join in a lottery. There you have to throw immediately once more. You'll receive 10-fold in Peng&ocirc;s from the bank the number of pips thrown. Should you throw 12 you even get the first prize of 10,000 Peng&ocirc;s. Instead of Free Parking you'll land in the Sanatorium. You may be sent to it as well by a Chance card, because &quot;You are exhausted, you have to be treated - Go to the Sanatorium!&quot;. It is a kind of jail anyhow, because here again you have to omit 3 turns.<br/><br/>In the inner box is an insert of black plastic containing 5 trays for the equipment. The 7 are printed in black on colored paper in the denominations 10 - 50 - 100 - 200 - 500 - 1000 and 5000 Peng&ocirc;. The tokens consist of 6 colored round discs of timber. There are 32 beige houses of raw timber and 12 red hotels.  One die is black and one red.<br/><br/>",

Each player plays alternately one chip in one direction only. a regular chip may move horizontally or vertically only. A power chip may move also diagonally. A regular chip must slide as far as it can go. Stopped only by reaching the edge of the board, another chip or the opponent's corner. A power chip can stop whenever it wants, but must stop for the same reasons as a regular chip.<br/><br/>Once inside its own corner, no chip can move back into the playing area. A regular chip must move horizontally or vertically as far as it can within the corner, a power chip may move any number of squares, within the corner.<br/><br/>Similar to Aztec Conquest, but in those versions, pieces can only move horizontally or vertically. No power chips to allow diagonal movement or stopping early. Aztec Conquest also allows you to move in and out of your corner freely, while Outwit has a rule that you may not leave your corner once you enter it.<br/><br/>",

The trick, though, is that items of cutlery lie all over the floor, blocking your way to the treats along with the shelving units that stand in the middle of the floor. As in the original Kakerlakak, the cutlery items have a pivot in their center, and players can turn the cutlery during the game to open and close paths.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, she rolls the cutlery die, then moves the cockroach 2-3 spaces based on the number of pips showing, turning an indicated piece of cutlery before, during or after the move. She then rolls and moves again. Starting after her second move, an opponent rolls the cook die after each movement, and if the cook shows up, that player's turn is over and the dice pass left to the next players. Alternatively, if a player reaches her goal, her turn ends.<br/><br/>The first player to reach all four of her food goals, then reach the hole in the kitchen floor wins.<br/><br/>Kakerlakak includes action rules that speed up gameplay. The cockroach and cook players both roll simultaneously, with the cockroach player moving as quickly as possible because as soon as the fifth cook face is rolled, the turn is over. The winning condition remains the same.<br/><br/>",

The armies go forth upon the play of march cards and try to take over other castles. Castles give you gold to spend. Heroes can also search ruins for gold or cool stuff.<br/><br/>Different scenarios have different winning conditions such as most gold or control of over half the castles.<br/><br/>Artwork is OK and it is fairly easy to collect as it can be found fairly cheap.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     CCG Workshop (no longer available)<br/><br/><br/>Regarding the publisher, Strategic Studies Group is an Australian company that is in no way connected to the other SSG (who published wargames such as Alaric).

And the clowns' code dictates that whoever remains clean the longest wins the argument.<br/><br/>Clown Standoff is separated into two phases. Phase one is a trick-taking phase with simultaneous card selection. Each player has cards 1-6, and four times players each lay down one card; tied cards are eliminated, then the highest card wins. The one exception to this: If a 1 and a 6 have both been played, then the 1 card wins the trick. All winners keep the cards they used to win the tricks, then they move to phase 2.<br/><br/>In Phase 2, six &quot;Pie Throw&quot; cards are in the middle of the table: five &quot;Dodge&quot; cards and one &quot;Hit&quot; card. Starting with whoever has the most cards from phase one, players then take turns as follows: They can draw a card; or they can discard one card from the ones they collected in phase one to shuffle all face-up Pie Throw cards, then draw one; or they can discard cards equal to the number of players who are still in the game to pass their turn to the next player.<br/><br/>If a player draws a Dodge card, nothing happens and the remaining cards move to the next player. If a player draws a Hit card, that player is out of the game; after this, all Pie Throw cards are again shuffled to form a deck, and the player with the most cards from phase one starts a new turn.<br/><br/>The last clown standing wins!<br/><br/>",

After each task the robots will eat some slices of pizza. Number of slices eaten depends on your group&rsquo;s performance on the task. How much pizza will you have left after completing the four tasks?<br/><br/>This is a cooperative game - players must work together as a team to succeed. This is a &ldquo;select-and-pass&rdquo; game (AKA &quot;drafting&quot;) - players pick a card, pass the rest of their hand left, and repeat.<br/><br/>The game includes 20 tasks of increasing complexity making the game suitable for both avid gamers and families. The advanced tasks provide challenge and replayability for avid gamers. Families playing with kids can enjoy the game even without the advanced tasks.<br/><br/>Players get points for collecting different combinations of robots. But because this is a cooperative game, you cannot only think about your own points. You must also think about how your card selection affects players downstream from you. Selecting a specific card might help you a little, but it might help a player one or two positions to your left even more. But then again, you aren&rsquo;t entirely sure what players downstream from you are collecting, and they can't tell you. You have to make an educated guess!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They take court in the company of other guests, make new friends, dance, drink, eat and generally have fun, at the same time creating groups of followers who will help them in case of any trouble. All this takes place in a stylish fire station, temporarily changed into a party room.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to gain as many Fun Points as possible before the end of the game and make life tougher for your opponents. The time passing is measured with successive wedding events. The points are obtained mostly by Winning Over new guests and challenging other players to Duels (you do this by rolling a die and testing one of your attributes - Chat or Muscle - against the corresponding attribute of the opponent/guest).<br/><br/>",

While gameplay is the same as in 'classic' monopoly, this edition features numerous unique changes, including:<br/>- The box is the Canadian flag motif. <br/>- All properties are Canadian replacing the equivalent 'standard Monopoly' properties (a booklet is included describing the actual streets, railroads and utilities used on the board).<br/>- The insert is formed plastic to hold the money (standard) and slots for the properties to be displayed upright and two troughs for the houses and hotels. <br/>- An embossed gold maple leaf enhances the center of the board. <br/>- The Chance, Community Chest and Properties are non-standard sized and bi-lingual.<br/>- The board replaces the cop with a RCMP Mountie on the Go To Jail (Allez au Houscou) corner. <br/>- all railway spaces show the front of a Canadian train rather than the black Parker locomotive<br/>- The 10 metal playing pieces include 9 original to 'classic' version, and a new beaver token (of course!).<br/><br/>For the 2000 2nd edition, all the pewter playing tokens were replaced with 8 true Canadian versions, including: Moose, Ski Plane, Bear, Hockey Player, Winter Boot, Sled, Canoe and Train. Other changes:<br/>- The banknotes design is different: In the centre is a maple leave and to it's left and right is a space showing the name of the sponsor Royal Bank.<br/>-Community chest and chance are replaced with bilingual 'Provincial' cards (red) and 'Federal' cards (yellow), both showing the same skyline picture as the box lid. They all show funny drawings with Mr. Monopoly (as Rich Uncle Pennybags will be called from 2000 onwards). <br/>The text on some of these cards have been adapted to uniquely Canadian situations.<br/><br/>For the 2010 'Electronic Banking' edition of the game, an online contest was conducted in which participants were asked to vote for cities to be on the new board. Unlike the earlier editions, properties were arranged in their final vote order, and are not in any specific geographic arrangement.<br/><br/>",

It is the sequel to the acclaimed and successful &quot;King of 12&quot;, Unlike its sister game, Council of 12 is completely cooperative with an adjustable level of difficulty. Here, the aim is to communally manipulate the central d12 according to the requirements of the cards at hand. Council of 12 is completely self-contained, but builds on the popular core elements of King of 12. Characters are played and negated again and dice are manipulated.<br/><br/>The game includes many different challenges to overcome, as well as an ever-changing selection of characters who will help you do so. Either let chance decide the composition of the Challenge deck, or else tailor it to your desired level of difficulty in your quest for the ultimate high score.<br/><br/>Cooperative: You play your cards face-down. If you manage to correctly guess what cards your team mates will play, this will help you greatly when solving the puzzle posed by the challenge at hand. But even if things don't go as planned, you will often still have a chance to master the challenge &ndash; provided you manage to spot it!<br/><br/>If you survive 7 challenges can you face your final task - securing the line of succession by forging an agreement among all the players.<br/><br/>",

If two players are exclusively pointing to each other, they score, and each gets one point. If three players are all pointing to one another and forming a threesome they each get three points for their feat of sexual teamwork. The first player (or players) to get three or more points wins the game. A successful threesome immediately ends the game, just like Quidditch.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monsterpocalypse is a fast-moving, action-packed battle miniatures game played with detailed hobby miniatures that  portray the most fearsome giant monsters on Earth! When the battle begins, you&rsquo;ll command your monster and lead your units into the city to hunt down and destroy your opponent&rsquo;s monster. Your monster and units each have weapons and abilities that are activated by special dice to help you achieve ultimate victory. Monsters can increase their power throughout the game by smashing buildings and destroying enemy units. When two monsters fight each other, the results are devastating &mdash; they can throw each other across the city, rampage through buildings, and suplex each other into radioactive rubble! The last monster standing wins the game.<br/><br/>The new big box Monsterpocalypse range will be 100% compatible with the existing Monsterpocalypse hobby miniatures game products and plays exactly the same, but requires no assembly. This is a board game version of the classic skirmish game and aims to give the same feeling as the original game while making it more accessible and &ldquo;pick and play&rdquo;. choose your agenda, between the protectors and the destroyers, lead your units into the city and hunt down your opponent, while destroying everything in your way!<br/><br/>The new Monsterpocalyspe product range will include a two-player core box, a multi-player expansion that allows co-op and competitive play for up to four players, and multiple add-ons that offer more monster characters, units, and buildings to expand players&rsquo; collections. The core box will contain 8 classic Monsterpocalypse miniatures representing four different factions: G.U.A.R.D, Planet Eaters, Lords of Cthulu and Terrasaurs, several unit miniatures and awesome plastic buildings, a double-sided game board, and all the dice and tokens needed to play solo, two-player co-op, and two-player competitive games.<br/><br/>The Multiplayer expansion, available as an add-on or a base pledge, will bring three and four-player co-op and competitive games to Monsterpocalypse for the first time with an extra-large double-sided game board designed for multiplayer games. The expansion also includes dice and accessories for two more players as well as five all-new Apex monsters. The Apex monsters include Ultimate Defender-X, Yasheth the Insatiable, Glacier Armodax, Imperator Gorghadra, and Supreme Gallamaxus.<br/><br/>",

With the Washington Naval Conference and its resulting treaty limitations on ship numbers and tonnages, the battleship went completely over to 2nd generation designs, including all the major conversions, and then the final burst of 3rd generation dreadnoughts.    Meantime, also as a result of the treaty, a now type of warship, the heavy cruiser, came to the fore and began a progress still unfinished in the modern missile cruiser. These events through 1945 are covered by BATTLESHIP.  The game system was designed to reflect the concept of the Immune Zone, around which capital ship design revolved. This zone is roughly represented by the medium range defense value. But since when this value will come into effect is a result of the characteristics of the opposing player's guns, you must conduct your movements to, whenever possible, be in your immune zone while your opponent is being fired on at either long or short range. It is within these margins that damage can be done in safety.  A hint: learn to use escorts. Properly handled they can shape an engagement early by threat of torpedo action.&quot;<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Simulations Canada's Battleship<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the box lid:)<br/><br/>Air War: Modern Tactical Air Combat is a unique, ultra-complex simulation of almost every facet of modern aerial combat.  Thirty of the most important aircraft types to emerge since 1952 - from the Soviet Union, United States, Great Britain, France, Israel and other nations - do battle in historical scenarios from the Middle East to Vietnam, from Korea to India-Pakistan, and in various hypothetical scenarios that include World War Three.  The game is played on a geomorphic map across which playing pieces move through a hexagonal grid, which functions like the squares of a chessboard in regulating movement.  Probability charts reveal the outcome of various game functions.<br/><br/>Contents: 48-page rules booklet; 16-page booklet of additional rules &amp; scenarios; 72-page chart booklet; 700 die-cut cardboard playing pieces; eight 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; soft map sections; and various play aids.<br/><br/>Level of Complexity: Very High<br/>Average Playing Time: 2 hours<br/>Suitability for Solitaire Play: Very Low<br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)<br/><br/>At one point called the most complicated wargame ever. This modern air combat game has a scale of 1 airplane per counter, 500 feet per hex and 2.5 seconds per turn.<br/><br/>The rule book is 48 pages long with 28 of those being rules. There is a large display for keeping track of each plane (4 per display) with a separate track for throttle, weapons, acceleration, turning at 5% increments, altitude and attitude giving each plane a true xyz position.<br/><br/>Included is a 16 page booklet of 39 charts and tables. There are also individual sheets for each plane with info, charts and tables. There are also individual charts and tables for each type of missile.<br/><br/>The game rightly suggests that you fly an individual plane around at first to learn how a plane operates before adding weapons. The game for all its detail is not without controversy as to realism. The energy rules and the claim that some aspects of the game are based on educated guesses because of the info on some planes being top secret, have caused this feeling of fudging.<br/><br/>All in all one of SPI's most ambitious projects. There is also an expansion - Air War Update Kit.<br/><br/>",

In addition, 80 victory point chips are included.<br/><br/>Each round is played as follows: the dealer will deal each player three cards. Four cards are played on the table, open. The players now take turns playing cards. On each turn, a player can play exactly one card. A player can use this card to capture a number of cards on the table. Cards can be captured if the sum of those cards is equal to the card played (i.e. you can capture a six and a two by playing an eight). If a player cannot capture any cards, he has to add a card to those open on the table. A player gets one point for capturing all cards on the table.<br/><br/>The round lasts until all players have played their three hand cards. Now, each player receives points: One point for the player who has captured the yellow seven, one point for the player who has captured the most yellow cards and one point for the player who has captured the most cards.<br/><br/>The play continues for a couple of rounds (either six rounds for two or three players, or a number of rounds equal to the number of players if there are four or more players. In the end, the player who has collected the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rock Me Archimedes is a two player abstract game requiring both strategy and dexterity.  The game is named after the ancient Greek mathematician, famous for describing the principle of the lever.<br/><br/>The game consists of: a wooden board affixed to a rounded base, forming a teeter-totter assembly; 14 white marbles and 14 black marbles; and a specially numbered die.  The length of the board is engraved with a grid of spaces in which to fit the marbles, 16 rows of 3 spaces each. The goal of the game is for the winning player to move at least 4 of his marbles to one end of the board without either end of the board touching the table at any time.<br/><br/>The game begins with no marbles on the board, and the board balanced level.  Each player receives 14 marbles of one color, and chooses one end of the board as his goal.  On the player's move, the player may choose to either place a marble in one of the two central rows of the board, or to roll the die. The die will indicate a number from one to three.  The player may then move any of his marbles already on the board the number of spaces indicated by the die roll.  The player may move a single marble, or split the move between two or more marbles.  Marbles may be moved in any direction except diagonally.  The player may jump the opposing player pieces, but not his own. If at any time during the move either end of the board touches the table, the player loses and the game ends.  Otherwise, the first player to place four of his marbles in his goal spaces (last two rows on the end of the board) wins the game.  The rules also contain several variants of the basic game.<br/><br/>",

Unlike many other cooperative games, players cannot see each other&rsquo;s cards. On top, they are not allowed to communicate with each other to provide hints about the cards they hold. Over the course of 1 to 12 missions, between 1 and 5 players will fight a series of terrifying monsters. Each mission requires the player(s) to defeat 7 monsters without running out of cards; their fate is in your hands!<br/><br/>On their turn, a player must select and perform one of the following 5 actions:<br/><br/>Fight - Play one of your action cards face-up next to the monster card on which your hero disc is located.<br/><br/>Move - Whenever you move your hero disc from one monster card to another, you must discard 1 action card from your hand.<br/><br/>Recover - Draw action cards from the draw pile, so that you hold up to 5 action cards in your hand. No matter how many cards you draw, you must then discard a card from your hand, face-down.<br/><br/>Support - Give one or more cards from your hand to a fellow player. The receiving player must then discard at least 1 card from their hand to the discard pile, face-down.<br/><br/>Consult the Oracle - Draw the top 6 action cards from the deck and place them face-up on the table. Choose and discard one of those cards. Then return the remaining 5 cards to the top of the deck in any order of your choosing.<br/><br/>A mission is won when the last Chimera is defeated. However, if a player ever holds no action cards in their hand AND has to draw from the depleted draw pile, the mission is lost. On the other hand, if the draw pile is depleted but the players can still take turns with the cards in their hands, the mission may still be won.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You start on a single tile, but you can't remember the rest of the layout. So you place a new tile each time you look through an open, exterior corridor onto a room tile that you have not seen before. Along the way you can pick up and use Stuff-markers that you find.<br/><br/>This movement and exploration continues until enough of the Elders are captured or neutralized by the Staff, or until one or more of the Elders reaches an exit and escapes.<br/><br/>",

As soon as they start crying, you won't be able to make them happy again. When a player is faced with five crying babies, the game is over and the other players score points for all non-crying babies. Every baby has a point value that is known only by the owner of the baby.<br/><br/>To make your life hard in the daycare center, opponents will attach bad cards to your babies so that they become unhappy. At the end of your turn, you have to find a solution for an unhappy baby or he'll start crying. A few things that happen in the game are stolen pacifiers, babies that need a diaper change, and crying babies that receive a toy horn so they can make even more noise. For almost every card played there is a reaction. For example, if an opponent makes your baby nervous, you can play calming music from a mobile, but as a reaction they can break your mobile to keep the baby nervous. You can feed your baby, but your opponents can steal your food...<br/><br/>If you don't have the right cards to keep your babies happy, don't worry. Your colleagues are there to help! During your turn you can trade cards with other players. If you receive the right card in your turn you can still make your babies happy again and prevent them from crying. But be aware your colleagues can also try to trick you by giving a different card as the one they promised! So do you want to make friends so you maybe could also get a little help later in the game or do you just want to make your colleagues completely mad? It's up to you!<br/><br/>",

The objective is to destroy the enemy headquarters (HQ).  To go on the offensive, deployed units have to be ordered with maneuver cards, which direct the attack along one of three terrain cards between the players.  The defender can freely choose among his deployed units to meet the attackers on that terrain.  The outcome of the resultant combat depends on the influence of the terrain card, the involved units and their attached equipment.  If the attack is not defended against, the attackers inflict damage on the HQ.<br/><br/>The game ends in a victory to the attacker when he or she has inflicted enough damage (typically 20) to their enemy's HQ.<br/><br/>",

It's up to the players to make them happy again by providing the nicest hay, the sunniest weather and the prettiest stable. Finding a farmer (or a farmer's wife) to take care of your cows will make them even happier. Off course, at the same time, you should prevent the other players from doing exactly so.<br/><br/>Each player receives three cow cards (double sided, different moods) and one stable. The remaining cow cards (double sided,  are mixed together with the action cards. Three of them are spread out. The rest of them forms the drawing pile.<br/><br/>On your turn you may either take one of the face up cards or the top card of the drawing pile. If it is a cow card you put in in front of you (without changing it's mood). If it is an action card, you perform the action thereby changing the cows' moods, stealing cows from other players, placing cows inside/outside the stables, etc. As an alternative to drawing a card you may also discard one of the face up which becomes out of play.<br/><br/>The game ends when the drawing pile is used up. The player with the most happy cows (after subtracting minus points for the sad cows) wins the game.<br/><br/>Trivia: The author was loosely inspired by the reality tv show &quot;Boer zoekt vrouw&quot; (Farmer Wants A Wife) when designing this game.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.koezoektboer.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.koezoektboer.nl/</a><br/><br/>",

An attempt was made to fulfill the following conditions:<br/><br/>1. A minimum number of playing pieces, preferably one each. <br/>The smallest possible board.<br/><br/>2. A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.<br/><br/>3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.<br/><br/>4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play forever.<br/><br/>The L game was the result. Each player has only one piece. The board is four squares by four squares.<br/><br/>Appears with 3 SPOT game in Rex Games' Two Smart Games mini-anthology.<br/><br/>",

Player tokens are altered - now you can choose from a jeep, teddy bear, blow drier, leather cap, handcuffs or a stiletto heel.  Properties have been changed to a 'gay' theme as well - e.g. Fire Island and Castro Street.  Instead of buying houses and hotels, you can buy bars and bathhouses.  The money denominations include $3.00 bills.<br/><br/>One departure from the original Monopoly is the inclusion of Family Pride cards.  When landing on the appropriate space, the description of a famous gay man is read aloud, and the player who can correctly identify the person can move ahead to any space on the board.  Also different is the addition of Camp Cards.  When these are drawn, you must perform the indicated action (ie. 'say: 'faaabulous!' six different ways and receive $3).  Finally, there are &quot;hanky code&quot; cards, where the player must identify what each color of the code meant, and what it meant when worn in each (left and right) rear pants pocket.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that there were only a very limited number of copies of this game, as it was produced by The Parker Sisters, a division of Fire Island games, and were sued for copyright infringement by Parker Brothers (the company is no longer in business).<br/><br/>",

Find hidden bombs and dismantle them, help hostages into safety, or take out terrorist leaders. Due to the high variation in goals, targets, threats and specific circumstances, players need to choose their set-up and strategy each time they start a mission or a campaign. Don't just throw in grenades with your buster at public places such as airports and train stations, or else civilians might get hurt, resulting in negative points on your mission balance. (Plus, you know, injuring civilians is not cool.) Develop your primary skill, but don't neglect your attack power, defense power and other skills if you want to stay alive in this thrilling new game.<br/><br/>Countdown: Special Ops is fully modular, with players being able to create their own game by adjusting four different aspects of play:<br/><br/><br/>     Game situations: With more than 200 playing cards, the challenges and threats are different each time you play.<br/>     Game mode: You can play a single mission, a campaign or a scenario; each game mode has its own level and duration, and you're advised to start with a single mission on the lowest level (green).<br/>     Level up: Did you succeed a few times on level green? If so, you might want to try the next (orange) level or even a scenario, that is, three missions in a row with increasing difficulty!<br/>     Goals: Even players' goals can be altered. Countdown: Special Ops is a co-operative game, but if you'd like to change the rules, you could add one or two traitors to the team and play &quot;Traitor Mode&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>Development<br/>You can develop your own Special Op by improving his or her skills. This is done in scenario or campaign play. This brings out interesting aspects of the game in which you have to choose how many risk you want to take to gain extra experience or if you want to move slow and stay alive at all cost...<br/><br/>This variation, combined with the 30-minute time limit per mission, makes the experience of a mission &quot;feel&quot; like an actual PC game in many aspects. Smart development is essential to survive the missions on higher threat levels.<br/><br/>",

Can you time your actions to take advantage of when the flocks fly?<br/><br/>During the game Flock, players try to expand their flock with the goal of scoring the most victory points after three rounds of play. Victory points are scored by controlling the action cards at the end of each round. Also, be sure to have enough tasty worms to feed your birds at the end of each round, or otherwise they will fly away. Will your flock be on top of the pecking order?<br/><br/>In more detail, players start with three of their eleven birds in front of them. Six nest, egg and worm tokens are placed on the side for each player. On a turn, a player can either place a bird on one of the six action cards or activate an action card on which they have at least one bird. When you activate an action card, you can remove birds from the card &mdash; possibly paying worms, nests and eggs as well &mdash; to take the action shown, such as removing two birds from &quot;Feeding&quot; to get three worms. Spent birds are returned to your personal pool of resources, while other spent resources are placed on the side. Each player in turn order does the same with this action, then whether they used their birds or not, all birds are removed from this action card, flying away to the players' personal pools.<br/><br/>When the &quot;Dominance&quot; card is activated, the dominant player adjusts their pecking order on the initiative track, then everyone else flies their birds from that card to the other action cards. When &quot;Competition&quot; is activated, which is possible only when enough birds have landed on it, each player spends a nest and worm for each of their birds (removing them if this isn't possible), then flies their birds to other action cards. Players then score points for having the most or secondmost birds on a card and for the birds left in their pool.<br/><br/>After three rounds, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Under the watchful eye of the occupying garrison, you must fight to keep your way of life alive, lead your students to help your community, and continue to secretly practice your arts. Only one school's style will emerge from these troubled times as the most prominent...will it be yours?<br/><br/>Manchukuo is a worker placement game played over a series of rounds. Each round consists of a day phase, where you assign your students to tasks about town, and a night phase, where you recruit new students and train with them in secret.<br/><br/>The day phase works similarly to a traditional worker placement game. You'll assign groups of students to different locations, and take the action at that location to scale with the number of students you assign. Certain spaces will allow you to gather resources like food, tools, and coins. Other spaces will present opportunities for you to invest those resources back into your troubled community--either by rebuilding, or by helping families in need.<br/><br/>At the end of the day phase, the students you assigned to different locations on the board will count towards your influence in the area. If you have the most influence in an area, you will recruit the students in that area's residence, and then the students you assigned to that area will replace them in that residence. All other players' students in that area return to their schools.<br/><br/>Managing the flow of students you recruit is the key to Manchukuo's gameplay. Recruit too few students, and you may not be able to take as many actions in the next round. Recruit too many students, and you could end up drawing unwanted attention from the garrison, who may enforce extra rules for how you can assign your workers.<br/><br/>Recruiting students is also important for the night phase, when you'll train together. The numbers and types of students in your school determine how you can level up your disciples, who can provide big bonuses to your actions, and who can eventually be promoted to Masters themselves. New Masters can take students with them to open their own schools, spreading your reputation farther than ever before.<br/><br/>At the end of the fifth round, the school with the greatest reputation wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dream Heist is a board game that takes place in the dream world. The board represents the inside of a dreamer's mind, who is known as the Mark. Each player is trying to plant an idea in the Mark's dream, hoping that when he wakes, he will carry out their chosen task. The key is to make your task seem achievable to the Mark and to make sure he believes it was his own idea from its inception. In order to do this the dream needs to be so real, that when the Mark wakes up, the planted idea sticks and he performs the mission without a second thought.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with his or her own mission. This is the core idea that they are trying to plant inside the Mark's mind before the dream ends. Each mission is comprised of four steps: Architect, Forger, Extractor, and Inception. Players must collect the correct number of cards for each of these four steps in order to plant their idea fully. This is done by circling the different dream levels in the direction of your choice. There are spaces for collecting cards and planting ideas. Once an idea is planted in a certain section of the Mark's mind, that section is full. The other players must move to another dream level where the section in need is still available. There are also spaces where players encounter the Mark&rsquo;s subconscious, which can either help or hurt you.<br/><br/>As you move down the dream levels to plant the different phases of your idea, you gain more points. However, it takes more time the further down the levels you go, so you have to plan your route wisely. Ultimately, the Mark will only carry out one player's planted idea when he wakes. This player receives extra points and increases his or her chances for victory.<br/><br/>",

In it, the players, employees of a huge corporation, compete to avoid promotion and remain competent (by taking more &quot;right&quot; decisions than &quot;wrong&quot; ones). At the same time, each tries to force the others into promotion or into &quot;deadwood&quot; status (which happens by accumulating enough wrong decisions and being found out). The last player still alive and competent is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game was originally published by Skor-Mor in 1973, but the 1981 AH edition is much easier to find.<br/><br/>Skor-Mor published 3D puzzles and games in clear plastic such as Chess in the Third Dimension and a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe called Trinary. It disappeared in the early 1980s.<br/><br/>A related game, theme-wise, is AH's Bureaucracy.<br/><br/>",

Starting in the Servants' Hall, each player is dealt Destination cards which have varying values indicated by the number of bells on the card. This relates to how important or difficult the task is. The players must then navigate their way around the corridors and stairs of the Abbey, throwing the dice to determine how many moves they can make.<br/><br/>Once they reach the destination of a task, they collect their bell tokens, and the next player throws the dice to set off for the next job. But nothing is that simple! Along the way, a player can land on a 'Carson Card' space and have to take a card, which could either help or hinder them. On other spaces, the player may have to collect a 'Letter' which could call them away from the Abbey, slowing them down or costing them bells! And which route will they take? A short easy looking one to get a job done earning only one bell, or a longer route with the possibility of collecting a higher reward?<br/><br/>The winner is the player who has completed all their jobs and collected the most bells.<br/><br/>",

Each turn you can either play an action card by giving it to another player, who must do what the action says, or play any number of Cubu cards, as long as they continue in the sequence begun. Sequences grow by color or location, and progress either up or down &ndash; but must go in the same direction in a single turn. Box number is determined by counting from the inside out. The first player to empty his hand wins the round and scores points for each card left in opponents' hands: 5 points per Cubu card, and 10 points per action card.

After the movement, the player has either reached a special field of the board or gets to draw a random encounter card. This may be an item to pick up or an enemy that must be overcome. At the special fields, keys may be collected or allied spirits recruited.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with a special die, which is rolled alternately by the player and by the enemy. Depending on the roll of this die, the rolling party may regain health, inflict damage or invoke special powers. These powers allow to deal more damage, regain health, collect treasure after victory etc. Each player and each enemy has three such powers, and the die roll determines which is used.<br/><br/>During the game, players collect rewards like gems and tokens that increase their fighting power. They may also increase their power by recruiting an allied spirit.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to collect four keys and open the treasure vault. To collect a key, a coin must be tossed when a key field of the board is reached. The coin is made of cardboard and shows either YES or NO. If the NO side comes up, the action fails and no key is found. The same mechanic is used to check if the treasure vault can be opened once it is reached with four keys - if this fails, four new keys must be collected to retry.<br/><br/>To hinder the success of the other players, mines can be used. These represent small traps of different type. If a player walks across such a mine - represented by a small cardboard chit - the mine may e.g. destroy equipment.<br/><br/>Rules are in English, German and Russian.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme:<br/><br/>Game is themed around a purification ritual of the ancient Etruscan people, who predated the Roman Empire around 6th century B.C.  Each player represents a different temple, faithful to the divinities Achvizr, Alpan, Leinth, and Thalna.  On &quot;Tagete's&quot; day, the Etruscan Haruspexes [priests] proceed down the path of purification to the Velthumena Altar.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>Each player has 8 pawns representing &quot;Haruspexes&quot; [priests] in their color.  Each player is trying to move their priests along the path of purifiction from their home temple to the altar at the center of the board.  One player may also choose the path of darkness and consecrate themselves to the divinity &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; with the goal of elminating all rival priests.  This role is only available in 3 and 4 player games.  If a player chooses this path, then another single player may consecrate themselves to &quot;Lasa Vecuvia&quot; with a different set of powers.  This player's goal is to now move their priests to set &quot;passages&quot; on the path and place 4 seals to win the game.  This role is only available in 4 player games.<br/><br/>Players win by having the most priests in the center altar at game end.  If a player chooses Tuchulcha's power, they win by eliminating all other priests, and lose if any priest enters the altar.  A player that chooses the Lasa Vecuvia power wins only by placing all 4 seals.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Game plays with 2, 3, or 4 players. Each player begins the game with 8 pawns on their home temple.  On their turn players roll 2 dice.  If doubles are rolled, the player may throw a third die.  Then player chooses to move one or more of their pawns the number of pips shown on each die.  For example, if a 5 and a 2 are rolled, a player may move one pawn 5 and another 2, or one pawn 5, and then 2 [not seven at once].  This is important as where you land can be significant on each move.  Players move their pawns around a spiral path approaching the altar at the center.  Along the way players will encounter other players' pawns, and special spaces on the path.  These spaces can increase the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of players' pieces by two times of three times [Mystical Stones], or &quot;passage&quot; spaces can banish them to the Tuchulcha forest.  While Mystical Stone spaces are powerful in defense, pawns must move off these spaces as soon as they can.  Pawns can normally pass through each other regardless of owner.  Any number of a single player's pawns may occupy a single space.  However, when a pawn would land on another player's by exact count, it must equal the &quot;spiritual strength&quot; of the player's pieces in the space.  Normally, spiritual strenght is one per pawn, but in the 2x or 3x spaces these are multiplied respectively.  If a moving player can eqaul the spiritual strength of pawns in the space, then the occupying pawns are banished to the Tuchulcha forest.  These pawns are essentially out of the game, but can be used to activate the alternate &quot;Tuchulcha&quot; player role. Once a pawn banishes an opponent's pawn, it may not move again this turn.  2 player game uses 2 &quot;neutral&quot; colors which any player can move during their turn.  3 player game adds the optional Tuchulcha player role, and 4 player adds both Tuchulcha and Lasa Vecuvia roles to play.<br/><br/>At any time one and only one player [in 3 and 4 player games], may choose to take on the role of Tuchulcha [a god of destruction]. To activate this power, the player must &quot;sacrifice&quot; 3 pawns.  These pawns may come from the home temple, altar, path, or Tuchulcha forest.  Once activated, the Tuchulcha player's new objective is to eliminate all other players' pawns.  As soon as one other player's pawn enters the altar, Tuchulcha loses and is eliminated from the game.  This can make this role selection a risky move.  However, this player gains powerful new abilities. Tuchulcha's pawns can never be banished to the forest, he rolls 4 dice and selects the 3 best, and no longer has to stop after banishing an opponent's pawn.<br/><br/>If a player chooses to be Tuchulcha in a 4 player game, then another [and only one] player may take the role of Lasa Vecuvia.  This player must still have 4 active pawns in play to activate.  This player's objectives are now to &quot;seal&quot; the 4 passages along the path.  These passages normally banish pawns to the forest, but when the Lasa player lands a pawn on the passage, she places a seal token on the passage and removes the pawn from play.  Once she places all four seals in this manner she wins the game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>32 high quality wooden pawns in 4 colors<br/>4 green wooden dice with gold pips and rounded corners<br/>1 double sided game board for 3 and 4 player games<br/>1 full color illustrated rules booklet<br/><br/>",

Players take the roles of &quot;Toa&quot; (the main charecters of Bionicle) and move around a posterized game board attempting to complete challenges on the island of Mata Nui.  When a challenge is successfully completed, a player is awarded a mask which grants additional, optional powers to him.  First player to achieve getting all 6 of his Toa's masks (the masks are pre-constructed  pieces, same as those found in the toys) wins.  Despite being marketed as a CCG, the starter decks themselves are quite literally complete, mini-board games in and of themselves. There are 3 expansions; Rahi Challenge, which added new cards, Bohrok Swarm, which could be played independently and introduced a new mechanic, &quot;Bohrok Control&quot;, and The Bohrok Awake, which was a promotion released alongside Mighty Kids Meals from the McDonald's fast food chain.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A bagatelle board resembles a light, flat board with nails (pins!) in it and short raised sides to keep the ball on the playfield during play.  Each ball is launched from some sort of spring-loaded 'shooter' or cue, to the top of the board, where it then rolls towards the player, bouncing off the pins or landing in any of several scoring pockets.  These scoring pockets can be depressions in the playfield, nails arranged in a U-shape, or both.  They are marked with various score values, with the higher values usually protected by more pins or tougher paths to reach them.  By &quot;shooting&quot; the ball harder or softer, the player can try to control where the ball drops.<br/><br/>A spring-loaded shooter is normally in the bottom right corner of the board. A ball is placed before the shooter mechanism. The shooter devise is pulled back and let go, with the aim to fire the ball up to the rounded end of the board and then to bounce around the nails or pins and, hopefully, land in a scoring area. A cue shooter is just a wooden object, rather like a miniature version of a Billiards cue. To launch a ball, the player merely shoots it by hitting the back of the ball with the cue thus sending it to the top of the board.<br/><br/>Note that it is possible for a ball not to score at all. This usually means that the ball reached the bottom of the board without settling into a scoring pocket.<br/><br/>Typically, a player might get 3 or more balls and a note of the total score achieved is taken. The first to reach a pre-agreed number of points, wins.<br/><br/>Bagatelle sets can be made of wood, metal or plastic and they can be of any size (but it must be able to stand on an average table). They are often linked to a theme, really as an excuse to feature related graphics. The game is a direct ancestor of modern Pinball machines.<br/><br/>",

All three titles are lightweight party games with simple mechanics accompanied by amusing cartoons.<br/><br/>In Gierki Małżeńskie, which roughly translates to &quot;Marriage Games&quot; players play in pairs (1-4 couples) and solve multiple challenges presented on cards. There are four types of cards: <br/><br/>     Guessing what a partner would do in a given situation (i.e. who knows their partner the best)<br/>     Charades<br/>     Describing a given word without using a few other specified words<br/>     General knowledge questions<br/><br/><br/>It is possible to play with multiple couples (up to four) - in such case couples compete with each other. There is also a one couple variant in which partners compete against each other.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Something Different is a card game that started out with a simple idea: A game in which the rules change as you play. What it evolved into is a fantastic party game in which players get to know each other and engage in hilarious challenges.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of 100 cards. Each player starts with a hand of seven cards and is attempting to empty his hand to win. Next to the main deck, three cards are turned face up, each with a different rule. Each turn you play a card on one of these piles from your hand, changing the current rules in play. If you break a rule at any time, you draw a card. Sounds simple enough, but it gets better. The basic rules tell you which color cards you can play or what suit they need to be, but other cards may restrict what you can do physically, such as making you keep one hand on the table or making you talk like a pirate.<br/><br/>The other notable mechanism in the game includes personal trivia, duels, and mini events called &quot;switch-a-roos&quot;. When trivia rules are in play, you get to test another player's knowledge of you. If they answer a question wrong, they draw a card &mdash; but at least they learned something about you! Duels are just as they sound &mdash; thumb wars, staring contests and more &mdash; but while you duel someone, play continues. The winner of a duel brags, the loser draws more cards. Switch-a-roos change the playing field, causing people to swap hands, trade seats, or reverse the order of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pairs in Pears is a word game consisting of plastic letter tiles inside a cloth bag shaped like a pear. It is from the Bananagrams (letter tiles in a banana) company.<br/><br/>The Pairs in Pears game involves making pairs of intersecting words that consist of tiles of all the same pattern. One word is up/down and the other is left/right, and they share a vowel or consonant. Whoever makes a certain number of word pairs first, wins. Pairpoints is a variation that includes a more elaborate scoring scheme (1 point for non-pattern-matching words, 2 points for matching words, 5 points for finishing first).<br/><br/>The large, ivory-like tiles show capital letters in four designs: solid, outline, lines and dots. The different patterns function like different suits of cards. As there are four suits, each containing a complete alphabet, there are a total of 104 tiles. Just as in a deck of cards, each tile is unique (e.g., the G of solids or the H of dots). This adds an interesting new dimension to play with (although the games in the rules only ask that a word consist of same-pattern letters).<br/><br/>The instructions emphasize the educational value of the tile set: a fun way for children to develop memory and cognitive skills while learning alphabetical order, word construction, vowels, vocabulary, rhyming, and more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Badaboom is a humorous card game for 3-5 players. The 30-60 minutes of game play feature loads of explosive action, a high level of player interaction, a non-sequential order of play, fabulous contraptions, numerous chances to stick it to your opponents in nasty ways and stunning graphics from the artists behind Spank the Monkey and Kablamo. The game contains 64 cards, 50 Gold Coin markers, 2 Bomb Armed markers and a rules folder.<br/><br/>The players of Badaboom take on the roles of wretched goblins in penal servitude under the cruel High Necromancer. Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and try reverse engineering, tinkering style, on various explosive contraptions manufactured by their master&rsquo;s enemies. But the task to gain hands-on personal knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime supply of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out, and the only way to succeed with this is to earn the gold coins needed for bribing their greedy guards.<br/><br/>The fundamentals of Badaboom are quite simple, but there are lots of tricks and tactics that add depth. Basically, the players take turns holding and tinkering with the bomb while striving to do three things:<br/>&bull; Remove valuable mechanisms from the bomb.<br/>&bull; Change the nature of the bomb in a way that is favorable to the current player but not necessarily to the others.<br/>&bull; Make damn sure to stay away from the explosion when the bomb goes off.<br/><br/>This may sound straightforward, but things are made complicated by the fact that any player can steal the bomb during other players&rsquo; turns. And it&rsquo;s very tempting to steal it. Not only do players get to tinker with the bomb when holding it. They may also draw a card from the deck, and as the deck is placed face up revealing the next card, the players know what they can gain by stealing the bomb. This makes the bomb skip and turn a lot during the game, keeping all players on their toes.<br/><br/>To win, players need to perfect their timing, make every card count and, of course, avoid losing their heads.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by<br/><br/><br/>    Big Badaboom<br/><br/><br/>",

If no answer or not enough answers fit the category, be the first to yell &quot;No Joe&quot; to claim the card. The first player to collect ten cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Essentially a board game version of &quot;Paper-Scissors-Rock,&quot; Casting Stones uses a &quot;Spells-Potions-Charms&quot; hierarchy for competition between players. Players &quot;cast&quot; by rolling their allotted five coin-like &quot;Casting Stones&quot; to generate Spells, Potions or Charms, depending on which way the stones land. The object is to beat your opponent's roll and end up putting a &quot;Gem&quot; on one of the game board &quot;Turrets.&quot; The first person to place four Gems on four consecutive Turrets wins. The game can become interesting when certain casting situations allow one player to knock another's Gems off the Turrets, thereby setting the opponent back a step. Players can up the level of gaming complexity in the &quot;Intermediate Game&quot; by adding the two &quot;Casting Cards&quot; into game play. These are included with the Starter Set and enhance the effect of Spells, Potions and Charms. The &quot;Advanced Game&quot; adds more options and strategies to game play, yet requires separate purchases of additional Casting Stones and Casting Cards sold in &quot;Refill Sets.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A casting call has gone out for the reality show &quot;HUNGER&quot;! Are you ready for the adventure of a lifetime? Do you have the wits to survive, with other participants, on a deserted tropical island? Or simply want to win $1,000,000? If so, HUNGER is searching for self-reliant contestants to attempt this bold adventure.<br/><br/>HUNGER: The Show is a fast paced family game with rich player interaction. To win, you have to predict your opponent&rsquo;s actions. On the island, you can gather fruit and catch chickens to get more food. But to win, you also have to collect raft pieces. It's a good thing that no one would ever think of stealing food and raft parts from other participants...<br/><br/>HUNGER is a family/filler game for 2-6 players, ages 7 and above, lasting 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Story: Welcome to HUNGER Reality Show! There is a 1 Million Dollar Prize and there can only be one winner. Alongside other participants, unfortunately not your best friends, you are cast onto a desert island. There is some food provided by the TV crew but it will not last long. You will be hungry very soon and will have to start picking fruit or catching chickens. You will also need to build a raft if you are serious about winning the prize. The first person to leave the island will be declared as winner. You will need rope and raft wood, which are hard to find. Well, you could always try to steal from the others, but would you?<br/><br/>Mechanic: Players simultaneously choose their next action and destination on the island. To be successful, players need to predict the other players' actions but also stay focused on their goal: having enough food to survive the next day (or otherwise being evacuated by the film crew according to the principle &lsquo;your safety is our highest priority&rsquo;) and building the raft as quickly as possible. Balancing those needs is key to winning the game. This is what makes the game so broadly appreciated among gamers but also non-gamers, families and children. The game is fast, smooth and easy to play and has no downtime, while allowing for a lot of player interactions. The better player will on average usually win most games but it is possible for a 7-year-old to win on occasion too, which makes the game a fun experience for everyone.<br/><br/>",

It includes 36 cards, 1 to 7, draw 2, all in colors of Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow, and four wild cards. Game play is similar to ordinary Uno. The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt a hand of five cards. Players take turns discarding cards by matching the most recent discard in color or number. This version includes different characters for each number so that characters could also be matched. A player with one card remaining must yell Uno or draw two cards. Players without a matching card must draw one card from the draw stack. If the drawn card matches, it may be played immediately, otherwise the player's turn ends. The two special cards are the wild which permit a player to name a color for the next card to be played and the draw two which forces the next player to pick up two cards and lose their turn. The goal is to be the first player to discard all the cards in their hand.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>All My First UNO games are grouped together in the database because there is seemingly no difference among them other than the featured characters.<br/><br/>",

Your task is to extract valuable materials from extrasolar planetoids and deliver the appropriate amounts of each to their target locations. It is imperative that these deliveries be made at any cost.<br/><br/>In the uncertain days leading up to the destructive Cataclysm of Earth, humans have settled other worlds and created robotic vessels to perform manual labor throughout their civilization. You will take on the role of one of these artificial intelligences tasked with mining asteroids for rare minerals and ice water, and delivering them to the colonies of humanity.<br/><br/>The goal of Ricochet Rock Jockeys is to retrieve goods from the Asteroid Fields between Earth and its colonies, and deliver them. You will explore the space surrounding Earth, mine asteroids, and make deliveries &ndash; all while vying for position with other players attempting to mine those same asteroids and make those same deliveries. Ricochet Rock Jockeys is an extremely fast-paced game of chance, delivery, and crashing spaceships.<br/><br/>Players start with a ship on Earth, then move that ship to explore, mine, and deliver mined goods. Players can bump into other players' ships, taking or losing goods based upon the strength of the impact. Players gain victory points for each successful delivery. Once the pool of victory points is exhausted, the player with the most VPs wins!<br/><br/>",

Will you play the right weapons at the right time? Each round you want to take down your opponents and be the only one left standing.<br/><br/>Each player in Duel: Once Upon a Game in the West starts with a hand of six cards: 3 pistols, 1 rifle, 1 barricade, and 1 reloading. Each player also starts with a heart card on the table in front of them, showing their current state of being alive. Each shootout proceeds as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Each player chooses one card in hand and places it face down in front of them.<br/>    Each player raises one hand, then (on the command of the current dueling master) points their gun hand at an opponent.<br/>    Each player reveals their card, then they see what happens:<br/><br/><br/>&bull; If you fired at someone with a gun (whether pistol or rifle), any shots aimed at you miss because you were moving when you fired.<br/>&bull; If you fired at someone with a pistol and they are behind a barricade, nothing happens as the barricade stops your shot.<br/>&bull; If you fired at someone with a rifle and they are behind a barricade, the rifle penetrates the barricade and they're hit; they flip their heart card to show a grave marker, indicating that they're out for the rest of the duel.<br/>&bull; If you were behind a barricade, then you're hit or not hit depending on the weapon(s) fired at you.<br/>&bull; If you were reloading and someone fired at you, then you're hit; flip your heart card to show a grave marker as you're out for the remainder of the duel.<br/>&bull; If you were reloading and no one fired at you, take all of your previously played cards back into your hand.<br/><br/>If more than one player still has a heart showing, place the previously played cards aside and start a new shootout as described above. If only one player has a heart, then this player earns $1; after this, everyone takes all their cards in hand and begins a new round of shootouts.<br/><br/>As soon as one player has $5, the game ends and this player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a humorous adult card game. Play 'John' cards on your girls to make money. The first player to earn $1500 wins the game. Beware, making money can be difficult. Other players can send your girls to jail. They can't make money until you bail them out. For some reason, this doesn't cost any money.  If one of your girls fails a health exam, she is off the street. A clean bill of health brings her back. You can steal girls from other pimps or steal their Johns. You can get more girls too. This is a good thing, since each girl will only work for you four times.<br/><br/>Each John is described by a profession or some characteristic. For example there is a Gardener John, a British John, and a Rancher John. Each card describes what services he desires (with some interesting euphemisms), and how much he pays for a trick. Some Johns have favorites. These Johns will pay triple. The above Johns' favorites are the Garden Ho, the Tally Ho, and the Westward Ho.<br/><br/>",

Any dice added to the tray must match by colour, number or letters. The first player to get rid of her dice is the winner.<br/><br/>Game 2<br/><br/>Game 2 is a variant of Yacht where the object is to have the highest points score after 11 rounds of play. The player draws five dice out of the bag and rolls all of them. The player may then take up to two more rolls with their choice of one or more of these five dice. Simply put aside the dice you do not want to roll, and roll the rest. Any of these dice may be rolled in any of your three rolls, except that all five must be rolled on the first roll. At the end of your turn, you must score your exposed dice faces in one of the eleven spaces in your column of the scoring sheet. If you cannot or do not wish to enter a score in any of the eleven spaces, then you must score a zero in your choice of one of the eleven spaces.<br/><br/>Game 3<br/><br/>All 24 spaces in the dice tray are used for Game 3. A player draws one die out of the bag, rolls it, and places it face up in any one of the 24 dice spaces in the tray. After the starting die is placed in the tray, the player to the left of the starting player draws four dice out of the bag and rolls them. The player looks at the dice to see if any of these can match the die already in the tray. The dice can match by either number, color or letter in any combination. If a match can be made, the player places the die in the tray and scores points. Dice are scored by making strings of two or more adjacent dice, all of the same color or kind. All numbered faces (0 through 9) score as their numerical value. The R, S and D2 each score as 20 points. The W and WD4 are not scored.<br/><br/>After a player finishes their turn, the next player takes a turn using the same dice. Thus a player will usually begin her turn with one less die than the previous player. In this way, the first player will have four dice to roll, the second three, the third will have two, and so on. When a player, down to only one die, is able to play it, then the next player starts the pattern over again by drawing four fresh dice from the bag, rolls them and play proceeds from there.<br/><br/>The game ends when the dice tray is full. The winner is the player with the highest total score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Touring is a card game with the theme of an automobile trip. Players are competing to be the first one to complete a prescribed set of mileage cards. In all versions of the game you need 16 mileage cards to win. From lowest to highest value cards, the required counts are 8, 4, 2 and 2. Other players will try to slow you down by playing cards against you which cause you to lose mileage cards, or to play &quot;problem&quot; cards which you must remove by playing a corresponding &quot;remedy&quot; card.<br/><br/>The game can be played in partnership for the 4- and 6-player versions, with each partnership playing as a single driver.<br/><br/>Touring was originally published in 1906 by the Touring Card Company, then sold by Wallie Dorr, and then later picked up by Parker Brothers in 1924. Winning Moves Games currently (2015) holds the trademark for and publishes Touring.  If the mechanics sound familiar, it is the inspiration for the game Mille Bornes, which has since become more popular.<br/><br/>As driving technology improved, card names and depicted mileage values became outdated and were thus replaced with longer distances.  There are multiple sets of rules, which reflect these changes.  A recent edition added some card categories.<br/><br/>The action card types are different between Touring and Mille Bornes. For example, Mille Bornes adds the &quot;protective&quot; cards, e.g. Emergency Vehicle which allows you to ignore speed limits. Thus in Mille Bornes a player has more decisions to make.<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>     The Lindy Flying Game - A 1927 Nucraft Toys version of Touring based on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.  <br/>     Lindy, the New Flying Game - 1927 Parker Brothers sequel where Touring card play has been themed on Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic.<br/>     Mille Bornes - A similar game to Touring, first published in 1954.<br/>     Wings: The Air Mail Game - Another &quot;flying&quot; game like Lindy, but card deck split into two parts with different colors.<br/>     Stap op - The Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic game Touring, from 1950 and still published today.<br/><br/><br/>Stap op is the Dutch adaptation (bikes!) of the classic American game Touring (cars!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Little Red vs. Pinocchio is the second game in the Scary Tales series of two-player games pitting common fairy tale characters against each other. Here's more about the two characters in this game from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Little Red is a scorned girl on a mission to prove that you may be able to fool her once, but you can't fool her twice! Pinocchio is a fibbing, scheming puppet that won't let you pull his strings. They both want to rule over the land, and they've got the drive to win. With the help of their companions, the Woodsman and the Cricket, each of them will be tough to beat.&quot;<br/><br/>The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.<br/><br/>Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player spends his movement points either moving his frogs toward their goal (the other side of the board), or moving logs and cars in an attempt to block or squash the other player's frogs. Complete with &quot;bonus points&quot; for landing on flies, this is actually a pretty faithful interpretation of the video-game; but far too simple to have any long-lasting interest.

In this game of true court cases, players are in the position to judge for themselves. Five hundred cards outline the cases--and with names like &quot;Trespassing Hounds,&quot; &quot;Shocking News,&quot; &quot;Forced Nuptials,&quot; and &quot;Quality Chicken,&quot; players are sure to be intrigued. The game can be played by two players or two teams. To start, a team rolls the die. A 1, 2, or 3 lets them know how many scorecard spaces they can fill in if they arrive at the correct verdict. After reading a case, they deliberate, debate, and finally decide for or against the plaintiff. A correct verdict advances the team. An incorrect verdict leaves them cooling their heels.

        "description": "You are a freelance journalist working in the city of Arkham. One day you hear about a mysterious ritual taking place in the underground cellar of the city&rsquo;s prestigious Miskatonic University. You and your team decide to infiltrate and investigate the ritual anonymously, in the hope of securing the next exclusive. Without much thought you step into the cellar, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long before you come to regret your decisions. The cellar is a shrine to ancient god and the horrifying ritual is tearing apart the minds of those who participate, causing them to go insane!<br/><br/>In the dark and musty cellar, worshipers are passing around artifacts. The light is dim so you can&rsquo;t quite make out the artifacts you are passing around. However, further away in the distance you get a glimpse of what others are holding. You can see the effect these magical artifacts are having on their bearers. You will need to deduce what you&rsquo;re holding by studying the other worshipers.<br/><br/>Preserve your sanity and escape from the ritual alive!<br/><br/>Game Play Overview<br/><br/>In Arkham Ritual, you don&rsquo;t see the card you are holding. Instead, you see the cards other players are holding. You must guess the card you are holding by looking at other players&rsquo; cards and the cards that have already been played.<br/><br/>The game is played over multiple rounds where each round consists of multiple turns. During each turn, one player draws the top card of the deck, looks at it, and passes it to another player. The player who receives the card has a choice either to a) discard the card he / she is holding face up and take the new card without looking at it, or b) pass the card to another player without looking at it. After a player takes a turn, another player takes his / her turn.<br/><br/>The round continues until one of the round end conditions is met, at which point all players reveal their cards. At this time, if you are holding a cursed (red) card, then the card corrupts your mind and you lose your sanity. If you are holding a sane (blue) artifact card but some other players are also holding the same artifact card (regardless of their color), the artifacts create an unpleasant resonance, corrupts your mind, and you will lose your sanity. You successfully survive the ritual only if you are holding a unique sane (blue) card.<br/><br/>Players lose their sanity by discarding sanity markers. New rounds continue until one or more players have lost all their sanity markers. All players who still have sanity markers survive the ritual. Will you successfully investigate the ritual and come out alive!?<br/><br/>Components<br/>28 cards<br/>30 sanity tokens<br/>7 player aids<br/>1 play sheet<br/><br/>",

Each player takes five of these cards at random, places them in a + pattern, then turns them face-up; the other five cards form that player's hand. Each card has two of twelve symbols in the upper-left corner.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player replaces one card in his + with a card from his hand, moving the first card into the + of his left-hand opponent in the same location; that opponent discards the card that was in that location. If a player creates a horizontal or vertical line of cards which each feature the same symbol, that player takes a key card showing that symbol. (A player can claim a particular type of key only once.) If all five cards in a player's + show the same symbol, the player can claim any key card that he does not already have.

        "description": "UWO's (unidentified walking objects) are residents of the planet Znorf. There are two kinds of UWO; The Gnorfs and the Pnorfs. Both of them are able to morf. But that is something that will be explained later on. The Gnorfs think that the Pnorfs are a group of ugly creatures and that feeling is completely mutual. All the more reason for them to start a war!<br/><br/>beginning of the game<br/>UWO is a cardgame and a boardgame at the same time. Both players have six energy cards. The playing field is formed by the energy cards of both players. One player places them horizontally, directly in front of him. The other player does this at the side vertically, just like on the photo. The playing field is between these energy cards. <br/>Both players place their ten 'regular' UWO's of their own color in front of them in two rows of five each. The players shuffle their pack of cards and place them both upside down in front of them.<br/><br/>energy<br/>Just like life on our planet, life on Znorf is expensive too. Everything you do will cost you &quot;Energy&quot;. you have to pay it for morfing, walking or fighting. Strong UWO's use much energy. If both players used all of their six energy, then a round is over. Everyone gets back his energy. But beware! If you're out of energy and your opponent isn't yet, he will play several turns at once! And for your opponent, weak (and cheap) UWO's come in handy now. They can do a lot of damage to you!<br/><br/>many different UWO's<br/>There are no less than eight different UWO's in the game. Some are riding Knorfs (strange animails). They can trample everyone. Others are cowards, hiding in bunkers, etc.<br/>UWO's carry many different weapons. Lasers, dynamite, granades, bazooka's, etc. The bazooka UWO for instance, is one of the coolest of the gang and he himself thinks so too. He is extremely powerful. He can even blow up tanks! Unfortunately, such a bazooka is a great danger to our tiny UWO. Each time he has shot someone, he will be knocked out until the end of your next turn!<br/>UWO's are specialists. Every UWO has protection against a specific other UWO. For instance, a UWO in a tank has protection against one who fights with his bare hands.<br/><br/>dynamite UWO<br/>Well, let's just say there's only one of it on each side. One who can be quite important to both players...<br/><br/>morfing<br/>UWO's can morf in exchange for one energy point: UWO cards may be placed on UWO's that are already in the game. This way, a regular UWO can be morfed into anything you want to, just like that! This can be very useful. Imagine a laser UWO threatening you. Your opponent announces that it's going to attack!! Don't panic, his UWO can never hit you when you are hiding in a bunker! So, when you have this card, just morf your furry alien into one and shoot back...and hope your opponent doesn't morf his UWO into a grenade UWO...<br/><br/>the pack of cards<br/>At the end of each turn each player may refill his/her cards to 3. But beware, players can run out of cards. The game still goes on untill all UWO's of one player in the battlefield are destroyed. It is very easy for an opponent to adapt his army to yours, when you are not able to morf anymore! Imagine your opponent creating a small army of laser UWO's to attack your last bazooka UWO! They have protection against this weapon. You may panic now, cause your lost.<br/>In the pack of cards, there are also nine &quot;miss cards.&quot; When you play this card, the shot will automatically be declared &quot;missed&quot; and of course you will have the chance to shoot back with this UWO. But don't play these cards to fast! Smart opponents remember how many you have left. When you lost them all, your opponent knows that every shot will be a hit. Sometimes it's smarter to just sacrifice a UWO, than to play a miss card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While marketed as a board game, the Magic Robot Quiz game is probably more accurately a &quot;curiosity&quot; game. The &quot;game&quot; consists of placing a little robot figurine which holds a pointer in the center of a circular pattern of questions. The robot is rotated to a particular question, and then lifted from the question area and placed in the center of the circular pattern of answers, whereupon the figurine auto-rotates to point to the correct answer.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the board simply consist of a magnet in the figurine and two magnets in the board. The question area sets the correct offset on the robot's magnet, and then the robot is allowed to freely rotate in the answer area to provide the corresponding alignment.<br/><br/>The game is essentially a trivial pursuit limited to eight sets of 14 questions with a &quot;wow&quot; factor for kids.<br/><br/>Merit also released a &quot;World of Sport&quot; version of the game which used an Olympic torchbearer to point to the right answer.<br/><br/>Magic Robot Contents:<br/><br/>1 board<br/>1 Robot figurine<br/>4 overlay mats with questions and answers<br/><br/>",

Other players in turn must follow with the same number of cards featuring a higher numeric value or pass.  If two players put down the same single card in a row, the next player's in line misses a turn.

For those who really want to resolve these questions in the most scientific way possible, there is now Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Dice! Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock was invented by Sam Kass and brought to the world by the popular sitcom The Big Bang Theory. Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock Dice brings all the fun of Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock into a game that everyone can enjoy! For those of you who don&rsquo;t know what Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock is or how it works, here&rsquo;s a quick review:<br/><br/>Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock. It&rsquo;s very simple. Look, scissors cuts paper. Paper covers rock. Rock crushes lizard. Lizard poisons Spock. Spock smashes scissors. Scissors decapitates lizard. Lizard eats paper. Paper disproves Spock. Spock vaporizes rock. And as it always has, rock crushes scissors.<br/><br/>In Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock Dice, each player has a six-sided die with images representing each of the possible choices. The sixth side indicates a Reroll. Players all roll their die, if you are eliminated and do not eliminate someone else, you are out. The last person left wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pro Tennis simulates tennis matches in the early 1980's, the era of Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Martina Navritolova and Chris Evert. Included are cards for 50 men and 50 women professionals. Each card has a column for &quot;Serve&quot;, &quot;Serve Return&quot;, &quot;Volley&quot; and &quot;Special&quot;. Play consists of rolling dice (two white dice, plus a red die that isn't added to the others but sometimes changes the outcome) and cross-indexing the number rolled with the proper column. The result will be a point for one of the players or an instruction to roll next in one of the other columns. Once in a while, a player gets to make a choice that varies a column's results, and random events, such as stomach cramps, broken rackets, arguments with the umpire and thunderstorms, are possible.<br/><br/>To take an example, Connors is pitted against McEnroe. Connors has the serve. He rolls 1, 5 (white) and 3 (red). The dice roll is 15 (read the dice as digits, low roll first); the red is ignored unless it's a 5 or 6. A 15 in Connors' Serve column is &quot;I&quot;, which means that McEnroe can return the serve. He rolls 2, 2 (white) and 1 (red) - a 22, which yields a &quot;V&quot; in his Serve Return column. Connors must now roll against his Volley column. He gets 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). Ordinarily, a 46 would be a point for him, but the red 5 allows McEnroe to make a clutch return. He rolls the white dice (only). A score equal to or less than his Clutch Value is a V result; anything higher loses the point. McEnroe's Clutch Rating is 33. He rolls a 3 and a 6 - not good enough, and Connors is ahead 15-love.<br/><br/>Connors serves again: 4, 6 (white) and 5 (red). An ace for Connors; McEnroe doesn't even get a clutch return. 30-love.<br/><br/>The next Connors serve: 2, 2 (white) and 2 (red). Triples generate a random event. (Many players think that random events are too common and limit their appearance to rolls of triple 1's.) Connors rolls the two white dice: 3, 4. He's gotten into an argument with the umpire (realism!) and draws a warning. If he argues again, he'll automatically lose a point.<br/><br/>Back to serving: 1, 4 (white) and 2 (red). The result is &quot;I&quot;. McEnroe's return: 3, 4 (white) and 1 (red) - a &quot;V&quot;. Connors rolls 1, 2 (white) and 4 (red). A 12 on his Volley column is &quot;S&quot;, which means that he returned the shot but left his opponent in a good position. McEnroe can roll on the favorable &quot;Special&quot; column. Sure enough. He rolls 3, 5 (white) and 3 (red); a 35 on his Special column wins the point. 30-15.<br/><br/>And so it goes.<br/><br/>This not a game for anyone who wants to devise winning strategies. Rather, the players watch as the dice play. That is, however, the point of this kind of sports simulation: to project what would happen if real athletes competed in imaginary matches.<br/><br/>The game also includes rules for doubles, mixed doubles and matches between men and women.<br/><br/>",

The three ways to play are: &ldquo;Hunt&rdquo;, &ldquo;Head Shot&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Situation Room.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In addition to the core rules, we&rsquo;ve included add-on rules that can mix and match however you like with the core rules. Kind of like the lights, lasers, and suppressors that can be added to modern firearms. These include high-impact options such as: &ldquo;Hot LZ&rdquo;, &ldquo;Taliban&rdquo;, &ldquo;Night Mission&rdquo;, &ldquo;One Shot One Kill&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Reign of Terror&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pirate's Plunder is a card and dice game in which players take on the roles of pirates and engage in a life of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns.  At the start of the game, each player starts off in a lifeboat.  They have to steal a pirate ship (based on the result of a dice roll), otherwise, they are stuck in the lifeboat and have to skip their turn.  When they have a ship, players draw Playing Cards into their hand.  These cards offer maps for treasures, events to modify a pirate's guns and crews, and other ways to bend the rules of the game.<br/><br/>A pirate's score is reflected by his treasure, which comes from the wealth-laden ships, loot, and hostages in the form of Treasure Cards.  These cards are drawn from their deck when a pirate plays a map in hand, or by making a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll during their turn.  Pirates can bury their treasure to keep them safe, although they have to dig it up for it to be counted as score.<br/><br/>Some Treasure Cards, however, are perils in the forms of deadly pirates (such as Blackbeard) and naval warships.  Players can play perils on fellow pirates, forcing them to engage in combat.  Players can also engage other players in battle as well during a successful &quot;Sail Ho!&quot; dice roll if they choose to do so instead of drawing Treasure Cards.  Such battles are resolved by comparing dice rolls, which are added to the player's number of guns or crew.  The loser's ship is sunk and the player has to start his or her subsequent turns in a lifeboat.  The winner also takes the loser's unburied treasure.<br/><br/>The game ends when a pirate has 3,000 or more pieces of eight worth of unburied treasure and makes a successful dice roll to &quot;Sail Home&quot;, thus becoming the winner.<br/><br/>",

Behind each dollar amount is an &quot;answer&quot; or trivia clue having to do with the category. When a player thinks he or she knows the correct response to the clue, that person signals and responds in the form of a question.

All cards cost the same but have varying resale values (some are even worthless).  Complete sets are worth more, and some commodities are worth more than others.<br/><br/>Assassination can be attempted if you land on one of the two Assassination squares, on the same square as your victim, or once per go around the board if you have enough money (500 k$, forfeiting your turn to do so).  Hired Assassins come in three classes (A through C), the cheaper being less proficient in weaponry than the more expensive ones (A: five weapons; C: three weapons).<br/><br/>Assassinations are resolved by drawing an Assassin card and comparing it with a Location card; each location lists permissible weapons --if the assassin isn't proficient with at least one of those, too bad.  If he is, you draw a Weapon card to see if he managed to find/smuggle one of the needed weapons.  Assuming the three cards show a match, the designated weapon(s) lists a number that needs to be matched on the dice.  An assassinated player is eliminated.<br/><br/>To defend, you may offer 1 M$ to the player who ordered the assassination just before the dice are rolled, or you may hire an assassin of your own as a bodyguard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world where cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>     A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and extra Intel details, such as things they particularly like or dislike &ndash; to help predict their behavior).<br/>     Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. These are the items they are allowed to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>     Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan. Each Black Market card provides an item to be used in an Action. Three actions should chain together in some way that results in the death of the target. <br/>     The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode. <br/>     The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that Action, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for each card. <br/>     The skull face on the die also adds a frantic element (replacing the 1 face, if the skull is rolled it prompts the flipping of a Fate Coin to add additional randomness). <br/>     In case of failure of any die roll, that Action didn't work, and the plan must be revised. While the timer continues running, the assassins draw a new Black Market item, amending their previous plan and rolling for a new Action. They may also call in &quot;Specialists&quot;, who are characters with special skills (earned in previous rounds).<br/>     If any three Actions are successful before the timer runs out, the target is killed. With the remaining time, the players may roll for Aftermath tasks (such as fleeing the scene or destroying the evidence). Completion of these tasks earns Specialist cards to be used in later rounds. This is the only way to replenish the group's overall Budget of playable cards.<br/>     If the timer runs out before three Actions are completed, the target escapes. This is the end of the round.<br/>     In the published rules, this also ends the game. This rule was subsequently revised, allowing players to make another attempt on the same target, or take the loss and move on to additional targets. Hard-core players may end the game at this point.<br/>     The team wins if they can accomplish four successful kills before their total Budget of Black Market cards are exhausted.<br/><br/><br/>Game Variants:<br/><br/>     Chief Mode is where one player takes on the gamemaster role of the Chief, answering questions and deciding on the difficulty of the plan being created by the other players. Groups of 4 or more work best in this mode. In groups of 2-3 players, each player states their opinion, and the hardest value is the one used.<br/>     Psychopath is similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. Each player holds a hand of Death Prediction cards that represent hostages. One psychopath announces a murder weapon (based on a drawn Black Market card), and players each toss in the hostage they believe will be most likely to be killed by that weapon. Designed for 4+ players.<br/>     Speed Round is faster-paced and useful for introducing players to the death prediction concept. One Chief presents the Death Prediction Card of an assassination target, and players rush to play a Black Market or Specialist card that they think can kill the person in the predicted way. The Chief assigns a difficulty value to the fastest player's proposed plan, and the player rolls to see if they can pull it off. If they do, they earn that Death Prediction Card as a point; if they fail, another player may propose a plan. <br/>     Mechanical Chief uses 14 regular playing cards to replace the subjective judgments of the Chief. Each Black Market card is dealt with a playing card, the value of which is kept hidden until the die is about to be rolled. This variant is good for faster play, and directs discussions toward justifying the revealed values within the story, rather than debating the merits of various plans.<br/>     Teams is useful for very large groups. The players split into two rival assassination teams, and alternate attacking targets, with a single Chief moderating. Teams operate under spelling bee elimination rules (one team's failure, followed by the victory of the other, results in the first team's elimination). A target that a team fails to kill must then be attempted by the other team, and a continuous narrative persists throughout the entire game.<br/><br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand.<br/><br/>Each player is also given a number of antique cards, with an item pictured, which will be used to drive the game play.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, an antique card is selected. Each player will then choose a value card from his hand to correspond to the value the player thinks the antique is worth and places it in front of him. Once that is done, the player whose turn it is reads two stories that are printed on the back of the card. One is true, the other false. As the stories are read, if a term is used that is listed on an Antique Speak card held by a player, that player can discard that card as well as any value card that is still in his hand.<br/><br/>After the stories are read, all the players except the one who read the stories will vote on which story they think is true. The true story and actual appraised value are then revealed. All players who guessed the correct value can discard the value card they used for their guess. All players who guessed the correct story can discard any value card, including the one used to guess the value on this turn (if they guessed the value wrong.)<br/><br/>As soon as a player is out of cards at the end of a turn, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Sections of the board have number combinations assigned to them (such as 1-2-3, for instance). Players roll a die and move one of their pawns forward to the best possible positions in the next rank ahead of them. Some fields allow for instant promotions or demotions of others, or for additional rolls. Other fields allow a player to add a minister to the current cabinet. The first player to control three ministers becomes chancellor, losing his/her post only when another player has more ministers. If all minister posts are taken, a player placing a minister removes another player's minister and takes his/her place. <br/>Whenever a player cannot use his/her die result, s/he ages by one year. A player reaching the age of 65 is forced to retire from the game - when all players are retired, the player who holds the office of chancellor is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Share some hilarious and suspense-filled moments as players of Toilet Trouble take turns spinning the toilet paper roll, flushing the toilet handle, and hoping they don't get sprayed with water! The number that turns up on the paper roll spinner dictates how many times each player must flush. Players are safe if they hear the flushing sound, but no water is sprayed. Who knows which flush will be the one that sprays water, eliminating that player? Continue taking turns spinning the roll and flushing until one player has not been sprayed. That player wins the game!<br/><br/>",

On a modular board with moving, turning, and disappearing spaces, players vie for a good board position and a strong hand. On every turn, players draw based on their piece's location, play half their cards, and move. They lose if they run out of cards during their turn or are on a space where they cannot move. The cards' effects vary from useful to nasty, and so playing more cards may be more of a curse than a blessing. As players get eliminated, will you be the only player to not lose?<br/><br/>",

The game is basically a two player game but it can be modified to accommodate any number of players. Each player manipulates his aircraft on a grid which simulates air space. 255 counters.<br/><br/>This game places two sides in a jet (era) dogfight. Each player starts with 3 planes, chosen from 14 different types available. One side are the 'Intruders'. the other 'Interceptors'. Each turn represents 30 seconds of real time. There are a variety of missions and you may use whichever aircraft you want, so that you can guage the different performance capabilities of each craft. This is an old-fashioned wargame and has been superceded by much more realistic (although also much more complicated) games, but if you like the theme and you want a quick, 'fun' wargame, this is ideal.<br/><br/>",

The game money notes are well-done one sided copies of present Polish banknotes.<br/><br/>The game mechanics is almost exactly the same as it is in Monopoly, but there are a few noticeable differences. The most important one is that the spaces forming a set are not necessarily close to each other - they can be even placed on opposite sides of a board.

        "description": "UFO is a low complexity abstract game themed on an alien invasion of Earth.  The alien player must land 5 of 8 available ships on Earth to win.  The Earth player, with only eight rockets, must defend or perish.  Movement is along orbital paths that form 7 concentric rings around the Earth.  Each player rolls two dice and moves one rocket or UFO the exact count of for each die.  In addition to the UFOs and Earth's rockets speeding around, the moon orbits the Earth destroying all in its path.  Combat is not dice based, rather players capture opponents pieces by landing on them by exact orbital move of one die.<br/><br/>The advanced game adds dummy counters for the alien player and space stations for additional defence of Earth.<br/><br/>It feels really more like an abstract strategy game, but Avalon Hill classified as a wargame simulation.<br/><br/>The game consists of<br/><br/>-two 8&quot; x 16&quot; map boards with 2 black plastic clips to hold together.<br/>-die cut counters (8 rockets, 5 space stations, 1 moon, 8 saucers, 12 decoy UFOs)<br/>-2 six sided dice <br/>-1 double sided page of rules.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 1<br/><br/>",

Whether you've earned a Ph.D. in the science of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; or are discovering the world of Leonard, Sheldon, Howard, Raj, and their neighbor Penny for the first time, you're guaranteed to be laughing and having fun.<br/><br/>In each round, one player serves as Referee, flips over a Red card, and reads it aloud; if it has a green background and says &quot;Experimental Formula&quot; on it, the Referee indicates that as well. The other players &ndash; who have seven cards in hand &ndash; each submit one or two cards face down that they feel best describes the category or description on the Referee's card. For example, if the Red card says &quot;Often Leads to Disaster&quot;, you could submit a Blue card such as &quot;Killer Robot&quot;. If the Red card were an Experimental Formula, such as &quot;Hilarious Battle&quot;, you submit two Blue cards using your envelope, such as &quot;Horny Engineer&quot; and &quot;Giant Rabbits&quot;.<br/><br/>If any player has a &quot;Bazinga!&quot; card in hand and wants to play it, he must do so after each player has made a submission, but before the Referee has revealed them! The Referee then reveals cards from the Red Deck until he reveals a card of the same type (either Basic or Experimental Formula) as the original card, thereby creating entirely new criteria by which to evaluate those same submissions.<br/><br/>Next, the Referee mixes up the submitted Blue cards or envelopes so that no one knows who submitted what. Then, the Referee turns all of the cards face up, reading each card name aloud. He then ranks each card (or pair of cards) in the order he feels best matches the criteria on the Red card. The first place submission is awarded the highest numbered point chip, which is taken from the pile, the second place submission is awarded the second highest point chip, and so forth. The player to the left of the Referee becomes the new Referee, and you start a new round. Whoever ends up with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

When a chip is drawn, the player chooses on which development he wants to invest.<br/><br/><br/>The number of phases is defined according to the duration desired by the players. The game ends with a final race phase.<br/><br/>The winner of the Schneider Trophy is the one who has accumulated the most victory points during the races.<br/><br/>",

The game is packaged very efficiently, in a small clear plastic tube, along with a rules sheet and four small flat tokens. Q-Turn is thus highly portable, and can be played on any flat surface, from the lunch counter to an airline tray table.<br/><br/>The game is played by randomizing the disks and placing them face down on the table in a 4x4 pattern. Tokens are placed at the corners, with the goal being to move your token to the opposite corner and back again before your opponents. As the tokens move across the board, disks are flipped over, revealing arrows that indicate which way a token may move next. Each type of disk allows a different special action, rotating one or all of the disks a quarter turn, thus changing the available paths across the board.<br/><br/>A quarter-turn here, and a quarter-turn there, and soon everyone may be headed off in the wrong direction!<br/><br/>Microbadge<br/><br/> Buy It<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.<br/><br/>There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.<br/><br/>If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.<br/><br/>When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.<br/><br/>Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinländer, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.<br/><br/>",

But, this last Monday, he did not show up for a gathering to which his friends had invited him. Tintin, the famous reporter, and Captain Haddock, the old sea-wolf, knew that, since the previous week, rumours abounded about the Professor&rsquo;s invention. They went to his laboratory, accompanied by Milou, Tintin&rsquo;s dog, and the detectives Dupond and Dupont, summoned in great haste. Once there, traces of a struggle were found that indicated that, without a doubt, the Professor had been kidnapped! Speculation is that the kidnappers intended to wrest the secret of his invention from the Professor.<br/>Immediately, Tintin and his friends launched themselves in pursuit of the kidnappers.<br/><br/>The players move on the board trying to gather as much information as possible. They are trying to find out in which house Professor Tournesol is being held, and by whom.<br/><br/>The game proceeds by elimination of possibilities, as one must rule out all other possible houses and suspects before reaching a conclusion. For example, the proof-cards (orange backed cards) show the following objects: a hat, sunglasses, a mustache, a crowbar and shoes.

From across the stars a great threat descends upon Earth. The Machine Horde &ndash; relentless in its determination to consume and expand &ndash; now threatens to exterminate Mankind. The Ancients, hyper-intelligent beings of unknown origins, manipulate the schemes of both human and machine to achieve their mysterious machinations. All that now stands between annihilation and survival for the human race is the Emergency Earth Coalition: a fragile unified human government rooted in fear and subjugation. Now's the time to choose your Faction Commander and lead your armies to total war.<br/><br/>PURGE: Sins of Science offers players a full strategy setting which eliminates luck of the draw and lack of resources. Inspired by traditional Real Time Strategy (RTS) computer games, PURGE allows players to upgrade their armies in various ways depending upon chosen technologies, Stronghold attachments and unit choices. Each player controls the flow and pace of army building through a one-of-a-kind gameplay system formulated to deliver a full strategy experience.<br/><br/>Players win the game by reducing their opponents' Stronghold Population to zero. But beware, the tide of battle can turn quickly as the unique game play allows for quick responses and counter-measures to almost every strategy.<br/><br/>PURGE: Sins of Science comes with six 50-card pre-constructed and expertly play-tested decks. Each 50-card deck is represented by a different faction Commander from the three (3) factions available to players. Each Commander has unique playing styles and abilities which offer players a wide range of playable deck types (Offense, Defense, Support).<br/><br/>",

In the aftermath of Ruele's Doom, the Empire was shattered, torn apart into nine houses each led by one of the Emperor's former council. The realm was thrown into bitter conflict as each of the nine houses vied for power over the others &ndash; each seeking to reunite the broken Empire under their rule. This conflict became known as the Game of Crowns.<br/><br/>In Game of Crowns, each player takes control of one of the nine noble houses. During the game, players can exchange cards and favors through diplomatic relations, or directly attack opponents through warfare in order to take what they want. It will take clever planning, skillful negotiation, and daring confrontations to gain dominance over your rivals and seize the crown!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BASIC DESCRIPTION:<br/>The Skip-Bo Dice Game attempts to translate the original Skip-Bo card game into a two- to four-player dice game. It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>The game includes 12 dice, three in each of four colors, and 17 mission cards. Each three-die set of set of dice includes a normal six-sided die, a six-sided die with the 2 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo, and a six-sided die with the 4 replaced by a Skip-Bo wild logo. The 17 mission cards include three-number sequences (i.e., 1-2-3, 2-3-4, 3-4-5, 4-5-6, 1-3-5, 2-4-6) or descriptions of three-number sets (i.e., all dice same, all dice even, all dice odd).<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Each player takes a three-dice set and one of the mission cards is revealed. All players roll their dice attempting to roll the sequence or set shown on the revealed mission card. Rolled dice that match a portion of the mission card can be saved aside when the remaining dice are rerolled. A player may use one Skip-Bo wild logo to represent a needed die on the mission card. When a player's rolled dice match the sequence or set shown on the mission card, he or she calls out, &quot;Skip-Bo!&quot; and collects the mission card. Another mission card is revealed and play continues until one player has collected five mission cards, winning the game.<br/><br/>PACKAGING:<br/>This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label. The top of the can pops off (twist to open). The one sheet of rules, 12 dice, and deck of 17 mission cards fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin. The tin also has a coin slot in the top that serves no purpose for the Skip-Bo Dice Game.<br/><br/>",

In it, players take on the role of villains building their remote fortresses and capturing secret agents. When one is captured, he can be killed right away, but what's the fun in that? The real points come when you slowly reveal your secret plan to him &mdash; or leave him to be eaten by sharks. Of course, that's where the risk is, too, and the longer you postpone the kill, the greater the likelihood that another player will produce a card that allows the agent to escape and destroy your fortress.<br/><br/>Reissued in color in 2004 as James Ernest's Totally Renamed Spy Game (with many more cards), then reissued again in 2016 as Before I Kill You, Mister Spy...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Mensch &auml;rgere Dich nicht&quot; is a very well known German board game, developed by Josef Friedrich Schmidt in 1907/1908. The game was issued in 1914 and sold about 70 million copies. It is similar to Parcheesi, but has several considerably different rules.<br/><br/>In the most recent Mensch &auml;rgere Dich nicht:<br/>- You only roll with one die, not two. There are therefore no bonuses (which often give you choices in Parcheesi) and penalties for rolling doublets. Instead, you roll the die again if you rolled a 6.<br/>- You start the game with a pawn on your enter space.<br/>- It is much harder to enter a pawn after the beginning of the game. This happens on a 6 and it is compulsory. The probability is 16.67%, whereas the probability in Parcheesi to roll a 5 on one of two dice or with both dice together is considerably higher at 41.67%. So it is much less likely that you have more than one movable pawn which would present you with choices when you roll.<br/>- There are no bonuses for capturing opponent's pawns or for reaching home.<br/>- There are no safe places where you can't be captured by an opponent, not even your own enter space.<br/>- You have to move any pawn off your enter space first chance you get unless there are no more pawns in waiting to enter as well. Which also reduces the number of decisions you can make.<br/>- Blockades with two pawns of the same colour on a space aren't possible under the standard rules, they are only an optional variant.<br/>- The board is somewhat different, particularly there is no home path leading up to a home square.<br/><br/>These differences are based on the rule PDFs of the  Mensch ärgere dich nicht rules by Schmidt Spiele and the  Parcheesi rules by Hasbro (version from 2001).<br/><br/>",

Bad pants, while recommended, are not required. <br/>Okay!  it's nothing like playing golf. But it's still a lot of fun!<br/><br/>Golfmania is a wacky, fast-paced card game for 2 to 6 players. The object of the game is to complete 18 holes of golf through equal parts luck, strategy, and the sincere desire to see your opponents suffer. It's a game the whole family can enjoy: the rule are simple, the cards are fun and colorful, and you can play it in under 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Here's a quick overview of what the game is like: At the beginning of each turn, a &quot;Hole&quot; card is drawn. Each Hole card is worth a certain number of hole points if you win it, so you take a swing (i.e., roll the die) and give it your best shot. Everyone   gets a chance to swing, and everyone gets to play cards which affect that swing -- freaky weather, lucky gophers, hi-tech golf equipment and other zany events are sure to change the way you play golf.<br/><br/>Did you win the Hole? Great! You're a few points closer to your winning goal of 18 hole points. If not -- no matter, you'll just have try again on the next Hole card... and get revenge on the opponent who nailed you with that nasty card last turn.<br/><br/>",

In other words, Moonshiners is the one game you need to stay away from if you worry about dark humor, morally questionable choices and drinking with your enemies until they pass out.<br/><br/>Set in an alternative post-apocalyptic 1920's, players compete over exploring and re-building the deserted &quot;Shanty Town&quot;. Explore and discover, scavenge for resources and build houses for the poor survivors. All of this while fighting off the hordes of disgruntled crowds that roam the town with the sole purpose of messing with your precious achievements. <br/>Did I say fight? I meant drink them under the table. Arm yourself with a crate of the strongest booze, some hangover aid and start drinking, because any unchallenged enemy will hunt you down and wreck your buildings.<br/><br/>Explore, expand, exploit and exterminate, scavenge for resources, raise distilleries, produce moonshine and sell it into your Saloons to maximize the profits, because when time is up, only one Hero will be able to pay for the ride out of &quot;Shanty Town&quot; and win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World War 3- 1976-1984, is a simulation on an army/fleet level scale of a hypothetical, world-wide, conventional conflict at the height of the cold war (1976-1984). The simulation is primarily of land and naval conflict with the secondary influence of air forces. The game covers five years in seasonal (quarterly) turns. Optional rules allow Players to choose from several levels of complexity.<br/><br/>With the increased number of small scale conflicts throughout the world had come increased tension and strain in relationships between the Soviet Union and the United States. Each superpower felt it necessary to choose sides in the local, &quot;conventional&quot; wars that proliferated in the late 1970's, until each felt small pressures from all directions. Eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Asian sub-continent, Southeast Asia, Africa and Central America were involved to various degrees, in conflict.<br/><br/>Then, one side (we're not saying which) began to feel its position slipping, as its favored side in war after war became threatened, with the scale of the conflicts ever more violent. Warnings and violent talk were followed by the commitment of the first conventional land forces by a superpower. This was followed immediately by an even greater commitment from the other side, and the war of escalation was on.<br/><br/>The Soviet Union struck first in Europe, and overran Germany and France in a matter of weeks. Italy and the smaller countries of Western Europe were cowed into submission, and Leftist regimes came to power in each of them. However, with the larger Gross National Product, and thus, with the larger capacity to make war, the United States was in a better position to wage a prolonged war. The United States struck back in outlying areas, consolidating its gains in areas that, without a sufficient fleet, the Soviet Union could not maintain proper contact with. <br/>Of course, the question of decisive victory was quite impossible. Because the war had &quot;crept up&quot; upon the superpowers, there had been no nuclear exchange, and, so far, the threats to resort to nuclear warfare had remained unfulfilled. But, if either power should become directly threatened, the possibility that it would use nuclear weapons would become a near-certainty. Thus, both sides kept their military goals small. The United States hoped to use its greater war making capacity to wear down its opponent, while the Soviet Union attempted to use its overwhelming strength to achieve lightning victories in short campaigns.<br/><br/>As the futility of the war became apparent, and the populations and their economies began to show signs of fatigue, the war gradually wound down to a sort of &quot;cold war&quot; stalemate, and, although there were thousands of miles of front lines, the unofficial orders of the frontline troops were not to provoke the enemy. And because of this unsatisfactory, but inevitable resolution, the responsible parties in the governments of both superpowers were overthrown, allowing for a gradual withdrawal of troops from the battlefields across the globe.<br/><br/>This game is a simulation of a hypothetical conflict. It is played on a map that is a simplified terrain reproduction of the entire world. A grid of hexagons printed over the map is used to regulate movement much as the squares on a chess board. The pieces in the game represent the actual military units which might take part in such a conflict. The large numbers on the pieces indicate the relative strengths of these units. Each Player maneuvers his pieces on the map to engage those of the enemy. Battles take place when units are adjacent to enemy units. The total relative strengths of the units involved are compared. The attacking Player consults a simple probability table (the Combat Results Table) to determine the outcome of each battle. Then the other Player moves his units and conducts attacks. The game proceeds this way (for a specified number of turns) as the Players try to achieve the objectives set forth in the rules. No prior knowledge of history or military tactics is required to play the game &mdash; just a little ingenuity and common sense.<br/><br/>World War 3 is basically a two-Player game (an Optional Rule provides for an independent Red Chinese command). Each Player moves his units and executes attacks on Enemy units in turn, attempting to fulfill the conditions .of victory. To move from one hex to another, each unit expends a portion of its Movement Allowance. Naval Transport and Amphibious Movement allows the transfer of land units across bodies of water. Combat is resolved by comparing the Combat Strength Points of opposing units and expressing the comparison as a difference (differential) between Attacker and Defender. A die is rolled and the outcome indicated on the appropriate (Land or Naval) Combat Results Table is applied to the units involved.<br/><br/>Rules and map are similar to Dunnigan's (Global War: The War Against Germany and Japan, 1939-45) game.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3 months<br/>Hex: 500 miles / 804 kilometers<br/>Units: Army/Fleet<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; four color mapsheet or Two 17.5 x 22.5&quot; mounted mapboards (Designer box version)<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page World War 3 rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed player air cards<br/>One 6-sided die<br/>One counter storage tray (Designer box version)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a geopolitical simulation of local influence in the Middle East on the flow of oil supplies to the rest of the world.<br/><br/>The map shows 8 fictitious Middle Eastern oil producing countries, one of which controls the Canal that links both ocean sides. If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country.<br/><br/>You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country's port to your country. To reflect a level of organisation, oil is worth more per shipping if a king or politician is in place than a dictator or guerrilla, whose job is more offensive. You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the managing pieces costing more than the offensive pieces. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto &quot;?&quot; spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. At face value, half the cards are favourable and half not, but all offer diplomatic opportunities for the country who is most stable.<br/><br/>To survive players must continually manage risks while trying to maximize their oil revenue. Early bold attacks, even combined with the right incident card, are not recommended: a co-operative approach to the game maximises revenue to offset the many accidents which can happen in the game.<br/><br/>From the Waddington ad for the game dated 1972:<br/><br/>A political strategy game<br/>&quot;In the modern world of international diplomacy and intrigue, there are many stakes in this game of economic survival. That means energy and the key to energy is oil. In this game there is but one object - and that is to survive&quot;<br/><br/>",

These cards are either placed picture or number side up depending on which game your playing. The video tape is inserted into your VCR, cued to a game, and played.<br/><br/>On your turn, you watch the screen and listen to the story. A visual clue (either a picture or number) will appear accompanied by an audio signal. You must then quickly find and remove the card that matches the clue. If the picture beneath the card is a ladder, you move your piece 1 rung up the ladder. If a chute is revealed, and the rung of the ladder your piece is on is connected to the top of a chute, you must move down the chute to a lower rung. If your piece is on the top ladder rung when the story ends you win the game. You also win immediately if you move your piece &quot;over&quot; the top rung of the ladder.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on a popular spanish flash animation, &quot;C&aacute;lico Electr&oacute;nico - El juego de cartas&quot; is a dungeon crawler in which the players take the role of C&aacute;lico Electr&oacute;nico himself or one of his clones to prove that they are the strongest by completing two episodes.<br/><br/>The mechanics are very similar to Dungeoneer: Tomb of the Lich Lord. Players are dealt one of the four characters; each one has a power and a charisma value and a special hability. Also, each player receives an episode to complete in a determined city area and three calico cards (action cards). Then, the initial city is built: each player places one city card that matches with the starting one or with one that has been already placed.<br/><br/>Each player in his turn can spend &quot;calikillos&quot; (action points) to do several things:<br/><br/>    1 Play a card: Each card has different costs and effects<br/>    2 Move to an adjacent city tile: Each tile not only has a different cost, but also, you receive &quot;anticalikillos&quot;, wich other players will use to play monsters, special effects...<br/>    3 Place a new city tile: Spending one calikillo, you can draw a city tile and place it on a legal spot<br/>    4 Heal yourself: By spending five calikillos, you heal yourself (each character has two status: hurt and unhurt, so by healing you revert to unhurt)<br/><br/><br/>When a player resolves an action, other players may, clockwise, spend that player's anticalikillos to play action cards on him.<br/><br/>If a player at any time in his turn is at the same city tile of a monster, he will fight it. Fights are simple: you choose a characteristic, roll a die and, if the result of the die plus the characteristic is higher than the monsters value, you defeat him, if it's lower you are defeated and turn to hurt status. Players can fight each other, but the characteristic is determined by the player who wins a rock-paper-scissors game.<br/><br/>When all the players complete their turn, a new round begins:<br/><br/>    1 Players can discard cards and draw until they have five<br/>    2 Set their calikillos to five<br/>    3 Set their anticalikillos to zero<br/><br/><br/>",

Simply put, Personally Incorrect makes things personal and lets players have some real fun, where they don't have to worry about being judged or offending anyone. Personally Incorrect does this by directing the questions at the individuals playing the game instead of just offering a fill in the blank question<br/><br/>The player with the most 'Question' cards at the end of the 10th round is the winner. Players begin the game with 10 'Answer' cards, and receive a new one each turn. Every turn a player will read a 'Question' card aloud submitting another player's name into the &quot;Insert Name&quot; quotations. The rest of the players will simultaneously select answers and submit them to the player who read the question.<br/><br/>The active player now shuffles all of the answer cards together and reveals them 1 at a time. All of the other players present quickly vote for the most appropriately inappropriate answer. It is important to vote quickly as the last vote will not count that way players don't base their vote on another player's vote. In the event of a tie, the active player/reader is allowed to cast their vote in order to break the tie. The player whose answer received the most votes now claims the question card, ending the round.<br/><br/>At the end of 10 rounds the player with the most question cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The teams each choose one their own to faceoff for the question.

If the team correctly guesses all the answers without getting three wrong guesses then that team wins the card. Failure to guess all of the answers gives the other team, as a group, one last guess as to what answer may be left unguessed. If this team is correct then it scores the card, if not the first team gets the card anyway.<br/><br/>The first team to score five cards is the winner.<br/><br/>Although not faithful to the television series on which it is based, players familiar with the television series can duplicate the game show using the material provided.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to build an edible s&rsquo;more before your opponents. Players get a higher point value based on the quality of s&rsquo;more ingredients. First player to collect all 4 ingredient cards and call out S&rsquo;more!, wins. The S&rsquo;more card game includes 70, 3x5 sturdy playing cards, and retails for $5.99. Sure to be a big hit at home or on your next family outing. Printed with Soy-Based Ink on Recycled Paper.&quot;<br/><br/>Cards consist of ingredient cards (graham crackers, marshmallow, and chocolate), bonus cards to increase the point value to your hand, action cards that decrease your point value, and filler cards which have no value. Players start with 5 cards each. On one's turn, a player has two choices: either take a card from the deck and discard one from one's hand; or, ask any player to fan their cards, then pick one of their cards and replace it with one from the active player's hand. The first player to get all four ingredients to create a s'more (2 graham crackers, 1 marshmallow, and 1 chocolate) shouts &quot;S'MORE!&quot; to win the game. If two or more players shout s'more at the same time, the player with the highest point value wins.<br/><br/>",

The first player to get rid of his Domos is the winner.<br/><br/>MATCHING DOMOS<br/>In general, Domos are matched by UNO rules and arranged DOMINO style. Match by color, number, or word. But play is limited to the 4 directions of play from the starting doublet. When playing the MATCHING SIDE always constitutes the play. If someone puts down a draw two card and you have one you can put it down.<br/><br/>If at any time you are unable to match color, number or word, you MUST draw ONE Domo from the remaining stock. If the drawn Domo is playable, you may play it immediately. If it is unplayable, it is added to your hand and play passes to the left to the next player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "U.S, Patent Number 1 is a racing game. Every player is a scientist who has invented time travel, and now everyone is racing to the Patent Office to prove who invented it first. Because you have a time machine, it's not enough to get to the Patent Office fast. You actually have to go back in time, to the day the Patent Office opened!<br/><br/>During this race you will upgrade your machine with some gadgets, including a power plant, a chassis, a weapon, and a shield. You can invent these things on your own, you can buy them, or you can steal them from the other players. Only a machine with all four upgrades qualifies to earn the patent, and you have a limited supply of money and power to spend.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAwards<br/>    2001 Origins Award Nominee: Best Science Fiction / Fantasy board game<br/><br/><br/>",

Kreskin, the world&rsquo;s foremost authority on ESP, thinks you do. You need only to develop it. This fascinating ESP game shows how!<br/><br/>Imagine the fun! Alone, or with a friend, or with a whole party of people, players can reveal their innermost thoughts on love, politics, or any other subject. Kreskin&rsquo;s ESP game will give you the opportunity to reveal your ESP powers and explore the outer frontiers of the human mind in two scientifically proven ways.<br/><br/>Similar to an Ouija board, this game includes several tricks and a magic pendulum which can be used to determine answers to yes/no questions and even spell out words.<br/><br/>From correspondence with Kreskin, December 2010:<br/><br/>Regarding your inquiry about the Kreskin ESP game, yours truly designed the game.  As far as the artwork for the box, the Milton Bradley people had their staff do that.  At one point, the amount of sales was over a million and it approached two million.<br/> Thank you for your interest about the game.  It became a very popular showcase, as I played it with many people on television, including Johnny Carson, Mike Douglas, and Merv Griffin, as the pendulum proved to be a fascinating phenomena.<br/> With all my best thoughts,<br/>Kreskin<br/><br/>",

Actors, which are characters from various cartoons, each also have a value and color. Special effects are the monkey wrenches that may be thrown into the mix for more randomness.<br/><br/>Four scenes are laid out and replenished when depleted. The object is to play Actors to the scenes to try to steal them. The active player plays actors and/or special effects to a scene then the inactive player does the same. After both have played the scene is removed and scored.<br/><br/>To win the scene you must have the best actors. The hierarchy for scoring is...<br/><br/>1. The highest value of same color actors not exceeding the scene value.<br/><br/>2. The highest value of wrong colored actors not exceeding the scene value.<br/><br/>3. The highest value actors exceeding the scene value. These actors are overacting.<br/><br/>...with the active player winning ties.<br/><br/>The game is good for children because of its simplicity but will not keep the interest of veteran game players. The artwork is from Looney Tunes both color and B/W episodes and are laid out nicely on the cards.<br/><br/>",

Fearless adventurers from throughout the kingdom gather forces under their banners, while prominent lords fortify their castles to withstand a siege. The whole world has turned upside down in the fever of war: dwarves have been seen defending the elves&rsquo; woodland strongholds against legions of the undead, great dragons have razed ancient obelisks to the ground, while heroes have used both brute force and cunning to capture enemy castles. The King can barely keep up with awarding commanders their well-earned titles for valor and heroism on the field of battle, and there&rsquo;s not a single distinguished title that hasn&rsquo;t already changed hands at least a dozen times. After all, it&rsquo;s not the strength of your castle or the size of your army that counts &mdash; only the favor of the supreme ruler will decide who ultimately merits receiving the King&rsquo;s Bounty.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Based on the bestselling video game of the same name, King&rsquo;s Bounty is a board game that&rsquo;s played with cards. The players take control of one of five races &mdash; elves, dwarves, orcs, humans or the undead &mdash; and use their armies to capture castles and obelisks, earning victory points in the process. However, the main battle will be fought over titles, which are far more valuable than land in ensuring victory. At the end of the match, the players who have completed the required objectives earn the titles and the victory points that go with them. Finally, the scores get tallied up, and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>Game contents:<br/><br/><br/>    48 Troop cards of 5 races <br/><br/><br/>Every race except for humans has 9 troop cards: 3 archers, 2 fighters, 2 wizards, 1 hero and 1 monster. Humans have 4 archers, 3 fighters, 3 wizards, 1 hero and 1 monster.<br/><br/><br/>    36 Property cards, including 24 Castle cards &amp; 12 Obelisk cards<br/><br/><br/>Castle cards. Every race except for humans has 6 castles: 2 towers, 2 fortresses and 2 citadels. Humans don&rsquo;t have any castles.<br/><br/>Obelisk cards. The game has 4 obelisks with powers 1, 2 and 3. All obelisks are neutral (meaning they don&rsquo;t belong to any one race) and each yields 2 victory points.<br/><br/><br/>    21 Title Cards<br/><br/><br/><br/>    1 Last player card<br/><br/><br/><br/>    1 Rulebook<br/><br/><br/>",

The game features graphics and pictures taken from the movie. Players alternate in leading Lyra in her journey to rescue her friends, as she escapes from the Magisterium's clutches. As each turn unfolds, players collect items and clues, and help Lyra to understand the Alethiometer - the truth-measuring Golden Compass. During a turn a player uses the Alethiometer spindle: the spinning action reveals the two actions the player is allowed to choose from. A typical move involves playing or drawing Lyra cards, played in sets to collect Item tiles from the board (representing Lyra and Pan's actions and investigations) or placing Symbol tokens that will later let a player draw valuable Truth tokens (representing the interpretation of the Alethiometer). Character cards, showing the main heroes and villains of the story, can be used by players to alter the gameplay by applying their special abilities. The winner is the player that scores the most points by the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trivia game about food. The first player draws a card which gives the category (food, drinks, etiquette, or a bit of everything) of which they should answer a question (and also a value, more about this later). They can choose a question for one point (easier) or one for three points (harder). If they answer the question correct they gain the points, if not no points. There are also a few jokers that give special rules for how many points a question should be awarded (including among others minus points, and &quot;as many points as the last player got&quot;). After the question is answered, the category cards are kept in a separate pile for each player.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the card values for each player are summed up. The player with most gets awarded an additional five points. The player with most points after this is the winner.<br/><br/>Awards<br/><br/>2007 Årets Voksenspil, Adult Game of the Year Denmark<br/><br/>",

But be forewarned: The Darkness grows stronger and more menacing with every bolt of Dark Lightning.<br/><br/>You will not know who triumphs until the last roll of the dice.<br/><br/>One player is the Darkness, each other player is a Valiant - all the Valiant players work as a team. The square-gridded board is filled with castles, each containing a treasure. Some treasures allow the Darkness player to add another piece, some provide benefits to the finder, and two are required for the Valiants to win - the Scepter must be brought to the location of the Living Throne.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls 2 dice and can move using either one, the total, or the difference. Moves are in a straight line unless both dice are used, when each can be used in a different direction.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is played with 3 dice and a dice-box. Every player must have a pig (entirely in pieces at start).<br/>Throw the dice in turn; the highest point will begin to play.<br/>In order to be able to win the body of the pig, the player must first throw a 6 (the aces throw before, count for nothing at this stage). Afterwards it suffices to throw aces to have the right to place parts, i.e: 1 ace for 1 leg or 1 ear or 1 eye; for the tail, it is necessary to throw 2 aces at the same time.<br/>The same player can go on throwing dice as long as he throw aces; if he cannot complete his pig, he will give the following player the dice and wait for his next turn.<br/>The winner will be the player who completes his pig first. If the game is played for a prize of some kind, he will receive from the other players as many tokens as there remain parts for them to complete their pig; the tail is worth 5 tokens and players who were unable to complete the body must pay 15 tokens. (Tokens not in the box).<br/><br/>+ If the 6 is accompanied by one or two aces, take the body, place a part or the tail, and throw the dice again.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Cootie<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>At last - a money game for adults!<br/><br/>Be forewarned!  This game might not be for you...unless you are a student of the international money market.  Or, you are just plain curious as to why the US dollar is worth less and less despite the fact that we are still the strongest nation in the world.<br/><br/>Simply put, Foreign Exchange is not a toy.<br/><br/>A perfect simulation of the international currency situation, it is!<br/><br/>International companies realize gains and losses when changing currency rates alter the value of their income and assets in foreign countries.  This game simulates this situation by letting players own and manage multi-national companies in various cities throughout the world.  As in the real world, changing conditions require each player to make constant decisions after considering his company's financial resources - and what he expects his opponents to make - against the cost of alternative protective strategies.<br/><br/>The Iranian oil situation of early '79 is a classic real-life example.  Iran furnishes less than 7% of America's petroleum needs.  Yet its unavailability has done more to devalue the dollar against gold than any economic crises since the depression of 1939. Why so, you may ask.<br/><br/>Playing Foreign Exchange will give you insight into this question, and you'll have fun doing so because the game focuses on the interplayer relationships.  Without such interplay relationships, no game is fun to play.  With it, Foreign Exchange might just be the greatest money game to come along since Monopoly.<br/><br/>Ironically, it doesn't come with any money.  All financial transactions are recorded on a variety of accounting pads included.  If you're into pencils, you'll love this game (some enterprising money -market enthusiasts have already programmed this game on computer).<br/><br/>You - as company head - decide where in the world (literally) you want to establish sales and manufacturing offices.  This is done at the beginning through a round of trading City Cards among players until everyone is satisfied they've outsmarted their opponents.<br/><br/>From this point on, a variety of situations and happenstances will determine likely changes in currency rates.  You - the manufacturer - must plan the strategies you think best to maximize gains.<br/><br/>Foreign Exchange was designed by a professional money-management expert and executive officer of the leading financial institution.  What is duck soup to him, however, might be unfathomable to the novice.  That's why the game comes in three versions: a &quot;Beginning&quot; version for game buffs intrigued by money games; the &quot;Intermediate&quot; game for those with a cursory knowledge of what's going on with foreign currency; and the &quot;Expert&quot; game for those people who really have a yen for this sort of thing.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/>2-piece fold-out game board<br/>Foreign Exchange Worksheet pad<br/>Net Worth Worksheet pad<br/>Hedging Cost Worksheet pad<br/>24 City Cards<br/>4 Borrowing Cost cards<br/>16 Currency Exchange cards<br/>16 Risk cards<br/>5 player tokens<br/>40 colored markers for 4 different colors<br/>2 6-sided dice<br/>Rules<br/><br/>",

Your choices will guide you through different storylines, from the seductive merfolk in the lagoon, to the brave natives in the mountains and all the other secrets the island has to offer. Gain allies and items, unlock new abilities, interact with locations and characters and gain experience during multiple adventures. As everybody's Neverland is different, every game will be a new adventure, with new possibilities and challenges to face. Although there will be a winner at the end of the game, the unfolding of the stories on the immersive island of Neverland are key.<br/><br/>In this story driven adventure game, 2-4 players take on the role of a main character in the world of J.M Barrie&rsquo;s &ldquo;Peter Pan&rdquo;. The game takes around 30 minutes per player, is played in turns and is suitable from the age of 12. The base game includes 6 characters with unique stats and abilities, each with a competitive story. In addition the base game includes one cooperative story for multiple characters. Additional stories can be added and combined. Adventures are narrated through story cards, happenings, and side quests of your choice. You can interact with other characters and locations on the island. While the immersive stories ensure you'll find yourself in a world of wonder and mystery, the players' choices will re-imagine Neverland every time you play the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. Each turn a player has 3 actions to move and interact with player characters and non-player characters. Players explore the island of Neverland while interacting with stories, happenings, other characters and special locations. The story, goal and challenges are narrated through cards with multiple available options. As every chapter of every player poses multiple outcomes, your adventures on Neverland will be different every time you play. Players can earn adventure points to level up their character. <br/>The game ends when the side quest deck runs out or all players finish their story. The player with the most adventure points wins the game. (Cooperative stories may have different end of game and win conditions)<br/><br/>The game is suitable from the age of 12 and takes about 30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Boardgamenews.com's Eric Martin:<br/><br/>Covert Action, which handles 4-18 players, is aimed squarely at the Werewolf crowd. Players are part of a covert team (red, blue, green) that must eliminate one member of an opposing team, but your target is a mystery. At the start of the round, players are randomly dealt a card that depicts one of four characters: sniper, agent, cleaner, mole. The sniper of one team must shoot the sniper of another team to win that round. Problem is, you have to figure out who to shoot without being shot yourself.<br/><br/>As for the other characters, the mole is secretly working for one of the other teams, the agent makes the other team lose if he is shot, and the cleaner must make the shot if the sniper isn&rsquo;t a part of the team. (Two cards are randomly thrown out each round, so a team&rsquo;s sniper might be out of play. The cleaner needs to figure this out by talking with his teammates, but since all discussion is open, they still need to be covert in their talk.) Members of the winning team (or teams, when three teams are in play) receive a score card, and the first player (or players) to receive four cards wins the game. Teams are randomly determined each round, so your back-up man one round may be your target the next. Covert Action sounds utterly simple, yet is difficult to describe succinctly. I look forward to seeing how Frank makes everything clear in the rules.<br/><br/>",

The first player (or team) to win six sets claims victory.<br/><br/>The game consists of two separate decks of cards: the Serve Deck and the Play Deck. Each player is dealt ten cards (or seven, when playing doubles) from the Play Deck. Players must use these cards wisely because they can not replenish their hands until the winner of the set is determined.<br/><br/>The serving player reveals the top Serve Deck card to get the game started. An Ace card is an automatic point for the server. Revealing consecutive Fault Cards gives an automatic point to the receiving player. Revealing an In Card means the receiving player may respond with a play from one&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>When the game gets going each player may respond with the proper card from one&rsquo;s hand. Failure to or choosing not to respond results in a point for the opponent.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Play Deck:<br/><br/>45 normal shots (5 cards for each of 9 possible shots)<br/>2 Out<br/>4 Smash<br/>4 Kill<br/>1 Ad card (not needed to play - same back as other cards but lists other Parker Bros. games to try)<br/>56 cards total<br/><br/>Serve Deck:<br/><br/>17 In<br/>3 Ace<br/>7 Fault<br/><br/>27 cards total<br/><br/>1 Rules sheet<br/>1 Serve marker<br/>1 Ball marker<br/>Tennis Court Playing Area board<br/>1 advertisement card with Play deck backing<br/><br/>",

Abuse is a fast-playing game of instant gratification at its most base&mdash;serving up heapin' helpings of nastiness on your friends, before they can do the same to you. To quote that eminent sage George Carlin, &quot;It's all about 'doing the dozens.'&quot;<br/> Written and designed by Greg Stolze, with graphics by Samuel Araya, Abuse is easy to learn. Each player aims to destroy the ego (not really, it is only a game!) of the other players, by laying down insults created from cards in one's hand. The objective: get as many of your cards out of your hand before the end of the round (brought on by someone emptying their hand), so as to have as few points as possible. At the end of the game, whoever sinks the lowest (in score as well as insults) wins!<br/><br/>Just to make things even more interesting, there are blank cards (helping you to put your own personal touch on your insults) and snappy retorts, which allow you to turn the tables on someone who's just insulted your mother.<br/><br/>Abuse is a non-collectible card game with eighty cards in a deck, good for four players per each deck in play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.<br/><br/>TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).<br/><br/>The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.<br/><br/>Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry (25 per side), armor (6), mountain (2), airborne (2), headquarters (1+2+4), and amphibious troops (2) and 6 counters without symbol (You can use as replacement for headquarters having fired their nuclear missile; the 3 types of headquarter have different nuclear missiles). 100 counters in all.<br/><br/>TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.<br/><br/>In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Operação MX-1, was released in Brazil. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Tactics III&quot;.<br/><br/>",

There are some safe spaces on the board (maintenance sheds) that allow you to refresh your hand of cards as a bonus. Cards allow you to move, move faster along the road, escape a dinosaur or cancel another player's card. On your turn, you roll dice that indicate which dinosaur you may move. You then move yourself one space, play a card or trade in cards. The dinosaurs don't kill anyone (unlike in the movie!) -- they just pin you down until the dinosaur is moved away or an escape card is played.<br/><br/>Although the box says 2-4 players, there are pieces for up to 8, which leads to a lot more mayhem (but a longer game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Depending upon the number of players, each player receives 1 or 2 knights.  Each of these knights lists a series of dice pips on the card, some of which are red in color.  These red numbers are the knights defensive abilities, and he will block these numbers if rolled by an opponent during a competition.  For instance, Upollonius Wolkenburg has a 1, 2 and 3 in red.  Thus, he will block one of each of these numbers each time dice are rolled by an opponent in a competition.  Some knights have less numbers in red, but they usually have a greater attack strength, meaning they can roll more dice in combat.  This mechanism borrows very heavily from many role playing and fantasy games.<br/><br/>In addition to these 'defense' numbers and the attack dice chart, each knight card also has charts for prizes won (1 - 15) and damage points (1 - 10).  There are also nice illustrations on each card ... about the only kind thing I can say about the game.<br/><br/>Each player also receives a 'lady' card.  Each lady possesses a number of characteristics, including hair color, build, height and personality.  When granting her favor to a knight (which is indicated by placing a corresponding token onto a knight card), the idea is to seek out a knight who desires similar characteristics in a lady.<br/><br/>The start player challenges an opposing knight with one of his knights.  A challenge cannot be refused.  These two enter battle, which involves each player tossing a number of dice equal to their attack strength into the tournament field.  In mounted combat, any 1's, 2's or 3's thrown strike a blow, unless these are blocked by the opponent.  If any of these dice strike, the knight falls from his horse and the knight suffers hit points equal to the number of blows which were landed.  If only one knight is struck and falls from his horse, the opponent wins and earns a prize for himself and for his lady.  If both knights fall from their horse, then the match continues on foot.  This involves more dice rolling, but 4's, 5's and 6's now strike.  This continues until one knight concedes or reaches 10 damage points, at which time he is out of the tournament (and out of the game).<br/><br/>The next player in turn order then challenges a knight.  This process is repeated until there is only one healthy knight remaining. The round then ends and victory points are doled out to the knight and lady who won the most prizes.  There are also potential bonuses which add to the players' scores.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this wacky Cheapass title, players are Sous Chefs trying to get to the top floor of a skyscraper by scaling the outside.  However the maniacal Devil Bunny is hopping about in a mad lust for blood thinking he'll get a ham by knocking you off.  Yeah, right, whatever.<br/><br/>The game board is a rectangular grid representing the side of a building, with the starting space at the bottom, and the goal at the top. There is a dotted line near the top that represents a critical height (see below). Furthermore, there are special spaces on the sides of the buildings that represent &quot;fear&quot; that cannot be moved into (As a show of Cheapass Games' signature humor, these fears included &quot;spiders&quot; and &quot;Wesley Snipes.&quot;)<br/><br/>In the basic game, each player controls two sous-chefs; on each turn, the player rolls two six-sided dice. Any roll other than a 6 can be used to move one or both sous-chefs up the side of the building, either horizontally or on upwards diagonals (a player cannot voluntarily move down the building). If a 6 is rolled, the Devil Bunny token is moved to the highest sous-chef on the board and knocks him off; if there is a sous-chef vertically below the one that was knocked off, the player controlling that one may opt to catch the falling sous-chef, placing the token in the spaces immediately below him. If no player that is able to catch the sous chef offers to help, the chef will crash to the ground. If the chef fell from a height below the marked line on the board, the chef is safe but must restart him climb back from the start. However, if the chef was above this line, the chef is dead, leaving the player with one fewer token to win. The players earn points for the order in which their chefs arrive at the top, and the weighting is such that a player with second and third-place chefs can beat a player with a first-place and a dead (non-scoring) chef.<br/><br/>Variants include ignoring the effects of the fear spaces (which normally cluster the players into the center columns), and using 3 sous-chef tokens for each player.<br/><br/>In 2022, Greater Than Games created a boxed edition with upgraded components.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a deck containing the same cards; each card shows a value from 1-5, sometimes as a numeral, sometimes with fingers on a hand, sometimes spelled in various languages, and so on.<br/><br/>Everyone plays at the same time. Players take three cards in hand, then all try to play cards to the center of the table, starting with 1s, then 2s, etc. The number of card piles in play can't exceed the number of players. When playing a card, a player can lay down a card that's one higher or one lower than the top card on a pile. As soon as a player lays down a 5, she claims the pile, placing it in her score pile. Players can discard cards as they like, but they lose 1 point for each card discarded.<br/><br/>As soon as a player runs out of cards, she can end the round. Everyone scores 1 point for each card in their individual score pile, then loses 1 point for each card discarded, each card in hand, and each card still in their pile. Players then sort the cards and start a new round. When one player has totaled 100 or more points, she wins!<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a color coded pizza slice with six slots used to hold topping discs. There are six discs of four different toppings placed face down on the table along with two &quot;switch&quot; ones for each color. Players flip one over on their turn and add it to their slice if it matches the topping they already have. If a &quot;switch&quot; one is revealed, the player trades his or her slice with the player of the corresponding color or with any player if his or her own color is revealed.<br/><br/>Ages 4 to 8<br/><br/>",

You may also steal treasures from the other players.<br/><br/>From the beginning you have 8 different equipment cards, which you need to use to pass traps or defeat monsters. Sometimes you might lose 1 or more of your pieces of equipment, but there's a possibility to get them back at a couple of places on the board.<br/><br/>The most remarkable thing about this game is that the board is in 6 parts, connected with roads in many combinations, The only way of reaching two of the parts is by jumping into one of the whirlpools in the middle of the board, This allows the board to be folded in or out to another board. There are rules to handle the other players if they get caught on the folded board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the dice game Tulpenfieber, you want to complete a particular pattern in your tulip field first to win.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a game board that's five rows deep, with each row having seven field spaces, each depicting one or more arrangements of dice; the lower the row, the more dice depicted in an arrangement. Three fields start with tulips on them. On a turn, you roll four dice up to three times, keeping or re-rolling dice as you wish. After your third roll, you can flip two tulip tiles in your field face down to have a fourth roll; you can do this again for a fifth roll if you wish, but you can't get a sixth roll and those tiles will be face down for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>If the dice show an arrangement depicted on your board, you can cover that field with a tulip tile; if not, take a tulip tile and place it next to your board; you can flip this tile face down on a later turn as part of a re-roll, but it has no other benefit.<br/><br/>If you have a vertical column of three tiles or a diagonal line of three tiles that reaches down to the third row, then you can roll five dice on your turn. When you have a vertical or diagonal line that reaches the fourth or fifth row, then you'll roll six or seven dice on a turn. If you have a 2x3 or 3x2 arrangement of tiles on your board, you can place a bonus tile to cover them, and at the start of each turn, you can place one of the dice that you would roll on this tile with the number of your choice.<br/><br/>Whoever first covers all seven fields in the fourth row or three adjacent fields in the fifth row or any four fields in the fifth row wins.<br/><br/>Tulpenfieber includes a solo mode in which you play three rounds of the game, with a round ending only when you meet a victory condition. You gain a permanent tile on the board after rounds one and two to help you advance more quickly, but your final score in the solo game is the sum of all the tiles that you gained over three rounds, with a lower score being better. A score of 60 or lower counts as a win.<br/><br/>",

Back then the 'milkcaps' from the Dairy bottles were used, but thanks to companies like the now nonexistent World POG Federation, the simple game became an overnight fad that spawned an entire industry for years.<br/><br/>The game basically consists of taking a slammer and slamming it down onto a stack of Pogs that are stacked on a mat.  You do this until either your or your opponent's Pogs have all been flipped over.  There are variations to the rules, but these are the basics of it.<br/><br/>The game is simple and rather fun.  POG The Game is a nice packaging of the game, with all the components needed to play it according to World POG Federation rules and with their official merchandise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": " &gt;&gt;&gt; ICE COLD ICE HOCKEY IS NOW LIVE ON BOARDGAMEARENA.COM!!!<br/><br/>Ice Cold Ice Hockey is a thinking-man's card game that has been designed to simulate all the excitement of professional ice hockey. An action deck of 64 cards, three rink-cards and comprehensive yet easy-to-understand rules comprise the complete game (although you'll need to supply a small token, disc or coin). The cards serve multiple purposes, including passing, skating, shooting, defense, shot-blocking and goaltending. Experienced players will be able to complete a game in about an hour.<br/><br/>Note that this is NOT just a &ldquo;draw and play cards (or a take-that!) game.&rdquo; Card combinations and good decisions are key in ICIH. You&rsquo;ll always want to keep an Inside Shot card in your hand, for example, in the hope of pairing it up with a Pass or Skate card that leads to an Inside Shot. (Your brain will be working on all cylinders during the entire game, and your play will improve over time as you learn to watch for the appearance of important cards.)<br/><br/>I call the above a &ldquo;set-up.&rdquo; Three and even four-card set-ups are possible, and over time you&rsquo;ll learn what they are. You can also bluff a bit; for example, if you have a surplus of Offensive Zone (OZ) Skate or Pass cards but no Inside Shot card, you can play an OZ card which allows the play of a defensive card to tease one out of your opponent&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>ICIH features realistic shots on goal, scoring and game play. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll effortlessly set up end-to-end plays while at other times you&rsquo;ll only be able to dump the puck out of your own defensive zone. You&rsquo;ll shoot from the point and, after some effort, from close-in. On defense, sometimes you&rsquo;ll be able to challenge the puck-carrier and sometimes you won&rsquo;t. Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to risk a penalty to stop an opponent&rsquo;s scoring chance. Loose pucks, blocked shots, breakaways, fighting, momentum, penalties, super-saves &ndash; they&rsquo;re all here in Ice Cold Ice Hockey!<br/><br/>",

The winner is the first to get all 4 of their dinosaurs home.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player rolls 3 dice—two white and one black.  They first move the Tyrannosaurus forwards or backward in an attempt to catch other players' dinosaurs.  If they are caught, they have to go to the &quot;T-Rex Den&quot;.  Once there, only a 6 can free them.  The white dice can be added and one dinosaur moved, or can be used separately to move 2 dinosaurs.<br/><br/>There are shorter and longer stretches of track, and a safe route through the riverbed which the T. rex may not enter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is similar to &quot;Can't Stop&quot; whereby you try to push your luck as far as possible.  Basically, everybody is given a number (1-6) [assume you are &quot;3&quot;].  In your turn you roll the five dice.  If you get your number [for example there is one &quot;3&quot; in the five dice], you are given tokens for every die of your number [one token in the case] and the option to re-roll those dice which are not your number [in the case, the other four dice].  If you choose to re-roll them, you need to get more dice of your number to get more tokens [for example if you get another &quot;3&quot; from the four dice in the re-roll, you get another token].  If not [in this case if you did not get any &quot;3&quot; from the re-roll], you forfeit the tokens you get from your previous rolls [which is the one token}.    With enough tokens you get to the &quot;Pit&quot;.  This is when the fun begins, instead of rolling the dice for your number, you roll other people's numbers of your choice.  You get to remove their tokens instead.  If you are out of the &quot;Pit&quot;, you cannot do so.  Games goes on till last man standing.<br/><br/>",

Rowling&rsquo;s Wizarding World like never before.<br/><br/>In this game, each player takes control of a group of witches and wizards from the Harry Potter cinematic saga, each represented by a finely detailed resin miniature, sculpted to exacting detail in collaboration with Warner Bros. Each 35mm miniature is produced in high quality resin, making it ideal for collectors, painters and gamers alike.<br/><br/>During the game, players must outmanoeuvre their opponents across beautifully illustrated game boards representing many of the iconic locations from the Wizarding World, such as Hogwarts, the Chamber of Secrets, and the Forbidden Forest. Players must explore these environments, resolving Challenges and Quests in order to secure victory.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter Miniatures Adventure Game gives players complete freedom to form their own group of witches and wizards. Players can collect their favourite models, and equip them with Potion and Artefact cards and, of course, a dizzying array of Spells. The variety of options at your disposal means no two games are the same. The Harry Potter Miniatures Adventure Game is easy to learn and fun to play. Its free-flowing, dynamic gameplay means you&rsquo;ll want to return again and again to unleash new characters and abilities, and perfect your tactics.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If the player chooses to repel the vampire that means using up garlic. A player that drove back the White Lady can then decide to move their own pawn, possibly frightening other players' pawns and stealing their garlic.<br/><br/>Successful play does not mean just remembering how many turns the White Lady has left, a much bigger influence is how well a player turned the other players against each other with the help of the Vampire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the game box:<br/>&quot;Solomon's Temple is a game for two players that is fun and exciting. The game will take you from 1 to 1-1/2 hours to complete. The first player to complete the Temple and play Filling of the Holy of Holies is the winner. However, the game is not that simple. While you are trying to build the Temple, the Israelites continue to fall into Sin. Work must be stopped on the Temple in order to lead the Israelites back into the ways of the LORD. To make matters worse, invasion forces from Babylon are pouring down from the north. They want to destroy the entire city of Jerusalem and wreck the Temple! Do you have what it takes to handle the Israelites' rebellion against God, deal with the Babylonian attacks, and still find time to complete the Temple before your opponent does?&quot;<br/><br/>Each of the two players takes the part of the Israelites attempting to complete the Temple while at the same time playing the part of the attacking Babylonians for his opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first player to complete the Temple in its entirety, including all Structure and Furnishing Cards, and finally play the Filling of the Holy of Holies card.<br/><br/>The folding game board loosely depicts the Old City of Jerusalem. Positions for Structure, Priest, Altar, Prophet, other cards, and positions for the Babylonian army pawns are clearly marked.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of 100 cards from which he draws during the game. Drawing and laying cards are the driving force behind play. Cards are played to build the Temple structure, furnish the Temple, build an Altar, attack your opponent's Temple with Babylonian armies, destroy your opponent's armies, interfere with building using Sin, negating Sin with Burnt Offerings and Scapegoats, and so forth.<br/><br/>A lengthy note from the designer explains much of the history and background of the game design and origin.<br/><br/>",

When you upgrade such a station, you may reassign it to another company. Your main focus is the acquisition of shares, and as soon as shares are issued, trains can run on behalf of the companies. This way money will be distributed to the shareholders and you get new capital.

It was him, who spread disaster and there was no-one who did not bear wickedness in his heart. Only the First Hero, shielded by an armor, which defended him from the influence of sin, has challenged the Unnamed, defeated him and banished into the Void, which he close using magical seals.<br/><br/>Today the safeguards crumble, and the power of the Unnamed makes its way to our world. Again, people act against each other, their hearts bearing the seeds of wickedness. The Virtues that were our strength are transforming into parodies of themselves. If the heroes will not complete the armor of the First, clothe with it the most worthy of them, and achieve victory over the Unnamed, all shall be lost.<br/><br/>7 is a fantasy board game, in which you will become a hero worthy of legends, gathering his own party of adventurers to win over an ancient evil. You will take part in dangerous quests, working with other heroes to recover the miraculous Armor of Virtues and proving that you are the most worthy of wearing it. You shall accomplish great deeds, as long as you guard yourself from the temptation of excess, which brings with it sin and disaster.<br/><br/>7 offers a unique mechanism of play, joining the aspect of cooperation with an element of rivalry. For the kingdom to survive, you will have to join your forces with other players. Be wary though, as there can be only one victor. You will have to beware of excessive ambition though, as it can unnoticeably cause your strength to falter. 7 opens the gates to a heroic, but dangerous adventure.<br/><br/>",

Because all along the track, Quicksand pits lie in wait to suck your adventurer down, down, down --piece by piece by piece!

To represent your sinking into the quicksand, you remove his feet, then his waist, and so on until only the pith helmet remains!<br/><br/>You actually start already partially mired (by an initial die roll); every turn you move forward a number of spaces given by your height, plus an optional movement die.

Start in your trailer and go through town, collecting &quot;redneck&quot; things like a bag o' jerky and a hound dog to bring back home. If you're the first redneck to collect everything and return to your trailer, you win.<br/><br/>On each turn you pick from three choices that correctly complete one of Jeff Foxworthy&rsquo;s redneck jokes.<br/><br/>Sample Questions:<br/><br/>You might be a Redneck if... you wash your car more often than you wash your _____.<br/>1. hair<br/>2. kids<br/>3. clothes<br/><br/>You might be a Redneck if... your mother doesn't put on _____ to go grocery shopping.<br/>1. makeup<br/>2. shoes<br/>3. a bra<br/><br/>Dumb luck plays a role, too. If you land on a Dumb Luck spot, you must draw a card and may be required to do any of 30 different things, such as give up one of your treasures, or perform a Redneck stunt like hog-calling. A flip of the Redneck coin each time you encounter Dumb Luck decides if you will be the recipient of the Dumb Luck, or if you must force it upon one of your fellow Rednecks.<br/><br/>Jeff Foxworthy's You Might Be a Redneck If... Game is for 2 to 4 players ages 16 and up. (Answers to the clues: kids, shoes.)<br/><br/>Foxworthy is the largest selling comedy-recording artist in history, a multiple Grammy Award nominee and best selling author of 13 books. He starred in The Blue Collar Comedy Tour movie and the follow-up DVD, The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again. He also stars in and executive produces the WB hit television show &quot;Blue Collar TV&quot; and hosts a weekly country countdown radio show, The Foxworthy Countdown.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Queens and Kings ...A Checkers Game is an abstract strategy game for 2 or 4 players that plays like checkers and in addition introduces a queen component that throws strategy out the door on each and every move. The game can be played in either two player  or team mode. <br/>More about the game: The Queen, being tired of a male dominated game that either features only the King or the Queen in a lesser role, created a 2/4-player game that  shows the Queen&rsquo;s ability to be the master of the game . <br/>Queen and Kings ...A Checkers Game, introduces a Queen scepter in the center of the board, upon capturing it the King is introduced. The King can move one space in any direction, forward or backwards along its diagonal grid. Advancing your piece to the opposite end of the board creates a Queen that can fly diagonally across the board, seizing all opponents in her path. Both Queen and King have a strategic value, so choose wisely because once a Queen or King that  piece remains so until defeated or game is over. Each game starts with either 9  pieces that can only move forward along its diagonal grid, so be mindful of the Queen and her pursuit of her opponents <br/>In Queens &amp; Kings ...A Checkers Game, In Team mode it takes a coordinated effort to defeat your opponents. The 9 piece- games plays out in about 30 minutes to 90 minutes. <br/>What will be your strategy? The Queen now sits next to the King on her throne and peace and harmony reigns in the kingdom, or does it?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the fantasy Xanth novels by Piers Anthony.<br/><br/>From the box: On Xanth... Anyone who doesn't believe in magic must reckon with the rainbow, which shows up only at a distance and retreats if anyone walks toward it. If one person stands still and another walks, the rainbow remains in place for the one and retreats for the other - simultaneously. It is one-sided, like a one-way path, invisible from the other side. That is obviously magic. - Piers Anthony<br/><br/>Xanth, the magical, pun-filled world of Piers Anthony's fantasy novels, comes to life in this hilarious game. As one of many colorful characters, players must travel across land and sea in order to fulfill their wild and wacky quests. For 1 to 6 players, ages 12 to adult.<br/><br/>Contents: 162 playing cards, 15 dice, 6 pawns, 12 chits, gameboard, rulebook, sorting tray.<br/><br/>There are 3 card types used in the game, Chair Actors (Characters), Events/Encounters &amp; Quests. The majority are E/E cards. Only Character cards have colour illustrations, the others being monochrome or text only. A small errata sheet is included.<br/><br/>Simple &amp; Easy Game<br/>Each player starts with 2 character cards and a Quest card (which determines their starting area on the map), with the character's Cunning &amp; Strength, plus a Talent - an extra rule or exception they can use, tying in to the character in the novels. <br/>Each turn starts by drawing an Event/Encounter card, playing it if it's a Disaster. Other E/E cards include objects to assist in some way, commonly in combat, hazards to play on other players, additional characters (mixed in from those not in play) etc., often limited by area (you have to get to some areas to activate some objects, for instance). <br/>If there is no Disaster, players move their pawn across the board (normally 2 areas, Characters, Event cards &amp; the area characteristics can modify this). The other players may then play Events or Creatures on them, possibly limited by the area. Characters can attempt to avoid encounters (roll dice under Cunning), or may fight (roll a die under Strength to cause a wound, repeat until one side loses). The specific encounter or creature may modify this, as can many E/E cards. <br/>Players start from scratch if their character is beaten, but can heal by use of certain cards or in certain areas. <br/>The first to complete their Quest wins.<br/><br/>Still Simple &amp; Easy but Longer Game<br/>Same as before, but complete 2 or 3 Quests. This ties in to the 3 Quests set by the Magician Humphrey in the novels.<br/><br/>Monaural (Solo) Game<br/>Same again, but work through the Quests deck until you are knocked out. hazards are drawn randomly instead of played by other players.<br/><br/>Stereo (2-player) Game<br/>Same as the Monaural Game, the winner is the player who completes most Quests<br/><br/>",

Cards may be taken from the draw or discard pile, or from other players.  When a player holds a correct set of four cards and lands on an 'open door' square the door is opened, revealing the date.<br/><br/>If the cards do not correspond to the date, the player's turn ends but their set of cards are retained.

On a turn, a player rolls the special LEGO die, then:<br/><br/>&bull; On a brown, hangs the monkey on a leaf with a banana, then claims all the bananas from that leaf, taking care not to knock over the tree.<br/>&bull; On a green, adds a new leaf to the tree.<br/>&bull; On a yellow, adds a banana from the stock to any leaf.<br/>&bull; On a green/yellow, does both of the actions above.<br/><br/>Any time you can't do a yellow or green action, you take a monkey action instead. If no bananas are on the tree, you can steal a banana from an opponent. Knock the monkey out of the tree, and you have to return a banana; knock over the tree or unbalance it so it topples, and you have to return all your bananas, ending the game and giving the win to whoever is the best banana baron. Variants include new ways to move the monkey and a suggestion to take monkey actions with your eyes closed.<br/><br/>",

You and your team have been investigating anomalous activities the region, and recently things have shifted for the worse. The coming storm is said to be the &quot;storm-of-the-century&quot;; it may last a month or more. Strange howls and buzzing fill the long nights, and yesterday a crew-member went AWOL... or worse. The call for evacuation was made, but it came too late. The long winter storm has set in. There's no hope of getting help until it clears. Now your crew's only hope is to use what little resources you have to survive the long winter cold (and whatever's out there in it). Use your rations wisely, and you may see the sun again.<br/><br/>Outpost: Siberia is a fully cooperative, survival game that plays with a single deck of cards. Using an inventive dual-facing system, a single card in Outpost can be anything from life-saving supplies to cataclysmic catastrophes. By enduring relentless weather and defeating untamable beasts, players are rewarded with the much-needed tools and food to continually resupply their resources.<br/><br/>Outpost: Siberia keeps the tension high, as players will need to collect their wits and ration their supplies in order to make through the perpetual perils that lie ahead!<br/><br/>",

But as with all haunted houses, know that you enter at your own risk. The goal is to emerge with your sanity - and your soul &ndash; intact.<br/><br/>The board game remains true to the original award winning computer game, although now you play the role of one of the six guests in direct competition with the other guests. Starting from the Foyer, you are randomly assigned destination rooms to which you must go, by roll of the Magic Die, and there, solve the mysteries and challenges within. Be the first to finish your tour of the mansion, arrive at the final destination, the Little Room at the Top, solve the final puzzle there, and you best your fellow guests and achieve your heart's most secret desire. Which, for one thing, is to best your fellow guests.<br/><br/>The puzzle types range from logic puzzles, to spatial problems, to riddles and cryptic clues to trivia. You never know what you'll get. Some may be easy, but some may be real brain freezers. But Stauf, being a fair-minded host, has provided up to three hints for the more difficult problems. But using the hints comes at a price, naturally. Nothing is free, you know. And in Stauf's world, no good deed goes unpunished.<br/><br/>(Note that whereas The 7th Guest and The 11th Hour had a little less than 90 logic puzzles &amp; brain teasers between them, the basic tabletop game comes with 300, and that's just for starters.)<br/><br/>And if you can't solve the puzzle put to you, the other guests will have a chance to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; it from you by answering it instead. So be vigilant and pay attention to not only your own puzzles, but to the puzzles put to your fellow guests. You might just walk away with the prize that was once within their grasp. How delicious is that?<br/><br/>It all sounds pretty simple and straightforward, doesn't it? Well, not quite so fast. Simple, maybe. But straightforward? That's not exactly the way of the diabolical game maker, who here, has devised a number of Mystery Spells that are cast upon his guests, making things just a little trickier... and lot more interesting. Should you land on a Mystery space, you might be sent someplace you don't want to be. Or, you might be assigned extra rooms to unlock. Or, somebody might gain the power to &ldquo;Steal&rdquo; the answer to your puzzle from right under your nose. Again, you never know what you're going to get. But Stauf is,if nothing else, an equal opportunity evil doer... so all those bad things that can be inflicted on you can be inflicted on your opponents too. And take heart... for every evil spell, there is a good one too. Stauf isn't totally evil. Right?<br/><br/>",

As an important urbanist, compete against other players to build the best districts of Chang'an and to get the favors of the court.<br/><br/>Players will carefully project their plans by placing cards on the top part of their personal boards (the gates). Then they will move them into the city districts to build amazing buildings and to welcome influential characters in the neighborhood. Every new card built into the districts will provide players with different types of privileges and a certain number of victory points.<br/><br/>During your turn, you perform only one of the three main actions: research, play and/or move cards on the gates to produce resources and activate character effects, or build.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player gets nine or more cards built in the districts of their City board (cards at the gates are not considered).<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points will be declared the best urbanist of Chang&rsquo;an.<br/><br/>",

You score very little for getting a question right but if you make a rather obvious answer, a klaxon sounds and you gather lots of minus points. The box features host Stephen Fry on the cover. The odd name for the show, QI, stands for 'Quite Interesting'.<br/><br/>The publisher says;<br/>According to The Bible what came first the chicken or the egg? Be careful with your answer. Get it right and you move forward but a wrong answer could mean the dreaded klaxon and you'll be going backwards! The answer to this and hundreds of other obscure and fascinating facts can be found in this hilarious board game based on the QI television programme!<br/><br/>",

(In Japanese, they overlap by syllable; in English and other languages, by letter.)<br/><br/>The artwork name that the turn player chooses can be a sentence, a quote, an onomatopeia, or anything. All it needs for chaining is the agreement from the other players.<br/><br/>Every player starts with 5 cards. The rest of the cards are the stack. Gameplay follows a clockwise direction.<br/>The first player draws a card from the stack, place it where everyone can see, and call the first &quot;word&quot;. Then the turn moves to the next player.<br/>At every player's turn, they can choose either of the following actions;<br/>1. Place one of their cards and call any chaining &quot;word&quot;. The &quot;word&quot; has to be chained to the last letter of the previous &quot;word&quot;.<br/>2. Discard one or more cards and draw the same number of cards from the stack.<br/><br/>If the turn player put and call the &quot;word&quot;, the rest of the players discuss whether the &quot;words&quot; matches the artwork or not.<br/>When more than half of the players agree, the chaining is succeeded. Otherwise, the card placed in this turn is discarded and the failed player must draw one card from the stack.<br/>Then the turn moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>Once a player has no cards remaining, that will be the last round. If multiple players are able to place all of their cards during the last round, all of them are winners.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A hybrid of CCG, Marbles and Transforming Robots, this dexterity game represents a battlefield, with competing forces battling for control.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns shooting the marble-like Bakugan at the metal cards which have been placed to make up the play area.  If the Bakugan lands at the right spot on the card, it will spring open and stand on the card, taking control of the card.  When two Bakugan stand on the same card, they fight, using their strength, plus bonuses on the card they are attempting to control.  Play continues until all areas are controlled, or one player's Bakugan have been eliminated.  The winner is determined by the values of the areas taken, and other bonuses accumulated in play.<br/><br/>",

Napoleon's Grande Arm&eacute;e launched an attack against the Russian army, driving it back from its initial positions but failing to gain a decisive victory. Both armies were exhausted after the battle and the Russians withdrew from the field the following day. Borodino represented the last Russian effort at stopping the French advance on Moscow, which fell a week later. However, the French had no clear way of forcing Czar Alexander to capitulate because the Russian army was not decisively defeated, resulting in the ultimate defeat of the French invasion following the retreat from Moscow in October.<br/><br/>Two scenarios are provided: a historical scenario (where units are placed as they were actually deployed) and a hypothetical scenario (where players are free to deploy where they wish).<br/><br/>Victory is solely based on Russian strength losses, the French player must eliminate at least 90 strength points to win.

The trick is to make the best 5-dice &quot;hand&quot; from your two personal pocket dice and 5 up-for-grabs dice. Each roll could shift your strategy: will two pair become three of a kind or a full house? Will you go for broke with an all-in-bet?<br/><br/>At showdown time, the player with the best poker hand wins the chips. The ultimate hand is a Yahtzee flush: 5-of-a-kind in the same color &quot;suit&quot;!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player blind draws two dice from the bag and places them in his cup and shakes (his secret &quot;pocket&quot; dice), and they ante and bet based on their pocket dice. Then three more &quot;community&quot; dice are drawn and rolled (the &quot;flop&quot;), then a fourth (the &quot;turn&quot;), and a fifth (the &quot;river&quot;), with two betting rounds (of check, bet, call, call &amp; raise, fold, and all-in options) in between each draw. Dice combinations are similar to their poker counterparts and can give players; two pair, three of a kind, full house, straight, four of a kind, flush, Yahtzee (five dice of the same number in different suits), straight flush, and the &quot;Yahtzee Flush&quot; - five dice of the same number and suit (color), that automatically wins a player the game.<br/><br/>",

Unlike Werewolf, Templar Intrigue does not require a moderator, has no player elimination, and plays VERY fast.<br/><br/>Players in Templar Intrigue are split into two teams &mdash; those loyal to France (and thus King Phillip), and those loyal to the Templars &mdash; and of course, you might not know who is on your team. After dealing out the cards, you go through a series of information reveals, then you start trying to sway Phillip to believe what you want the King to believe...<br/><br/>After a certain amount of discussion and at the discretion of His Majesty King Phillip IV, one monk looks at another player's card.  This is followed by more discussion, then another monk looks and reports back.<br/><br/>Once all of the monks have spied on another player and reported back, more discussion takes place, then at the discretion of His Majesty, two players are identified. If Phillip finds the Temple Grandmaster and the Archivist, then Phillip and those loyal to France (blue team) win the round; if not, then those loyal to the Templars (red team) win the round.<br/><br/>As soon as one (or more) players have won three times, the game ends with those players being victorious.<br/><br/>",

There is only one law in the land and that law is QUAO (pronounced &lsquo;cow&rsquo;). The mighty and all-powerful bovine of the badlands, QUAO governs the province by sheer antagonism. Only she knows the Rules and she hands them down with iron hoof.<br/><br/>WHAT&rsquo;S UP WITH THE QUAO YOU ASK? First of all, she&rsquo;s not just a cow, she&rsquo;s a dictator and you better get used to playing by her Rules!<br/><br/>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE QUAO? When you play this game, being QUAO means you know the Rules and everyone else has to figure them out. You also hand out all the penalties! Use your secret Rules and the help of your loyal subjects Quak, JaQuas and BullyQ to win this game. Just watch out for Cheata&rsquo;, because she could be your downfall!<br/><br/>OBJECT: Each player is dealt five white cards. Each player has a chance to discard one card during each turn. The person that successfully completes and discards all the cards in their hand first, wins the round and becomes the dictator QUAO. Whoever wins the fifth and final round is the ultimate dictator and the winner!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: There are four different &lsquo;suits&rsquo; of white cards and each suit is played differently when discarded. During each turn a player may discard one of their cards from their hand to the table.<br/><br/>This is a commercial variant of the public domain game Mao<br/><br/>",

The players begin the game from their own base and each have control over a Vlad hero as well as an Archer and a Wallachian Knight.<br/><br/>During the game, they try to eliminate the opposing Vlad heroes through tactical movements and attacks with their own units. Gameplay takes place on two boards: the Game Map and the Underworld Map. While the Game Map is the board on which all the interactions between players take place (including movement, battles, tactical actions, and the positioning of units and outposts), the Underworld is the area Archers and Wallachian Knights enter once they die in battle. I Am Vlad: Prince Of Wallachia has two types of battles: against enemy units and against neutral units; for both types, players use battle cards, magic cards, tokens, and an eight-sided die. Other tactical actions are made through tokens, gold coins, outposts, and so on.<br/><br/>",

Nowadays, megacities locked in endless competition have to avoid the pitfalls of their own egocentrism...<br/><br/>Each player controls a city, represented by her hand of cards. Each card has an Egocentrism value and higher-valued cards also have special abilities.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to finish the game with the lowest Egocentrism score. One game can be composed of one or several rounds. Rounds play quickly.<br/><br/>Shuffle the 60 cards, form a deck, and initiate a discard pile. Distribute 5 cards to each player to compose her hand.<br/><br/>A card put into the discard pile is simply discarded when it came straight from the deck, but is played when it came from the hand of a player. A played card can trigger its special ability while a discarded card cannot.<br/><br/>During your turn, you must complete one of the following<br/>actions:<br/><br/>- Draw and either discard OR keep the card so it replaces one from your hand. The replaced card would then be played.<br/>- Take the first card from the discard pile so it replaces one card from your hand. The replaced card is then played.<br/>- Reveal a pair of equal-valued cards and play one.<br/>- Say &ldquo;STOP&rdquo; so the round will end just before your next turn<br/>starts.<br/><br/>The round also ends immediately if a player has no more cards in hand.<br/><br/>The game is therefore a race for the lowest score. The tricky part is that each player has the power to abruptly trigger the end of the round as a regular action on her turn. She must however be careful because other players might have lower scores than hers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer &amp; publisher:<br/><br/>Pictureka! is a new kind of game, both in mechanic as in artwork. The mechanic is invigorating with its large square gaming tiles. The game board is composed of 3 by 3 game tiles, so the game board on which is played is a huge square of 63 cm x 63 cm. This is large enough for several players to be able to play the game at the same time. The game board is &ldquo;alive&rdquo;, it is not a static board as the tiles are flipped over, turned and moved. So it is not possible to memory map the board. The mechanic of an ever changing board makes it not only fun; also the challenge is kept into the game all the time.<br/><br/>A game turn <br/>Players will have to throw a color dice at the beginning of their turn. According to the color thrown (3 possibilities) they must draw a mission card of the same color. There are 3 kinds of missions.<br/><br/>How to win the game? <br/>Be the first one to have successfully accomplished 10 missions. Each successful mission gives 1 point, so be the first one to get 10 points. <br/>The artwork is something not to be found in &lsquo;standard&rsquo; games. The personal drawing style of the artist Eugene makes this a kind of playing artwork.<br/><br/>",

Get it before it's cool.  It even has a pretentiously  hipster name, since it only includes one die.<br/><br/>The rules are characteristically evasive but the gist is: there is a six-sided die. Each side of the die represents a category: music, drink, literature, fashion, movies, and food. One player rolls the die and has one minute to declare a factoid concerning the rolled subject. If everyone accepts the factoid as true, then play passes to the left. If someone challenges the factoid, then that player has two minutes to disprove the statement using whatever electronic device is handy. The winner in the challenge scores one point. The winner of the game is declared when that person scores five points. Players will have to provide their own score keeping units and electronic device for research.<br/><br/>",

Each player sits on one side of the board. The red, green, yellow or blue strip at the board&rsquo;s edge determines the color each player uses.<br/><br/>A player is chosen to be banker. He distributes to each player 1 million dollars (5 x $10,000; 3 x $50,000; 3 x $100,000; 2 x $250,000). He puts the remaining money beside the board and administers it separately from his own money.<br/><br/>The 25 movie cards are mixed thoroughly and a card is put face down on each board space.<br/><br/>The 25 miniature screens and the 6 Golden Suns are put beside the board.<br/><br/>Everyone throws the numbered die once. The player with the highest result (the star equals 6) begins. The game proceeds after him clockwise.<br/><br/>Play, phase 1 <br/>On his turn, a player throws both dice. The intersection of the column (number-die) and row (letter-die) determines a board space. If the movie card on this space is face down, the player can and should buy this space with this card. He pays $10,000 to the bank and turns the card face up. Now, a miniature screen is put on this space. The player takes a screen from the reserve and puts it on the space so that his color appears through the two gaps in the framework of the screen.<br/><br/>Finally, the acquired movie card is put into the screen, face up.<br/><br/>Play, phase 2<br/>As soon as all 25 movie cards are owned and face up in miniature screens on the board, the second game phase begins. Now movie cards can change hands.<br/><br/>Debts and bankruptcy<br/>If a player must pay a sum and no longer has sufficient cash, he must sell his movie cards and/or Golden Suns. The player chooses what he would like to sell. The bank pays the sums printed on the cards, and Golden Suns fetch the same amount. Sold movie cards are turned face down again, and the screens and Golden Suns go back to the reserve. How-ever, the bank only takes back cards and Golden Suns if a player is insolvent.<br/><br/>A player who cannot settle his debts must declare bankruptcy. He gives all his remaining cash, miniature screens and Golden Suns back to the bank. The movie cards are turned face down again. The player retires from the game. If movie cards are turned face down in the second game phase, the game returns to the first game phase. Therefore, takeovers of movie cards that belong to other players cannot take place.<br/><br/>Negotiations <br/>All players are allowed to negotiate with other players anytime, even if it is not their turn. Movie cards may be bought, sold or traded. Players can also negotiate in order to pay debts. They need not necessarily sell to the bank if they receive better purchase offers from players.  Players can also negotiate whether owed sums on opponents&rsquo; movie cards can be reduced or even free of charge.<br/><br/>Ending the game<br/>The game is over when only one player remains. He is king of Hollywood!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Time heals all wounds, they say, but the sudden death of a loved one sometimes shakes those who are left behind so much that their faith wavers. To prevent this, the gods send fate weavers to change the past and prevent death. In the game series UNDO, players slip into the role of these destiny weavers and do everything in their power to undo sudden deaths &mdash; whether murder or suicide. Not only do they travel minutes or hours back in time, but sometimes thousands of years to change events that have laid the foundation for the later stroke of fate. Sometimes a leap into the future can also provide important information.<br/><br/>UNDO: Drowned Hopes is a beginners case for the UNDO Series and gets distributed for free through Pegasus Spiele on various events. It was also part of that games package Stadt Land Spielt! Mini Games 2019.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As you rise in power, your Nobles acquire Lands and Serfs, you'll add a Wife and Heir to your throne and move slowly toward becoming the most powerful Kingdom in the land. But wait... your opponent works to undo all you've built! You face opposition from his Minions, Magick spells and Armies. You are forced to Wage War with your Generals and Arms to seal your legacy in stone.<br/><br/>In the end, only one CASTLE can prevail!<br/><br/>Fast paced and fun, the game is quick to learn but challenging to play. While a session can be over in as little as 30 minutes, aggressive play and thoughtful strategy will keep you on the edge of your seat in game after game!<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing from a deck of 168 cards. As the game progresses, players may decide to try to Block their opponent&rsquo;s next card draw by using the combined values of either Minions/Magick or Champions/Arms. As players gain more cards in their Kingdom, they may decide to wage war with their Army, attempting to destroy their opponent&rsquo;s Kingdom while delaying paths to victory.<br/><br/>During the game:<br/>The players will be building their own Kingdoms while attempting to hinder their opponent's progress by waging war or blocking their draws. Striking a balance of building, organizing, blocking and attacking is integral to victory!<br/><br/>During a turn, A player may perform one of five available actions. <br/>1. Draw a card from the deck<br/>2. Wage war against their opponent by combining the strength of their General, Champion and Arms<br/>3. Use a Wizard card's ability<br/>4. Top off a stack (move one card in any stack to the top of the pile)<br/>5. Move the top card in a stack from one column to another, left or right<br/><br/>After completing an action, the player may opt to block their opponent's draw by combining either their Minion/Magick or Champion/Arms values. Three block conditions can occur based on the opponent's card draw value:<br/>1. Lower value than the block total - drawn card is discarded <br/>2. Equal value - both the drawn card and all blocking cards are discarded <br/>3. Higher value - Drawn card is kept. Blocking cards and additional cards (equaling or exceeding the drawn value) are discarded<br/><br/>To Win the Game:<br/>Be the first player to complete their Kingdom, consisting of 18 total cards in a specific arrangement.<br/><br/>",

Two to five players each play a different god, and compete with each other to take over the world.

For example, players may choose to be a figurehead of one of the five main religions, or they may choose to create their own gods &ndash; or even be their own god!

Players use one of their cards to move a dinosaur onto a matching space on the board. The dinosaurs don&rsquo;t share spaces, so players can get the dinosaurs really moving by playing the same item card twice and jumping over other dinosaurs! Mixed into the item cards are lava cards and when a player draws a lava card the lava moves one space closer to the valley. Players must get all the dinosaurs onto the island before the lava token reaches the bottom of the volcano.<br/><br/>The bright and colorful image-based gameplay makes Baby Dinosaur Rescue easy to learn and fun to play!

Move around the board as you win challenges, throwing dice to decide the difficulty of the action.<br/><br/>TWISTED EYES<br/><br/>A party game in which players have to draw while wearing glasses that distort what they see.<br/><br/>The game is played in teams. The goal is to be the first team to reach the finish space on the board. The board shows a track consisting of green, yellow and blue spaces. The active team rolls a colour die and moves their pawn to the next space of the corresponding colours. A member of that team inserts the glasses of the same colour (different amounts of distortion) and rolls the die again to select which of the three words from the card he/she has to draw. He/she then tries to draw, wearing the glasses, so that his/her teammates manage to guess the word within the amount of time specified by the timer. If the team is successful, they roll the die again and move their pawn to the next space of that colour. If the time runs out before they have guessed correctly, the team's pawn stays where it is.<br/><br/>The team who reaches the finish space first wins the game<br/><br/>GOOGLY EYES is the hilarious family game that challenges your vision and leaves you googling for more! Put on the zany, vision-altering google eye glasses and start to draw while your team tries to guess what you're drawing. Is that an igloo or a turtle? A birthday cake or a fortress? Players take turns drawing and guessing, so everyone gets a chance to wear the glasses. The glasses come with three sets of lenses that range from mild changes to mind-blowing fun, so no one can see (or draw) straight--your vision will bounce off of the lenses. Googly Eyes is a fun twist on classic drawing games that lets players of different ages and skill levels compete on equal terms, since the goggles make it fun and challenging for everyone. Unlike any other drawing game you don't need to be an artist, and the rules are simple. Just roll the die and move--the space you land on tells you which color lenses to use (easy, medium, or hard). Then pick a card, set the timer, and start drawing. If your team guesses correctly you get to roll and move again; if not, then you stay where you are on the board. The first team to reach Finish wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a new game inspired by the bestselling novel of the same name and licensed by the film company that is making the movie based on the Da Vinci code book. The game includes 15 different mysteries for players to solve and uses some clever tools that players must employ to solve the mysteries. An instructional DVD that explains the game and shows an example mystery being solved is also included.<br/><br/>There are 2 phases to the game. In the first phase players roll and move their pieces around the board to visit various sites to look at clue cards so they can figure out the mystery phrase first. Each of these clues require a different mechanism to solve. Some use a mirror to reverse the letters, some use a decoder box that is laid over the card in a certain way to reveal part of the mystery phrase, some cards you line up against a special decoder tool, and some are just riddles or puzzles to solve. Some clues will also require the player to do to the center of the board and visit the library to retrieve a card there with information that will help them solve their clue. Alternately, players might need to visit the Louvre and examine a painting there. When the players visit the Louvre the players only have 30 seconds to find the correct card with the painting that relates to their clue, examine the painting and the information on the card about the painting and hopefully discover the information they need to solve their current clue.<br/><br/>Players can also discover one of two special types of cards: Taxis which let the player move around board quicker and a computer card that lets you look at another player's notes for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Once one player thinks they have solved the Mystery Phrase they go to the center of the board and announce the answer. If they are right then all players score 1 point for each letter (and blank space) they had correct in the Mystery Phrase. The player that got the Mystery Phrase correct gets 5 bonus points.<br/><br/>This begins Phase 2 of the game as 5 questions are now read from the mystery book. These questions relate to the clues that the players discovered during the game. Each question a player gets right is worth 5 points. If a player gets all 5 questions correct they score another 5 points.<br/><br/>Players lose points for any Taxi or Computer cards they had left in their hand at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is played on a large board like a soccer field, approx 100x80cm. The players each have a rotating plastic gun attached to their end of the board, behind a wire goal frame. The idea is to fire ball bearings from the gun to knock your puck into your opponents goal, and keep theirs  away from yours. The board is slightly curved to cause the balls to roll into pots at each end for re-use.<br/><br/>A new version has been released by MB. The new version has more than one puck, and a smaller, rounded board. The original version came out in the 1970's and had a rectangular board and simple round pucks.<br/><br/>This game is similar to Gunfight at OK Corral.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SuDoku is the abbreviation for &quot;Suji wa dokushin ni kagiru&quot;, which means &quot;The numbers must remain individual&quot;. Long before the game came to Europe, the Japanese were racking their brains with it. Usually Sudoku is a solitaire game, but now with SuDoku: Das Brettspiel, you can play it with up to four players.<br/><br/>A SuDoku consists of 9 fields with 9 squares each. In each field and in each row, both vertically and horizontally, only the numbers from 1 to 9 may appear once. Different numbers are given before the game. Now it is up to the players to find out where which of the numbers from 1 to 9 are to be entered. It is important to achieve your goal by excluding.<br/><br/>Since the playing field is empty at the beginning, 9 numbers are initially distributed over the 9 fields. There can only be one number in each row, each column and each square. On your turn, you place a number card in an empty space, paying attention to the laying rules. Then, receive as many points as there are numbers in the square and on the vertical and horizontal line. With each number played it becomes more difficult to accommodate your own, but you also get more points the further the game has progressed. At the end of your turn you draw a new tile. The game ends when no player can add another number without breaking the rules. The player with the most points wins. Children can play on the back of the game board on 6x6 fields. You don't use numbers for this, but animal tiles. The point rule applies as with the big ones.<br/><br/>",

Also the $1-million victory reduces the odds of player elimination and multi-hour games.<br/><br/>",

Each Zingo card is double sided: Green is easy and Red is more challenging.<br/><br/>The Zingo holder dispenses two tiles. These tiles have various pictures on them such as: apples, a ball, fish, star, house, kite, tree, smile, train, cake, clock, etc. When player sees a tile that matches one on his or her Zingo card they take the tile and cover up the corresponding spaces on his/her Zingo card. Unclaimed tiles are placed back into the Zingo tile holder. If two players call the same tile, it goes to whoever called it first. The first player to cover all 9 spaces on their card shouts ZINGO and wins the game.<br/><br/>The game also comes with two variants: Mini-Zingo where the first player to match three images in a row up or down is the winner, and Zany Zingo where you select a pattern to match on your card. The first to match it wins.<br/><br/>",

Who will be the first to use up all of his ingredients, and thus become the new voodoo master?<br/><br/>In Voodoo Mania, each player starts with a hand of three cards and a reserve ingredient pile of 18-45 cards, depending on the number of players. One card starts in the center of the table. Each card is double-sided, and each side features four of five symbols on it (mask, amulet, voodoo doll, magic potion and top hat) in four of five colors.<br/><br/>All players play at the same time, trying to play their cards in hand. To play a card, the card must depict the symbol missing from the top card of the discard pile in the missing color or it must also be missing the same symbol in the same color. In the latter case, the player laying down the card says &quot;Voodoo!&quot; and all other players must draw a card from the bottom of the discard pile and place it on the bottom of their personal ingredient pile. Then all players start playing again.<br/><br/>At any time, a player can place a card from his hand on the bottom of his ingredient pile, then draw the top card of this pile. Whenever a player plays a card, he draws a replacement card to keep three cards in hand.<br/><br/>When a player runs out of cards, the round ends and everyone scores one point for each card still in hand or in the pile. After three rounds, the player with the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A shadow rises over ancient Japan. Each night, storied terrors emerge from a dark gate to ravage the countryside. As all hope seems lost, a group of heroes stand together to fight back the Oni and their endless hordes.<br/><br/>Onimaru (Japanese for &ldquo;demon circle&rdquo;) is a fully cooperative game where you and your allies take up arms to defend a village against otherworldly invaders. You will win the game if you are able to destroy the three villainous Oni. However, if you fail to do so within the predetermined number of days (rounds), the Gate will remain open forever, and all of Japan will succumb to the shadow!<br/><br/>Each round begins with a preparation phase, where new enemies will appear from the Gate, and the Heroes may develop their skills.  After that, each player will roll a set of dice and work together as a team to decide how to allocate, reroll, and sequence those dice. These dice can be used to attack your enemies directly, or combined in specific sets to execute powerful techniques. Finally, the Oni will roll its own dice to damage the Heroes, summon forth new Hordelings, and command those Hordelings in play to attack their targets.<br/><br/>Out of the box, you can choose to play the Heroes as recommended...or, through use of GameTrayz technology, you can customize and store your own unique Heroes!  Each Hero can be built with any 2 of the 16 included Techniques (and their accompanying cards), any 3 of the included 24 Skills, and any of the 8 included Talents. Out of the box, over 1.9 million different combinations are possible!<br/><br/>The enemies also feature similar modularity. In each game, you will choose one of the three Oni to face of each Circle (difficulty tier). Each Oni is not only its own board, but also adds its own unique Attack cards and Hordeling cards to their respective deck. When an Oni is defeated, those Attack and Hordeling cards remain in those decks, as it passes its abilities and dark allies along to empower the next Oni!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are three accepted variants of Baccarat: Baccarat Chemin de Fer, Baccarat Banque and Punto Banco. Typically played in Casinos, several standard decks of 52 cards are shuffled together and dealt from a communal card shoe.<br/><br/>All three variants operate on the same principle; 2 cards are dealt in alternating order to a hand designated as the Player, and a hand designated as the Banker. Typically the Player hand is played by the person who bet the most on the Player's hand to win. Depending on the variant being played, certain circumstances allow either participant to draw an extra card then the cards are totaled (2s through 9s are worth their face value while 10s and face cards are worth ten points and aces are worth one point). If the total of a hand's cards exceed 10 points, the tens digit is dropped. The hand with a total closest to 9 wins and neither hand wins in the event of a tie.<br/><br/>Punto Banco is the most common variant in North America, but requires no skill and operates solely on chance. Typically played in Casinos, the house always plays the Banker hand (although players may still bet on that hand to win). It is usually played with eight (8) decks of cards shuffled together.<br/><br/>Conversely, Baccarat Banque and Baccarat Chemin de Fer (more common in Europe) allow the players to make choices during the game so a player's skill can affect the outcome. In either of these variants a player may choose to play the Banker himself and the other players play against his 'Bank' (supply of money). In Baccarat Chemin de Fer, the Bank passes when the Banker loses a hand. In Baccarat Banque, a player may remain the Banker so long as he still has funds or until all cards in the shoe have been dealt. Baccarat Banque is typically played with 3 decks of cards while Baccarat Chemin de Fer is typically played with 6. In most cases these variants are played completely in French even in English-speaking areas.<br/><br/>Since the Banker has a slight edge over the Player in his chances of winning a hand, the house taxes all winning Banker bets when played in a casino (typically 5%).<br/><br/>",

Glory, fame, hot feet &ndash; whatever the reason, you're doing it.<br/><br/>You move ahead in the game by completing actions in six categories, possibly making up outrageous lies about yourself, freshening up with a quick shower in your host's bathroom, or acting out the words &quot;butter patty&quot;. The categories are:<br/><br/>&bull; The Volcano Has Spoken &ndash; Roll a black and you'll be subject to the whims of the volatile FURT volcano, which is sometimes angry, sort of bossy and always a bit weird.<br/><br/>&bull; Straight-Faced &ndash; Can you keep a straight face while your friends and family members assault you with funny words? You're about to find out (psst: fluffer nougat, pussy willow, burp nut) whenever you roll a red.<br/><br/>&bull; Guess What? &ndash; The volcano is chock full of funny words and you may find yourself acting out the phrase &quot;butter patty&quot; or drawing an invisible jet to get your friends to guess your word when you roll a green.<br/><br/>&bull; Truth or Fiction? &ndash; Roll a purple and you reveal something about yourself. Is it truth or fiction? Only you know. The more people you fool, the more you move ahead!<br/><br/>&bull; You Are... &ndash; Not yourself when you roll a yellow. Maybe you are having an identity crisis, who knows? Just be who the card says for thirty seconds and you can move ahead.<br/><br/>&bull; What The?! &ndash; When you roll a blue, you'll get a TOP SECRET card that you must perform before your next turn. It could be annoying, outlandish, confusing, obnoxious or just plain freakish. You have been warned.<br/><br/>",

Except toward the end of the game, players have a hand of five tiles from which to choose, but they are constrained by the building regulations and the luck of the draw. There are also four tiles that can cause fires and one extra-heavy &quot;wild&quot; tile: these can be harder to place without causing extensive damage the later they emerge.

        "description": "Mr. Game! is a family-friendly party board game where one player has the power to create permanent rules during the game.<br/><br/>MECHANICS: Players use a simple roll-and-move system to navigate the board - roll two four-sided dice, choose one of the options, and move. If you land on a space with an ! on it, you draw a card from the game's singular tall stack of chaotic cards. The ultimate goal of the game is to land on the goal, but the goal can change places during the middle of the game if a special GOAL SWITCH Action card is drawn.<br/><br/>CARDS: There are three kinds of cards in Mr. Game! - Actions, Powerups, and Badges. If you draw an Action, you must play it immediately and discard it. If you draw a Powerup, you must play it immediately, but it stays in play and affects your character's natural abilities (sometimes positively, sometimes negatively). If you draw a Badge, you may play it whenever you want, and you are allowed to keep it concealed.<br/><br/>TILES: Many cards will bring Tiles into play. These small chipboard squares are essentially movable spaces that can be placed anywhere on the board. They change the layout of the board as soon as the enter play, adding spaces, removing spaces, or transfiguring spaces to have ridiculous, game-altering effects! They can be as simple as another ! space, or they can be as crazy as a Portal that transports you across the board!<br/><br/>MR. GAME: Before the game begins, someone must volunteer to be Mr. Game. (They can change their title, but the default is Mr. Game) Players must direct all questions to Mr. Game. This character is in charge of adding permanent rules to the game if the need arises. The game is purposely designed so that the core rules allow you to play but leave out specific details. Mr. Game's job is to fill in these details as the game goes on. The more creative Mr. Game is, the more fun everyone has! Other players at the table are encouraged to suggest ideas, but Mr. Game has the final say. If you don't like how they are &quot;Mr. Game-ing&quot;, or they break one of the core tenets of being Mr. Game, just impeach them!<br/><br/>Mr. Game! is designed to be simple to learn. If you just read this entire description, you already know how to play! Oh, and if you have a question... well, ask Mr. Game!<br/><br/>",

Each part has a number from 1-6 and the roll of a die decides which kind of body part you can take from the pool. The goal is then to complete as many clowns as possible.<br/><br/>Jumbolino is representative of a whole class of children's games where players roll a die and add a puzzle piece to their board for the number on the die roll. Similar to Cootie, except that Cootie requires you to get multiples of some numbers (6 ea. of 6 for the legs, and 2 ea. of 4 and 3 for eyes and antennae).<br/><br/>It's also similar to The Merry Game of Floundering, with some differences. In The Merry Game of Floundering:<br/>1. The Flounders have to be assembled in order. Body part 1 first, two next and so on.<br/>2. All the Flounders are put in the middle at the start.<br/>3. Flounders are not owned by players, they remain in the center even if fully assembled.<br/>4. Two dice are thrown for assembly. A player may use either number rolled to add a Flounder part. If both numbers relate to started Flounders, then both numbers can be used.<br/>5. A double thrown grants an extra turn.<br/>6. When a 6 and a 1 are thrown, the player may take a complete Flounder from the center and if there are none in the center that player may take a complete Flounder from another player.<br/>7. When all the Flounders are complete and owned, the player with the most wins. If they are tied, they throw the dice to decide the winner.<br/><br/>Similar to Safari Builders, but Safari Builders is listed as 1-4 players.<br/><br/>",

Which staircases you can move up and how much you can move are determined by rolling 8 dice and combining them into pairs.  When one of a player's men reaches the top of a staircase, he gets treasure as well as the option of challenging the Polterdice (ghosts of the former inhabitants of the mansion whom you must &quot;capture&quot; for additional treasure) for more money.  If he loses the challenge, it goes to the next player on the staircase and so-on until someone wins or everyone loses.  The key mechanic is deciding how to &quot;spend&quot; your dice rolls on which men in which part of the mansion.<br/><br/>The designers note that the game is inspired by Can't Stop, and is therefore dedicated to Sid Sackson (who died during the production of the title).<br/><br/>",

This champion must have a strong will, strength, magic, intelligence, persuasive abilities and is proven to be a survivor. Thus the Queens banished all Heroes and Villains into a fierce competition to see who will survive the Fairytale Games. There will be only one.<br/><br/>Fairytale Games: The Battle Royale is a 1-10 player dice-based board game that uses cards as the board (for land exploration). Movement is with a 6-sided die. When you begin the game, you and other players start at the same location and begin revealing locations/terrain as you roll your die. Some locations offer opportunities to start quests to gain survival items or allow you to explore more lands and gain better abilities. All the while Events are happening that might help or hinder you greatly. There are 30+ character cards that you can play as or fight against in this game. Other cards include Action Cards, Event Cards, Location Cards, Quest Cards and Item Cards. A normal game duration is about 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to kill off at least ten fairytale characters in the game in addition to your opponent before they can do the same to you. If playing a one-player game, you must kill twenty characters. The other way you can win is if you complete certain Quest challenges as a team to escape the realm or to take the entire place down with you by finding the slim opportunities through certain card scenarios to defeat the three Queens.<br/><br/>Although Action Cards allow you to strategically attack, defend, hinder, or help another player, your character cards themselves have their own special abilities that can be used during certain situations through dice rolling or if they are activated by Quests, Events or other Action Cards.<br/><br/>",

It takes a desire for loot, hordes of your minions willing to be led to certain death (err, victory), cunning strategy, and a touch of treachery. The first player whose Dark Force unit enters the keep, by the end of turn eight, is truly the mightiest champion and claims total victory for his army.<br/><br/>The Story So Far - The Invasion Begins!<br/><br/>Castle StormHaven is guarded vigilantly by brave defenders comprised of an alliance between Men, Elves, Halflings, and Dwarves. For over 300 years, these defenders have repelled numerous invasions from the Badlands, home to the subterranean Dark Elf marauders and the mysterious sect of arcane bending wizards, the Arcanists. StormHaven is the first and last line of defense from keeping the fertile farmlands and gold mines of Western Holmenstein from being overrun.<br/><br/>Years ago, a mysterious masked and exceptionally short villain appeared with the goal of uniting the Badlands and ruling over Holmenstein. Dubbed &quot;the Boss&quot; by his cohorts, he promised gold and power to those who would follow him. First the Dark Elves, then the Arcanists joined his Dark Forces. Soon after, the Orc pirate raiders joined the growing army and brought with them their crazed goblin allies and monstrous cousins, the giants. Knowing The Boss' army needed further strength to overwhelm Castle StormHaven's defenses, he revealed the last piece of strategy for domination, the Undead Horde of the BlackSoot Swamps.<br/><br/>Now the four dark force armies &ndash; Dark Elves, Arcanists, Orc and Goblins of the Green Tide, and the innumerable Undead host &ndash; begin their long march east.<br/><br/>Dark Force Army Overview<br/><br/>Choosing your army is part of the fun of Storm the Castle! Each Dark Force army has unique units, power cards, combos and strategies. Is one better than the other - no! It&rsquo;s how you use your strengths while minimizing your weakness. Each army has a fair opportunity to win.<br/><br/>The Green Tide: Orcs, goblins, giants, and other humanoids make up this loose tribal alliance. Specializing in brute force and strange Eastern technology, players who enjoy large explosions, brute strength, and dangerous yet untested weapons will enjoy smashing their way to victory with this army.<br/><br/>Pros: Hard hitting units with lots of equipment upgrades. Power cards primarily focused on attacking and smashing. The rock lobber is one of the most effective siege weapons in the game. Goblin sappas provide for cheap, hard hitting units.<br/>Cons: Moderately expensive units. Lack of diversity in their power cards utility. Equipment can be deadly for both you and foe!<br/><br/>The Arcanists: Mixing metal with magic produces stunning results. These masters of the forbidden arcane arts use their talents to manipulate the minds and outcomes of events of their allies and enemies. Players who enjoy using tactics that harness deadly magics and powers to manipulate events will surely enjoy the awesome power of the Arcanists.<br/><br/>Pros: Incredible power cards that can shift game elements to your favor. Several long range spells and abilities to generate quick magic. <br/>Cons: Many of your units have low health and are easily destroyed.<br/><br/>The Undead Horde: The walking dead from the Blacksoot Swamps know of one thing - how to feed! Their power derives from their ever increasing numbers and ability to sustain damage while pressing forward. Players looking to overwhelm the Fantasy Defenders with hordes of undead while using dark magic will find great pleasure in fielding this army.<br/><br/>Pros: Your units cause fear and can take quite a bit of damage.  Inexpensive units allow you to swarm and overrun the Fantasy Defender&rsquo;s defenses. <br/>Cons: Though your units are many, they don&rsquo;t hit hard. Magic can be hard to build up as its dependent upon how many undead units you have in play.<br/><br/>The Dark Elves: From the deep recesses of forgotten lands nestled deep within the earth come the masters of marauding, the Dark Elves. Known for their exceptional arts in battlefield tactics and archery, no foe is safe from the tips of their arrows to the teeth of their treachery. Players who revel in treachery, backstabbing and shooting should choose the Dark Elves.<br/><br/>Pros:  Awesome ranged attacks and power cards to support them. Treacherous power cards give you a unique competitive edge against other players.<br/>Cons: Squishy units means you&rsquo;ve got to know when to fight and when to move in. Players may give you strange &ldquo;can I trust you&rdquo; looks. Lack of strong melee units.<br/><br/>",

Properties are now only bought in the bank and not on landing on the square.<br/><br/>2) Stocks<br/>Stocks can be bought in one of the 7 sets of properties and gives you money by dividend paid from the bank and dividend paid from the owner of properties.<br/><br/>3) Car<br/>In Finans you have the opportunity to buy (and later sell if you are short on cash) a car which gives you two dices to roll instead of just one. Having a car makes jumps over the expensive properties more easy. You still only use one die inside the Bank.<br/><br/>4) Bonds<br/>Bonds can be bought in the Bank by all players if a player land on one of the two bond squares. Each bond has a number from 2 to 12 and pays out if the number is rolled using two dices.<br/><br/>The 1998-variant from Brio is a revised version of &quot;Finans&quot; by Anders Jeppson and Per Leveaux originally designed by &quot;Martin Marte&quot;. &quot;Finans&quot; means &quot;Finance&quot; but is different from Parker Brothers version from 1933.<br/><br/>So far I have only seen this game sold in Scandinavia (Denmark, Sweden, Finland &amp; Norway).<br/><br/>",

If they land on a therapy praxis, they have to answer not-too-intimate therapy-questions about themselves instead. For these therapy-questions, the other players have to guess the answer, either alone (therapy in their praxis) or in consensus with the other players (group therapy). Through these therapy questions, most games will result in surprising revelations; you will get to know your friends/ game buddies/ ... a bit better.<br/><br/>As in Trivial Pursuit and The Game of Life, Therapy is a race to collect six pieces (one for each of the six phases of life). Pieces are not only granted for correctly answering questions, but also for guessing what your fellow players answer while they are in therapy.  Depending on the version, you will play with different unusual playing pieces (e.g. tiny psychiatry couches and brain lobes).<br/><br/>Recommended for Ages 16 and up<br/><br/>",

The first one to pillage all of the villages and take the daughters of their thanes to his home port as warranty of recognition of jarls authority will be declared the winner. To do this, the jarls will have to brave the stormy northern seas, battling each other along the way, and watch out for the sea monster that lurks beneath the waves! The most cunning and vehement of them all &ndash; that is, the one who the Gods favor &ndash; will throw a great feast and become the Konung of the North.<br/><br/>Vikings: Warriors of the North is a card-based game. Players draw cards from a common deck. Wind cards are used for moving a drakkar around the board that depicts the cold north sea. Players can move the drakkar to a village (to sack it), to an enemy drakkar (to attack it), or to their own ports, where they can throw a feast for the Gods.<br/><br/>A player can also use cards to drastically change the gameplay: He can increase his chances in an attack, re-roll the dice, sail further with his drakkar, or steal cards from an enemy's hand. All of those cards represent story events that have tangible effects within the game. Some cards represent heroes who can become part of a drakkar's crew. As long as a hero stays on the ship, he grants his owner a permanent effect. Each drakkar has three open slots for heroes. Daughters of the thanes are also considered heroes, so they also occupy drakkar slots. With only three slots, players have to think hard about their crew composition.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can play any number of cards from his hand and take one action: attack, sack a village, throw a feast, etc. Attacks are resolved by a roll of a six-sided (d6) die, although many cards influence the combat result, so each battle is exciting.<br/><br/>When a player take three daughters of the thanes (each of a different, opposing player color) and brings them to his own port, the game is over and that player wins. The gameplay is fast, furious and fun, full of twists and comebacks; it really lets you feel like a Viking chieftain!<br/><br/>",

Players then race to play a word from their hands to fulfil the Dash card, or skip the turn to discard cards and draw new ones.<br/><br/>The Dash cards include criteria such as number of letters (ranging from 2 to 4), specific parts of speech (verb/proper noun), or specifying that the word has to start, end with, or contain a particular letter, drawn at random from either the vowel or consonant deck (players do not need to play their own copy of this letter from their hand).<br/><br/>The first player to lay down a valid word claims the Dash card, and the first player to collect 5 Dash cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

They are:  1) Yacht has no Three of a Kind category, 2) there are no bonuses in Yacht, 3) there are no Joker rules in Yacht, and 4) the Full House category is scored as the sum of the dice.  The other scoring rules are identical between the two games.<br/><br/>Travel versions of the game use a device that keeps the dice captured within compartments of a plastic box and allows players to &quot;lock&quot; a particular die between rolls.<br/><br/>",

The world as we knew it has gone. Those that survived are split into various &lsquo;factions&rsquo; (or proto-nations). Each player assumes the role of a &lsquo;government&rsquo; leader charged with building his/her &lsquo;country&rsquo; by developing existing resources and assets; whilst expending production in the form of consumption and government cash on infrastructure.<br/><br/>As much as each nation will want to trade with each other, there remains the probability that political and economical control of land and resources (zones) become ever more critical. Progress is measured in terms of social development levels and the emergence of new cities. The higher the Development Level the higher the value of each zone and thus victory points, but watch out for the 'catastrophes'.<br/><br/>New Earth is a strategy game for 2-4 players with elegant game mechanics combining worker placement with innovative hand management and modular tile design that provides endless game scenarios. Game length is 12 turns and lasts around 60-90 minutes, though players can agree on an extended time-frame. For ages 12 &amp; up.<br/><br/>",

Components: 300 plastic markers, 150 tokens, 8 ships made of metal with 2 masts, 55 cards (3rd edition only), 3 six-sided special dice, 1 rules booklet.<br/><br/>Between the second and third edition, the theme of the game changed. The first and second have a theme of four nations exploring and colonizing new land, while the third edition has a pirate theme. The third edition also adds 55 action cards, resulting in more chaos and - possibly - less strategy (at least that's what is suggested in the rules).<br/><br/>The board shows an island group composed of five smaller island groups separated by ocean. There is a large island group in the middle and four smaller ones in the corners. The four smaller island groups are the homelands of the four nations in editions 1 and 2 and the pirate bases in edition 3. Nations / pirates set out to explore and conquer the big island group in the middle (or each others' homelands).<br/><br/>Every round, each nation / pirate group has 10 action points. With these you can accomplish various actions: move, load ships, explore unknown areas, attack your opponents, etc. Most important action is probably exploration, in which you roll two special dice which determine how many natives and how much gold there is in a neighboring, unexplored land. You'll have to fight the natives to conquer that land and get the gold. The gold itself you use to muster new armies / pirates. Conquest ultimately decides the winner.<br/><br/>In the 3rd edition, you can use special cards to optimize your course or counter the actions of opponents. Thus you have a large freedom of movement, unfortunately your opponents do also.<br/><br/>A winner of the 1986 Concours International de Créateurs de Jeux de Société.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players in turn roll the 21 word cubes, set the timer and form sentences with the words appearing on the tops of the cubes in a crossword puzzle-like fashion (one word may be part of two sentences - one running vertically and one running horizontally). Turns end when the egg timer runs out. Players score 50 points for each sentence of 7 words or more. All other sentences score the square of the number of words in the sentence (i.e. a 4-word sentence scores 4 X 4, or 16 points). A bonus of 50 points is awarded if all 21 cubes are used. Two points are deducted for each unused cube.<br/><br/>The 1983 version of the game seems to differ in the number of cubes.  The rules on the inside of the box lid still have a 1971 copyright date, but among other differences, they state that the game contains 27 cubes.  Two of the new cubes are marked with stars on all six sides, making them wild.  From the 1983 rules: &quot;When playing a wild cube, a player must state what word it represents, after which it cannot be changed during that turn.&quot;<br/><br/>The 1988 version has 24 cubes - two of which are the starred wild dice. The box states that this is the 2nd edition of the game from Coleco Games. Selchow &amp; Righter is credited in the directions as a subsidiary of Coleco Industries, Inc. The majority of the outer box is blue.<br/><br/>",

This is the tile just before the first pad of the map.<br/><br/>Each Turn<br/><br/>Each then you roll a die; this determines the maximum spaces you can move in any direction. The first player may re-roll on the first turn.<br/><br/>You then pick a pad to land on. There are 4 types of pads:<br/><br/>Green Pads: Land here safely<br/>Yellow Pads: When land, flip a frog coin; if it lands on heads, you lose a life. <br/>Red Pads: Lose a life when you land here. <br/>Dark Green: Like green pads, but you cannot dunk a player who is on them. These pads usually have flies, as shown above.<br/><br/>When you land on a pad, you automatically gain the number of flies indicated. It is now in your possession. The flies are then removed from the lilypad and cannot be gained by another player.<br/><br/>You can also land on a pad another player is already on. When this occurs, you may attempt to dunk them.<br/><br/>Dunking<br/>When you land on the same pad as an existing player, you can choose whether to try to dunk them. If you want to, roll the frog dice. If it's an even number, you can move that far, and they lose a life. If it's odd, you may not move. However, if it's a 1, you lose a life.<br/>If you die holding flies, they FLY back to the location they come from and can once again be claimed by another player. <br/>Notes:<br/>You must roll for the pad first when attempting a dunk on yellow/red. You may leapfrog even if you lose a life, provided you have not been eliminated.<br/>When there are 2 or more people on a pad, you dunk them all!<br/><br/>Lives<br/><br/>Each player starts with 5 lives. Upon running out of lives, a player is eliminated and loses the game without any further actions possible.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Collect flies, and return them to the start point. The winner is the (living) player with the most flies at the end. Once you've returned, you cannot go out again.<br/><br/>Optional Rules<br/><br/>An optional rule is Fly Stealing. When this rule is chosen, a player steals a fly from any opponent they successfully dunk.<br/><br/>",

Peasants from nearby villages collect amber, which is bought by merchants from distant lands. The barons know that the one who profits the most from the amber trade will become the most powerful ruler of the new lands.<br/><br/>In Amber, players take the role of the barons, and their goal is to build trade routes that connect their castles to the villages where the amber is collected, and to the other barons' castles where it is traded. To this end, players build roads through the wilderness &ndash; placing one tile each turn in the shared playing area &ndash; which will allow their buyers to reach the sources of the amber. Since all buyers can use the roads, however, it's important to have suitable connections with the road networks built by others. The baron whose castle is connected with the greatest number of villages and castles will become the richest and most respected Lord of the new land.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box<br/><br/>Bureaucracy is a somewhat less complicated version of The Great Chain of Being, a medieval, theological, parlor game, first uncovered in a small church in Urbino during the renovation of an ancient, holy, but clearly inadequate, sewage system.  Both the Church and the monastic Parkover Brothels deny the authenticity of the game.  As one official noted, &quot;that's a crock&quot;.<br/><br/>Bureaucracy is designed to simulate the bureaucratic behavior which constitutes so much of what we call government.  It is convoluted, Byzantine, and entertaining.  It is also cost effective, feasible, and administratively impossible.  In its early stages, Bureaucracy required a fifteen story parlor, a six acre gameboard, 200,000 pieces, and a 15,000 page rulebook.  Of course, this prototype was unwieldy.  Consequently, we were forced to simplify the game.  The present version is good for two to eight players.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game at the lowest organizational level.  The winner is the player who rises up through the masses to become the Director of the Bureaucracy.<br/><br/>Players may select one of four lifestyles, each with its own advantages and disadvantages: lifer, over achiever, empire builder, or hustler.  To be promoted from level to level, a player will need the required number of promotional prerequisites and that's where the fun comes in.  All sorts of things can happen.  Players may be demoted.  They may be involved in scandals.  They may become involved in power plays.  They may have to go before a Grievance Committee.  A player may even go bankrupt and have to start all over from the bottom again.  There is no one sure formula for success.  Players will have to stay out of trouble and use all their cunning to succeed.<br/><br/>This is a game that makes being a part of the bureaucracy fun  It will make you laugh at government and yourself at the same time.    For civil servants, it's required recreation.  For just you and me, it's a must.  Don't be surprised though, when you open the box and hear the call of the jungle.  It's a wild game.<br/><br/>Game includes a 22 x 24 gameboard, 2 dice, 240 promotional prerequisite pieces, 20 power play pieces, 64 player tokens, a pack of money, 80 lifestyle cards, 20 memo cards, 20 consumer goods cards, 8 bucks, 1 power file, and two rulebooks (one to explain what it says in the simple game rules)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Generally, the game of Nim is a two-player game of perfect information in which there are some number of rows or &quot;heaps&quot; of objects, and a legal move consists of removing any number of objects from a single heap. (For a non-trivial game, we should start with at least three heaps.) In &quot;standard play&quot;, the player who cannot make a move on his turn (because no objects remain) is the loser. A very general and far-reaching theory of such games is developed in Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy's Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays.<br/><br/>In the commercial version pictured, the players take turns removing 1, 2, 3, or 4 pegs together in a row. It would appear from the picture that &quot;rows&quot; can run in any direction, which means that the &quot;heaps&quot; intersect. This is not what most people know as Nim. Also, according to the original description, in this version the loser is the player who has to remove the last peg. This is so-called &quot;misere play&quot;, rather than the standard winning condition. Many combinatorial games allow mis&egrave;re play as a variation.<br/><br/>Nim is solved, which means that from any initial configuration, one can readily determine whether the next player or the previous player has a winning strategy, and identify a good next move in the former case. For Nim, this can be determined surprisingly readily no matter the size of the heaps, but you're not going to get the secret from me.<br/><br/>As most who would be interested in Nim know the solution, there isn't much of a game here. But Nim plays a central role in the theory of combinatorial games, as any two-player finite impartial game is in some sense Nim in disguise: any position in such a game corresponds to a unique Nim-heap, and one can play the disguised game perfectly by making the moves that correspond to winning moves in Nim. Sprouts is one example. This however does not mean that Sprouts itself is solved, as the &quot;disguise&quot; is only partially revealed.<br/><br/>",

Each game of Wyvern is a struggle for domination of the tabletop Battlefield; your objective is to completely clear your opponent's Battlefield of Dragon and Terrain cards. To accomplish this, you will use your Dragons to attack cards in the enemy's Battlefield. However, your Dragons will not fight for you free of charge. Dragons love gold, so in Wyvern you must pay your Dragons to fight. You start with a bankroll of 25 gold pieces, and you are trying to clear your opponent's Battlefield while spending as little of your gold as possible.<br/><br/>Wyvern, one of the first CCG's after Magic, is played with two decks.  One deck holds your dragons and terrain cards.  The other deck has your treasure cards and action cards.<br/><br/>To set up the game you take the top six cards from your dragon deck and lay them face down in two rows of three cards.  Your front three dragons can fight the opponents front three dragons so you do have to be careful how you place.  Flying dragons can fight over one row.  Each player gets 25 gold (any markers you supply) and draws seven cards from their action deck.  On your turn...<br/><br/><br/>     You draw a card from your action deck.<br/>     Place a treasure or replace a treasure.  You may have up to two treasures per row.<br/>     You may change the position of one or two cards in your grid.<br/>     All players may play action cards one at a time around the table until everyone has played as many as they want.<br/>     You must choose one dragon to attack or replace a dragon or terrain card in your grid with the top card from your dragon deck face down.  A dragon can attack a face up card or a face down card hoping he can beat it.  Dragon numbers are compared and the strongest wins.  A losing dragon or terrain is not replaced and you lose by losing all six positions.<br/>     A second action phase now ensues.<br/>     You must discard down to seven cards.<br/><br/><br/>See also Dragon Hunt<br/><br/>",

Players roll a die to initiate the zombie threat, represented by horde tokens of strengths 1 through 4 placed in zones around the board. Special &quot;grey zones&quot; represent lack of intel by featuring face-down tokens with zombie hordes of unknown strengths. Throughout the game, players travel to different zones and battle the zombie hordes in those locations by rolling dice and adding effects of Combat Cards.<br/><br/>The game features a die-based combat system. Humans always roll a six-sided die, while the hordes are represented by either a six-, eight-, ten-, or twelve-sided die depending on their strength. Humans may modify their role or add additional effects by playing Combat Cards, which consist of reusable Weapons (including Lobos, slang for &quot;Lobotomizers&quot;) and one-shot Tactics (like Booby Traps or Redeployment). Every time a human wins a battle, the zombie horde strength decreases by one level, while victories for zombies cause players to discard Combat Cards. At the end of each turn, humans draw a Threat Escalation card to reveal how the zombie threat has grown.<br/><br/>Though players start the game working together against the zombies, when a player loses all his Combat cards, he becomes one of the undead. Player-zombies can manipulate the hordes on the board to attack other humans and to escalate the zombie threat.<br/><br/>The game ends after a predetermined number of rounds based on the number of players (six rounds for four players, seven for three, and eight for two). At the end of the game, if more than ten total zombie hordes of strength 3 or 4 still remain on the map, the humans lose (and any zombie players win). If ten or fewer such hordes remain, the humans collectively win.<br/><br/>",

Players control dwarves mining mithril and gems on a randomly assembled tile-based board. After each player's turn, he or she rolls a die and chooses a tile with that number on it at one end of the board for Magdar to destroy. Any dwarves on the destroyed tile are sent back to the cavern entrance and lose anything they were mining at the time. The game ends when one row of tiles has been completely destroyed. Scoring is based upon having a good mix of mithril and gems. Other elements such as claim jumping are added in the advanced version of the game.<br/><br/>",

Players start as 2-6 campers along the Bear River and must navigate the wilderness, avoiding bears and trying to not get lost.<br/><br/>The map of trails and challenges is built by the players as they explore the wilderness. These wilderness cards feature beautifully illustrated realistic art and have between three and six exit points along with a variety of features, both man-made and natural in origin. No two games will ever play the same.<br/><br/>Gameplay is structured around a clever movement mechanism in which the first player moves one card, the second player moves up to two cards, the third player three, and so on. Each of the six player characters has both advantages and disadvantages that can be used across a variety of play options &mdash; short or long play, regular or advanced.<br/><br/>Dive into caves, row canoes, cross bridges, climb mountains, and cut through treacherous underbrush as you stop at nothing &mdash; except bears &mdash; to be the first to reach base camp. Can you survive and escape Bear Valley?<br/><br/>",

After laying a second card in the round, a player has the option of securing a row at the end of each turn. To secure a row, the player must not have the lowest total in that color when compared to the other players; the player secures a row by turning the last card in that row 90&ordm;. A player can secure only one row each turn.<br/><br/>If a player exceeds a total of 15 points in a row, that row is now blocked and worth 0 points; the player turns those cards face-down.<br/><br/>If a player draws a colored card for a row either secured or blocked, she must discard the card. The next player in turn order has the option of taking this discarded card instead of drawing randomly from the deck.<br/><br/>Once the fourth row of any player is secured or blocked, the round ends immediately. Whoever has the fewest points in a color (with blocked rows worth 0 points) scores nothing for this color; all other players score points equal to the numbers showing in this color in their row. Players then empty their rows and continue playing with the cards remaining in the deck. After five complete rounds, the player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "飛行棋 (fēi x&iacute;ng q&iacute;) - Aviation Game or Flight - is a simple Chinese board game. The object is to get all your plane pieces into the base of your color in the center of the map.<br/><br/>Each player has 4 planes in their starting base. Each turn you roll the die and move one plane of your color on the board.  To get your planes out of your base and onto the board you must roll a 6.  You get an extra turn whenever you roll a 6. If your plane happens to end up on top of another person's plane, that person's plane must go back to their base until he or she rolls a 6 again to get it out onto the board.<br/><br/>On the board there are colored spaces that coincide with each player. If you land on your own color, you can immediately jump to the next block of your color.  There are also certain colored squares that offer shortcuts across the board.  You may only use the shortcuts that coincide with your color.  If you land on a colored square and subsequently jump to a shortcut square, you may also take the shortcut (essentially jumping twice in one turn).  If you ever land on your own piece, you may &quot;stack&quot; the pieces and move them as one piece until they reach the center or are landed on by an opponent and sent back as individuals.<br/><br/>The first player to get all of their planes to the center of the board wins, and the rest play until there is only 1 loser. To land in the center of the board, you must roll the exact amount of spaces.<br/><br/>It is very similar to Pachisi and especially Aggravation. There is no indication of a specific designer or publisher as the game is a classic from China, so it is now probably a public domain game. As is the case for Go, there are different packages for it with different colored/designed pieces<br/><br/>",

It is the same game as played by the characters on the show and as such does not require any knowledge of the TV series itself.<br/><br/>The players split into two teams - intended to be girls and boys, but this only matters for the bonus questions. Each team takes it in turns to answer yes/no questions about the opposite team in one of four categories:  &quot;Fears and Pet Peeves&quot;, &quot;Ancient History&quot;, &quot;Literature&quot; and &quot;It's all Relative&quot;. This is done by submitting Yes/No cards face down for simultaneous reveal with the correct answer(s) from the other team. Some questions are about one member of the opposite team - in which case all members of the answering team submit a guess - and some questions are of the style &quot;Which of us...?&quot;, in which case the answering team collaborates for a yes/no answer for each member of the opposite team. The goal is to answer the most questions correctly about the other team and have the highest points total at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There is also a bonus round - and here the gender divide does matter, because the game is designed so that the boys are asking the girls questions that are supposedly hard for the girls to answer but that the boys themselves should easily know the answer to, and vice versa (no answers are provided for the bonus questions). The bonus round is timed and each team answers as many questions correctly as they can within the time limit.<br/><br/>",

There are two red circles on each die.<br/><br/>Players (from 2-6) begin with two dice, and two red chips.

(&quot;Simply Ingenious: Whoever Risks Too Much Loses!&quot;) is a tile game related to the Ingenious board game in that players are once again collecting as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also needing to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well.<br/><br/>To start the game, mix all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) face down, then turn three face up and place them in a shared pool in the center of the table. On a turn, a player flips a tile face up. If the tile doesn't match one of those in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can either end his turn and collect the face-up tiles before him and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn.<br/><br/>If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. (With four players, the goal is five tiles.) Any tiles of a color you collect over seven are shuffled back into the supply.<br/><br/>If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool. If the pool ever has fewer than three face-up tiles, reveal tiles and add them to the pool until three tiles are available.<br/><br/>Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert! was later released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.<br/><br/>",

Do what the birds tell you to do and score bigger!<br/><br/>The Bird Told Me To Do It is a point scoring game in which each player adds to a twisting forking tree branch from his hand of cards.  Each card shows a number of birds of a certain color.  A player can collect a plumage card of a color by adding birds to the branch in that color.  When a branch is finished the color showing the most birds scores points for the player owning that color plumage.<br/><br/>Each card also shows an instruction being given by a bird on the card.  When a player adds a card to the branch, he performs all instructions given on all cards on the branch from the trunk of the tree all the way out to the card he placed. These instructions can be to draw cards, collect plumage, score cards, add more cards to the branch, remove cards from the branch, or boost the effect of a future card.<br/><br/>Cards in the same color on the branch also boost each other's instructions. Chain lots of cards on a branch for crazy turns!  Twist and loop the branch to keep other players from copying your moves!<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to have more Genetic Markers than your opponents when the last DNA Strand is revealed.<br/><br/>To do so, you will have to make the best use of your Characters and Abilities as you draw them from the main deck (all players draw from the same deck). Game play is also randomly affected by Event cards that can completely change who is winning or losing. The core game includes hand manipulation, resource management (your Characters and Abilities), bluffing, and blind luck (dice and Event cards) which make each game interesting and unique.<br/><br/>Genegrafter is currently available only on Kickstarter and will offer customization and additional expansions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BASIC DESCRIPTION:<br/>The UNO Dice Game attempts to translate the original UNO card game into a two player dice game.  It was released during the 2011 Christmas season and displayed along with other Mattel dice games in the same type of soda can tin packaging.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>The game includes 11 dice.  Each die is unique and has some combination of faces in the four UNO colors (yellow, green, blue and red).  The die faces include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, draw one, draw two, and wild (in black).  Note that there are no die faces that represent the Skip or Reverse cards from the original UNO card game (presumably because this is just a 2 player game).<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>The game mechanic is simple and mimics the original UNO card game.  To begin, 5 dice are randomly given to each of the two players.  These dice take the place of a players hand of cards in the original UNO card game.  The 11th die is left in the middle of the play area to form the start of the dice line (think UNO discard stack from the original card game).  The starting player rolls their dice and has to match either the color or value of the most recently placed die in the dice line.  That player's matching die is placed in the dice line and will have to be matched by the next player.  Play continues as players take turns rolling their hand of dice and adding one matching die from their hand to the dice line each turn until they only have one die left in their hand.  The player must then say &quot;UNO!&quot; or be penalized.  The penalty for not remembering to say &quot;UNO!&quot; is similar to the draw one and draw two die faces:  the affected player must take the appropriate number of dice from the end of the dice line.  The first player with no dice left wins.  The winning player's score is based on the faces of the dice left in front of their opponent.  Alternate rules are provided to ignore scoring and simply play the best out of 3 games.<br/><br/>PACKAGING:<br/>This edition was packaged in a creative looking tin that was made to resemble an aluminum soda can--complete with Nutrition Facts label.  The top of the can pops off (twist to open).  The one sheet of rules and 11 dice fit inside the tin with a cardboard insert to help dampen the sound of the dice in the tin.  The tin also has a coin slot in the top that holds the a plastic hook to allow it to be hung for selling/display purposes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Herd is a two player game played with two standard, six sided dice and unlimited red and blue stones on a hexagonal grid of any size, initially empty. The two players, Red and Blue, take turns placing their own stones on the board, one or more stones per turn. Red goes first. Players are not allowed to pass. Mark Steere designed Herd in August, 2022.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>ON YOUR TURN<br/><br/>     Roll the dice.<br/>     Remove enemy stones in the quantity indicated by the lower die value.<br/>     Place your stones on any unoccupied cells (except where prohibited as described below) in the quantity indicated by the higher die value.<br/>     If you completely surround an enemy singleton (enemy group of size 1) - that is, every one of its adjacent cells is occupied by one of your stones - you must immediately remove it.<br/>     For each enemy stone you surround and capture, you must add an additional stone of your color, which could then capture more enemy stones and require you to add yet more of your stones during your turn.<br/>     Prohibited placement: You may not place a stone on a cell completely surrounded by enemy stones - that is, a cell whose every adjacent cell is occupied by an enemy stone. If at any time during your turn, the only unoccupied cells are such self-capturing placements, your turn is concluded.<br/><br/><br/>BALANCING RULE<br/>Red, on his first turn, places the number of stones indicated by the LOWER die value.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends when the board is completely filled. Who has the most stones on the board wins.<br/><br/>",

Players represent the Chief Operations and Marketing Officers of major American airlines, whose job is to fly the most passengers over a given period of time.<br/><br/>There are two basic games in Airlines: the One-Year Quick Game which takes about 45 minutes to play and the Three-Year Game, which takes about two hours to play. The currency of the game is seats, seats are used to pay for everything. The game is card-based, with a small map to show distances between Major and Regional Airports. The cards consist of Major Airports, Regional Airports, various Aircrafts, airline Hubs (your airline), Gates, and varied Opportunity/Events cards. The Ops/Events cards may denote bad weather in a region (thus reducing number of seats for that round), strikes (which can played on another airline), Fuel Price Adjustments (which effect your maintenance fees paid with Seats), and even an Aircraft Incident card (which people outside the industry call &quot;crashes.&quot;)<br/><br/>Airlines can be combined with the stand-alone game Airlines: United States Set 2.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FROM the SESSION REPORT:<br/><br/>Each player is competing to pull off the most lucrative scams. You do this by spamming mailing lists. The more closely related the mailing list is to the type of scam you're trying to pull, the easier it is to score.<br/><br/>Scams come in 4 types - sex, internet, money and free stuff. The text and art flavor are quite wonderful. Of course the sex scams appeal the most - highlights were the Virtual Jellorama, Walter's Wankery and Disgusting Dog Tricks. If you're geeky, some of the internet scams are witty. All the standard 'make money doing nothing' and free stuff scams are there as well.<br/><br/>You play scam cards in front of you (up to 5) and then play mail-out cards (spams) trying to lure people in. There are a number of mailing lists of various sizes in the middle for anyone to mail to, plus each player has some private mailing lists that only they can spam. The action is to play a 'mail' card, nominating both a scam and the list that you're mailing the scam offer to. If you roll a d6 less &lt;= the size of the list, you succeed, and that scam scores a point. If you roll way under (4 or more), your scam scores 2 points. Some lists specialize in one of the 4 scam types ... if your scam and the list matches, you get a modifier of +2 making it easier to score, plus the mail-out cards have modifiers between 0 and +5.<br/><br/>Simple so far, but every time a mailing list gets spammed, it decreases in size by 1 (1 million thematically which equals 1 on the die) - these are subscribers getting disgruntled by the amount of spam they're receiving who leave the list.<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to get 20 points across all their scams, or who gets a single scam of 12 points BUT it's only checked at the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>A turn consists of 3 actions surrounding 2 decks - list cards and action cards. An action is pick up a card, play a card or merge 2 lists (making one bigger list you can then mail to). The action cards consist of scams, mail-outs or hardware cards. Hardware cards are played in front of you and allow you to break the game rules in a prescribed way (eg can mail other's private lists). Mail-out cards also list special effects which vary from mundane to wildly powerful but generally allow you to hose other players. When you play one, you say whether you're mailing or playing the special effect.<br/><br/>To the game play itself. You try to get a mail-out going every turn (you're only allowed one) and pick a scam / list combination that gives you the best chance of scoring 2 points rather than 1 point. If you only get 1 point, you may well be falling off the pace. You're generally picking up at least one card each turn, and this can be a slow process as any special action needs to be read and understood to work out whether you want to use the card as a mail-out or for the special effect. So it's not the fastest game in the world. These hostage cards also make it a big hit the leader game. If you're going to make a dash for the lead have plenty of protection cards because you have to maintain your winning score for a full round before you win - everyone gets a shot at you.<br/><br/>",

Each player then secretly commits a ship card to it from their hand of five.  The winner of the round is the player whose ship best meets the mission's criteria.<br/><br/>Ships are rated for Space Combat, Marines, Diplomacy, Science, and Cargo.  Most missions will only use one of these (i.e., &quot;highest Space Combat wins&quot;) while some use two combined (i.e., &quot;highest total of Science and Cargo wins&quot;).  A few missions add special conditions; ships sent to defend against Gorn attack may not be Gorn, for example, while the Romulan Civil War excludes all but Romulans, and negotiations with alien pacifists go to the highest Diplomacy after Space Combat and Marines are subtracted.<br/><br/>From the rule sheet cover:<br/><br/>Star Fleet Missions is a card game played with two decks of cards:  Ship Cards and Missions Cards.<br/><br/>Each Ship Card represents a starship.  there are 18 cards for each of six &quot;races&quot; (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Gorn, Tholian, and Orion Pirate), for a total of 108.  (Race means &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;empire.&quot;)<br/><br/>Each Ship Card shows the class (type of ship), the name of the specific ship, and five Ratings which are used to determine the suitability of a ship for a given Mission.  These Ratings vary from 1 to 16.<br/><br/>The other two Ship Cards represent starships with Legendary Captains and are the most powerful Ship Cards in the game.  All five Ratings are 20!<br/><br/>Each Mission Card describes an exciting mission on which you will send one or more starships.  Each Mission Card describes the Mission, tells how many ships to send on the Mission, provides any special instructions, and describes how to &quot;win&quot; that Mission (i.e., which Ratings of the ships sent will be used to determine which ship performed the best.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Exploration: Warzone is a space themed game in which players take control of spaceships with different skills and jump into a space battle.<br/><br/>This is a dynamic filler game in which the most important part is that you need to assess what your opponent's next move will be. Should you attack, defend, recover, avoid battle, collect VP or use spaceship skills? That is the question.<br/><br/>There are multiple paths to win: destroying opponent spaceships and became last man standing in the warzone, collect two relic cards or get the most victory points. You will be able to acheive the goal by building your deck of hex cards including action cards, war cards and relics. Then you will be able to utilize them in one of 9 possible actions. To expand your hand you will need 4 resources that create microeconomics in the game. Finally, you'll use your spaceship's unique ability to overwhelm your opponent in a simple, but not crude, card-based combat system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&yen;&euro;$ (YES) is a new game produced by Armstrong Company and launched in 2004. There are 6 types of commodity spread across the 5 continents and players must control these to satisfy two different winning conditions. So to win, you might need to control two tractors and two factories for one condition, and one commodity in each continent for your second condition. Alternately, the first player to earn 1 million wins.<br/><br/>There are decks of cards; Country (which shows a commodity in a country and a price, e.g. Factories are in Britain and cost 70,000), Yes (good stuff), No (bad stuff), Auftrag (winning conditions). You start with some cash money, a few countries and two Auftrag. For the countries you own, you put the plastic commodity onto your colored disc onto the country. So the player owning Britain puts a factory on one of their discs onto Britain. This way, ownership can be seen and can change.<br/><br/>The game is driven by two dice. The player rolls them, chooses one for itself and the other for the player on the left to use. The dice are marked Buy, Sell, Country, Yes, No, Cash. Buy means you can buy a commodity/country from another player - regardless of whether they want to sell it - at the price on the card. There is also a red die you can roll to gamble on the price, making it higher or lower. Sell means you may sell a Country back to the bank. Country means you draw a Country card and place the commodity on your disc on it. Yes/No means you draw from the appropriate deck and apply the result, e.g. all players get a dividend, or pay a tax, etc. Cash means you move a marker on the board and whoever has that commodity or continent gets a bonus.<br/><br/>Since the game is completely driven by two dice, it is pure chance if a good thing or bad thing happens to a player. Due to the nature of the dice, the cards, and the rules, it is quite possible for the game to end in the first round. ...or it can go on forever.  [See Fluxx.]<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game has completely different rules from the 1995 version, which was reissued in 2017 in a wooden box but with the same old rules. The rules also seem to be different from the 2019 playable prop replica. The focus of the new game is an actual jungle adventure.<br/><br/>The 2021 version has similar wooden box, but the board now has  four undifferentiated pathways over a jungle scene with a waterfall and a volcano and other jungle details. The pawns now look like the rhinoceros figure from the original movie.  It comes with two regular six-sided dice, four six-sided &quot;challenge dice&quot;, 12 life tokens, and a sand timer. When the lid opens the two sides have the same text as the game in the original movie.<br/><br/>It has a deck of 100 &quot;challenge cards&quot; and a green card reader which doesn't work very well. (There's also an electronic version that reads the text.) On the front of the card is a hidden riddle, from which you're supposed to guess one of 20 categories.<br/><br/>On the back of the card is a &quot;challenge&quot;.  These range from the sort of dice rolling that was used in the old game to physical role-playing activities like jumping across an imagined chasm or racing to the refrigerator to get a piece of fruit and taking a bite before the timer runs out.  There are storytelling challenges like imagining there's a lion and telling how you'd get away from it, acting challenges like having the whole group howl like wolves, and trivia questions relating to the jungle.<br/><br/>If you fail a challenge you lose a life token.  If any player loses three life tokens the group as a whole loses the game, but players can give their life tokens to another player.<br/><br/>",

Along the way players draw cards that either: a) turn you into a mouse (can't move), b) turn you back into a child if you are a mouse, or c) have you drop the &quot;whammy&quot; ball down the chimney. The whammy ball comes out in one of the four quadrants of the game board and makes something move (witch's broom, secret door, etc.). If a player's pawn (or mouse) is hit by the ball or moving object it is sent backwards to a &quot;safe&quot; spot. Ages 6 - 12.<br/><br/>Which Witch came out in two editions: a large box version in 1970 with an unfolded board, and a narrow box edition in 1971 with a folding board.<br/><br/>Finnish version known as Kummituslinna did not use cards for events but came with wheel you spin around. Kummituslinna had high quality plastic tower and staircase instead of cardboard.<br/><br/>Italian version of the game was published by MB and it was called &quot;Brivido!&quot;. It came with a plastic central tower and a phosphorescent skull instead of the ball. Also, the plastic &quot;scared guy&quot; markers glow in the dark and the cards are replaced with a spinner (the Greek version also came with the glowing skull and the spinner).<br/><br/>Hungarian version of the game is known as &quot;Szellemkast&eacute;ly&quot; and also came with a plastic central tower, a wheel instead of cards and a skull which glows in the dark.<br/><br/>The UK version of the game, called Ghost Castle, also featured the black plastic central tower, glow-in-the-dark skull, and spinner.<br/><br/>",

Along the way, you can demo your model coaster for investors to see how well it works and earn some extra money for auctions.<br/><br/>At the end of the game you get to unveil your fully constructed roller coaster and run it for the public.
