        "description": "1066 is a three player game covering the various claimants to the crown of England following the death of Edward the Confessor in January 1066.<br/><br/>The players fulfill the roles of Harald Hardrada, Harold Godwinson and William of Normandy. The game is split into 4 phases each of which is designed to illustrate a key component in determining who takes the crown.<br/><br/>Firstly there is a Pre-Invasion Political Event phase (PIPE) which is designed to showcase the political intrigue that took place prior to the death of Edward. During this phase the players can gain additional support from other leaders and regions and, crucially, they can gain additionally legitimacy from various monarchs, religious bodies and events. Many events are outside their control; death of the Aethling, Scandinavian Wars and the activities of Tostig but they will also be crucial.  This simple game preamble will provide an infinite variety of starting points to be played out on the map itself. In addition this phase can be a time of acquiring operational and tactical chits to use advantageously later.<br/>Legitimacy is central to the game. Unless a player gains an automatic victory then a players legitimacy level will be key in determining who has won the war. As well as during the PIPE phase it can also be changed by winning and losing battles and by taking controlling of areas on the map.<br/><br/>However before the Operational phase there are the perils of the sea crossings. When to sail is a crucial decision by both William and Hardrada. Go early and the weather should be kinder, go later and you can recruit more troops.  Lady luck, in the form of stormy seas can destroy the best laid plans, in addition the prevailing winds can prevent you invading, even when you  are ready to go (as occurred to William). If a crossing goes badly wrong, or you lose an early decisive battle your claim lies in shreds. Don&rsquo;t despair &ndash; &lsquo;Become a Dane&rsquo;. A player can abandon their attempt, as William or Hardrada, and instead take up the cause of Sweyn of Denmark and try and gain the throne for the Danes (they historically invaded in 1069). It won&rsquo;t be easy winning as the Danes but it means you are still in the game.<br/><br/>The first week in September is a dangerous time for Harold as the Fyrd stand down to collect the harvest, is this the time to strike? , will the weather conditions be in your favour.<br/>In the operational players move around the map of England to gain control of areas and improve their legitimacy as well as deciding when to strike to win a decisive battle against one of the two opponents. The operational phase is a real &lsquo;rock, paper, scissors&rsquo; problem. How to square the problems of keeping your forces concentrated to win battles, spreading them out to take control of areas whilst keeping them feed without turning areas into wastelands.<br/><br/> When battle is joined them the action is transferred to a battle board where the individual characteristics of the differing armies is highlighted. The longer you stay on the battlefield the bigger the loss if you are defeated; often the losses from pursuit are greater than the losses from the battle itself. Winning and losing battles result in big legitimacy swings which can decide the game.  <br/> Never before has this iconic campaign been gamed with all four key facets illustrated (politics, invasion, operational campaign and battles)<br/>There are a number of very good battle games but not much for the operational phase and nothing showing the political interplay or the perils of the sea crossings themselves.<br/>The victory conditions for each player differ slightly, requiring differing strategies for each side. <br/>Sweyn of Denmark is waiting in the wings. If no one &lsquo;Becomes a Dane&rsquo; then the system takes over the game system will determine if he arrives or not. Leave London inadequately protected and he will take it and without it neither William or Harold can win a decisive victory.<br/><br/>The game is easily playable in a single session (4-5 hours)<br/>4 Kings 1 Crown &ndash; have you got what it takes to become the undisputed King of England.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A tactical WWII wargame that was published in the first issue of JagdPanther magazine. Eight generic scenarios were included for portraying conflicts involving German, American, and Russian forces. MP-44 is currently available in PDF format as Amarillo Design Bureau has digitally rereleased all fifteen JagdPanther issues.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Mp44 [sic] is a squad level (10-12 man) game of infantry combat in WWII. In many ways it is the illigitemate [sic] child of Panzerblitz and Grunt. But it is distinctive and in many ways superior to both ... In this game we have squads of 14 men, and we have teams of two ... Some may complain that the game is too close to Panzerblitz. Well, part of that us intentional. I saw no reason to require the gamer to learn a new game system when most are familiar with Panzerblitz. For that reason, I left the factors where they were on the counter, and used, for all practical purposes, the same CRT ... Besides, this game is sort of a companion to PzB, allowing you to get closer to the action. Basically, we had to contend with Bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles, machine pistols, and machine guns. Assault rifles are also included, and the heavier fire factors are indicative of the fire-generation of these weapons. The Vietnam type infantry provided for the Americans include not only assault rifles, but Grenade Launchers - pocket cannon ... German paratroopers might carry rifles, smg, or assault rifles ... Any differences in the relative intelligence or training or minor differences in weapons are reflected in reduced or increased range, reflecting more or less disciplined fire.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dark is a dungeon-crawler card game for 1-7 players, currently in it&rsquo;s print-and-play beta version.  It&rsquo;s free to download.<br/><br/>This very early version is in black-and-white with very simple graphics.<br/><br/>The Dark features a classic group of adventurers exploring a dungeon. One player lays out the dungeon cards, while the others control the adventurers. Adventurers leave torches to light the way through the dungeon as they explore, and for each torch placed the character player gains a point. Roles are then rotated, and scores compared to determine the victor!<br/><br/>This set contains:<br/>1 double sided dungeon entrance card.<br/>6 adventurer cards, each with their own deck of 7 cards.<br/>47 dungeon master cards, including 4 instant cards.<br/>1 deck box.<br/><br/>The Adventurers:<br/>Guard: Loves a scrap. Good at the stabby-stabby. No so good at the hygiene. Scared of water, so cannot cross the many and varied puddles dotted around the dungeon.<br/><br/>Librarian: Great at magic. constantly coughs up warp-points. Carries a lot of books around, and is scared they&rsquo;ll get destroyed by the bonfires in the dungeon, so cannot cross doorways blocked by fire.<br/><br/>Miner: Intent on ignoring the normal passageways of the dungeon and blasting new tunnels through the place. Spends most of his time underground so is terrified of heights, and cannot cross the cracks in the floor.<br/><br/>Vampire: Here for a long time, not for a good time. Hated by the other adventurers, but kind of useful. Can&rsquo;t go through doorways without being invited and there&rsquo;s no one around to invite them.<br/>Aversion to silver.<br/><br/>Explorer: Jack-of-all-trades kinda person. Bit of a coward. Rubbish at fighting monsters.<br/><br/>Zombie: Barely alive. Probably still braindead. Rarely does anything, but oh so great at this adventuring business when they wake up and start smashing heads together.<br/><br/>The Decks:<br/>Instants: Most adventurer deck cards and some dungeon master cards are Instants. Reveal the card, do what it says, then discard the card. Simples. Instants only affect cards in play, not cards in the decks.<br/><br/>Permanents: These cards stay on the table until the end of the game or until another card causes them to be discarded.<br/><br/>Dungeon cards: These make up the dungeon for your adventurers to explore. They&rsquo;re played dark side up with the nasty stuff on. To win the game the character player needs to flip these cards over to their light side, revealing nicer stuff.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Misplaced&rdquo; cards: The dungeon deck contains 4 instant cards. Some of the adventurer decks contain cards that can be played as part of the dungeon as if the character player were the dungeon master.<br/><br/>When placing cards that form part of the dungeon:<br/>&bull; Cards must be played adjacent to another dungeon card forming a grid. Cards should meet along the full length of a long or short<br/>side of the card.<br/>&bull; Cards may not be placed corner-to-corner.<br/>&bull; Cards may be rotated 180 degrees, but not 90 degrees, they must always be in &ldquo;portrait&rdquo; orientation, not landscape.<br/>&bull; Cards can be placed in a way that rubble or other obstacles make the dungeon impassable in the next turn, but cards cannot be entirely blocked by rubble.<br/>&bull; Cards cannot be placed further back than the dungeon entrance, otherwise the table gets very messy very quickly.<br/><br/>Reach:<br/>At many points during the game you&rsquo;ll need to check if an adventure can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; a monster or chest. Checking this is simple, just draw a line with your finger through the dungeon from the entrance card to the monster or chest in question. If you&rsquo;re not blocked by items that your adventurer is afraid of, or by more doors than you have keys, your character can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; the monster or chest in question.<br/><br/>The Adventurers will be blocked by:<br/>Rubble: Impassable. Find another way around.<br/>Locked doors: Can only be opened with a key.<br/>Kind of like locked doors in real life. Vampires have trouble with these.<br/>Puddles: Easy to walk through, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.<br/>Bonfires: Easy to jump over, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.<br/>Cracks in the floor: Easy to jump over, unless your adventurer card states otherwise.<br/>Open Passage Ways: All characters can freely pass between rooms with open passage ways.<br/><br/>In the dungeon you might find such varied items as:<br/>Monsters: The dream-team for any dungeon master. They look different but all do the same thing: cause the character player to lose cards until the monster is defeated. Don&rsquo;t hate the monster; hate the game.<br/>Wooden chests: Like silver chests, only made of wood.<br/>Silver chests: Like wooden chests only made of silver. Vampires really don&rsquo;t like silver that much, so can&rsquo;t travel through rooms containing silver chests.<br/>Warp Points: Any adventurer can travel from any warp point to any other warp point.<br/>Mine Shafts: Any adventure can travel from any mine shaft to any other mine shaft.<br/>Keys: For opening doors. All doors in the dungeon can be opened with any key, but you need as many keys as doors you want to open on a single character route. For example, if in order to reach a monster, the Guard needs to travel through 3 doors, you need 3 keys. No, you can&rsquo;t just take the key with you along the way<br/>because&hellip; I don&rsquo;t know why not. But that&rsquo;s not how the game works, okay?<br/>Bombs: Classic little bomb type bombs. When a bomb is revealed, the dungeon master can instantly discard a card from the top of any adventurer deck that can &ldquo;reach&rdquo; the bomb. If the bomb is on an instant the dungeon master can pick any adventurer deck.<br/>Torches: This is how you win the game. As dungeon cards are flipped, torches will appear. The more torches, the higher your score.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players then choose one from their hand each turn, and place it face down in front of themselves.  All of those cards are then simultaneously revealed. Typically, the player who chose the card with the highest value will score a point. However, duplicate cards cancel each other, '1' beats a '5', and '0' can be any value between 0-5. After all six cards have been played once, each player picks up their entire hand and play another set of turns.<br/><br/>The game ends one of two ways: The first player to score 9 points immediately wins, or after 3 complete sets.  In the latter case, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>文房具をモチーフにした6枚のカードでバトルするバッティングゲームです。<br/>原則数字の大きいカードが勝利しますが、１は５に勝利します。また０は、<br/>１～5までの数字をコピーすることができるので、戦略的なバトルが楽しめます。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lords &amp; Servants is a game system designed to recreate skirmish games with 28, 20 or 15mm miniatures. It covers the Medieval period and it shares the mechanics of our popular system Smooth &amp; Rifled.<br/><br/>In the Appendix you will find all the information that you need to create your games, from simple clashes involving a few men per side to bigger encounters with 60-80 miniatures per side. This system is ideal for multiplayer games.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need a few miniatures for the period (based singly, both 2x2cm or 1-inch diameter round bases are ok), some rulers or other measuring sticks and a few 6-sided dice, which we&rsquo;ll call d6. You&rsquo;ll also need markers to show who is &ldquo;Shaken&rdquo; and a figure&rsquo;s weapon reloading status. Some markers are available<br/>in the appendix.<br/><br/>The game can be played on 90x90cm or 120x120cm tables with 28mm miniatures or 60x60cm when using 15mm.<br/><br/>The scale of the game is: 1 figure = 1 man; 1cm is equivalent to 2m in real-life when using 20mm or 25/28mm miniatures, while it is 4m when using 15mm models. A turn represents 10-20 seconds. You can halve the distances when using 15mm miniatures. All measurements are taken from base to base. A miniature can shoot with a 180&deg; arc, Groups with a 90&deg; arc (45&deg; per side). In order to simplify the rules we ask players to use their common sense to decide shooting priorities. There must not be any intervening miniatures on the shooting line unless they are in base contact as in a 2nd rank (only) shooting. In theory, you should give priority to the target that is in front of you rather than one that is behind. You can always target a mounted miniature behind a foot figure.<br/> Additionally rules are provided for: Cavalry, Artillery, Religion, Weather all manner of Medieval Things!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The logical gamification of the age old insult that&rsquo;s been traded in bars, man-caves and on Shakespearean stages for centuries, Your Mother Is A Whore is a fast paced, interactive and hilarious game where you get to defend your Mother&rsquo;s honor by handing out Whore Points&trade; while dodging them yourself.<br/><br/>Build out a hand in Blonde, Brunette, Redhead or Raven to tell all your friends: Your Mother is a Filthy Whore! Maybe dive into someone else&rsquo;s hand with a Threesome, or if someone is trying to dish out Whore Points to you, Cockblock them. Still, sometimes there&rsquo;s just nothing left to do but resort to Because Fuck You, That&rsquo;s Why! This game has a deck just for that too.<br/><br/>If you love the hilarious inappropriateness of Cards Against Humanity, but also like a more structured, social game as well, Your Mother Is A Whore will deliver tons of laughs along with its fun, highly interactive 'take that' gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally conceived as a set of &ldquo;large scale skirmish&rdquo; rules for the Indian Mutiny, MD&amp;E is easily adapted for other theatres and periods. These rules will easily manage skirmishes and battles between European and any native forces. The rules will even work if you want to pit a colonial German force against the French Foreign Legion, or for that matter, the British in South Africa against the Boers.<br/><br/>For the most part, the disparity in weapon technology offsets the fact that the Europeans are often heavily outnumbered, even though newer rifles meant superior range and firepower, in each theatre these new weapons were not universal. In fact, the British and other colonial powers often relied on locally raised allies, or levies, to do most of the fighting for them. The British had a habit of issuing local troops with weapons that were one or two developments behind their European counterparts. In far flung theatres, the replacement of seemingly obsolete weapons took some time.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are straightforward. All movement is randomized by using dice and you lose movement dice for bad terrain. It is easier to move and control units if there is a commander present. Firing and combat is based on the number of figures, plus or minus relevant factors. Damage either kills a figure or inflicts terror on the unit. Morale tests are triggered by extreme situations, or the gradual buildup of terror.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be quick, capable of handling battles from forty or fifty figures a side to several hundred. They have worked well on a standard home-sized 10 x 6 or a monstrous 45 x 6 and have been &ldquo;crash tested&rdquo; by over 100 wargamers from a dozen different countries.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Rainbow Cats, players compete to claim as much space in the house as possible for their favorite cat while making sure their least favorite cat's objects are nowhere to be seen.<br/><br/>At the start of play, players draw two cat cards to establish their favorite and least favorite cats, information they need to keep secret! If a player somehow draws the same cat for both their favorite and least favorite cats, that player will not have a least favorite cat. The house consists of a 5x5 grid made up of items from seven different cats, each representing a color of the rainbow.<br/><br/>The Seven Cats:<br/>Phoenix<br/>Ginger<br/>Daisy<br/>Jade<br/>Azul      <br/>Iris      <br/>Violet<br/><br/>Contents: <br/>14 Cat Identity Cards<br/>140 Cat Item Cards<br/>9 Grid Goal Cards<br/>25 Starting Grid Cards<br/>Last Played Card Token<br/><br/>There are 7 cats total and 20 item cards for each specific cat within the item deck. During game play, players will take turns placing item cards on  a 5 x 5 grid. Players will also have  secret guide showing anywhere from 1-5 points for each spot on the grid. The player earns points for every preferred item card placed and loses points when their least favorite cat&rsquo;s items are on the grid. Each player has a different guide, meaning each player can gain or lose points for different spots.  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Types of Cards:<br/>Cat Identity: Each player gets 2 of these. Keep them secret. <br/>Grid Goal: Each player gets 1 of these. Also keep this secret.<br/>Cat Items: Players will get a lot of these throughout the game.<br/><br/>Set Up: <br/>To start the game , first distribute the starting grid cards face up on the table, revealing 25 colorful spaces where players can play item cards. Then shuffle and give each player 2 Cat Identity cards, 1 Grid Goal card, and 5 Item cards. Play will start with the person who has the most cats. If there is a tie then rock paper scissors should suffice. Players DO NOT select a favorite and least favorite cat at this time.<br/><br/>During the beginning stages of the game, players will take turns drawing 1 item from the items deck and playing 1 item within the 5 x 5 grid, not placing any cards on top of existing Item cards within the grid. <br/>They also must place cards at least 2 spaces from the last card played if able.<br/><br/>When they place an Item card on the grid, that player will also place the token to show the last played Item card. If there are no spaces available 2 spaces from the last card played then place anywhere an Item card has not been placed. Once 25 item cards are placed on top of all starting grid cards, players must select their favorite cats by placing it face down in front of them and adjacent to the 5 x 5 grid. The cat card left in their hand is their least favorite cat. Remember that if both are the same then they do not have a least favorite cat.<br/><br/>How to play: <br/>At this time shuffle the remaining item deck and deal each player 10 additional item cards in order to build individual decks. From this point forward, players will draw and play from their individual decks. Players will continue to draw 1 item card and place 1 item card on top of existing item cards until all players have no cards left in their individual item decks. There is no limit to the number of cards that can be stacked on top of other cards.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t forget: Players can only place item cards 2 or more spaces from the last played item card.<br/><br/>End of Game: <br/>After all item cards have been played from the players&rsquo; individual decks, players will reveal their favorite cats and calculate their points based on their secret grid card, giving positive points for each item of the cat on the grid. Players will then reveal their least favorite cat and referring to their goal grid card, deduct points from their total for each item on the grid from their least favorite cat. The player with the highest total points wins.<br/><br/>Single Player Variant:<br/>In the single player variant of Rainbow Cats, you will shuffle all 140 cards and make a 5 x 5 grid with 5 item cards in each space. The remaining cards will become your deck. You will then shuffle your deck and deal yourself 5 cards. Next, you will shuffle and deal yourself two cat cards.<br/><br/>Unlike the multi-player version, you cannot have the same favorite and least favorite cat and will need to draw another cat card.<br/><br/>The goal of this game is to remove all 20 items for the favorite cat. You remove 2 items from anywhere on the grid as long as they belong to same cat. The only items you cannot remove are from your least favorite cat. You can also peak at as many item cards on the grid as you&rsquo;d like to help plan where you want  which cards to move. You can however move any item card from 1 space to another when you collect 2 of your favorite cat&rsquo;s items.<br/><br/>For example, if Phoenix is your favorite cat and there are 2 red items for Phoenix showing, you will remove those 2 items and the items make a pair. When you remove a pair of items from your favorite cat, you can also move . Cards in hand can also be used. When cards in hand are played, it is replaced with a card from the remaining deck. The goal is to get all 20 items for your favorite cat.<br/><br/>",

His shrieks alone have been known to rend the sanity from witnesses, and all living things quail and soon perish in his presence.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the game box<br/><br/>",

Confidence was high, as they estimated there was less than 500 km (310 mi) remaining of unexplored Arctic mainland coast. When the ships failed to return, relief expeditions and search parties explored the Canadian Arctic, which resulted in a thorough charting of the region, along with a possible passage. Many artifacts from the expedition were found over the next century and a half, including notes that the ships were ice-locked in 1846 near King William Island, about halfway through the passage, and unable to break free. You need to do better!<br/><br/>In The Search for the Northwest Passage you'll try to find a sea route from mid-19th century Britain to the Pacific Ocean via the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, make discoveries along the way, and return home to tell the story.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he/she has a choice of two actions. He announces whether he wants to navigate or explore. Then he draws the top card of the deck. Players alternate turns until one of the end game conditions occurs. The player with the most VPs wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The solution to the puzzle will be restricted by two groups of numbers which cannot be moved or removed from the game board once set by the players:<br/>A) Any number on a black &ldquo;Shadow&rdquo; square placed during game play.<br/>B) Any number on a white &ldquo;Tiger&rdquo; square placed during game play.<br/><br/>To win the game, you must be the first player to fill all twenty-one squares in your row, column and block, each with the numbers 1 through 9, solving your piece of the puzzle. Like Sudoku, no number can be repeated in your row, column or block. Additionally, your numbers cannot repeat any black number in the same row or column. Designed for 4 players,yet playable with 2 or 3 as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We were sick of playing the same boring, lackluster, and uninspiring drinking games.<br/><br/>We set out on a quest to revolutionize the drinking game industry by creating a game with real substance and the highest quality of materials.<br/><br/>The basics:<br/>The rules of Dicey are simple! Roll our signature 12-sided die and draw the color card that corresponds with your roll. Read the card out loud to the group and follow the directions to the mini-game that is on the card. Winners and losers are determined on a per card basis (each card is its own drinking mini-game). If you can successfully collect 5 cards you are the winner of the game!<br/><br/>More details: <br/>Dicey is a collection of 83 mini-games split into four different color categories:<br/><br/>Group Play cards are the color green and are mini-games that the whole group will play together.<br/><br/>Face Off cards are the color orange and are mini-games that are a one-on-one competition between players. If you draw this card you are responsible for picking your opponent from the group to compete against.<br/><br/>Rule cards or &quot;Rules&quot; are the color yellow and are fun variations to the game that last a full turn (one complete lap around the circle) or until someone else draws a rule card.  Only 1 rule card can be active at a time!<br/><br/>Wildcards are the color purple and are the most ridiculous of the Dicey mini-games! Get ready for belly-aching laughs as these cards are an assortment of Dicey's most wild creations.<br/><br/>We worked for over 3 years on creating Dicey.  We made hundreds of mini-games, played with thousands of people, and ultimately narrowed the cards down to what people truly had fun playing.<br/><br/>We want you to share in the crazy shenanigans, lifelong friendships, and timeless memories Dicey has given to us.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To do so each monkey must tame the mountain by following the Six Principles of Zen; forging paths, directing streams, and arranging features such as fruit trees, lanterns and statues that will most please King Monkey. In addition, Sun Wukong demands that all monkeys must help to build him a shrine on top of the mountain. Not all of the mountain monkeys agree with Sun Wukong however and some patrol the forest, ready to catch unwary monkeys.<br/><br/>In Zen Monkeys players each have a monkey Disciple, creating their part of Sun Wukong's kingdom on the mountain. Each round player monkeys search the Wilds for placeable 'feature' resources or collect landscape tiles to shape their forest into a puzzle-like network of paths and streams. Searching along paths in the Wilds has a noise penalty that triggers the approach of the grey guardian monkeys who will chase and eject any monkeys found collecting. Sneaky monkeys will be able to collect and place these resources in their landscapes to best please King Monkey, following the set of objectives he has set them for the game. Collectable resources are scarce so the monkeys will have to landscape their part of the forest carefully and be ready to grab point-scoring features before their rivals can.<br/><br/>After two full moon phases, the game ends and King Monkey appears to judge the most impressive landscapes of his new kingdom. Points are scored on the sets of features placed in each area, the adherence to the 6 zen principles and for the specific tasks assigned by King Monkey.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After centuries of slumber, it can once again advance the cause of the Mythos forces on our planet, getting ready for a final battle it knows is coming.<br/><br/>The Avatar of Cthulhu has been sculpted by Joaquin Palacios, one of the World's most famous sculptor. This reference comes with its own Dust 1947 unit card, for the Mythos Bloc. Like all regular Dust 1947 miniatures, it comes already assembled and primed. It's ready for the battlefield, or for painting, as you wish! You can directly paint over on it, since the priming serves as an undercoat and is compatible with any type of paint.<br/><br/>",

You play as a dessert chef working in a kitchen to make the foods desired by your customer.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, choose a character to be your customer.<br/><br/>Shuffle the 15 food cards and deal them face up in three columns of five cards each. Then shuffle a standard deck of playing cards and deal six cards into play and draw a starting hand.<br/><br/>To create a food, you match the suits found on the food with the suits on your cards. Then you collect it and feed it to your customer, gaining its sweet reward.<br/><br/>When you can't make a match, you can deal more cards, but be careful not to run of out cards before creating all of the foods that your customer wants.<br/><br/>Once you've created all the foods your friend is hungry for, you win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Timing of the launch and other external events are determined by a rotating disc on the board that rotates when a double is thrown with the dice. Once all the required components and 25,0000 litres of fuel is collected a player launches a satellite. <br/>A successful launch is determined by throwing a number greater than 6 with the two dice. If the total of the dice is less than 6 then the launch fails and all is lost. An exception to this is if a player obtained life insurance for the scientist and fire insurance for the rocket whilst moving around the board.<br/>The player who successfully launches the most satellites in a set time is the winner.<br/><br/>A Greek version of the game is titled 'Lunik', where 5 playing launch pads are included instead of the typical 4 in RISCO.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

It's a game that anybody can learn to play in minutes but spend a lifetime mastering and will be a great addition to your tabletop strategy game collection.<br/><br/>The board is a square grid divided into 7 rows and 7 columns. Each player begins with two microbes, colored blue or red. The microbes are placed at the four corners of the grid, with blue in the top left and bottom right corners, while red occupies the other corners. Red takes the first turn. During a turn, a player may move one of their microbes one or two spaces in any direction, including diagonally. If the player moves to an adjacent space, a new microbe is created on the space the microbe moved from. If the player moves to a non-adjacent space, the space on which the microbe began the turn remains empty. Any of the opponent's microbes which are in spaces adjacent to the space a player moves onto will be &quot;infected,&quot; turning to the color of the player who has moved. Players are required to move unless no legal move is possible. The game is over when either all cells of the board are filled or all microbes on the board are the same color. The player with the most microbes on the board at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The D-Day folio series consists of four separate games, each portraying a portion of the Normandy campaign area. Turns represent two to three days each; the games cover the campaign from the initial landing to the breakout. Each game comes with one map covering a portion of the battlefield at 2.5 miles per hex. The playing pieces represent the regiments and special battalions taking part, plus the multitude of fire support available to them.<br/><br/>The series uses the Fire &amp; Movement system rules, with exclusive rules for each folio. The folios can be combined to display the entire American or British Commonwealth sectors, or into a single giant game on the entire campaign.<br/><br/>Utah Beach, a late addition to the invasion, was envisioned as both flank protection for the main landings and a launching pad for the capture of the port at Cherbourg. The Allied player uses airborne drops and amphibious landings to secure a large beachhead, including capture of the city of Carentan. The German player must use the limited forces available to prevent it.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>17&quot;x22&quot; terrain map<br/>100 die-cut counters<br/>one Eight page system rule booklet<br/>one exclusive scenario rules<br/>10x13 ziplock<br/>5x3 ziplock<br/><br/>Players: 1-3<br/>Ages: 14+<br/>Hex Scale: 2.5 miles<br/>Play Time: 1-2 hours<br/>Complexity: Low-Med<br/>Solitaire Ability: Medium<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forgotten Chambers is an exploration game in which dungeons are randomly generated through exploration cards. Each game follows a scenario as part of a campaign described in the dedicated booklet. It will be quite possible to create scenarios thanks to the various explorations cards and related events without forgetting encounters and monsters.<br/><br/>When discovering a new exploration card, a player draws an encounter card on which a small ambient text is described and what the heroes discover. When all the players cross an area together we draw an event that we just place on the storyline at the bottom of the board, describing the scenario and its stages. Specific event cards to each scenario are added to the common ones.<br/><br/>The monsters encountered also depend on the scenarios: Kobolds and undead. All monsters (except bosses) are also drawn randomly.<br/>It is possible to change the difficulty of the game by adding events and / or exploration cards to increase the exploration time. It is also possible to play with higher level monsters.<br/><br/>The game offers a great life because of all these elements. Each game will be different even if the same scenario is played several times thanks to all the exploration mechanics of the dungeons.<br/>The core box will propose 4 heroes and several decks of experience cards that will allow you to evolve them. Many treasures and equipment will also be part of the contents of the basic box.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pinch is played on the intersections of a square grid (9x9, 11x11 or 13x13 are the recommended sizes). One player plays with black stones, the other with white stones. The borders of two opposing sides of the board are colored black; the remaining two sides have white-colored borders. (If a Go board is used, mark the ownership of sides as follows: place a black stone near one side of the board and then place another black stone near the opposite side; do the same with white stones and the remaining sides.)<br/><br/>A player&rsquo;s goal is to connect his/her two same-colored board sides with a group of orthogonally-connected stones of his/her color. On each turn, a player must place a single own-stone on any empty point. If as a direct result of the placement, a player has two own-stones that are orthogonally adjacent to an enemy stone at a right angle, then that enemy stone is converted to an own-stone. If the newly converted stone creates conditions for a similar capture, then that capture takes place immediately, and so on in a chain reaction. A capturing pair (i.e. the two own-stones that bring about a capture of an enemy stone) must contain at least one newly placed or newly converted stone, otherwise no capture takes place.<br/><br/>For examples of captures, see the Rules Forum posting titled &ldquo;How Pinch captures work.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In order to offset the first player&rsquo;s advantage, the PIE RULE applies. (After the first stone is placed on the board, the other player decides which color of stones he/she wants to play.)<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The tin board had a number of small holes numbered for the various plastic components to recreate each of the 9 holes, as the 1st hole was intended to be a straight shot to the hole.

        "description": "On To Vienna! &ndash; simulating the Austro-Prussian War (1866) &ndash; is a sequel to On To Paris! using a wargame system adapted from Victory Games&rsquo; The Civil War. Players familiar with On To Paris! will be immediately familiar with the scale, system, rules and game play of On To Vienna!, taking the action to central Europe and Italy in 1866.<br/><br/>The systems challenge players to control the leadership, organization and military operations of Armies and Corps during the later 19th century, this time between Prussia and its ally Italy against Austria and the independent Federal German States, including Bavaria, Saxony and Hanover, with the exciting possibility of French Intervention.<br/><br/>Designed for two players, On To Vienna! is also suitable for solitaire play. Eleven scenarios include various &lsquo;early start&rsquo; situations and the historical start of the war as well as a number of key points with the conflict already underway that can continue past the historical end of the conflict. An introductory &ldquo;learning&rdquo; scenario introduces players to the system and several scenarios look at exciting variations such as Austria being able to focus and bring more effort against either Prussia or Italy. Players can also pick any scenario as a starting point and determine their own period of the conflict to simulate. Most scenarios can be played on sections of the maps for smaller, shorter and faster games and as before with On to Paris! many optional rules explore interesting historical options for both sides.<br/><br/>On To Vienna! is a fast moving competitive game where players do their best to control their forces and where every decision creates excitement and tension. The game system features interactive game play with flexible initiative and variable turn length as well as extensive defensive player reaction ability. The game puts players in charge of all the famous Corps and Army leaders of the Austro-Prussian War which are all rated for their individual leadership qualities and occasional unique characteristics like resistance to following orders.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Once everyone has submitted their answers, they are organized in ascending order and the player(s) who wrote the answer that's in the middle of all answers (hence the name &quot;Median&quot;) wins that round!<br/><br/>But here's the twist: you don't actually need to know the correct answer to win. In fact, sometimes the funniest or least-likely answer will be the one that ends up in the middle! This can add an element of strategy to the game, as you have to think about what other players might write and try to come up with an answer that will put you in the winning spot.<br/><br/>Whether you're a trivia buff or just looking for a fun and lighthearted party game, Median is sure to provide hours of entertainment and laughter.

In the west of the island of Sicily there lived a wolf (now extinct): the Canis Lupus Cristaldii, a large and fast, lethal blond wolf. This is true the story of a Wolf and a man who lived in the deep European Middle Ages: do you want to be part of it? Nebrodensis is the name of the Sicilian mountains and in this enchanted island the game develops on 8 abstract games 1vs1 (or 1vs2) or other in 8 solitaire games; symmetrical and asymmetrical, strategic and aleatory, german and american, nocturnal or diurnal, pushed into a psychological wood where only fangs and magic win. The only way to survive is to become an extinct Wolf or a magical Hermit really existed: do you accept the challenge or are you too afraid of the moon?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be the first to build a sturdy house and win the game!<br/><br/>Build, Piggy, Build! is a family-weight game with two components: a custom six-sided die and a deck of 48 cards. Players take turns rolling the die to determine whether or not (and how many) cards can be drawn from the face-down draw pile or the face-up discard pile. Standard cards depict a one of four parts of a house (of which there are five different constructions). The winning five card hand is comprised of one of each of the parts of a house (all the same color) + one &quot;piggy&quot; card.<br/><br/>Special cards are included to influence gameplay. The &quot;piggy nose&quot; card allows a player to root through the discard pile for a particular card instead of rolling. The &quot;wolf&quot; card can be used to force any player to discard any one card. The &quot;huff-and-puff&quot; card can be used to force an immediate re-roll of the die.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Political and military facilities were the main targets, but civilians were also affected. Many homes were destroyed, and a large number of people were killed or wounded.<br/><br/>Raid on Taihoku Epic Collection takes you back to two Taiwan cities &quot;Taihoku and Keelung&quot; in 1945. In reloaded version, players will have two maps to assemble including Taihoku and Keelung during playing. <br/>In the midst of war, you must cooperate to survive. You will be fettered and will face difficult choices. We must live until the war is over. To win or to die?<br/><br/>",

A presidential election has just concluded, and no clear winner has arisen. Martial law is declared, but competing factions on the Joint Chiefs of Staff result in a divided military, and militia forces are popping up in the urban centers.<br/><br/>This is YOUR chance to command one of those military forces, or a militia force, and see if you can overcome your enemies and restore some measure of control over Divided America.<br/><br/>Designed in the classic hex-and-counter style of &quot;military chess&quot; game playing popularized in the 1970s and 1980s, this game lets you decide the fate of the republic.<br/><br/>Battles take place on a brand new  original map which has a simplified terrain representation of the lower-48 states. Cities, forests, rivers, lakes, and coasts are among the terrain types represented on the map.<br/><br/>In a civil war, will militia units do well, or run away? Will military units fire on civilians, even if they have taken up arms? What will happen in a Divided America? And over it all hovers the fear of who has the `nuclear football'? Will nuclear attacks happen?<br/><br/>Game Facts: Three sets of double-sided counters made by professional artists, an original map commissioned just for this game, and a comprehensive 60 page rules book.<br/><br/>1-3 players ages 10+ with great solo rules.

Then players pick up all 8 cards and swap hands in preparation for the second round.  There is also a secret bid between rounds on which areas you think you will have won by the end of the game.  Winning majorities and making your bid score you points.<br/><br/>From the Game Box:<br/>You and your rival are each rallying your numerous supporters to be the next and most inspirational commander.  However, you must convince the shadowy Council of Five to back you.  The Council collectively wield enough power to determine which of you will triumph and which will be ... forgotten.  To sway the Council members to back your claim, you and your opponent will each champion a unique series of policies.  Each policy will earn approval from one of the Council members, but simultaneously harm your standing with another.  Angering any one member too much can result in dire consequences.  To gain an additional edge, form secret alliances with Council members and dramatically reveal your plots to devastating effect.  A poorly timed decision and cost you everything, but the right ones will see you claim the mantle of Diktator.<br/><br/>",

Both queens hate each other and feel envious that the opposing land is greater than their land. Then one fateful day, these two queens rally their armies to wage war between themselves.<br/><br/>In SEN: Save The Queen, each player becomes the queen of their respective kingdom and duels to take the lands of the other. Using only eighteen tiles to play, each player must outwit the other to trap the opposing queen. Each player has three types of units: swordsmen, spearmen, and horsemen. The battlefield is a 3x3 grid of tiles, with each player's queen occupying an opposing corner and a priest as a neutral unit in the middle of the battlefield. Then each player in turn, places their units in the available spaces.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple: There are eight action cards, and each player holds three cards at the beginning of the game. In turn order, each player can play a card from their side or take back two cards to their side of field. Each card affects certain units they control to move or attack opposing units. The player who can successfully occupy two adjacent grids owned by the enemy queen with their healthy units wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Welcome to the Age of Blood and Glory, where you and your opponents will send your fighters to the epic re-enactments of the infamous wars, in the hope of finding favour with the High Autarch.<br/><br/>Autarch: The Age of Blood and Glory is an asymmetric PvP arena combat miniature tabletop for 1-4 players, also playable as skirmish, with additional worker placement preparation phase which builds the campaign potential of the game.<br/><br/>With two games in one, your journey will alter between merciless arena battles, based on unique dice-less card combat, providing both a macabre and fun experience; and worker-placement phases, where you will strategize your next steps in a push-your-luck environment.<br/><br/>Battles are played in a modular arena with different fighter races, developed by advanced deck-building through character leveling and equipping different items. Main mechanics which make up the unique and challenging experience of Autarch include:<br/><br/>     Initiative Dial mechanism creates a dynamic player order, depending on the played cards;<br/>     Threat Level defines how much each fighter is worth in every attack, making it less opportunistic to focus on the weaker ones;<br/>     Dice-replacement Power deck represents effort a player is willing to invest in all of his actions. As both the attacker and the defender will have to use Power, you will not only have to make trade offs between offense and defense, but also test your bluffing skills in an effort to read through your opponent&rsquo;s secret intentions;<br/>     Player&rsquo;s hand being the target of attacks (selected randomly by opponents during successful attacks), with your initial hand being comprised of combat- and defense cards, and clogged with wounds as you get damaged, which may inflict you with permanent injuries. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Unlike Soviet-built tanks and aircraft, no Russian first-line submarine has ever been exported to an ally - so no one has ever been captured and analyzed by the Western Powers. And since no Soviet nuclear sub has ever fired a shot in anger, their weapon systems have never been observed under combat<br/>conditions.

        "description": "A wargame played on a square grid using square cardboard tokens for representing military units. It was played around 1809-1820 at the Plebanischen Institute in Wien and was probably designed by a teacher or student(s) there. The rules were written down by an Austrian army officer A.P Reyer and published under the name &quot;Ein Altes Kriegsspiel&quot; (that translates to &quot;An Old Wargame&quot;) in 1858. The rulebook also contains drawings showing an example game board and images that can be used for painting the units, although they are not to scale or complete, so players are expected to construct their own components rather than cut out the images from the book.<br/><br/>The book retained the original theme from the game as played in the 1810's, with images showing Napoleonic war era uniforms and weapons.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dimension That Disappeared is the 3rd booster pack and the 5th overall set in the Exodus TCG.<br/><br/>Details<br/><br/>This set introduced the Afterthought mechanic as a new secondary Ability featured exclusively on Chrono creatures. Rares started getting their Ability &amp; Ability Name hot stamped to further enhance their foil treatment. Secret Rares continued with their 3D raised foil treatment and their pull ratio of 1 in every 4 booster boxes, or 3 per case. No new Harmony Rares were introduced as they were deemed exclusive to Set 4 Converging Chasms. The set instead brought massive support for a few Guilds, specifically focusing on Chronos, Treefolk and Shardfolk--even going so far as to mix the latter two's mechanics. This expansion set also assigns the new Box Topper Rare title to the box topper card, replacing its old Secret Rare title; this change was made due to the single SR that always comes as a box topper having a Rare foil treatment rather than the usual treatment for the SR rarity tier. Box Topper Rares have a 'fixed' pull ratio, meaning they always appear at the same rate, 1 per box and cannot be found in packs themselves.<br/><br/>The booster display packaging was overhauled to a shorter 2-column box, doing away with the Styrofoam filler that was found in older booster boxes.<br/><br/>'Scaling' effects are introduced in this expansion; effects &amp; Abilities that become more powerful depending on if the player pays additional cost(s) or is playing with a teammate in Multiplayer format. The set is optimized for both Constructed and Booster Draft formats.<br/><br/>The planet's landscapes shaped themselves into 3 different, massive creatures in an effort to annihilate the legion of Chronos invading from a lost dimension. Eeventide's will manifested in the form of the 3 Harmony Rares during the war, causing temporary alliances between Guilds. But as portals continued to collide and Chronos infected Drifters and creatures alike, Treeforge Guild Leader Oliver Rose fought against the smoky onslaught. He used his Psylerran powers to seal off the dimensional rift between Eeventide and The Dimension That Disappeared...only to discover that another Guild Leader also took it upon herself to dive into the forsaken dimension at the last moment. Crystallus, the Shardveil Guild's tyrannical leader, was exposed as a puppet to the real Shardveil Guild Leader, Lucia Lievdrahs. Together, she and Oliver Rose must navigate the severed dimension to vanquish the source of Chronos' destruction and find a way back to Eeventide before they are trapped for all of eternity.<br/><br/>Set Breakdown:<br/><br/>This set consists of 77 cards, including:<br/>        1 Box Topper Rare<br/>        8 Secret Rares<br/>        27 Rares<br/>        18 Uncommons<br/>        23 Commons<br/><br/>The 8 Secret Rares have a packaging ratio of 1 in every 4 booster boxes, or 3 per booster case.<br/>        The Box Topper Rare (End of the Rift) can only be found as a fixed box topper in sealed booster boxes and not in packs themselves.<br/><br/>Box Toppers<br/><br/>Box Toppers are extra/bonus cards included as incentive when opening an entire booster box or display.<br/>        Box Toppers are always Foil.<br/>        1 of the 2 Box Toppers in every box is &quot;fixed&quot;, meaning it is the same card in every box.<br/>        The 2nd Box Topper is a random Foil from the booster set (Uncommon or higher).<br/>        A new rule card explaining the Afterthought mechanic is included as a 3rd card with Box Toppers in this set.<br/>        The Box Topper Rare rarity tier is the equivalent rarity to a regular Rare, placing it below Secret Rare and Harmony Rare on the rarity mechanic latter.<br/><br/>Sneak Peek Creature Types &amp; Product Pattern<br/><br/>The trend of previewing upcoming factions has continued since the first booster set. However, that pattern has been shaken up with this set; Set 4 hinted at Chronos and Machines being the next fully supported creature types. While this set does contain full support for Chronos, Machines' new mechanic has not yet been spoiled and will see support in Set 6. The sneak preview creature types in this set that will gain full support in a future set are Machines &amp; Leviathans. Additionally, the alternating product pattern of decks &amp; boosters was switched up with two back to back booster releases.<br/><br/>Creature Types<br/><br/>This set introduces the following creature types:<br/><br/>- Crow<br/>  - Peacock<br/><br/>",

The player with the lead throws 3 colored dice and combines them to move his train on a modular path with different landscapes (mountains, hills, lakes, snow and deserts), trying to stop at the stations to pick up passengers. Passenger tiles are worth only 1 point, but if players are able to deliver them to the next station, then the tiles are flipped over and may be worth from 2 to 4 points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The unused dice may be invested in some powerful and surprising bonus tiles to be used any time during the game. The first train driver who arrives at the last station of the path will also get a punctuality bonus, represented by a stationmaster hat.<br/><br/>The mechanics of Tutti in Treno not only are thought to highlight the idea of a path game keeping it always fun, but they also encourage kids to make some basic strategy choices, training at the same time logic and sense of space.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, they won&rsquo;t simply just take them; by using their unique Cat-abilities and a variety of cards they&rsquo;ll not only attempt to deflect the boops but also restrict your abilities to deal them.<br/><br/>Additionally to the extensive strategic aspect Catboop has 2 unique features which eliminate the pain points usually associated with card games.<br/><br/>Firstly, a &ldquo;basket&rdquo; mechanism, allows you to plan ahead your turns and reduces the luck of the draw by giving you a steady pool of cards to choose from. <br/>Secondly, a &ldquo;Pooper Scooper&rdquo; ability, unique to each Cat, provides you with a way to participate in the game, even after you&rsquo;ve been eliminated, making sure you can still revenge your loss.<br/><br/>All of this in a family friendly setting with a non-standard time frame, meaning you can shorten or expand the game time, depending on how much time you have to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For this to work the monster tile to be eaten has to be adjacent to this monster (via small or large side) and needs to be fully covered after jumping onto it. Normal building rules apply here, so it is not allowed to create isles of non-connected tiles this way. The eaten monster is removed from the player area and not considered for regular scoring. This eating process can be repeated as long as the covering jump action can be performed as stated or until the player decides to not eat anymore monsters. Each tile eaten this was is scored with 4 points.<br/><br/>",

It is your quest to tame the dungeons, each representing its own sin.<br/><br/>The game consists of rounds, each round the player will do the following action items until the end game goals are reached.<br/> Roll four 8-sided die, and three 6-sided die [4D8 + 3D6] then: <br/><br/>     Assign one D8 dice value to the list of CITIES. The number rolled represents the city which has called for aid. For example: if you assign a six,  Lord British has called for you to assist the city of Skara Brae. <br/>     Next, assign each of the three categories, THE TASK, THE VIRTUE, and, THE DUNGEON one of the remaining D8 values. For example: if you rolled a 2 and two 6s, you could assign the 2 to THE TASK, and each of the 6s to THE VIRTUE and THE DUNGEON. This would mean that the Avatar is to complete the task of Deliver a Message, meditate in the virtue of Honor, and battle in the dungeon of Shame. If the dice results do not allow for further progress, simply assign a dice to an already completed option and do not record any outcomes. <br/>     To settle the task, refer to THE TASK and TASK RESULT tables, assign one of the D6 values to the result and record the outcome on the play sheet. When a task is successfully completed, the Avatar gains favor with the city from which the task was given. Fill in one square for that city on the map portion of the play sheet to track the progress. If the task is failed nothing is recorded. When all four squares are full the city will offer the Avatar a gift which will provide advantages for the rest of the play, these advantages DO stack. It is not required to complete one of each task. <br/>     To settle the virtue, the Avatar simply meditates and gains one point in that virtue. Record the added virtue on the play sheet by filling in a single square next to that virtue on the right side. When all squares are filled, the virtue has been mastered. <br/>     To settle the dungeon, refer to THE DUNGEON and DUNGEON BATTLE tables. Dungeon battles will increase in difficulty as they progress; the last stage of the dungeon is the boss. When a dungeon battle is won, fill in a square next to the associated dungeon to show progress. If the battle is lost, no progress is recorded. The dungeon is considered cleared when the final square is filled in. Refer to the Combat section. <br/>     A second D6 value is assigned to a randomizer, refer to the RANDOMIZER table. <br/>     The third D6 is usually a wildcard but may be used as a task additional result assignment.<br/><br/><br/>Fame and Karma are awarded or taken away depending on the results of THE TASK and THE DUNGEON. As the Avatar increases their Fame, they can use it to increase their power. For every 5,000 points of fame obtained, the Avatar can advance one stat to the next value shown. Refer to the Avatar section for more information. Karma can be traded for combat re-rolls or temporary bonuses, see Karma Allocation. Track the Fame and Karma in the allocated space on the play sheet paperdoll. Karma can be negative, but it does not affect the Avatar.<br/><br/>After all records have been kept and any combat is resolved, start the next round of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The huge influence of Napoleonic combat systems, tactics and weaponry (the flintlock musket was the standard weapon for all Armies until the later 1840&rsquo;s), meant that they remained the standard throughout the world until the full development of the rifled musket. This weapon, which used percussion caps rather than a spark from a flint, together with rifled artillery changed tactics and formations, and ended the Napoleonic Era.<br/><br/>Divisional Commander (DC) is a set of Napoleonic rules to cover the whole Napoleonic era, including the British-American War of 1812, the &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; Wars of Liberation in South America, and the last War of the Napoleonic Era - the 1st Carlist War.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to play battles of this period of medium size, involving a division, or a small corps. DC is designed to allow players to represent historical battles or to play balanced games based on a point system that allows them to play fictional scenarios and to run campaigns or championships.<br/><br/>To represent the intense movements and counter movements of the formations in Napoleonic battles,  DC (as other Capitan Games rules) uses a system that allows more flexibility in the game rather than an &ldquo;I go, you go&rdquo; system.<br/><br/>With the order system and the obligation to choose between different options for units, DC represents the fog of war and the uncertain control a commander has over his troops and his subordinate generals.<br/><br/>Included: Rules, Cover &amp; Back Cover in High Resolution, Tokens &amp; QRS, Napoleonic Army Lists, 1st Carlist War  Rules &amp; Carlist Army Lists<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For two thousand years; from 3000 BC to 1000 BC, warriors fought battles with weapons of bronze. This gleaming red-gold metal is an alloy of copper and tin. The warrior nobles rode into battle in chariots and were clad in bronze armour. Their followers gripped bronze thrusting spears, battle-axes and slashing swords. Battle was a dazzling sight as weapons and armour glinted in the sun amid the clash of bronze against bronze and the clatter of charging chariots. This was the heroic age of legend! When the sand and rubble is cleared away from the mighty ruins of the temples, tombs and strongholds of this time; the tales of these battles are revealed inscribed in stone and on the imperishable tablets of baked clay.<br/><br/>Around the ancient carvings of the warriors, which inspire the model soldiers depicted in this book, are the reports of their deeds on the battlefield. From what they tell us we can recreate battles for our model armies. In this book you will find many battle scenarios and skirmishes all based on real events. We begin with the Sumerians, rival city states. Then we see the rise and fall of the first great empire of the Akkadians. Ancient Egyptians fight to unite their nation and repel Hyksos invaders. The mighty Hammurabi takes on rivals to create the kingdom of Babylon. The chariot Empires of the Hittites and Mitanni clash and try and hold their own against the New Kingdom Pharaohs and the Mycenaeans. Egyptian and Canaanite chariots battle on the plain of Megiddo. Heroes fight duels upon the plain of Troy. Then Sea Peoples and Habiru tribes challenge the chariot lords as we approach the dramatic end of Bronze Age.<br/><br/>Age of Bronze contains 32 scenarios - in addition to the traditional Hail Caesar massed battles we introduce skirmish rules for smaller scale conflicts between warbands so often seen during this period.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from Publisher<br/><br/>",

Only the wise old Daedalus, inventor of genius, still stands against him, helped by a handful of heroes. But these will not cooperate: only one will be the savior of humanity.<br/><br/>Hades Trap is played on a modular board made up of 9 tiles, which allows you to renew your games. Each player plays as a hero who will be able to perform a variable number of actions in turn. You will be able to move around or interact with the square on which you are standing, in order to fight skeletons, activate mechanisms or even knock out your opponents! But beware, if you step on a breadcrumb trail, the Minotaur will be alerted and will run in the direction of its patrol! Maybe this is your chance to pull it towards your enemies?<br/><br/>Collect three of the available medallions and exit the labyrinth to be declared the winner. The medallions can be retrieved in many ways, so you'll need to be resourceful and brave to complete this important quest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bomber is a rock climbing themed push your luck game where two players race to top out on their respective climb. Whilst overcoming challenging route sections, players need to deal with unforeseen events, manage their energy level and gear placement to avoid hitting the ground in case of a likely fall. If you top out first, you win. If you hit the ground when you fall you lose.<br/><br/>First each player decides how much energy they will have and how much gear they want to take on the climb: you can be more risky and have more energy to allow you to climb longer stretches, but the falls also become longer and more serious, whereas having more gear allows for steady progress but you will need more breaks to recover some energy.<br/><br/>Then players take turns deciding how to move along the route, spending energy as they go. For example, it costs no energy to climb across a ledge, but it will take a lot to surmount an overhang or a roof section. Once all energy is spent the player takes a fall. Thus one needs to place gear for protection to prevent falling to the ground (different coloured gear fit only into places with suitable colour, unless it is a bomber placement). When a player places gear, a Place card is taken and the corresponding event is resolved. Every time a player enters a new route tile a Move card is taken and a corresponding event is resolved, which may result in a fall or may replenish some of the player's energy reserves.<br/><br/>",

As mortals you are trying to reveal your 4 columns (8 cards) to appease the gods while avoiding curses and lock/keys.<br/><br/>The game is simple, match the god character cards, top and bottom, in your columns to cancel out the points. If you match multiple adjacent columns with the same god you score a Midas Touch which gives you negative points. Finally, if you are the first one to reveal all cards in your columns you get negative bonus points. The player that gets the fewest points wins.  While that may seem simple, the gods are full of passion and your opponents are full of fury so be ready for curse cards that inflict pandemonium and lock/key cards that stop you from changing the cards in your columns.<br/><br/>The core deck is designed for 2-5 players and the party expansion is designed for 6-10 players. Typical game-play time is 15 minutes per round. Ideal for friends and families that love strategy, laughter, spite, and glory.

        "description": "A gunboat squadron is like a gnat in comparison to the larger ships-of-the-line. Nevertheless, they have a useful place in the fleet. A gunboat would typically have only a single mast with square-rigged sails, mounting between one and three fixed cannons.<br/><br/>Fleets of all navies kept gunboats on hand. They could be useful in shallower waters, as with only a single mounted cannon, they were able to manoeuvre relatively easily where a large ship could not. If this cannon was a 32-pounder it could still prove dangerous to larger vessels. For instance, a frigate could easily destroy a single gunboat with a single broadside hit. But if deployed in large numbers, the frigate would struggle to deal with every gunboat before sustaining heavy damage itself. The extremely cheap cost and relative time is taken to build these gunboats could prove a tremendous advantage.<br/><br/>Gunboats were crucial to Napoleon's notion for the planned invasion of England in 1804, whilst the US Navy's policy between 1803 and 1812 focussed its Navy around the concept - this was to prove ineffectual against the British Blockade in the war of 1812.<br/><br/>In the Game<br/><br/>In Black Seas, Gunboat squadrons are tiny vessels. This means that they are extremely difficult to hit, but are vulnerable to collisions from larger vessels, particularly if that vessel was travelling at speed. They mount only a single light cannon and are too small to allow for upgrades  - their relative evasiveness, however, means that they will be difficult to deal with in battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Centuria is a wargame for two players or more that lets you simulate battles set in the Ancient Period. The game uses our well-known Action/Reaction mechanism but now includes exciting new rules to better simulate the dynamics of these battles and will allow you make many strategic and tactical decisions that will help you on your way to victory. Closing ranks at the right time, charging the enemy when he&rsquo;s disordered and making the most of his hesitation to break his lines, these are just some of the new ways of fighting that you&rsquo;ll find in these pages. The system allows you to play with any scale of miniature and keeps the base sizes fixed while just changing the number of miniatures that are on them. As well as a points system to help you balance your games, each unit also has a Training Value, a value that shows its prowess in Melee, an Armour Value and a number of losses that it can take. The rules also contain three classic scenarios, Vanguard, Ambush and Sacking the Camp which will test your command skills. The game is easy to learn and a normal game will last a couple of hours.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You act as Spymasters and send highly skilled agents to complete a mission or thwart your opponent's goal.<br/><br/>The main objective is for a player to force his opponent to discard The Target card by playing different agent cards such as Sniper or Assassin card.  On the other hand, the player holding The Target card must prevent his opponent from forcing him to discard the Target card by playing agents such as Police or Bodyguard until the game ends.<br/><br/>A player can also win the game by playing The Package card or get eliminated in the middle of the game by losing The Package card if he is forced by his opponent to discard it.<br/><br/>The game is dynamic as your mission may change during the game.  You may be trying to eliminate The Target during the start, then may find yourself protecting The Target towards the end.  The game ends when the (52-card deck) draw pile is depleted.  But be careful, the player holding The Bomb card at the end of the game also loses.

        "description": "The Devil&rsquo;s Crown is a campaign for Fistful of Lead: Tales of Horror. The campaign is a series of 6 linked scenarios to be played in order. The outcome of each scenario has a direct effect on the next game. The player with the most Renown at the end of the campaign wins, and possesses the dark power of the crown.<br/><br/>The scenario book also has rules for a new faction: Gypsies! Sometimes against, sometimes with the Forces of Darkness.<br/><br/>And a printable catacomb for use with scenario book.<br/><br/>&quot;Few know that the War in Heaven was only surpassed in length and ferocity by the War in Hell. Soon after the Fall, Lucifer was faced with a power struggle of his own. The Legions of the Damned fought a fierce civil war for the Infernal Throne that lasted untold ages.<br/>As a symbol of his victory over the fractious demons, the princes of Hell presented their Dread Lord with a crown. Forged in the very fires of Hell, the crown was a thing of terrible beauty, dripping with blood, and pulsing with malign power.<br/>Not long after the coronation, the crown was stolen, perhaps by a disgruntled devil of the losing faction. It was hidden, it was said, in the mortal world. Many have sought it, few, thankfully, have found it. Those who do, usually meet with an untimely and painful end.&rdquo;<br/>- From the writings of Brother Theodoseus, just before his mysterious death in 1563<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The wolves cannot harm them. Once the last wolf is removed from the board, the shepherds have won.<br/><br/>The wolves move fast and work in a pack.

Covering the period from the late 1950s to the modern day or near future.<br/><br/>The game can be played with fleets ranging in size form one or two ships per side to full sized battlegroups of ten or more ships. The rules can be used for different sizes of ships ranging from small fast attack craft up to super-carriers engaged in open sea battles or littoral and amphibious missions.<br/><br/>The aim of these rules is to create a game that captures the feel and provides a fairly accurate recreation of modern naval engagements but is still relatively quick to play with reasonably sized fleets and does not require excessive bookkeeping and paperwork.<br/><br/>New 2021 Edition<br/>This new version of the rules is the culmination of years of playing the game and the execellent feedback and expertise provided by the Naval Command Facebook group. As well as lots of small improvements and updates the follwing changes have been made:<br/><br/>New system for submarine deployment, movement, and detection that will require players to carry out effective ASW tactics.<br/>The addition of altitude levels for aircraft and missiles meaning that different air defence systems now have more well defined roles.<br/>Improved missile and torpedo procedures<br/>Updated and expanded fleet lists.<br/>&mdash;description from the designer on wargamevault.com<br/><br/>",

        "description": "18th century GAME OF WAR wargame rules are designed for 25mm or 28mm scale figures with 16 figures per infantry battalion, 4 figures per cavalry squadron, and artillery units of one model cannon and up to 4 gunners. <br/>They are intended to be in the &lsquo;old school&rsquo; stream of wargaming popularised by the likes of Donald Featherstone and Terry Wise - which means lots of dice throwing and gentlemanly conduct on the part of the players while bringing out the subtle tactics of this period of history! <br/>Units have variable motivation and training, straggler losses happen due to disruption during battle (which is recoverable by dressing ranks), nuances in both artillery and small arms development are represented, and besides that you can have units lie down, set buildings on fire, read a treatise on rates of fire in the rules, use optional rules for sickness and supply, and employ the rules for weather, decoys, and unit characterisation - I say, what more could a budding general want!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "プレシャスメモリーズ (&quot;Precious Memories&quot;) is a two player trading card game, following standard play of building decks and competing head to head. Players draw cards to their hand, discard those they don't want to use, play character cards and event cards to the front of their playmat, and support cards tucked under character cards. Players tap cards to trigger actions and many cards have special events related to the card. The first player to reach seven points, or to drive their opponent to exhaust their deck, wins.<br/><br/>The game is themed around building memories of popular anime series. The game is designed to allow players to mix up characters and events from different series, and so build their own adventures. Players can build decks around themes in different TV shows, such as a swimsuit deck. As such, the game is lavishly illustrated with artwork from many series, with each anime artist created on the cards.<br/><br/>The game has a starter pack with a pre-built deck (1 type / 60 cards), rule sheet, and playmat. The starter pack weighs about 0.40kg.<br/><br/>As with other TCGs, there are many extra decks, booster packs, and special bonus cards, that players may trade.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Players compose their forces from an army list, and add extra support like artillery or trenches, or fortified Pa in the case of the Maori forces. <br/>There are multiple scenarios and deployments to play, and the variety of possible army lists adds to the replayability.<br/><br/>Officers and Ariki (Maori Chiefs) also factor in, being able to issue orders and fight. <br/>Rules are provided for muskets, carbines, swords, taiaha, patu, pistols and a few other melee weapons. <br/>Maori forces can upgrade regular soldiers to be combat specialists, as well as being able to field sawn-off double barreled shotguns (called Tupara), artillery and various other forms of support. Most soldiers can be given horses too and made mounted. <br/>Colonial forces can field regular British soldiers, militia, forest rangers, as well as artillery and can also make use of horses.<br/><br/>28mm Miniatures are recommended, and the author uses the wonderful Empress miniatures made for this conflict. Any scale would work with these rules though.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Guns with slow rates of fire are penalised. As the game turn is now longer, the damage inflicted has been increased, and there is a bit more differentiation between different gun calibres. <br/>     Hull Damage and Special Damage is evaluated separately for each hit. Some weapons will not damage the hull but could affect the ship in other ways. You cannot sink a destroyer with a machine gun, but you could suppress the gun crews. <br/>     Torpedoes are represented by individual tracks, so the player needs to have a good aim and be able to judge the distance to the target.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The rules also allow for the use of Aircraft, Submarines, Minefields and Armed Merchant ships. <br/>     The data annexe has been expanded and now covers over 250 vessels and 200 aircraft.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Game support material (template, record sheet, erratas) is available to download on the publisher's website.<br/><br/><br/>Turn Sequence:<br/><br/>     Determine initiative <br/>     Movement Phase: a)drifting vessels / b)Contact Markers and Ships / c)aircraft <br/>     Spotting <br/>     Damage Control and Repairs <br/>     Shoot guns, attack using aircraft <br/>     Torpedo attacks  a) Advance existing tracks  b) Launch new tracks  c) Resolve any torpedo attacks <br/>     End Phase <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great War is usually portrayed and imagined with the blasted landscapes of the static, trench warfare that emerged late in 1914 and persisted far into the conflict. However, while it is fair to recognize that much of WWI was characterized by this stalemate, it is also fair to point out that the early and later parts of the war were witness to operations of maneuver in which armies sought to take key positions and outflank enemy forces.<br/><br/>And it is these early battles of WWI which inspired us, some friends in the industry, and some wargaming collaborators to focus on that particular period of WWI. Our aim was to produce a set of wargames rules that caters to this style of fighting and challenges the players with constant tactical decisions and does not burden them with a lot of rules. 1914 shares some mechanisms with our WWII game, Iron Cross, so players familiar with that ruleset will recognize this one, but it plays differently.<br/><br/>The battalion is the core tactical element in the game in a formation that is roughly the size of a British brigade. The game mechanisms are easy to grasp and make the game flow smoothly and ensure that both sides are always involved, especially when an opponent is activating units. 1914 is a game in which players act as the overall commander for the battle, developing and co-ordinating a plan for the achievement of operational objectives, and entrusting individual battalions to execute those plans. It is purposely uncomplicated to allow players to concentrate on the scale of the battle, but the action/reaction system ensures that all players are involved at all times, making tactical decisions affecting their own commands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But are you the greatest monster? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out, and that&rsquo;s to pit yourself against other monsters in a game of Monster Mayhem! Compete against your fellow monsters in rooms containing bubbling acid, exploding rockets, tentacled terrors, rickety bridges, and much, much more for the thrill&mdash;nay, the honor&mdash;of being crowned the greatest monster ever.<br/><br/>Monster Mayhem is a push your luck social party game for 4-12 players.  Players choose a monster and vote token, and then take turns reading scenario cards.  Afterwards, all players vote on the scenario simultaneously.  Depending on how players vote, players gain or lose points.  At the end of the game (typically 8 scenarios which takes about 30 minutes), the monster with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Here is an example scenario from the game:<br/><br/>The Rickety Bridge <br/>Two bridges lie before you. The one on the left is sturdy; the one on the right is barely standing. There is a greater reward for taking the right bridge, that is if it doesn&rsquo;t collapse and drop you down onto the sharp rocks below&hellip;<br/><br/>Monsters choose to take the sturdy left bridge or the rickety right bridge.<br/><br/>Taking the left bridge will reward 1 point. Taking the right bridge will reward 3 points.  However, if 50% or more of all monsters take the rickety right bridge it collapses, causing all those monsters to fall and lose 2 points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Snipers! is designed to commemorate the hard fighting that took place in Italy during World War II. <br/>The German troops faced a determined Allied attack that came over difficult terrain in terrible conditions of cold, rain, snow, heat and dust. The advantages lay with the defender and that made the attacks costly and time consuming. Often both sides seemed to be in a quagmire that sapped morale and destroyed equipment and devoured manpower. In the end, the Allies prevailed, but their sacrifice, valor and victory were overshadowed by the D-Day landings and the campaigns in France and Germany.<br/><br/>This game system is fast to learn, fun to play and reflective of the realities of warfare of the Second World War. The user will not have to invest in large armies or costly terrain pieces. With a little skill and some imagination players will be able to recreate and reenact some of the most difficult kinds of combat faced by American GI's, the Canadian Armed Services and the famous British Tommies. House to house fighting against one of the most cunning and deadly enemies of the Twentieth Century; The Nazis.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Your clan controls provinces, represented by castles on the Daimyo board.<br/><br/>To win a game of Daimyo, you will score your clan&rsquo;s provinces, your Honour, economy and much more in a tight race to become the most powerful clan in Feudal Japan.<br/><br/>Each game is played over 3 turns (Wars) comprising the following phases:<br/><br/>The Alliance phase<br/>The Action phase<br/>The Battle phase<br/><br/>The Alliance Phase is where players vie to determine who they will be allied with and against for the coming battle.<br/>Allies are typically immune from being attacked by your forces and can prove to be your greatest asset, sending reinforcements to help you attack and defend your provinces. <br/>However, alliances are fickle and even your closest ally could turn on you by employing Sabotage cards to poison your army, kidnap your general or blow open your fortresses with Chinese cannons.<br/><br/>The Action Phase combines the best parts of worker placement with a quintessentially Martin Wallace spin. Place Action Cubes to expand your armies, build fortresses, buy more resources to transport your forces, disrupt other player&rsquo;s plans and much more.<br/><br/>During the Battle Phase you will attempt to conquer the provinces of other players or the neutral provinces on the board that have yet to have a ruling clan.

All you need are some six-sided dice and some coins to provide weight for the aircraft counters.  Everything else can be printed from this ruleset.<br/><br/>Each player has a flight of four bombers, represented by two counters.  Aircraft counters move by means of curved &ldquo;performance rulers&rdquo; that represent the aircraft&rsquo;s historical cornering ability and maximum speed<br/><br/>Each performance ruler is unique to each aircraft, and contains all the speed, cornering, and weapon information needed.<br/><br/>TAC is designed for portability;  The entire game can fit in a plastic bag.  Even the largest battles can take place on a fast-food restaurant table.<br/><br/>Each aircraft is sold separately.  Only pay for the ones you want, and print out as many copies as you need to create your own epic WWII air battle.<br/><br/>The Liberator was faster than the B-17, had a longer range, and carried a larger bomb load. Over 18,000 Liberators were built, more than any other Allied aircraft. However, it was overshadowed by the older B-17&rsquo;s fame and apparent toughness, much like the Spitfire took more glory than the equally capable Hurricane. The Liberator&rsquo;s longer range made it ideal for the Pacific theater, and took the more difficult missions into the heart of Germany.<br/><br/>This set is a self-contained rulebook with miniatures for the B-24 Liberator and three scenarios that reference other aircraft.<br/><br/>     Operation Tidal Wave:  A low level attack on the Ploesti oil refineries.<br/>     Berlin:  Liberators attack a railroad station in Berlin.

        "description": "Having been an avid player of Air Wargames and computer air combat games for many years I decided long ago that of all periods and genres the &rsquo;Air Game&rsquo; had great characteristics as an introductory game for new wargamers, if only the rules could be simplified. <br/>Most air games which try and deal with the complexities of multiple dimensions, and the problems of spotting in combat, find a convoluted and complex method of doing it; which drops the game pace to a crawl. <br/>Unit count is low however, and the period and genre has glamour&hellip;<br/><br/>The objective of these rules, and the Combatdice system in general, is to allow these complex situations to be gamed simply&hellip;but without losing the realism of the period.<br/><br/>So in Bandits you will discover recon missions, bombing runs, fighter on fighter scenarios, and the air full of missiles and chaff, without hopefully becoming a full time accountant or bookkeeper. <br/>The overall concept owes much to the work of Mike Spick and his studies of air combat through the ages. <br/>The central concept of this work is that Situational Awareness (SA) is the dominant trait of Aces (the 5% of pilots who account for over 40% of all air to air kills!), this is the ability to be able to analyse the location, and situation of fast moving units to allow action to be taken that gives a good possibility for attack and escape.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It deliberately moves away from competitive play, and instead is focused on an ongoing campaign where the cast of characters encounter new challenges each game.<br/>Character creation is completely open-ended and freeform, with each character tailored to match their miniature and concept. <br/>Likewise, scenarios are intended to have objectives that can change as the characters meet, fight, negotiate and explore. Rather than list-building and point-scoring, the game is instead meant to encourage creativity and picaresque storytelling.<br/><br/>As well as using dice rolls to resolve actions, each character uses a deck of playing cards to track injuries suffered, blood loss, degradation of virtue and expenditure of willpower. Whilst using a simple framework, the mechanics have room to be customised so that a wide variety of characters can all play in different and interesting ways.<br/><br/>Gameplay tends towards fairly low lethality; killing enemy characters is difficult, but combat is useful as it allows you to injure (and so weaken) enemies, and lets you control the tempo of the game. This control of the tempo of the game so you can react to your opponent's moves or preempt their strategy is key to success; by the time blows are exchanged there's probably been a great deal of maneuvering and negotiation.<br/><br/>The book contains:<br/><br/>     Basic rules for movement, shooting, fighting, magic, and other actions.<br/>     Special rules for duels, jousts, taking prisoners and so on.<br/>     Guidelines for character creation, including various character archetypes.<br/>     A medieval armoury to equip characters with, ranging from simple weapons and armour, legendary weapons, different mounts, and stranger equipment.<br/>     Various example special abilities for characters, such as fighting styles, the authority of noblewomen, and supernatural gifts. Likewise, a selection of example spells from schools such as enchantment, necromancy, vivimancy, shamanism, theurgy, infernalism and alchemy.<br/>     14 sample characters and 15 example monsters.<br/>     Guides to scenario design.<br/>     Various sidebars spotlighting different aspects of the setting, such as woodwoses, knightly orders, marquesses and hermits.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Father Tilly is a set of wargames rules designed to re-fight the battles of the Thirty Years War.<br/><br/>The rules are aimed at players with 25/28mm figures to fight both small scale encounters all the way up to larger battles.<br/><br/>The mechanics are fast and simple and allow players to quickly resolve shooting or melee with hardly a glance back to the rules. <br/>In addition to the rules system there are a number of cards or &quot;war-tokens&quot; that players use to complement the action on the table. The skilled use of these tokens allow players to further influence the game play but they also introduce an element of risk: powder explosions, drunken generals, mutinies and looting soldiers are all hazards that players have to face. The advantage of using the &quot;war-tokens&quot; (other than the sheer level of fun that they introduce) is that they allow some of the more unforeseen and random events to occur without clogging up the game mechanics with added lengthy rules.<br/><br/>In addition to the Father Tilly rules comes the first of several supplements: <br/>The Bohemian Revolt covers the early stages of the war and includes army lists, generals profiles, a Battle of White Mountain scenario and additional &quot;war-tokens&quot; specifically designed for this early period.   <br/>My aim when writing Father Tilly was not to create a generic set of &quot;pike &amp; shot&quot; rules that covers hundreds of years of European warfare but to concentrate specifically on the fascinating, surprisingly varied and brutal conflict known as the Thirty Years War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

What makes Runya special is the vast number of games<br/>you can find that are capable of earning your living.  Each week there are large tournaments that pay cash prizes.  Once per month in each of the 8 regions of Runya, the winners of weekly events are invited to a Regional Tournament.<br/><br/>Regional winners are automatically entered in the annual event held in the capitol city of Liberia.  The National tournament is the largest event in the Kingdom and is played over the course of 7 days.  Players bring their avatars and compete in a series of randomly chosen game types.  Brackets include solo play as well as teams and occasionally players will be forced into co-op situations with competitors.<br/><br/>This year, the main event of the Nationals is a new dungeon<br/>crawling game, aptly named &ldquo;Dungeon Crawlers&rdquo;.  Who will<br/>come out on top?  Let&rsquo;s find out!<br/><br/>In this game you'll play as one of 8 Heroes from the 1st Season of the &quot;Legends of Runya&quot; series.<br/><br/>Game Setup aka (Building the Dungeon)<br/><br/>1. Ensure all meeples are in the drawing bag and shake them up.<br/><br/>2. Separate and stack all the decks Floor tiles, find the 4way starting tile, then shuffle the rest and put it on top of the deck.<br/><br/>Shop cards, shuffle all 20 shop cards and deal them into 4 stacks of 5.<br/><br/>Potion cards, put 3 potions on top of each stack of 5 shop cards<br/><br/>Boss/Treasure cards, With the treasure pile or boss faces UP, shuffle them blindly (Yes, this means that you will KNOW which boss is coming up. Place them strategically)<br/><br/>3. Each player choose an avatar from the 8 Heroes.<br/><br/>4.  The person who chose an avatar first will place the first tile in the center of your play space.  (This will be the 4way tile with blue lights in the corners).  Place 1 gem in that room and roll the Monster die to see how many monsters are in that room.  (Then draw them at random from the meeple bag.  Continue taking turns clockwise placing tiles and spawning monsters using the Monster die.  This continues until you no longer can place a tile or you have placed all of them.<br/><br/>THE ENTIRE DUNGEON WILL BE BUILT BEFORE THE GAME BEGINS<br/><br/>Rules for placing tiles and spawning monsters<br/>1.  You MUST place the 4way tile FIRST<br/>2.  Starter tiles must leave space for the shop cards behind them.                            <br/>3.  As long as at least ONE corridor connects, you can place a tile.<br/>           (Yes, even if 2 other corridors end at a wall)<br/>4.  When you place a starter tile, you do NOT roll the Monster die.<br/>                  (Starter tiles are free of monsters)<br/>5.  When you place a &ldquo;Boss&rdquo; tile, you do NOT roll the Monster die, instead, you take the top card from the Boss/Treasure deck and place it on that tile face-up (Monster details up, Treasure chamber picture up)<br/>6.  Whenever you roll a 5 or 6 on the Monster die, that room gets a gem due to it&rsquo;s difficulty to clear.  Whoever kills the last monster in that room gets the gem.<br/>7.  Once all tiles are placed and Monsters have been spawned, place a shop outside of each starter tile<br/>8.  Place avatars on the starter tiles with the picture of your chosen Hero.  If the starter tile for your Hero didn&rsquo;t get placed, place your avatar in the 4way tile. <br/> ONLY THOSE STANDING IN A STARTER TILE CAN SEE INVENTORY IN THE ATTACHED SHOP  <br/>It is a secret what items you have available in your shop when you start.<br/><br/>Now you are ready to play!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Guided by a Noble pilot, an Imperial Knight moves with a speed and grace that should not be possible from such a towering engine of war. Enemy fire pinging harmlessly off its thick armour, ion shields flashing with brilliant light, the Imperial Knight unleashes incredibly powerful weaponry, able to wipe entire battalions off the map with a single volley of explosive chain-gun fire. Should any enemy survive this bullet hell, the Knight also wields terrifying close-combat capabilities &ndash; smashing through the thickest armour with its enormous gauntlets and crushing foes under its massive feet. To see a squadron of Imperial Knights is to gaze upon the full splendour &ndash; and might &ndash; of the Imperium.<br/><br/>Codex: Imperial Knights contains a wealth of background and rules &ndash; the definitive book for Imperial Knights collectors.

Players take on the role of Cybermancers, masters of digital combat, who summon virtual avatars to fight for them in the Virtual Arena.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a 30 card Summoning Deck, containing the warriors he will summon to the battlefield. Both players draw 7 cards from their Summoning Deck, then draw 5 cards each from the CPU and RAM Power Deck, which will be used to pay the summoning costs of each warrior. Cybermancy uses a unique dual-track power system, in which players decide each round whether to increase the amount of CPU or RAM available for summoning. This allows unlimited flexibility in designing each deck, as well as important tactical choices every round.<br/><br/>Players can attack their opponent's warriors or the enemy avatar itself. When either Cybermancer's health is reduced to zero, the game is over and the surviving Cybermancer wins!<br/><br/>The base game includes complete decks of cards for both the Human and Undead factions. Unlike collectible card games, Cybermancy provides all of the cards right out of the box, and even allows for players to mix and match warriors from different factions. Future expansions will include warrior tribes such as Robots, Aliens, Celestials, Demons, Dinosaurs and more!<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to collect 3 sets of non-identical camping item &amp; activity cards, from the same category, in order to &ldquo;Camp Out.&rdquo; The camping items and activities span six categories, which include the campsite itself, food &amp; drink, wildlife, hiking &amp; fishing, things at the beach, and play and relaxation.<br/><br/>As you play Camp Out, Match Cards help your hand, and a set of six &lsquo;game-changer&rsquo; cards called &ldquo;Trail Mix.&rdquo; Trail Mix cards can help or hinder your game play, depending who plays them, and how and when they are played. For instance, the &ldquo;Avalanche&rdquo; Trail Mix card can be used to make all players shift three of their cards to their left, or the player holding the card can choose to not enforce it. With another Trail Mix card called &ldquo;Cherry Picking,&rdquo; a player gets to dig into the discard pile for the right card, which will help their hand. With another Trail Mix card, &ldquo;Leap Frog&rdquo; makes the players to either side of the one holding the card exchange two cards simultaneously.<br/><br/>The way in which this &ldquo;pickup &amp; discard&rdquo; game plays out, includes a playing feature both near the end, and at the end of a round, which gives Camp Out its name. When a player is one turn from possibly going out, they signal the other players by announcing their status with the word &ldquo;Camp.&rdquo; They do this not only to alert others, but also in order to garner 3 &ldquo;Camp&rdquo; points, which they would not get if they go out, or &ldquo;Camp Out,&rdquo; on their following turn.<br/><br/>The final playing feature, which can actually give the remaining players an edge over the winner of the round, is the choice of a final card draw, which they are not allowed to discard.<br/><br/>Final card hands are scored in various ways, depending on their makeup.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But without formal discipline Maori were more dependent on their leaders. With the loss of a chief a war party would likely flee even on the brink of victory. To reflect this Maori Leaders count 4 (instead of 3) as per Breakpoiny.<br/><br/>Tupara (double barrel shotguns). These weapons can fire twice before reloading. If the second shot is fired in the same activation it can only be fired at the same target that get a -1 on Firing Damage test. This reflects that the British usually went flat after the first shot because they expected the second shot.<br/><br/>Hand weapons - They are melee weapons and allow a re-roll in melee.<br/><br/>Bayonets - Re-loading a Muzzle loading musket takes longer if bayonet is fixed. Add 1 to re-loading time when bayonet is fixed. Miniatures are supposed to start the game with unfixed bayonets. Bayonets can be fixed with one action, it can be also a Group Action.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Most youngsters play at 'dogfights' with model aircraft clenched in their hands, but this form of play does not even attempt to simulate reality. The adult wargamer requires something rather more sophisticated but, until now, the major problem has been recreating the third dimension. Happily, thanks to Mike Spick's unique system, the problem is now resolved for all time.<br/><br/>In these pages you will find data and proven playing rules enabling you to fight an individual combat between, say, a Spitfire and a Bf 109; a multi-fighter melee;the interception of a wave of bombers; a dive-bomber attack with a Stuka; a valiant 'Stringbag' attack on a battleship; a bombing raid; or even a kamikaze attack if you feel so inclined!<br/><br/>The book includes playing suggestions, in fact, for all forms of aerial combat during World War 2, including night fighting with radar; scenario suggestions for aerial campaigns using a miniature 'ops room'; and ideas for solo games.<br/><br/>Included in the text are extensive data tables giving necessary facts on dozens of representative aircraft types of all main nationalities, and you can control your own aircraft from take-off to touch-down, climbing, diving, looping, firing your machine-guns or cannon and, hopefully, sending your opponent down in flames.<br/><br/>Although aerial wargaming must, of necessity, be more complex in some ways than straightforward land battles, the author's lively style makes this book a pleasure to read.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The only thing exactly like fighting against a Messerschmitt 109 with a Spitfire I in 1940 is fighting against a Messerschmitt 109 with a Spitfire I in 1940 . . . Nevertheless, [this] air combat simulation probably comes as close as any game can to giving the 'feel' of what air combat is really like.<br/><br/>&mdash;quote from the foreword<br/><br/>160-page illustrated hardback book with color dust jacket. The major chapters include principles of Flight; Combat flying, aerobatics, and tactics; Compromise and the needs of wargaming; Observation; Aerial gunnery; Air-to-ground and ground-to-air; The table-top game; Large-scale air warfare; Campaign details; and Simulating night fighting. Statistics are provided for various World War II fighter and bomber aircraft fielded by Britain, America, France, Russia, Germany, Italy, and Japan.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Energetic is a 4-6 player cooperative board game about the future of New York City. It comes with a map board, three card decks, 142 infrastructure pieces, and more. You play from 2021 to 2035, a turn each year. Your team must work together to balance your budget, your grid stability, and your public opinion to keep the lights on, win elections, overcome climate impacts, and build 16 gigawatts of clean power for the city. Then you will have replaced all fossil fuels, provided there is a matching reduction in demand from behavior change and efficiency.<br/><br/>Our objective is to give players a quick grounding in what solving climate change actually means, in a physical and social sense, based on demand of energy and the types of renewable or carbon neutral generation that can supply 8 million New Yorkers.<br/><br/>As you play, one thing you'll realize is that this problem is big, and our response must be too. This means, among other things, that it will be visible. Playing a single Solar piece represents building a piece of infrastructure nearly half the size of Manhattan. Playing a single Wind piece represents the construction of 167 metal structures, each nearly as tall as the Eiffel Tower, miles off the Long Island coast.<br/><br/>We hope playing this game can make your role in the coming decade more effective, better informed, and more powerful, and that by providing a tangible vision of what part of the solution looks like, society can begin the necessary step of reorienting itself towards this larger goal. It's a lot of fun, too!<br/><br/>During development, Energetic was tested and enjoyed by people ages 11 to 60, including middle school students, MIT energy PhDs, former commodity traders, and leaders at environmental NGOs. The game is in use at organizations including Yale University; Carnegie Mellon University; Nature Energy; NYSERDA; Con Edison; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC); and the British Government's Department for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In many countries it is dangerous to be a Christian and they must meet in secret. The government sees them as a major threat and has engaged the secret service. As Secret Service agents conduct house searches, patrol and guard the border, Christians try to smuggle Bibles and do their best to spread the gospel. Who can you trust?<br/><br/>The game if playable for groups of 2-20 players. It is suitable for large groups of 10 to 20 players as a group game and for 2-9 players in the form of a card game! Including an accessible conversation starter from Open Doors about prosecution.<br/><br/>CARDGAME 2-9 players<br/>In the card game for 2-9 players, every player receives a (hidden) role card that decides whether he's in team &quot;believers&quot; or &quot;secret agents&quot;. Players also get 3-5 character cards, depending on the amount of players. There are &quot;believers&quot; and &quot;secret agents&quot; among those cards, these are the cards people will try to collect. Most of the other cards are action cards that may help people achieve their goals, like viewing another players role card, forcing other players to discard, grab a specific card from the discard pile or even change your role card with another player to switch teams.<br/><br/>Players will need to make sure that all of the cards in their hand fit their role card to win. When a player only has character cards fitting its role, he wins for the amount of card +2 bonus points. Teammates will be awarded the amount of cards MINUS the character cards fitting their role, making it a valid strategy as well not to collect those cards and actively trying to help their teammates. Players can also collect as many cards from the other team and try to switch to that team. All in all, a rather quick and dynamic card game for 2-9 players.<br/><br/>GROUP GAME 10-20 players<br/>When playing with 10-20 players, it is a role playing game. There's a game leader who hands every player a character card and. The group is basically divided in two (equally strong) teams of believers and secret agents. The game is played in 7 &quot;nights&quot; where every player will close their eyes until they want to perform an action. All players can only choose one action to perform. In general the believers can choose one of two options: either smuggle bibles or try to convert agents. The secret agents can try to stop both. The game leader registers the amount of players for each action. Believers are successful if they gain a majority over the secret agents &quot;defending&quot; and option. Converting secret agents can be a strong strategy because not only it may &quot;create&quot; a new believer, but also reduces the amount of secret agents. However, it is not without dangers: if the secret agents have a majority guarding against that action, it may result in a believer being arrested.<br/><br/>Some of the believers and secret agents have special abilities that may help their teams successfully achieve their goals. Like a detective (secret agent) who can try to arrest believers and a lawyer (believer) who can exonerate them or characters that can gather and communicate extra information. Other special characters make the game even more dynamic, like a &quot;traitor&quot; (starting as a believer but automatically switching to the secret agents after 3 rounds are played) and its &quot;researcher&quot; mirror character (starting as secret agent and becoming a believer after 3 rounds).<br/><br/>Believers win if they successfully smuggle bibles 4 out of 7 rounds or if they convert all secret agents. Secret agents win if they prevent the smuggling of bibles 4 times or if they arrest all believers. <br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Combat is straight forward, you choose an opposing playing than by parties throw a dice per card they own and if they throw the card value you they get a hit and that the amount of enemy cards are discarded, the Leader card is discarded last.  In Missile combat, only cards with missiles weapons can be used.  The winner of any combat receives Booty Tokens.<br/><br/>The other way to kill an enemy Leader is to Challenge him with your Leader in One-to-One combat, he may refused by giving you a Booty Token.<br/><br/>Booty Tokens can be used instead of discarding cards, and in recruiting goblin cards and in a Challenge.<br/><br/>You win, you must have the only Leader Card left in play.<br/><br/>There are a number of Goblin and Leader cards which have special abilities.<br/><br/>The game is free to print and is available to download below.<br/><br/>I design the cards to be published in a games club magazine in the 1980s , this is why the cards are available only in black and white. so they could be photocopied on to card, but it was never published.

        "description": "The Will Street Detective Agency has received a tip about The Seaside Strangler murders that has led you, a consulting detective, to nearby Gold Hook Island to investigate. The tiny island of Gold Hook is home to a mere 32 families and can only be reached by ferry. With a few eating establishments, stretches of uninhabited beachfront, and The Kingfisher hotel, Gold Hook is a quaint tourist getaway in temperate months and is mostly cut off from the mainland in the winter. After the National Weather Service announces that a nor&rsquo;easter is headed their way, the residents of Gold Hook begin to evacuate the island using the small ferry that makes the two mile journey back and forth to the mainland. On its way back to pick up the last batch of residents, the ferry experiences a mechanical failure that renders it inoperable, leaving you and a few other people behind on the island to fend for themselves during the storm. Not long after the storm begins to hammer the coastline of Gold Hook, one of those left behind is found strangled with a length of strangely knotted rope, leading you to conclude that The Seaside Strangler is one of those who didn&rsquo;t make it back to the mainland. The police and Coast Guard are unavailable for the next twenty-four hours due to the extreme weather so help will not be coming any time soon. Leaving the island is not an option. Your only choice...determine who The Seaside Strangler is and close a case that the police have been unable to close.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 6.5/10<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Voodoo Mary was at the pinnacle of rock stardom in the 90&rsquo;s, charting a string of hits, playing to sold-out stadiums around the world, and even notching a Grammy nomination. Somewhat of an anomaly, the band itself was a revolving door for musicians that served as a vehicle for the band&rsquo;s namesake, principal songwriter, and only original member, Mary Kershaw. The world, however, loved Voodoo Mary and were captivated by her voice which had once been described as &ldquo;a bayou blend of cigarette smoke, attitude, and smooth whiskey.&rdquo; Yet, like so many bands, their star doesn&rsquo;t shine quite as brightly anymore, and they are a shadow of the band they used to be, playing in clubs with a capacity of 500 instead to arenas of 20,000. Desperate to right the ship and help Voodoo Mary reclaim its spot amongst rock royalty, manager Reg Kennedy announced suddenly that all of the band members and road crew would be replaced at the end of the tour in hopes of finding a group of professionals who could do justice to Mary&rsquo;s impressive catalog of songs. Tempers and tensions understandably ran high because of the decision, but the two shows leading up to the end of the tour went off well despite it all. The Carbon Underground was set to be the last show with the current band and road crew. Everything seemed to be going according to schedule until Reg didn&rsquo;t show up for the VIP Meet and Greet, leaving Mary&rsquo;s personal assistant to manage the event. A throng of fans was actually in the middle of posing for photos with Mary and the rest of the band when someone accidentally bumped one of the equipment cases near the stage, causing the body of a very dead band manager to fall out. Get your Backstage Pass to Voodoo Mary&rsquo;s Carbon Underground show and solve the mystery of who killed Reg Kennedy!<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7/10<br/><br/>",

That many cards are revealed from the deck to form the forage pile. Players then have two optional actions they can perform:<br/><br/><br/>     Buy cards using stones to add to your personal collection. <br/>     Sell two cards of the same type (any two mushrooms/beetles/berries) for 5 stones.<br/><br/><br/>Buying and selling may only be done once per turn, in any order. Once the deck runs out, each player gets one bonus turn to spend their extra stones and then scoring commences! Players who have the most of a given category get to score those cards and all players with identical pair of cards get to score those.<br/><br/>And that's it! It sounds simple but you need to keep on top of what your opponent is doing so you don't end up empty handed.<br/><br/>",

For disobeying Hitler&rsquo;s express order not to withdraw the LVI Panzer Corps in the face of certain annihilation, Weidling was told over the telephone that he had been condemned to death by firing squad. Instead of attempting to avoid his execution by escape or suicide, Weidling drove to Berlin and walked into the Fu&uml;hrerbunker. Adolf Hitler, so impressed by his general&rsquo;s courage, not only canceled the firing squad&mdash;he ordered 53-year old Helmuth Weidling to take command of Berlin&rsquo;s defenses.2 &ldquo;You might just as well have me shot,&rdquo; Weidling remarked dryly to a staff orderly. As Berlin&rsquo;s newest commandant&mdash;the previous three had each been sacked by Hitler&mdash;Weidling faced insurmountable challenges. He lacked manpower and even the most basic supplies, such as food and small arms ammunition. Berlin also lacked proper defensive fortifications and to complicate the situation further, Hitler&rsquo;s adamant refusal to evacuate non-combatants meant that key military bastions&mdash;like the impregnable Zoo flak tower&mdash;were clogged with thousands of panicked civilians. But Weidling&rsquo;s greatest challenge loomed farther east. The Red Army.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You don't roll dice in a hope for a hit. If you can reach your target you instantly deliver a blow. Fighting in Hyper Light Flicker is about a consideration for the right moment to attack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     One against many. You don't cut through cannon fodder. Each Denizen has an equal footing with your Wanderer, however the game gives you a fair chance to survive against a dozen of opponents. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Fast pace resolution. You don't consider a dedicated turn of your opponents.

The players will have to study the path that allows them to collect the most treasure coins.<br/><br/>PHASE 2: Each player places an acetate sheet over his/her own copy of the temple map, and, with an erasable marker, traces the pathway he/she memorized.<br/><br/>PHASE 3: To verify the correctness of the route and count the treasures collected, each player, in turn, places their acetate sheet on the treasure map. It will be easy to understand who the winner of the challenge is!<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to complete the path collecting as many treasures and points as possible.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is universal for any party and is designed for a company where they like to spend an interesting time:<br/><br/>☑ easy and short rules, time of learning &mdash; up to 5 minutes;<br/>☑ the game will decorate any party, even the one where everyone is &quot;driving&quot;;<br/>☑ you can play both the three of us and the big company;<br/>☑ the goal is not so much the victory, as an interesting and fun process of the game.<br/><br/>Don (chairman of the Mexican mafia) chooses a successor among the players. But his adviser, who dreams of heading the cartel, constantly arranges pretenders all sorts of tricks, trying to show that they are all only &quot;green&quot; Mexicans, and do not deserve to take the place of the Don.<br/><br/>The set includes cards of two types &mdash; 45 orders of the Don (performed by the player), 45 insidious interference of the Advisor (the player transfers their performance to any other player) and the rules of the game.<br/><br/>What if it is impossible to execute two (three) Advisor card tips simultaneously? Hence, you are unlucky and the chances of becoming a &quot;green Mexican&quot; have increased significantly :) For example, if one card says that the left hand should be held at the back of the head, and the other that the left hand should cover the knee, then one must break at least one of the cards of insidious advice.<br/><br/>What if the player can not fulfill the order of Don described in the card? What can not mean?! He does not want to disappoint Don? :) You need to try until it works out. But if, nevertheless, the task is not fulfilled, then such a card goes into a dump, turn the card upside down.<br/><br/>A pause is possible? What pauses? The struggle for the cartel's empire is in full swing! Ordering alcohol, chewing a fragrant shish kebab or answering the phone call, the player is obliged to fulfill all orders of the Don assigned to him or cards with tips of the adviser.<br/><br/>The most enterprising and attentive will win, but everyone will get pleasure and positive emotions!<br/><br/>",

The Desert Fox began his first offensive in North Africa with a &lsquo;reconnaissance probe&rsquo; on 31 March, targeting the British advanced positions by Maaten Biscer. At 0600 hours a flying column consisting of medium tanks, armored cars, and a single 88mm gun towed by a prime-mover left their assembly area nine kilometers to the west of El Agheila. The scratch-force promptly advanced along the Via Balbia until, at about 0800 hours, contact was made with the enemy. Two troops of British cruiser tanks were encountered near Kilometer 3 on the Via Balbia. The Germans immediately moved into combat formations, the &lsquo;88&rsquo; was un-limbered and went into action, dispersing the enemy tank formation without hitting any tanks. A running fight then took place for some six kilometers, concluding after the British made another attack, only to be driven off by the column....<br/><br/>ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS&mdash;BENGHAZI HANDICAP is a detailed new ASLComp VARIANT that tells the story of the War in North Africa. It's about time the desert warfare goodness that was spawned by Hal Hock's seminal work TOBRUK back in 1975... was brought to the gaming tables of ASLers. And now it is, in a big way.<br/><br/>ASLComp AFRIKAKORPS&mdash;BENGHAZI HANDICAP continues the series with Rommel's push to re-take Cyrenaica in 1941, going against Hitler's orders and confounding Italian Comando Supremo. We know YOU won't be confounded, and are ready, willing and able to go along for a wild ride past Mersa el Brega, Derna, hello Mechili, we're back...and beyond to the gates of the jewel...Tobruk!<br/><br/>You receive a set of 8 scenarios, all depicting actions from the exciting offensive, rife with combined-arms actions. And yes, these are aimed at playability. Slap them down, bang them out, do it again. And again. Please do a little hooting and hollering while you're at it... at least when you roll 'snakeyes' (or the other guy rolls 'boxcars').<br/><br/>ASL Comp Afrikakorps: Benghazi Handicap contains:<br/>8 action-packed scenarios depicting actions from Rommel's drive into Cyrenaica<br/>Color cover sheet<br/>Descriptive back sheet<br/>Ziploc style storage bag<br/><br/>",

There are five colored dice that will be used to match all the similar colored shapes.<br/><br/>As each new shape is discovered, you will be trying to match the dice to these shapes before they move off the board and generate a new shape.  Each shape you match with the dice causes the dice to be removed from the board and the other dice to fall down into their place.<br/><br/>You start the 1 minute timer. You can use six actions to manipulate the dice to help you line them up and create stacks to generate the shapes. If you run out of time, the dice fall as they are.<br/><br/>Try to create as many shapes as possible to collect the highest score.  Be careful with your actions because if you leave too many dice on the board, they may start to stack too high and cause you to lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Welcome aboard!<br/><br/>In The Lucky Penny Diner players are the waitstaff in a 24-hour diner, serving orders to guests, and trying to collect the most in tips. Cards are drafted into players' hands, then served to guests by laying the cards in an overlapping fashion beside them, representing how full they are getting.<br/><br/>What you serve, when, and to whom factor into how well you are rewarded. Do you serve dessert to a guest that your opponent is waiting on so that they can't serve them any more apps or entrees? Do you give it to the guy at the end to turn his two courses into three?

        "description": "The horrors of trench warfare rage across Europe in 1916. Machine guns are cutting brave soldiers to ribbons when they go &quot;over the top&quot; and are confronted with mazes of wire. Tanks are appearing more frequently on the battlefield, as well as biplanes which seem to evolve every day. The major source of havoc, however, is artillery, which rains hell from above on a regular basis. Not to mention the poison gas.<br/><br/>1916: The Card Game is a tense filler for two players, and includes all of the above. The rules are simple, but the choices aren't. Players represent the opposing commanders of a small stretch of trench line. They draw and play cards from a common deck, but some can only be used by one side. Some cards can be played alone or in combination, and what to play and what to hold in hand can be critical decisions. Some cards have multiple uses. Biplanes, for example, can be used for recon, assault support, or aerial intercept. Victory can be total, major, minor or, rarely, the result can be a stalemate.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The sailing ship must move onto landmarks on the board using limited movement dictated by a &ldquo;wind&rdquo; die, while being also a target for attacks.<br/>Both the treasure and the actions players can use come from chits drawn from a bag throughout the game.<br/>You win by having the most points in hand, buried under your treasure markers on the board, or from collected landmarks.<br/>The game can be played from 2 to up to 6 players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>AWARDS<br/>Finalist in the 2020 Geekway to the West game design contest (convention/contest cancelled).<br/><br/>",

All of the characters are represented by either miniatures or cardboard standees, with the Hexgyas and Grandragon being much larger than the other characters.<br/><br/>What's more, these two figures are the most important ones because if you lose your main character, then you lose the game.<br/><br/>To set up, players choose a starting configuration for their large figure and seven smaller ones on their half of the game board. The Hexgyas and Grandragon stand in one of the five large hexagonal spaces, while their supporting characters occupy the smaller hexes that form a network around these larger hexes. Each player positions three pieces of armor around their large figure, designating two other positions around their perimeter as a weak spot and a critical weak spot. Players also customize a control deck for their large character with three attack cards and three special cards that are added to their six movement cards.<br/><br/>The game lasts at most five rounds, and each round consists of four phases. Players first choose initiative from a hand of five initiative cards and program three control cards for their large figure. During the control phase, players carry out their actions, moving their large figure and attempting to inflict damage on the opponent. The command phase allows the supporting characters to attack one another, but also to infiltrate the opponent's giant to discover weak spots and possibly inflict damage or pull control cards from their hand.<br/><br/>Deal ten damage to the opponent's larger figure, and you win instantly. If no one has been taken down after five rounds, then the Grandragon wins, having overcome the initiative advantage wielded by the Hexgyas.<br/><br/>",

And welcome to our brand new cooking show &mdash; Ninja Chef: The place where true masters of nunchucks and razor claws compete against the great and glorious Octo Zamzey for the title of &quot;The Best Rice &amp; Sushi Chef!&quot; The drama is hotter than wasabi, the plot rapid as a flying onigiri! Sounds intriguing, huh? Then let&rsquo;s roll it!<br/><br/>In the family board game Ninja Chef players participate in a cooking show not as regular folks, but as animal ninjas! There's more: the animals in the game are not just random characters, but the very last of their species in Japan. At Cosmodrome Games, we appreciate the diversity and fragility of nature, so we decided to create a special board game that will help you not only enjoy your time with family and friends, but will also tell a story about unique and endangered species.<br/><br/>How does it all start? The show host and main jury is the famously beloved Octo Zamzey. He&rsquo;s become extremely tired of untalented participants and decided to get the fastest, bravest, and most nimble creatures in the whole universe. You might think at first that it&rsquo;s all about ninja turtles, but nope, that&rsquo;s a completely different story. Octo Zamzey called for Japanese ninjas! Why them? It&rsquo;s simple: our heroes share not only the ninja&rsquo;s path but also a hobby&mdash;they love to cook!<br/><br/>Octo Zamzey is super hot-tempured and an explosive slime ball at the same time (he&rsquo;s an octopus, duh!). It gets really spicy in the kitchen when he&rsquo;s angry. And, Octo is up to no good and has an axe to grind with the ninjas. His tentacles are always aiming to strike their heads and miso-souped their plans!<br/><br/>Move around the kitchen and collect the essential ingredients you need to cook up a fantastic presentation. Roll out your creation to the jury so they can taste your masterpiece&mdash;and select the winner!<br/><br/>In this game, you need to escape Zamzey&rsquo;s wrath while competing with the other players!

The game requires players to collect different cards on the field.

But similar to the game's predecessors, Twilight Ravine revolves around a group of adventurers seeking treasures.

For example, a detection by radar is affected by the range of the contact, its signature (which is not the same as its size), the type of radar, the radar&rsquo;s technology level, the weather, the contact&rsquo;s proximity to land, and how quickly the detection is processed (a new feature in this edition, the combat system). And then there&rsquo;s offensive jamming.<br/><br/>Harpoon is a complex game. It is playable because we have worked hard to ruthlessly simplify the many interactions and abstract, or &ldquo;black-box&rdquo; processes that would otherwise slow manual play to a crawl. We want the game to be about making decisions, based on real-world trade-off s.<br/><br/>This game requires that you learn about naval warfare. Like any game, the more you understand, the better your chance of winning. The rules explain, in real-world terms, how radar, sonar, and other sensors work. Some of it is arcane; all of it is real. And in naval warfare, finding the other side is the hard part.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Malady is an unconventional stacking/sowing game designed by Alek Erickson in May 2020. It is inspired by the games of Arrausi.<br/><br/>Setup: Players play on a hexagonal board. Three colors are involved: White, Black, and Grey (neutral). Players Black and White own stacks with their own color on top. The field is initially filled with single checkers of all 3 colors. The third color may be neutral or owned by a third player. The checkers are tiled so that they are evenly spaced. This game may also be played on a square grid tiled with evenly spaced White and Black checkers.<br/><br/>Players take turn distributing stacks: On your turn, you pick up one stack with your color on top, and immediately place a blockade (stone of your color) on that empty point. Then, distribute the stack. This means for each checker in the stack you are holding, move exactly that many points in a straight line in any direction and drop the bottom checker on that destination. Repeat this process as long as checkers remain in the stack. Note that &quot;any direction&quot; means any of the six hexagonal directions, or, on the square version, any of the eight orthodiagonal directions.<br/><br/>The board gets increasingly restricted: Nobody can drop checkers on points occupied by blockades of either color. While distributing, you may jump over blockades of your color, but not the opponents.<br/><br/>Game end: A player loses when they are unable to make a legal move.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Story:<br/>It&rsquo;s the end of the twentieth century and you are in a post-soviet country in Europe. The main way to make a living is mineral mining. The market situation is very bad in the country troubled by corruption and high criminality. Market prices are barely enough to cover costs. The only way to make a decent living is to mine minerals supported by the government. The catch is that the government places subsidies just before the minerals are sold. This means you need to corrupt government officials to place subsidies in your favor.<br/><br/>Game basics:<br/>The game is for up to five players. Each player represents a mine owner. The goal of the game is to make enough money to leave the country in three years by corrupting government officials, stealing, snitching or by exploiting miners.<br/><br/>Each year is divided into four quarters. One turn is one quarter. Each quarter is divided into three months (actions), which means one player gets three actions each turn.<br/> In total, each player gets three actions each turn and four turns each year.<br/><br/>At the end of each year, the government gives subsidies and sets market prices.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the third year (the twelfth turn). Players sell their minerals as usually and then count their money. The player with the most money wins. If there is a tie, the player with higher ranking card wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In doing so, you will collect resources from the land to feed your tribe, to develop technologies, to build resources, make offerings to the great spirits, activate skulls and more. As the Shaman you must be wary of impending catastrophes known only to you and the other Shaman of the world.

Gather everyone together and let the excitement and deceptions begin!<br/><br/>Players will receive a hand of action cards at the beginning of each round. Play proceeds around the table with each player drawing a mine card at the beginning of their turn. They will look at the mine card privately and then take a treasure card of one of four different values from the available piles. You can either take the treasure that matches the mine card you drew and play it safe or you can take a treasure of a higher value instead.<br/><br/>Another player may choose to call your bluff. If they correctly call your bluff, then you will have to give the treasure to them. If they call it incorrectly, they will have to forfeit the matching treasure from their collected cards.<br/><br/>The round continues until the mine card deck runs out. Then mine cards and action cards are shuffled and set up for the next round. The game consists of three rounds at the end of which players will total up the value of all of their collected treasures and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>This is a collection of twelve red spells (16 - Extra Strength, 17 - Grow, 18 - Slow, 19 - Blur, 20 - Hand of Belo, 21 - Magic Lasso, 22- Retrieve Weapon, 23 - Sunburst, 24 - Weak Knees, 25 - Crushing Walls, 26 - Lightning Bolt and 27 - Insanity).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Artillery, machine gun fire, and mortars plastered our troops. The forward battalion was cut off by an invisible, deadly wall of steel and lead.&rdquo; &ndash;Colonel Riegelman of the US 162nd Infantry Regiment account of the first day&rsquo;s fighting on Biak.<br/><br/>The invasion of Biak island was the culmination of General MacArthur&rsquo;s New Guinea campaign that began nearly a year earlier with Operation Cartwheel and the reduction and bypassing of the Japanese fortifications at Rabaul and Truk. MacArthur&rsquo;s campaign had earlier stumbled out of the gate, with bloody battles at Buna and Sanananda along the Northeastern coast of New Guinea in late 1942 and early 1943. Shocked at the butcher&rsquo;s bill run-up in those fights, MacArthur initiated an &ldquo;island hopping&rdquo; campaign that bypassed Japanese strongholds and not attacking the dug-in defenders head-on. From mid-1943 to early 1944 the US and Australian forces outmaneuvered their Japanese opponents, reducing and cutting the supply lines to the massive defensive works of Rabaul and Truk. This trapped thousands of badly needed Japanese defenders who would spend the rest of the war amid growing squalor and mounting privation. However, a risk run with each island &ldquo;hop&rdquo; by the US would be if the Japanese navy and air forces mounted a sustained counter-attack that would cut-off the American spearhead. Such an operation by the enemy could turn the tables and change MacArthur&rsquo;s bold gambit into a costly defeat.<br/><br/>By early 1944 General MacArthur feared the upcoming US Navy offensive to take the Marianas to the north could lead to a strategic switch in offensive operations that would jeopardize his ambition and promise to retake the Philippines (as well as taking away the spotlight his operations commanded to this point in the war). In early 1944 MacArthur proposed the capture of Biak Island to not only end the New Guinea campaign, but also to provide a forward base of operations for his planned return to the Philippine archipelago. He also argued his attack and capture of Biak would provide valuable protection and early warning along the navy&rsquo;s &ldquo;southern flank&rdquo; in the Marianas, giving a base for operations against any moves by Japanese naval and air units based in and around Borneo.<br/><br/>The plan to take Biak island was accepted over the objections of the US Navy as only a handful of ships could be spared from the Marianas offensive to support the Army&rsquo;s attack.  Expecting only light opposition two regiments of the US 41st Infantry Division landed on May 27th. After a relatively easy landing the GIs encountered fierce opposition by the veteran Japanese 36th Infantry Division, supported by garrison troops and tanks. Things for the Americans quickly went from bad to worse. Perhaps you can do as well or better?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But be careful because it is very easy to lose sight of them, as they seem to disappear before your eyes.<br/><br/>This is a game that takes place in an old European hotel. People move from floor to floor in a fascinating elevator that contains open compartments, moving in an endless chain. They enter one of the compartments while moving up and down, and then get off on another floor. Your job as a hotel detective is to follow the trail of all the mysterious characters using the elevator. Both the compartments and the characters are in constant motion, so you must use memory and logic to locate them all.<br/><br/>Object of the game: the 9 cards are placed face down on the table in two rows, in order to represent the elevator. A different character is shown in each compartment, they are in constant movement.<br/>Players will try to be the first to guess the position of all the characters on the moving elevator cards, matching them (pair up) with the character cards in their hands.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imperial Armour Apocalypse is a book produced by Forge World related to Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse. Within it are rules for the use of many of the models produced by forgeworld in Apocalypse games.<br/><br/>The book has 112 pages and the cover and contents are printed in colour.<br/><br/>This book serves three purposes. First, it provides rules for Imperial Armour models. The arrival of Apocalypse has made it necessary to update the rules for some of our models, which were previously published in our large Imperial Armour volumes and Update books. In fact this book now replaces the Imperial Armour Update 2006. Rules changes are especially important for super-heavy vehicles, aircraft and gargantuan creatures. All of these troop types have new rules in Apocalypse rulebook and obviously our rules needed to fit with these. Secondly, Apocalypse has introduced several new blast marker templates, which did not exist when our original rules were published. Where appropriate we have used these new templates for our models (for example, the Manticore). Thirdly, we have incorporate many Imperial Amour models into new battle formations. All straight forward enough... or is it? The arrival of Apocalypse provides players with a perfect arena in which to use their Imperial Armour models, and as such serves as an examples of how these models can be used in different styles of Warhammer 40,000 games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A bare-bones set of tactical miniatures rules for depicting squad- or platoon-level World War II actions, ostensibly in 1944 Europe. The only real tie that the rules have to the setting is a five-page list of game statistics for small arms used by combatants who fought in the European Theater. However, the abbreviated rulebook contains no scenarios, organizational info, or other historical background.<br/><br/>Each 15 or 25mm figure represents an individual soldier. Each soldier is rated on a characteristics sheet for various abilities: weapon, hand to hand (combat), throwing, recovery (from &quot;shock&quot;), and survival. During character creation these statistics are modified based on a National Characteristics chart which provides various percentage adjustments to weapon, hand to hand, and survival ability die rolls for German, British, American, Italian, and Russian troops.<br/><br/>&mdash;User summary<br/><br/>Precis Intermedia brings back this classic set of WWII miniatures rules. Originally published in 1978 by Wee Warriors, Dogtags is designed for action on a squad to platoon level, and may be played with 25mm or 15mm figures. Recreate the most difficult and demanding actions that were daily encounters for the long-faced G.I.'s of WWII. Enact small unit tactics with you as the NCO. Can you take a strong point without excessive loss to your fighting strength? And can you hold off that next German assault? You have to answer questions such as these from game to game as you learn the importance of tactics and a good NCO to carry them out. It's up to you to hold victory in your hands -- or just a collection of dogtags.<br/><br/>This piece of gaming history is a must for collectors, old school gamers, and those looking for a fast-playing WWII miniatures skirmish game. With the original on the extremely rare list, this classic reprint of Dogtags has been remastered for a clean print, and is readily available at a low cost.<br/><br/>Requires a set of percentile dice and a six-sided die (a four and eight-sided die are also needed on occasion).<br/><br/>&mdash;2020 description from the reprint publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Medium-weight, set collection, action allowance plus secret action programming game, where you play as a genetic engineer with the goal of completing genetic sequences to fix troublesome mutations in the human genome, first extracting chains of 3 cubes from a shared sequence, and then, creating different chains to complete public objectives.<br/><br/>All players build onto the same shared chain; therefore, they&rsquo;re constantly getting in each other&rsquo;s way, requiring a secret action programming mechanic that lets them modify or rearrange the sequence to their benefit.<br/><br/>Public objectives vary in points according to their difficulty, and players can also combine private objectives onto longer sequences to get more points.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each turn, you have a set number of actions, initially 4. The ones in your color are called edit tokens, while the generic white ones are called extra action tokens.<br/>It all starts in the manufacturer, where you can use 1 action to place 1 cube of any color. You&rsquo;re looking to create the sequences that you have on your CRISPR cards, so that when the cubes get transferred to the shared sequence, you can extract them.<br/>Since the cubes are added to the same queue by all the players, you can use 1 action to play an Edit card, marking it with the edit token. This will allow you to change what&rsquo;s being built.<br/>When all the spaces are full, the first half gets transferred to the shared sequence, but the edits are resolved first, letting the player remove, replace, duplicate the cubes, etc.<br/>As edit cards are used, they go to the spent side of your board. To recover them so you can use them again, you&rsquo;ll need to spend 2 actions.<br/><br/>Once the cubes are on the shared sequence, you can use 1 action to extract the cubes from the sequence, matching the cards in your hand.<br/>In the same action, you can chain more than 1 card, or even overlap them, to extract a longer, uninterrupted sequence.<br/>To get more cards onto your hand, you can use 1 action to draw 2 cards and keep 1, or you can use more than 1 action to, for instance, get 6 cards and keep 3.<br/><br/>After claiming them, you place the cards below your board, face up, and you take the sequence of cubes onto your private sequence.<br/>If there are cubes there already, you may insert them on any position, to get other sequences that you need.<br/>You can also discard an extra action token to remove any number of cubes from your sequence.<br/><br/>From your private sequence, you may match 3 consecutive cubes, and discard them to turn them into an amino-acid, or codon, placing one of your edit tokens onto the corresponding space.<br/>Some of the amino-acids have an &ldquo;extra action&rdquo; icon &ndash;the first person to place an edit cube there, gets an extra action token, but they can be claimed more than once by the same or different players.<br/>To unlock more edit tokens from your reserve, once every turn you may spend two actions to get a new token. However, you may only have 4 edit cubes available on your board or at the manufacturer.<br/><br/>While extracting CRISPR cards and claiming codons, ideally you should be trying to complete the public objectives, getting each of the letters shown, either from your collected cards, or from codons marked with your tokens. To claim an objective, discard the cards and remove the tokens, using one of them to mark the objective &ndash; The first player to claim it gets a few extra points, as shown in the single space, but the objective can be claimed any number of times, by the same or different players.<br/><br/>When a player has no edit tokens left at the end of their turn, the end of the game is triggered &ndash; every OTHER player gets 1 more turn, and then the game ends.<br/>Players get the points from each completed objective, plus the points from each amino-acid with one of their tokens, plus 1 point for each collected CRISPR card, plus 1 point for every 2 action tokens of either kind still on their board.<br/><br/>The winner is simply the player with the most points.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

But its greater distinguishing feature is the ability to score multiple subsets of melds (sets or sequences), though only one subset per trick. You may also score for holding the King and Over in trumps (a Bela).<br/><br/>Many points (and a lot of information) can be earned quickly this way, but you should also try to earn points by capturing certain scoring cards during tricks. Indeed, you must win at least one of the final 9 tricks otherwise all of the card points (plus 10 points for winning the last trick)--161 points in total--will be scored by your opponent.<br/><br/>You accumulate points for melds and captured cards over several hands until you have gained 501 points or more. If your opponent has gained 251 points or more, you score 1 victory point; if they have gained 250 points or fewer, you score 2 victory points. First to 5 (or 10) victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

Very few enemy weapons will scratch a Tiger's surface, roll over your opponent with your nigh invulnerable task force.<br/><br/>This box set will allow you to field two armoured platoons, both with immense anti-tank capability. Every tank in this bundle has a super heavy anti-tank gun, which would make them one of the biggest threats on the battlefield - able to take out literally any tank fielded by your enemy!<br/><br/>This starter set gives you a force worth over 2000 points!

        "description": "Once in a Millennium, when all the elements of the Universe are aligned, the Millennium gate emerges and releases powerful cosmic energies in the form of mythical beasts, sacred weapons and spells. This is an opportunity to harness the cosmic energy and win the prolonged war between 2 powerful forces: The Virtues and The Sinners.From around the world come the most powerful heroes from both spectrums. They travel to the dangerous shadow realm to claim the power and to keep it from falling into the enemy&rsquo;s hands. Whoever shall claim the millennium gate shall win the war, the Millennium War.<br/><br/>In the Millennium War, there are two game modes: competitive mode and cooperative mode. In competitive mode, players go head to head while building their strategy by selecting teams of legendary heroes, buying items, preparing passive spells to counterattack, and most importantly planning their actions by managing mana resources and movement across the Millennium Arena. <br/>There are 3 ways to win in competitive mode: eliminate all your opponents' teams of heroes, destroy all your opponents' ancient structures or claim the Millennium Gate by hunting powerful mythical beasts. <br/>Millennium War's competitive mode is inspired by the popular MOBA games but adjusted to be one of a kind as a board game.  You don&rsquo;t win by speed and accuracy, or control of your keyboard, but by how you think and plan your strategy with a combination of choices. Similar to Chess but way more fun. Whether crushing your enemies with extreme power, trapping them with self destruct explosives and sacrificing one of your hero's for a few of theirs, brain controlling enemy hero's or even switching positions, there are endless ways to gain a strategic advantage. Build combos with 35 special Millennium Hero's and their endless combinations of weapons and spells.<br/>In contrast to the swift pace of Competitive mode is the journey to the Millennium world in Cooperative mode, where players must work together to defeat Millennium Bosses. Each Boss presents a unique way of attack and has its own topography that&rsquo;ll require the entire team to solve the puzzle to defeat the powerful Boss.<br/>The game offers countless excitement, it&rsquo;s fun and full of surprises, easy to play and tracks game play because of uniquely designed and patented smart dials, dealer shoes, hero cards and icons. Offering a supporting website featuring hero skills diagrams for easy learning, along with in depth character design inspired by world cultures and game mechanics. The game miniatures are lovingly made with highly detailed craftsmanship by talented artists from around the world. They also magnetically attach to the smart dial.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A traditional deck trick-taking game that is rare for its use of playing paired cards rather than a single card at a time.<br/>The game uses values 2-7 in a 2 or 3 player game, 2-9 in a 4 player game.<br/><br/>Lead Pairs consist of<br/>A matched pair: Two cards sharing a suit - totaled and requiring others to follow suit.<br/>An unmatched pair: Two cards that have different suits - totaled but not requiring others to follow suit.<br/><br/>Following Pairs consist of<br/><br/>A matched pair: Same as above.<br/><br/>An unmatched pair following an unmatched pair: cards are totaled.<br/><br/>An unmatched pair following a matched pair: the lowest card is considered the total.<br/><br/>A double - An unmatched pair containing a 2, following a matched pair. The higher valued card is doubled.<br/><br/>The highest total takes the trick; the player who takes the trick retrieves an opponent's card played to the trick and leads the next trick.<br/><br/>After a number of tricks (4 in a 3 or 4 player game; 6 in a 2 player game) players total the cards remaining in their hands. This is their score for the round.<br/><br/>At the end of the round in which any player has scored at least 50 points, the highest score wins. If tied, the tied player with the highest score in the last round wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>Dyad plays with a number of variants:<br/><br/>Cipher - (Usually with 3 or 4 players) A player may choose to cipher prior to the start of a phase. If that player takes 0 points, the player scores 20 points.<br/><br/>2's - If a player ends the round with a 2 and any other card, the 2 is subtracted from the score, but having a sole 2 at the end of the round scores 20 points.<br/><br/>Teams - (4 players) Players on a team sit across from one another. Teamed players pass 2 cards to each other prior to the start of the phase. Teams play to score 100 points.<br/><br/>The game generally includes themed decks where themes include new variants.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Click on Files to download.<br/><br/><br/>            WINNER OF &ldquo;BEST AREA CONTROL GAME&rdquo; IN THE 2020 BGG SOLITAIRE GAME DESIGN CONTEST***<br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Shield of the Viking is a solitaire Tower Defense / Tile placement game that sets you as the Jarl of a small Viking village who is trying to survive the nightly raids from &quot;the riders&quot; who live in the mountains to the north.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board made up of hexagonal spaces that narrow down in quantity from top to bottom.  Your objective is to defend your fortress at the bottom of the board just long enough for you to put an end to the raids.<br/><br/>Using 4 colored die each round, the riders path down the mountain and through your village is randomized each turn.  The rider will follow the colored pattern of the die rolled through colored arrows on each of the board spaces.  The result is a snake like path causing destruction as he moves.<br/><br/>In between Raids, you will have the opportunity to place Viking soldiers and build defensive buildings to stop the Rider before he reaches the bottom.  However, you must also decide how many Vikings to keep in the village to defend it vs how many you want to send searching for the rider's home base to defeat them once and for all.<br/><br/>The PnP version was originally designed for the 2020 Solitaire PnP Contest by Joe Fontana<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players build sequences of attacks and responses that resolve in reverse order, representing the ebb and flow of a theoretical fantasy fight scene two psychics are projecting into each other's minds. Planning your own moves isn't the only key to victory; you'll also use your psychic and magical abilities to manipulate when - or IF - actions resolve!<br/><br/>Players select one of the four characters in a diverse cast of psychic combatants, using their unique skillsets to emerge victorious. Every character deck has its own strengths and weaknesses, with a depth of tactical play that ensures no two fights are the same.<br/><br/>In Fight Sequence, players take turns playing Actions or passing, building a series of Actions until both players pass consecutively [with passes being forced once the maximum sequence size of 9 Actions is met]. Once that happens, the entire sequence then resolves in reverse order, starting with the last Action played. Timing your Actions for maximum effect is crucial, but every character has some ability to manipulate that timing to work more in their favor. Even the best-laid plans aren't foolproof!<br/><br/>Actions are either attacks or responses - use your attacks to damage your opponent, and your responses to defend yourself from opposing attacks or support your strategy. Every card in the game can be played as either an attack or a response, so you're never out of options. Damage is represented by discarding cards from your deck; no paper, pen, dice, or tracker apps required. Just choose your characters, shuffle your decks, and begin!<br/><br/>In addition to four varied characters with different styles and movesets, The First Chapter also includes the Academy decks, which use a more streamlined subset of cards to help ease players into the reverse-action-programming nature of the game.<br/><br/>-- description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the active player will roll the die, and move one of his sheep forward along the track. If the sheep ends on one of the special spaces, the player draws a card showing a clock. If the player can tell the time correctly, they are rewarded with a &quot;wolf coin&quot;.

Each set of checkers is numbered 1-6 twice.<br/><br/>In each game the pieces are randomly placed in the usual Checkers starting positions. (A variant is given where after determining first player, the second player's pieces are re-arranged to match the first player's.)<br/><br/>Game 1 is played like Checkers except that a piece can only jump a piece with an equal or lower number. The object is to capture both opposing 6s, although a player also wins if their opponent can no longer move.<br/><br/>In Game 2 players score points every time they make a jump - normally the absolute difference between the jumping piece's number and that on the piece being jumped, but if the numbers add to seven or eleven that many points are scored instead. When no captures can be made remaining pieces are added to players' scores.<br/><br/>Game 3 also uses scoring, in a different way. In this game when a piece is jumped the capturing player keeps it in front of them in a scoring area, and when a piece reaches the back row it is removed and added to its owner's scoring area. (There are no kings.) The winner is the first player to reach 30 points.<br/><br/>",

Brush Brothers plays in 15 min, is for 2-6 players and is for ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>In Brush Brothers, players are new employees for the Brush Brothers Paint Co. and are seeking to make a good first impression by mixing colors and completing company goals.<br/><br/>In this color based deck building game, players compete to collect paint cards and meet goals before the day&rsquo;s end.<br/><br/>On a player turn, players may perform a variety of actions including mixing paint, matching paint, and meeting company goals.<br/><br/>To mix paint, players may mix any of the colors in their hand to pick up paint colors from the center row. For instance, I could use red and yellow to create orange.<br/><br/>To match colors players may pick up a color if they already have that exact color in their hand.<br/><br/>To meet company goals, players declare that they are seeking to meet a goal and if they have the required colors in their play area, they may collect the goal card.<br/><br/>Any cards used for an action are then placed in the player discard and can cycle through their deck back into their hand on a later turn.<br/><br/>Players start with an even mix of red, yellow, blue and white and can collect a variety of other colors. In this way every card can help to build your deck. Excluding the starter cards, every card is worth points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when the center pile runs out.

        "description": "Kinswinds is born of a desire for a deception game that focused more on information control and less on guesswork and odds.<br/><br/>The game attempts to simulate the power of suggestion, encouraging players to invest in the strongest card suits but also encouraging attempts to influence which suits other players believe​ are the strongest, not only through bluffing but also through actions.<br/><br/>Players move together through 5 steps whilst passing, discarding and activating card abilities, all of this giving them several options for altering the distribution of the cards and thus the score value of those cards. Players choose which cards they will score on during the game and in the fifth step can take a small points penalty to force the game to end if they think their chosen cards are worth the most.<br/><br/>At this point all hands are revealed, each player's chosen score cards are revealed and their value is calculated, the highest scoring player being declared the winner.<br/><br/>The game takes seconds to get running and comes in a pocket sized deckbox.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

All other cards are shuffled and each player gets a hand (of 12, 10, or 8 depending on player count). Each player also gets one counter of each color.<br/><br/>On a turn a player may trade, meaning they may turn in any number of counters and then take counters equal in value; the values are determined by the cards on the table. A player also must play a card, which will change the value of the associated color; this can be done before or after trading.<br/><br/>When all cards have been played the game is over. Players score a point for each counter and four more points for each set of all four colors.<br/><br/>",

On a turn a player places their pawn next to a row or column and rolls the die. They count that many cards from the pawn and place a counter on it, spot up, placing on top of an opposing counter if necessary. If necessary the count wraps around to the start of the row/column.<br/><br/>The player may then roll again and place another counter. This continues until they decide to stop or they roll a card which they already have a counter on (from this or a previous turn). In the latter case all the counters they placed this turn are removed. Otherwise they flip over their just-placed counters, remove any opposing counters from these cards, and take any of these cards that are courts. If they have counters on all three black cards of a given number they take those as well.<br/><br/>The game ends when all court cards have been taken. Each set of black cards is worth the cards' number. Each court is a point unless a player has seven or more, which is worth 12 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Distrix is an award-winning game of skill in which two players, Red and Blue, battle to control a 6x6 region called The Matrix.  The number in each square of the matrix equals power, and Red and Blue are equally powerful.  During the game, players use colored tokens to group the squares into 9 districts, one square at a time.  The tokens are not player specific; all tokens are available to both players.  As districts are formed, power is unevenly allocated.  Red controls some districts, and Blue controls others.  The game ends when one token occupies each square and no legal moves remain.  Whoever controls more districts is the winner.<br/><br/>The idea is simple, but game play is incredibly challenging.  You and your opponent are equally powerful at all times, so victory is achieved by winning many districts by narrow margins and losing few districts by large margins.  This is how election districts are rigged, or gerrymandered, in the real world.  But, in Distrix, an opponent responds to your every move.  Each district is a tug-of-war that you want to win narrowly or lose by a lot.  But be careful...you may accidentally win it by too much or barely lose it!  Nine districts are in play, so there's a lot to keep your eye on.  Spatial awareness is critical because the shape of one district affects another.  And there's a special rule that can be highly disruptive at the end: squares may be transferred from large districts to adjacent smaller ones.  Overall, it's a stunningly pure battle for power that combines basic arithmetic, spatial awareness, and expert move timing.  All games are closely contested, and endgame surprises are remarkably common.<br/><br/>Distrix is for 2 players ages 14 and up and takes 30-60 minutes to play.  Each game set includes 36 tiles, 9 home base tokens, 99 expansion tokens, 9 scoring tokens, a scoreboard, a rulebook, and a rule summary sheet.<br/><br/>Distrix introduces a game-based framework for dividing any region into a given number of districts of nearly equal area, one sector at a time.  The same framework can be used to form election districts of nearly equal population within US states.  Thus, the game offers a potential solution to America's gerrymandering problem.  Instead of one political party rigging new election districts to its advantage, multiple political parties could form new election districts in a high-stakes game, one voting precinct (or county, census block, etc.) at a time.<br/><br/>Distrix won the Best New Abstract Game Judges Award at the 2021 UK Games Expo and a silver medal in the 2020 Serious Play Tabletop Game Competition.<br/><br/>The game box, components, rules, and theme were updated in 2022 to enhance player enjoyment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Use your special powers to atomise or fuse your element and create the perfect sequence of five. The winner restores balance to our chaotic universe. So, Spin away and Wu Xing!<br/><br/>Xing is a game of strategy and balance where players are the masters of a single element. They must use the language of the universe - Math - to tactically position their elements in a sequence and gain victory over others. Spin, pick a card and solve the question to find your position(s) on the board. Place your element token using strategy and planning. Master basic concepts of factors and multiples and gain critical thinking skills in this epic battle of minds!<br/><br/>In Xing, players master the laws of nature by controlling the elements - Huo, Shui and Tu. Each player picks one element and collects 14 tokens of that element. The game board and action spinner are placed in the centre.<br/>Shuffle the fuse and atomise card decks separately and place them beside the game board. <br/>On your turn, spin the action spinner.<br/>If you get Fuse, pick the top card from the fuse deck. <br/>If you get Atomise pick the top card from the atomise deck and,<br/>If you get Pick Any, pick the top card from any deck.<br/>After you pick a card, read what is said and solve it. then choose where you want to place one of your element tokens <br/>For example, if the card reads, &lsquo;multiple of 4 between 35 to 55&rsquo;, then you can place your token on 36, 40, 44 or 48.<br/><br/>Remember, you can place only one of your element tokens per turn<br/>You must place the element based on the solution of the card you picked.<br/>If the card has more than one solution, pick one of them and place your token there<br/>If a location already has a token then you cannot place another<br/>If you cannot place your token on the game board, you pass your turn<br/><br/>In each deck, there are 2 Wu (the spiral symbol) cards and 2 remove cards. These are special cards. <br/>The Wu card allows you to place one token on the wu symbol on the board. The &lsquo;remove&rsquo; card allows you to remove one token of an opponent from the board. when a token is removed it goes back to that player. Once all your element tokens have been used, then you can move them around on the board. just take it from one spot and place it on another, as per the card you pick. Remember, you can place an element token to create your sequence or block an opponent. choose your strategy! The first player to create a line of five of their own element tokens, wins the game. This could be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. Xing can also be played with 6 players split into 3 teams of 2.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This 86-page rulebook includes the Essential Starmada Rules, 46 starships (Klingon, Federation, Tholian, Orion, Kzinti), and complete rules to bring the Star Fleet Universe alive in the Starmada game system.<br/><br/>This fast-playing game easily handles squadrons of ships as they encounter their enemies and battle to see who is indeed the best commander.<br/><br/>Ships included are the Federation dreadnought, battlecruiser, heavy cruiser, old light cruiser, command cruiser, and frigate; the Klingon C8 dreadnought, C7 heavy battlecruiser, D7 battlecruiser, D6 heavy cruiser, D5 war cruiser, F5 frigate, and D7C command cruiser; Kzinti dreadnought, battlecruiser, and frigate; Tholian patrol corvette, Orion Raider, and many other ships. (There are a total of 46 ships.)<br/><br/>This book is complete and ready to play.<br/><br/>This edition unifies the previous Nova and Admiralty editions, so there will no longer be Starmada fans who cannot game together. The new rules preserve the best of both previous systems, and add dynamic seeking weapons rules that do what seeking weapons are supposed to do: force the enemy to move out of key areas or shoot his way through a swarm of drones.<br/><br/>",

From the earliest age, they learn to ride, becoming the greatest horsemen in the land. After many battles, these horsemen have honed their skills to perfection. Their mastery of swordsmanship, archery, and riding is surpassed by none. In combat, they are a triple threat of strength, speed, and range.<br/><br/>The Dothraki Veterans unit box gives House Targaryen players a multi-faceted new threat to add to their armies. These warriors have trained their abilities to the max, able to perform attacks at range and in close combat. When attacking with their shortbows, they can follow it up with a devastating charge. However, the Dothraki eschew heavy armor, so a good commander will make sure the Veterans are in and out of combat before an enemy has a chance for a retaliatory strike.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They move around the catacombs and roll their dice to unearth treasure, all while trying to avoid (or confront) their opponents.  Looted treasures are kept secret, but after each phase players announce their positions and collapsed spaces on the map.<br/><br/>With your trusty GLM&trade; helping stow your treasures, you just might be able to snag the most loot.

You can read (relive) people's stories , record their abilities, and find out  enemy weaknesses.<br/><br/>The gameplay is focused on strategic, ability based combat and exploring. Each ability belongs to a particular weapon master and class, with specific actions. This gives you a wide range of opportunities to create a character with the desired synergy. Part of our game art is shown in a comic book called the Memory Book. It charters the history of important characters in an uncensored,,18+ comic book format.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>If you take our game monsters and bosses lightly, you are likely to get killed mercilessly. Exploit their weaknesses as this will help you win. At the beginning of the game, each player names their Knight and chooses 5 starting abilities. Before entering battle, select 3 of the 5 ability cards and utilize them to transform your Damned Sword.  With up to 20+ sub-action cards, you can flexibly tailor your attacks to deal with your immediate foes!. Explore our dark fantasy world and encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Killing monsters grants you the game's currency, Karma. Karma can be used to record abilities, purchase items, and level up characters. Leveling up your characters gives them more capacity to record abilities and creates more synergies with your ability cards.<br/><br/>Plot<br/>Fallen Knights were created by the Gods to acquire and relive lost memories, though the Gods decided where they went and what they did. The lost memories recovered by the Fallen Knights never lasted long since every time they returned them to the Gods, they were reborn with no memories. This was a never-ending nightmare, a hellish cycle with no escape..<br/>Now, the Gods are gone, the curse is broken, and every memory is available to Fallen Knights.. However, the memories are vague and unclear - like bad dreams - so it&rsquo;s time to set out. Fallen Knights must forge their own path!<br/><br/>What about the Damned Sword of Fallen Knights?<br/>If the corpse of a vanquished foe contains blood and flesh, the Damned Sword can be used directly to read memories. If the foe is long dead, and only the skeleton remains, then a sacred fire is required to harvest memories. Further still, players can use various abilities to turn their Damned Sword into weapons such as a bow, dagger, and even a Great Sword!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There&rsquo;s no appetizer so mouth-watering as a good cheeseboard. There&rsquo;s a pleasure to timeless foods&mdash;meat, cheeses, fruits and grains&mdash;spread out like a savory work of art. These morsels combine in endless ways&mdash;do you want cheese and crackers? Crackers and meat? Cheese and fruit? Do you want to stack one of everything into a giant charcuterie sandwich?<br/><br/>But the real question is: can you make a good cheeseboard? The party is barely an hour from now! You have the ingredients, but they still need to be cut and served. It&rsquo;s time to find out if you&rsquo;ve got the chops to make a cheeseboard deluxe.<br/><br/>Cheeseboard Deluxe is a solitaire roll-and-write for one player, originally developed for the 2020 Solitaire Print-and-Play Contest. Your goal is to build a jam-packed cheeseboard, leaving as few empty spaces as possible at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each round, you draw shapes representing food onto each of your cutting boards. When you can&rsquo;t draw another shape onto a cutting board, that board is done, and when every board is done, the number of empty spaces remaining becomes your score. The more spaces you manage to fill in, the lower your score&mdash;and the better!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

Each warrior has a unique ability, realm traits, and a racial restriction. Players alternate turns with one warrior acting at a time based upon the order determined in their deployment. A warrior can use their turn to attack the enemy squad by rolling a d10 and allocating damage (called a Standard Attack) or by using their warrior ability or realm ability as an alternate way to deliver damage or otherwise alter the flow of battle.<br/><br/>While many warriors have offensive abilities, many others have defensive, retaliatory, healing, summoning, or a wide variety of other abilities. The interactions and synergies of the warriors each player selects for their squads will have a major impact on the battle.

        "description": "Spitfire Ace: Daylight Air Defense Over Britain: 1940 is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a Royal Air Force fighter during the Battle of Britain. Each turn consists of a sortie in which a contact interception mission will be flown from one of many bases in South-East England, attempting to destroy incoming German. Spitfire Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Nightfighter Ace / Interceptor Ace game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion (if an officer) and receive awards.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of an R.A.F. fighter pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may pull strings to arrange a transfer to other fighter bases in an attempt to get &quot;closer to the action&quot; or use their influence to adopt more effective tactics. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player's eventual goal &ndash; to become the bomber killer of the Battle of Britain.<br/><br/>Where many air combat games focus on accumulating hardware, the emphasis in this game is on developing the skills and tactics that will enable you to (a) survive and (b) shoot down enemy aircraft. Your approach in the game is characterized by various skill and benefits including Pilot skills, Wingman skills, tactical changes, and Prestige Level.<br/><br/>Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot, squadron and aircraft type, play proceeds by checking for incoming raid information. Play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the German raiders. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the possibility that your airfield may have been bombed while you were engaging the enemy. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a change of tactics, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until end of October 1940 should you make it through unscathed.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>    Time Scale: 3-4 days per turn<br/>    Map Scale: abstract<br/>    Unit Scale: individual aircraft, weapon systems, crew members, ammo rounds<br/>    Players: 1 (with option for 2 or more)<br/>    Solitaire: High<br/>    Playing Time: 2-3 hours<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Staying first is even harder.<br/><br/>Players have full control over their vehicles starting from statistics to behavior on track. You can go slow and safe and never roll a dice, or push your luck and attack aggressively, and put your fate on a dice roll.<br/><br/>Take corners fast and risk losing control over speeder! Push your opponents on track wall, to slow them down or even destroy. Fight your way to the first place using extra equipment for your vehicle like shields, tractor beams, EMP discharges, or even seeking missiles. All means necessary allowed!<br/><br/>Each player pilots one speeder, steering it through obstacles, blocking other players, and collecting boosts. Speeders are customizable, and during the progress of the game they get upgrades, and the player decides how to tune the vehicle. Board is modular, allowing players to build unique tracks for each game.<br/><br/>There are also sponsors available, giving additional upgrades to your speeders. Lots of negative but fair play interaction between players, course-plotting, and risk-taking. Speeders can be damaged and even crashed, but even then you can still get to the end line first.<br/><br/>This is a downloadable product, to be printed and cut on an A3 format paper or cardboard sheet. It still needs additional elements like tokens, dice, and speeders models.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher&rsquo;s website<br/><br/>",

Badly damaged in these efforts she spent the latter half of that year in the Brooklyn shipyard of New York.<br/><br/>She would return to service in the East Mediterranean, being a key component with only four British ships covering the area.

The game takes place on a map made of hexagons. During the game players can have their kids build forts or work at headquarters to grow their economy and gain resources. Supply lines must be maintained to transfer this wealth. Each micronation can also print their own currency which they can use for trade or negotiations with other micronations. The value of this currency can be brought up or down for manipulative purposes. Other optional strategies involve combat or social infiltration to convert kids from other micronations. Aside from these challenges kids must avoid parents who randomly wander the map in attempts to make them go home.

A spell is formed from a combination of two word cards (English included). Players use agreed symbols to represent the components of the spell (water, fire and so on). Each player draws a version of the spell from the symbols required.<br/><br/>At the end of the course, each player studies the spells drawn by the other students, and casts a secret vote on how well they have been drawn. Players are looking for how easily the drawing is to read, and how well it matches the requirements of the spell.<br/><br/>Once all the votes are cast, the scores are revealed and totalled up. The best score wins the game and a new job.<br/><br/>Players must try to draw out on paper a spell, decoratively and cleverly. But it must be recognisable as the spell, and not too difficult to read and interpret correctly. A spell that is too easy, or too obscure, should score lower marks than a more finely crafted work.<br/><br/>The game has been presented as a Print'n'Play, with the black &amp; white files online under a password, being released for the low price of &yen; 500.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Every year, just before winter, hives around the world kick out all the Drone bees so that the Workers and the Queen can survive through the winter and come back strong in the spring. The game is based on this.<br/><br/>In Hivernation, two players (or two teams of two players) receive a stack of 20 double sided, hexagonal bee tiles (one side Workers, one side Drones) as well as 3 specialty tiles chosen at random (or, for fairness, 2 flower tiles and 1 bear tile).<br/><br/>The Queen Zizi Tile is placed in the center of the play space and players take turns playing tiles from their stack. They can attach to Queen Zizi or their own bees but not directly to their opponents bees. When the two sides meet, each player, on their turn, can start converting their opponents tiles to their own by sandwiching their opponents tiles between two of their own and flipping the tiles in between to show the opposite side. There are opportunities to flip tiles in multiple directions at once as well. When a player does this they've made a multi-directional play and  they're awarded another specialty tiles chosen from the stack at random.<br/><br/>Or they can modify game play by using one of those specialty tiles to flip tiles in a ring, stop tiles from being flipped or removing them from the game completely. The winner is the player with more of their tiles face up when the first player runs out of bee tiles to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players will try to win up to 6 &ldquo;tricks&rdquo; each round.  But the twist is that each time both players play Odd numbered cards, the Flip Card swaps to the opposite side - meaning the loser of the trick could win the points.  And with just 15 cards, ties are resolved using Rock-Paper-Scissors - all recorded on a tug-o-war style board.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the winning player adds their points to their total. Rounds continue until one player reaches 5 points, and are crowned the Schoolyard Champion.<br/><br/>Schoolyard Tricks contains a surprising level of strategy and decision-making for a quick, addictive, and highly portable, 15-card microgame.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

When there are no moves left, the player with the higher score is the winner.<br/><br/>The general idea behind the scoring is simple: You get 1 point per empty cell that is orthogonally adjacent to more of your pieces than your opponent's pieces. Two measures are taken to exclude all draws in as fair a manner as possible:<br/><br/>1: You get an extra point every time you make a placement that closes off an odd number of tied cells. (A cell is closed off when it is adjacent to no cell that can be occupied on a future turn.) This is equivalent to dividing tied cells between you in a &quot;one for me, one for you, one for me&quot;-fashion as they are closed off.<br/><br/>2: You get an extra point if your opponent has made more placements than you at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Of course, cute forest animals! How will these innocent, fluffy little creatures deal with mental illnesses that came from nowhere and had previously been completely unknown to them?<br/><br/>Be a part of their everyday lives as the rest of their lives start right now, but it could easily end in psychiatry. It's all up to you! (Evil laugh)<br/><br/>How to play? It's easy!<br/><br/>The table before the player is the player's Mind. Here you have to play and collect your Moment cards, like Video Gaming, Unkept Promises, Mowing the Lawn. You can play negative cards (like Phobia, Illness - eg. Coulrophobia, Insomnia) to other player's Moments, or positive cards (Recovery - eg. Aversion Therapy, Faith in the Future) to your Moments. These cards will affect your Mentality value plus or minus. There are immediate cards like Impact cards (eg. The Swamp of Sorrow, Salmon of Doubt), which will alter the gameplay a bit by the card effect, and Fracture cards (eg. Bipolar Disorder, Panic Disorder), which will drive a punch into your Mentality.<br/><br/>This is a turn based game. One turn has 3 phases. Phase 1 is your card's &quot;beginning of your turn&quot; phase. Cards have effects, so some of the cards will apply their effect here. Phase 2 is Defragmentation Phase. The player has got 2 Fragments, and a Fragment can be redeemed into Actions, like DRAW a card or PLAY a card from the hand. The last Phase is the end Phase, the player has to keep the hand limit.<br/><br/>You can STEAL, ERASE, LOCK, etc. a card(s) from your so called friends' Mind. You may decide to be evil - it never hurts. When you erase a Moment, it goes into that player's own Subconscious discard pile.<br/><br/>The player who first collects 7 Moments in his/her Mind and his/her Mentality reaches or exceeds 15 (in a positive direction, of course) wins the game. It's that simple and great.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

In her stories, the truth is multi-layered, man and machine collide with disastrous consequences, and seemingly harmless games turn into deadly danger. Each mystery is a whodunit, where questions, guessing and fiddling must be used to uncover the secret.<br/><br/>By the way, Poznanski's favorite puzzles from her own edition are &quot;Ungeworfen&quot; and &quot;Das Letzte!&quot;<br/><br/>iddly, morbid and mysterious riddles for teenagers and adults. The players try to reconstruct the crime by asking, guessing and fiddling about. A spooky card game just right for any party.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SOPWWID, a Solitaire One Page World War I Dogfight game has an extremely low footprint, minimal components, and simple rules.  The entire game fits on one piece of paper, front and back.  Also needed are 11 coins (1 penny, 5 dimes and 5 nickels or any other set of coins), and 1d10.  Alternately, you may print plane images (included) instead of using coins.<br/><br/>The goal is to shoot down as many enemy planes with your Sopwith Camel before being shot down yourself.<br/><br/>Each turn, you'll maneuver your Sopwith by selecting from 1 of 31 hex movement options.  Then the AI will maneuver each enemy plane (both Fokkers and Pfalzes) by a roll of a die.  Although random, the available movement options vary given the relative position of your Sopwith to the enemy.  As a result, the enemy AI is eerily accurate, meaning the enemy is quite effective at hunting you down.<br/><br/>Then every plane shoots in a straight hex row if it has an enemy in its sites.  Your Sopwith has a range of 4 hexes, the Fokkers may shoot 3 hexes, and the Pfalzes shoot 2.<br/><br/>Every plane is shot down on it's second hit.  Fokkers are worth 10 points, Pfalzes 5 points, and if your Sopwith is shot down, you are out.<br/><br/>If you survive the first wave of 1 Fokker and 1 Pfalz, each successive wave adds 1 additional Fokker and 1 additional Pfalz.  [The designers record is 55 points!]<br/><br/>",

The recommended board sizes are between 5x5 and 9x9. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.<br/><br/>A group is a stone along with all other like-colored stones one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stones of its color. The size of a group is the number of stones in it.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty square. Then,<br/><br/>- for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to an empty square 'B' in the opposite direction, move stone 'A' to empty square 'B';<br/><br/>- for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to the edge of the board in the opposite direction, remove stone 'A', and<br/><br/>- for every stone 'A' that is adjacent to your newly placed stone in one direction and to another stone in the opposite direction, replace stone 'A' with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>The game ends when the board is full. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. If the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.<br/><br/>If the same board position appears for the third time with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesRepeating a position is very hard on a 5x5 board, and it is believed to be impossible on bigger boards.<br/><br/>Robble was inspired by Gekitai and Pathwayz.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the 19th century, the elevation of the Chicago area was just a few feet higher than the shoreline of Lake Michigan. For many years, there was little or no naturally occurring drainage from the city surface, and this lack of drainage caused unpleasant living conditions. Standing water harbored pathogens that caused numerous epidemics including typhoid fever and dysentery, culminating in the 1854 outbreak of cholera that killed six percent of the city's population. The crisis forced the city to take the drainage problem seriously. In 1856, engineer Ellis S. Chesbrough drafted a plan for the installation of a citywide sewerage system and submitted it to the city council, which adopted the plan.<br/><br/>However, due to the minimal elevation above the lake, the sewer could not be built underground and had to be built at street level. The city council then decided to implement a radical idea: Prevented from digging down, they instead decreed the buildings of the city would be raised to allow the new sewer system to be hidden under the new street level. Representing one of the four companies that were created to tackle the problem of raising the buildings of Chicago, it's up to you to gather resources, take on the most attractive projects, and help solve the sanitation crisis of the city.<br/><br/>On your turn in Raising Chicago, you place a tile on a resource slot associated with one of five building projects, then claim the resource you covered. After all players have placed tiles, each project is evaluated. The winning player pays resources to complete the project, claims the project reward, then places all of their tiles associated with that project as levels underneath the building onto a space on the board. Players earn points for placing buildings cleverly, doing the most work in a ward, and meeting the demands of council people.<br/><br/>Only the most successful player will win, so play strategically to prove you can raise buildings the best in Raising Chicago!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are 10 different symbols and may be in one of 8 different colors. The task of all participants is to search for the icon from the center of the final flipped card on the outer circle of the other three visible cards. The paired cards must match in both shape and color. As soon as one of the opponents finds such a card, he must quickly slap his palm on it and take the card.<br/><br/>It can very easily happen that there is no matching card on the table.

Make new discoveries to gain points, but don&rsquo;t be naive, many of these creatures still pose a threat to those who wander too carelessly into their home!<br/><br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>     8 Amateur Diver Tokens<br/>     8 Expert Tokens<br/>     2 Dice<br/>     16 Creature Cards<br/>     1 Rules Card<br/>     1 Research Vessel / Reference Card<br/><br/><br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>SETUP - Place the Research Vessel (RV) card to the side of the playing area. Spread the remaining cards face-down. Each player receives either the Red &amp; Gold, or Blue &amp; Silver set of diver tokens. Gold &amp; Silver are experts, and let you adjust your dice roll by +/-1 on the turn they are added to a card.<br/><br/>ON YOUR TURN - The lowest dice roll goes first. Place 2 amateurs or 1 expert token on any face-down card (or face-up card that you control) per turn. Roll both dice. If either dice matches the back of the card, flip it and place your token on a free square. If the roll total matches any face-up cards with your diver on them, take the action shown and end your turn.<br/><br/>DISCOVERIES - Each player may have a diver on a card back, however only the player who discovers it may add their tokens once the card flips. The losing player&rsquo;s token is returned to them. If you place divers on all available spaces on a card, on your next turn you may take the card as a Discovery Point, and retrieve your divers.<br/><br/>INJURIES &amp; ACCIDENTS - Dangerous creatures can injure your divers and send them to the RV. Once &lsquo;healed&rsquo; after 3 turns for injuries, or 1 for accidents, they can be placed again.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN - Collect 8 Discovery Points to win. Deduct 1 point for each diver still in recovery at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Agrarian is an economic farming game in which farmers go through a land bidding phase and then followed by a growing stage. During the bidding phase, different parcels of land will come up for auction in which all the farmers will put in a blind bid on each parcel of land. The highest bid gets the land.<br/><br/>During the second phase, farmers get a weather prediction and then have to decide what crops to grow. The more of one crop the group as a whole grows the less valuable it becomes. Weather also affects each crop differently. Once farmers decide what crops they are growing, the weather is decided by a dice roll that affects all farmers equally. Then crops are revealed and the value of the crops are adjusted based on the number of fields grown.<br/><br/>Farmers collect the amount of money they have made for each crop and then start the second round. 3 rounds later the game ends and the farmer with the most money wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ex nihilo is a highly tactical and quite novel stack-fighting game with an emergent checkmate-esque win condition. The novelty of this game lies in its central gimmick: Every move consists in moving a stack. In this sense it is a pure movement game. Yet, the game features both placement and captures.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>The game is for 2 players and is played with stackable pieces of two colors on a hexagonal arrangement of hexagons (a hexhex board). The board starts out empty. The game is over as soon as one player is unable to make a move. The other player is then the winner.<br/><br/>Movement &ndash; overview: <br/>Stacks move along straight open lines and grow when they move away from the center cell. This game is unusual in allowing movement of stacks containing 0 pieces. It is by growing these that pieces get onto the board in the first place.<br/><br/>Movement &ndash; details: <br/>On your turn, you must move a stack not topped by an enemy piece to an empty cell reachable through an unbroken line of empty cells. By convention, a single piece is considered a stack of size 1 and an empty cell is considered to contain a stack of size 0.<br/><br/>If, after you have moved a stack, it is farther away from the center cell than before it was moved (measured in number of steps), its size is increased by 1 per step further away from the center it now is. This is effected by adding pieces to the top of it from your hand.<br/><br/>You may move a proper part of a stack by splitting it.  That is, if a stack contains several pieces you can choose to only move the top n pieces, given that you do not change their order, for any number n less than the number of pieces in the stack.<br/><br/>You may also move a whole stack, but only on the condition that you move it farther away from the center cell. A consequence is that moving a whole stack always results in its size increasing. Together with the convention that empty cells contain stacks of size 0, this also has the consequence that you can effectively place a new stack on the board by moving a stack of size 0.<br/><br/>Note that nothing special happens to the cell you moved the 0-stack from &ndash; it still contains a 0-stack.<br/><br/>Capturing &ndash; overview: <br/>Flanked enemy stacks are captured by being taken hostage for a move. Capturing is obligatory: If a capturing move is available, a capturing move must be made.  The winner will be the player who manages to force their opponent to capture an immovable stack.<br/><br/>Capturing &ndash; details: <br/>If (and only if) the top piece of a stack is of your color, it is said to partake in flanking an enemy stack if (i) this enemy stack is exactly in the middle of a line of otherwise empty cells going from the flanking stack to another one of your stacks, and (ii) all three of these stacks are of the same size.<br/><br/>If, after you have moved a stack, it partakes in flanking one or more enemy stacks, you must immediately move one of these enemy stacks. Except for the obvious difference that you are moving an enemy stack, all normal rules apply to this move. For example: If the captured stack grows (if you move it farther away from the center cell, that is), it grows by the addition of pieces of your color, so situations where this hostage move must itself be a capturing move are possible. Such chaining of captures must continue until you capture a stack that is not in a position to continue the chain. Growing captured stacks is the only way to take ownership of them more permanently.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Survive the traps, take the riches (from other archaeologists if necessary), and get out alive to gain your fortune and glory!<br/><br/>The Adventures of Tennessee James is a board game for 1-4 players 8 years and up and can be played in 30 to 45 minutes.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with an Archaeologist of their choice and 3 Team Members. Players can spend up to 5 Actions per turn, and can either move 1 space or draw 1 card per Action. Players can repeat Actions during their turn and may also discard cards for extra Movement Actions.<br/><br/>Each temple contains an entrance and 24 spaces. Each space contains a face-down tile which could either be a treasure or a trap. If a player finds treasure, they keep it as a reward. If a player finds a trap, they must play cards to defeat it. If the trap is not defeated, the player loses a Team Member, which reduces how many Actions they can perform per turn. Make sure that you have enough cards to defeat traps because other players can play cards that make traps more difficult to defeat. If you run out of Team Members, and you can&rsquo;t defeat a trap, you lose the game. Find the most treasure and escape the temple to win the game, but don't stay too long or the temple will become your tomb.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This has been a nice way to introduce some of my non-miniatures gamer friends into a game with my miniatures.<br/><br/>The intended setting is near future and Sci Fi military or policing actions involving around a Squad&rsquo;s worth of models (usually ten or so), however I&rsquo;ve also used them for the Weird Wild West and Weird World War Two skirmishes so the rules are really usable across any gunfight setting. Occasionally, the rules have had a run out for a standard Dime Fiction Wild West shoot-out, Hollywood Colonial adventure or World War Two section-level encounter, using Primitive weapons and no armour (except for Clint Eastwood&rsquo;s boiler plate).<br/><br/>The rules are simple to pick up, but the turn sequence is a little unusual compared to many games: make sure you understand this before playing. You&rsquo;ll need a couple of dozen tokens for Initiative Points, and a few markers to place beside Stunned models. In addition, you will need a handful of six-sided dice, and if you&rsquo;re not using a gridded tabletop, a ruler marked in 6&rdquo; lengths.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The goal is to achieve the greatest profit of all players, surviving unexpected obstacles in transport and price levels while facing fierce competition from other players.<br/>Bayamigo is played over three days (different lengths can be agreed on). At the beginning of each day, players buy goods in bulk, and rent motorcycles or vans for the transport. Then they begin a journey through different markets. At each market, players can announce that they want to sell goods there. All players who want to sell, pay the required tax, then dice are rolled to determine the selling price. Each market has a maximum capacity, so turn order is important. Players who are not happy with the price can move on, but won&rsquo;t get their taxes back. At the end of the day, vehicles have to be returned, and interest has to be paid on any debts the players may have. Obstacle cards can get in your way, reflecting the risks that small-scale resellers face in their trade.<br/>The player who has made the greatest profit during the three days, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you draw a playing piece from the bag &mdash; feeling for a desired shape, if you wish, but not knowing the color of the piece &mdash; then place that piece in any legal location on the board. Pieces come in yellow, cyan, and magenta, and initially you must play these pieces on the lowest level of the game board. If you can play a piece so that it's entirely supported by other pieces, then you can play on the second level of the board; by doing this, you can create the secondary colors green, orange, and purple &mdash; and this is what you'll need to do to win.<br/><br/>Each player in the game is assigned a secondary color, and at the end of a three-player game, whoever has more spaces of their color showing wins. In a two-player game, the player with the largest contiguous block of their color wins, so the game is more about blocking than simply creating your color wherever you can. If you're green, for example, you want lots of yellow and cyan on the bottom level so that you can potentially transform it into green later, while magenta is useless to you and ideally you can stack magenta pieces on top of one another to put them out of play altogether.<br/><br/>The game ends once all the pieces have been played or when no piece remaining in the bag can fit on the board.<br/><br/>",

The main purpose of the game is to bring the SDG of one&rsquo;s chosen role (stakeholder) to the highest level of discussion, that is global attention.<br/><br/>Using cards you move your SDGs up on the scale. When an SDG reaches the top step, a vote begins. If all the players vote in favor, the round ends and the points are calculated. If even one player votes against, the SDG is placed on the lowest step and the round continues. Players have a limited number of votes against in each round.<br/><br/>The game ends after completing the third round, or at the end of any round chosen as the last one. The player with the highest score is the winner. In the event of a tie, the players share the win.<br/><br/>Summit 2030 is freely inspired by Stefano Luperto&rsquo;s &ldquo;King Up&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

On odd-sized boards, the center square must be light-colored.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack starts the game by performing one action. From then on, the players alternate performing two actions per turn. The available actions are:<br/><br/><br/>     Placing a friendly stone on an empty light square.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Moving a friendly stone from a light square to an adjacent empty dark square.<br/><br/><br/>You can only pass your turn, or the second action of a turn, if you have no legal actions available. There will always be a legal action available to at least one of the players.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color. A chain is a set of mutually connected stones. Two like-colored stones are connected if they occupy orthogonally adjacent squares or diagonally adjacent dark squares.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each diver is dealt 6 &quot;Depth&quot; cards and given two single coin treasure cards. The &quot;Depth&quot; cards consist of two suits - Octopus and Anchor and are numbered from 1 to 16 (meters). There are also two wild cards which are equal to zero meters of depth and may be used in forming discount hands or to deceive your fellow divers as to how many total meters may be in your hand.<br/><br/>Through discarding sets of two or three cards, the diver lowers the number of total &quot;meters&quot; held in their hand. Once the total is below 8, the diver may opt to declare &quot;diver down&quot; and claim the top most Treasure card. But be careful, another diver may have a lower amount of meters in hand and declare &quot;Diver Down Deep&quot; and claim that treasure instead, as well as claiming a single gold coin treasure card from the original declarer.<br/><br/>First diver to obtain Treasure cards totaling 10 gold coins is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players try to exit the maze board by answering clue cards that have rhyming answers. There are four categories available for play: Their Flair (People), Sports Shorts (Sports), Creature Feature (Animal) and Hodge Podge (Variety). Each card contains four numbered clues which determine how far a playing piece may move (e.g. - answering clue #3 means a player can move three spaces). There are three sub-categories in the game: Think Wink, Thinky Winky and Thinkety Winkety. These designate two-word answers of one, two or three syllables per word, respectively. However, since Thinkety Winkety cards are harder, they are treated as Wild cards that allow for moving five spaces on the board.<br/><br/>When a player gives an answer, opponents may either pass or challenge the answer. While there is one answer per clue, it is possible to have more than one correct answer. If a player passes, they accept the given answer. If they challenge, they consult the Challenge Card and check the answer given. If the answers don&rsquo;t match, it&rsquo;s an automatic wrong answer. Once a team is correct, they can move their piece the number of spaces the clue stated, or they may hinder opponents by moving their piece farther from the exit. Moves are also not limited to completely one direction. For example, a move of three could be played as two backwards and one to the left.<br/><br/>The first player or team to get their piece to the exit on the opposite side where they started, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In Bandits wager, bluff, double-cross your former allies, and win great riches in this game of skill and strategy for 2-4 Players.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>All Blinks begin as Bandits, which swirl and pulse with their team color. Each player should take a single Bandit from the set of Blinks and set it to their chosen team color. Each time you double-click a Bandit, it will change team.<br/><br/>Once everyone has a Bandit in their color, take another Bandit and triple-click it: this will transform it into a sparkling diamond. Place the Diamond in the center of the table, then begin the game.<br/>Gameplay (First Turn)<br/>Bandits is played in turns, with each turn broken into three phases: Bidding, Results, and Cleanup.<br/>Bidding<br/>Each player secretly bids a number between 1 and 3 on their Bandit. To do this, single-click your Bandit to see the current bid. Once it&rsquo;s revealed, you can single-click again to cycle through the three possible bids. A Bandit will automatically go back into its hidden state if you don&rsquo;t click it for 2 seconds.<br/><br/>After everyone has chosen their bid, players take turns placing their Bandit onto the Diamond, starting with the first player and then going around the table clockwise. On the first turn, the player with the most money in their pockets goes first.<br/><br/>On the first turn, all players will attach their Bandits directly to the Diamond. When a Bandit is correctly attached, the face touching the Diamond will sparkle white.<br/>Results<br/>After all Bandits have been attached, it&rsquo;s time to see the results. In Bandits, the highest unique bid is the winner. For example, if one player bids 3, another 2, and another 1, the player who bid 3 would be the winner. If, though, two players bid 3 and a third player only bids 1, the bid of 1 wins because it is the highest unique bid. If there is no highest unique bid, no player wins, and the turn moves immediately to cleanup.<br/><br/>To see the results, double-click the Diamond, which will begin calculating. After a few seconds, the winning Bandit will sparkle with victory, then receive their points. A Bandit that steals directly from the Diamond receives a number of points equal to 6 minus their bid, so 3 points for a bid of 3, 4 for a bid of 2, and 5 for a bid of 1.<br/>Cleanup<br/>After the results have been handed out, the losing players remove their Bandit from the Diamond. The winning player, if there is one, leaves their Bandit on the Diamond, extending the board outward. That player retrieves a new Bandit from the pile and sets it to their team color, and bids first in the next round..<br/>Gameplay (Following Turns)<br/>After the first round, there will be at least one Bandit attached to the Diamond permanently. This Bandit will display the number of points it earned, and will sparkle like the Diamond on its outside edge. This extends the Diamond itself, and changes the way that players bid for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>During betting, instead of attaching to the Diamond itself, a player can place their Bandit onto the outside edge of the scored Bandit. They must attach directly opposite the Diamond, and their Bandit will sparkle as if attached to the Diamond itself to show that this was done correctly. Because they can only be attached in this way, the number of available faces is always 6, even after multiple Bandits are stacked outward.<br/><br/>If a player wins a round by attaching to another Bandit, they also score differently. Instead of taking points directly from the Diamond, they steal points from the Bandit they attached to equal to half its points, rounded up. For instance, if you win a round while connected to a Bandit that had scored 3 points in a previous round, that Bandit would lose 2 points and you would gain 2. Points will only be stolen from the Bandit on the outside edge, meaning once a Bandit has been stolen from it will keep the remaining points for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>In a typical game of Bandits, players can only build out to a distance of 3 from the Diamond.<br/>Win Condition<br/>The game ends when no more bids can be made. This might be because there aren&rsquo;t enough Bandits left to play a full round, or because the Diamond has 3 scored Bandits attached to each face.<br/><br/>When the game ends, each player adds up the points they scored on each of their scored Bandits. The player (or players) who scored the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>Long press any Blink to reset all connected Blinks back to unscored Bandits.<br/><br/>",

If the cards in your hand meet the requirements of the next square (e.g., you have a &quot;5&quot; in your hand, two red cards, etc.), you can advance to the next square.<br/><br/>If you can create a hand that can meet the conditions of multiple squares, you can advance to several squares at once in one turn.<br/>It's hard to decide whether you should have all the cards in your hand and move forward at once or chop them up into small pieces.<br/><br/>Since the sugoroku squares are cards, the board changes every time you play, and the best way to make the best hand changes every time, so you can play with a fresh mind as often as you like.<br/><br/>In addition, each card is a real-life jungle of tourist attractions in Kyoto (Kyoto Tower, Fushimi Inari Taisha Shrine, etc.).<br/>It is also fun to see the beautiful maiko pieces you use strutting around the exotic Kyoto.<br/><br/>The game takes about 15 minutes per game, and is a game for two players that can be played easily while worrying.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

From 1895 to 1945, Taiwan was colonized by Japan. In that time, Japan heavily invested in modernizing Taiwan&rsquo;s railway system around the island, with bold plans including building tunnels and tracks through mountains. In the Taiwan map for Mini Express, the white company represents Japan. Players are seeking to expand tracks across the island, especially to the 6 major cities; however, mountains pose a logistical problem. Players can at any time invest in Japanese modernization, and it indeed comes with benefits. However, the more players do business with Japan, the tighter the restrictions are in the game. Soon, you might find your influence in a company reduced to nothing if you&rsquo;re not careful. Fulfill your dreams of steel and steam!

Players roll the die and move their pawns along the dotted paths. Upon landing on a hidden treasure, the player flips the piece to reveal a gold coin, diamond, jeweled ring, or silver chalice. It can also feature a boat which sends a diver back to their starting point.<br/><br/>Divers can strategically bump each other back to their boats, by passing through the a spot on a the board that's occupied by an opponent.<br/><br/>Divers may also choose to take the longer more predictable routes by staying on the dotted path, or attempt to pass through murky waters to make a quicker trip. To pass through murky waters, players draw a murky water card which indicates if they successfully pass through or not.<br/><br/>The first player to collect all four treasures and make their way to the center of the board wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Set in Jen Eric High School, Grad Rush is a 2 player strategy board game that pits players to get their students to graduation as fast as possible. Players will play student cards to the board that advance forward every turn. Once your student and an enemy's student land on the same space they will perform a face-off, a rock-paper-scissors battle of athletes, misfits, and preps. The loser drops out and the winner continues on. Once a student gets to the opponent's side they will be added to the graduating class. Once players have 10 GPA in their graduating class they win. Players can use single use event cards to drastically alter the board to their advantage. There are also several game modes available to play including a cube draft and a 2 v 2 format with an extra copy of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To do this, your team will have to draw, mimic and overcome unexpected events that will reveal your most secret sides.<br/><br/>There are two modes:<br/><br/>Classic - risque enough for 95% of the population<br/>Party - only for the most daring, ready to drink one glass too many<br/><br/>When to play Stimulus: college parties, bachelor parties, bachelorette parties, pre-evening and any other occasion when your parents aren't around ...<br/><br/>How to Play Stimulus<br/><br/>Open the game table, take the decks of cards and place them face down on the game table. Players divide into teams of at least 2 people. Each team chooses a pawn and defines the captain for the first round. The most excited team starts by rolling the die and moving their pawn on the board.<br/><br/>The captain draws the card that corresponds to the color of the square you arrived at. He looks at the word on the card, and passes it discreetly to the designers of the other teams. It's time to draw. Once all the designers have seen the card, the countdown 3,2,1 starts, GO!<br/><br/>The other members of each team will have to guess the artwork of their designers. The first team to guess wins the round. The winning team rolls the die and repeats steps 4 - 6.<br/><br/>Includes rules for drinking game version as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Don&rsquo;t be fooled, the landscape and the house are always the same but all around goats, horses, tools, and buckets move! Where did they leave the wheelbarrow? And where did the bison go?<br/><br/>You need to have hawk eyes and cat-like reflexes to be able to spot all the elements every time and beat your opponents: at the end of the game who will be the fastest draw in the West?<br/><br/>The game features landscape cards, scoreboard tokens and 36 cards. Each player must get as many tokens as possible to win the game.

You have to be skilled with anagrams, but also fast, creative and intuitive!<br/><br/>The youngest player begins who takes the pink slate and a marker, draws an anagramm card, and puts it in the center of the table face up. He turns the spinner indicating the number of letters of the word to form, then starts the hourglass and, using the letters of the drawn card, try to form a word by writing it on the slate without showing it to others and revealing the initial letter.<br/><br/>The other players must try to guess the mysterious word in about  15 seconds of time and everyone has only guess. If no one guesses, the competitor on duty reveals the second letter of the word and, if he still does not guess anyone, reveals the third letter of the mysterious word. The round ends when a competitor guesses the mysterious word or no one guesses after the third letter.<br/><br/>The game continues with a new round, identical to the previous one (the player on duty changes clockwise). The spinner can indicate to form a word of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 letters. If the arrow points to the smiley face, the player can form a word with any number of letters, which he must declare together with the first letter of the word.<br/><br/>The playerho guesses the word on the first hit earns 3 points, on the second letter 2 points and on the third letter 1 point.  If no one guesses, 3 points go to the author of the word.  If the current player fails to form the word, he loses 3 points.    The winner is whoever reaches 25 points first (or more, or less, at the choice of the players before starting the race).<br/><br/>When a competitor guesses the mysterious word, he plays with the anagrams: he takes the light green (large) slate and a marker and, in the time of an hourglass, tries to write as many anagrams as possible of the guessed word - you do not use all the letters of the word).  To his normal score, he can add one point for each anagram of the starting word.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

In this fun party game, the winner is whoever provides the most news and information on a topic, among seven fields of knowledge.<br/><br/>The deck of knowledge cards is shuffled and placed face down in the center of the table.  Each competitor takes a marker, a slate and four plus tokens (Where? How? When? And Why?) of the same color. The youngst player starts spinning the spinner and draws a knowledge card.  All players must write on their slate attributes, qualities, characteristics or other elements, up to a maximum of four, which identify the topic present in the knowledge card in correspondence with the symbol indicated by the spinner.  The first one who writes four attributes says &quot;STOP&quot; and counts up to 15, after which the other competitors also stop and score points.<br/><br/>When the spinner points to the wedge with the little face, the choice of the category is at the player's discretion.  The game continues in the same way with another round (change the player whose turn it is clockwise). The winner is the one who reaches 30 points first (or more, or less, at the choice of the competitors).<br/><br/>Each competitor earns 1 point for each attribute identified.  If the attribute is original, or was not identified by any other player, it is worth 3 points.  The score can also double: after the spinner has been turned, but before the knowledge card is drawn, each player can decide to play one of the four plus tokens.  Competitors who have played the token doubles the score for each attribute that answers the question contained in the token played: How? Where is it? When? and why? Played plus tokens must be set aside and can no longer be used.  Furthermore, plus tokens cannot be played when the spinner lands on the wedge with the face.<br/><br/>",

The Kaiyo was lost in an accident, and the new government army acquired the ironclad Kotetsu, and the power balance changed drastically.<br/><br/>The player aims to establish the Republic of Ezo from the standpoint of Takeaki Enomoto. The operation of the Navy is important, but money is needed for the Navy to function. Taxes must be collected while paying attention to the feelings of the residents, and ground troops and warships must be prepared to prepare for the arrival of the new government army. Can you fight better than historically against the new government forces who are trying to end the civil war early with the game system? Or can we achieve the long-cherished desire to establish the Republic of Ezo?<br/><br/>Published in Banzai EX Magazine No.9<br/><br/><br/>箱館戦争は近代日本が直面した最初の海洋戦略が戦局を左右する戦争でした──当時国内最強の軍艦〈開陽〉を要する旧幕府軍が海軍力で新政府軍を圧倒していましたが、その〈開陽〉を事故で失い、新政府軍が装甲艦〈甲鉄〉を手に入れ、パワー・バランスは激変しました。プレイヤーは榎本武揚の立場で蝦夷共和国の樹立を目指します。海軍の運用が重要ですが、海軍を機能させるためには金が必要です。住民感情に注意しつつ徴税し、地上部隊と軍艦を整備して、新政府軍の来寇に備えなければなりません。果たしてあなたは、ゲーム・システムによって内戦を早期に終わらせようとする新政府軍を相手に、史実より善戦できるでしょうか。あるいは、蝦夷共和国樹立の悲願を達成できるでしょうか。<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Map: 1 A3 size<br/>Counter: 99 pieces of 15 mm square (including the following variants for &quot;Hakodate Sensou&quot; and &quot;Red Crescent White Cross (First Balkan War Variant in &quot;Red Sun Blue Cross&quot;)<br/>Rulebook: A4 size 12 pages<br/>Player assistance card: 1 A4 size<br/><br/>",

Are you up for a challenge?<br/><br/>The puzzles are in the &quot;At Home Mystery&quot;-style, meaning they resemble the kind of thought process used in Escape Rooms - but are solvable at home! Clues are scattered throughout all the seven Cards, and combining those clues will bring you step by step closer to the final answer of each card. To solve them you will have to use all of your puzzle-skills extensively, from out-of-the-box-thinking to deciphering and researching. Every card is its own puzzle, and one card (the Letters Card), is a meta-card. That means that it incorporates the final answers of all the other Cards in its puzzles.<br/><br/>You should be able to send the Cards by mail, as they conform to most of the international postcard guidelines (including PostNL). The Cards vary greatly in difficulty and general puzzle-style, so there should be one available for every kind of puzzle-fanatic out there. You do not need to damage anything on the Cards in order to solve them, so after you've finished you can just send them on to one of your puzzle-lovin' friends!<br/><br/>This product contains one printed set of The Cards of Confound, containing all seven Cards and a Users Guide. To help you out during all the puzzling, you can find step-by-step-hints and spoiler-free solution checkers on our website.<br/><br/>",

It is played with a deck of cards containing 5 suits of 15 numbers each.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Shuffle the deck and fan out 25 stacks of 3 cards each in a regular layout of 5 rows and 5 columns. All cards should be visible, and it should be clear which cards are on which layer of the layout. (The 25 top cards in the initial position are on the top layer, and underneath that there are two more layers of 25 cards each.)<br/><br/>Definitions:<br/>Every card belongs in a number group together with all and only those cards which are connected to it by a sequence of orthogonal steps between cards with equal numbers. The members of a group all lie on the same layer.<br/>A suit group is defined the same way, except &quot;number&quot; is replaced with &quot;suit&quot;.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>On your turn, you first distribute a number group, then you collect a suit group.<br/><br/>Distribute: Pick up a number group from the current top layer and distribute them anew on the layout. You may not place two of these cards in the same stack, and you may not place them underneath any cards. Other than that, you are free to choose any of the 25 sites in the layout. There is no limit on how many cards there can be at each site.<br/><br/>Collect: Pick up any suit group from the current top layer and store those cards in a personal scoring pile on your side of the board.<br/><br/>Ending the game:<br/>When all cards are collected, the winner is the player whose scoring pile contains the majority of the cards in the majority of the suits.<br/><br/>Slight variations: <br/><br/>     Add the requirement that all cards (or at least one card) in the chosen number group are in a new position after distributing.<br/>     When distributing, cards must be moved in a straight (diagonal or orthogonal) line.<br/><br/><br/>Decks you can play Garner with:<br/>Rage<br/>Stick 'Em<br/>5&deg;Dimension Playing Card Game<br/>Sluff Off!<br/>Tricky Bid<br/>David &amp; Goliath<br/><br/>Ways of playing with more traditional decks:<br/><br/>(A) <br/><br/>     9 cards in 3 suits from a standard French deck. <br/>     Layout: 9 stacks of 3 cards each in a 3x3 grid.<br/><br/><br/>(B) <br/><br/>     12 cards in 3 suits from a standard French deck. <br/>     Layout: 9 stacks of 4 cards each in a 3x3 grid. <br/>     Extra rule: You may never have exactly 6 cards in a suit in your scoring pile. If collecting a suit group would bring the number of cards you have in that suit to 6, you must leave behind a card in the layout, even if it means collecting 0 cards.<br/><br/><br/>(C) <br/><br/>     13 cards in 3 suits and 9 cards in 1 suit from a standard French deck. <br/>     Layout: 16 stacks of 3 cards each in a 4x4 grid. <br/>     Extra rule: The suit with 9 cards is worth half a suit.<br/><br/><br/>(D) <br/><br/>     9 cards in 4 suits from a standard French deck and 9 cards in a suit form a different deck, like a German deck or Tarot deck. <br/>     Layout: 15 stacks of 3 cards each in a 3x5 grid.<br/><br/><br/>(E)<br/><br/>     12 cards in 4 suits from a standard French deck and 12 cards in a suit form a different deck, like a German deck or Tarot deck.<br/>     Layout: 20 stacks of 3 cards each in a 4x5 grid.<br/>     Extra rule: You may never have exactly 6 cards in a suit in your scoring pile.

Players place tiles representing a different industry (service, trade, hospitality, leisure, residential) into matching districts and score points based on which where it was played and how many other tiles had been played there.  There are also three, black-bordered wild plots that can be from any industry.  The game comes with 60 tiles and show actual companies and organizations from Ratingen ... or at least were in Ratingen in 1998.<br/><br/>To begin the game, the tiles are shuffled and placed face down in a general supply.  Each player draws 6 tiles and places them face up in front of them.<br/><br/>On each turn, the following may happen:<br/><br/><br/>     Exchange: The active player may give two tiles to another player and take one of their tiles.  This cannot be refused.<br/>     Place Tiles: The player may place as many tiles as they want onto empty plots in one district.  Tiles much match the plots by color.  The player then scores points according to what is printed on the board for that district and the number of tiles placed there.<br/>     Draw Tiles: The player draws 0-3 tiles from the supply.  This number must be announced before the first tile is drawn.<br/><br/><br/>Each action is optional, but they must be performed in the above order.<br/><br/>The game ends when all plots have been filled, or if one player has placed 5 sets of tiles on the board (i.e. placed tiles on 5 separate occasions during the game).  If that happens, all other players get one more turn each.  Each remaining unplayed tile is -5 points for the player holding them, and then whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Each is an elite warrior-mystic clad in sigil-scribed power armour and wielding archaic weapons through which they channel their otherworldly abilities. They are a purified order, incorruptible and possessed of iron fortitude. They have to be, for the Grey Knights face down the most nightmarish horrors from the seething depths of the warp: the Daemons of Chaos. Their Brotherhoods use the shifting immaterium to their advantage, drawing on it to direct coruscating energies and outmanoeuvring their foes through pinpoint teleportation. Their warriors unleash a storm of firepower, supported by sanctified battle tanks, gunships, and giant warsuits whose psychic weapons can banish the greatest of Daemons back into the warp.<br/><br/>The secretive and sinister 666th Chapter of Space Marines are a force of elite warriors, even beyond their Adeptus Astartes kin. Each member of the Chapter has an affinity for the powers of the warp, and they can channel their gifts in battle to blast their foes apart with bolts of energy as well as the might of their arms. Clad in power armour of unusual design, and armed with weapons of rare potency, this small but deadly army strikes from their hidden base on Titan, more than a match for the strongest enemies the Imperium must face.<br/><br/>Inside this 112-page book, you'll find:<br/><br/>- The clandestine legacy of the Grey Knights, including their myth-shrouded founding and classified operations throughout the history of the Imperium<br/>- A guide to the unorthodox organisation and heraldry of the Grey Knights and their various Brotherhoods<br/>- A Grey Knights bestiary with background details for every unit and Character featured<br/>- A showcase of stunningly painted Citadel miniatures<br/>- Rules for units that are available to the armies of the Grey Knights &ndash; including 32 datasheets<br/>- Stratagems, Relics, and optional secondary objectives that illustrate the mystifying goals and remarkable tactics of the Grey Knights<br/>- A Crusade section providing Agendas, Crusade Relics, Battle Traits, Requisitions, Psychic Fortitudes, Honoured Titles, and unique Daemonic Nemesis rules<br/>- Loads more<br/><br/>You will need a copy of the Warhammer 40,000 rulebook to use the rules included in this codex.<br/><br/>",

Puzzles within puzzles within puzzles, within a luxury deck of custom playing cards. And all of this is themed on an estate shrouded in mystery called Riverbank ...<br/><br/>Included within this fully functional, seemingly regular deck of playing cards are four very special cards, each with its own puzzle for you to solve.<br/><br/>Solving all four puzzles will unlock an incredible, multilayered, eight-step puzzle hunt expertly designed by Dave Shukan, master puzzle-maker. Combine answers from every puzzle you've solved along the way and you will reveal the final, meta-puzzle answer. A true puzzler&rsquo;s paradise!<br/><br/>ENIGMAS are themed on a fascinating historical place -- a mysterious estate outside of Chicago called Riverbank. Over one hundred years ago, the scientists at Riverbank worked on cryptography projects: the estate was filled with secret messages and codes. And exotic animals like alligators, peacocks, monkeys and bears roamed the property!<br/><br/>Illustrator Billy French has masterfully captured all of these bizarre and beautiful elements into the ENIGMAS design. The card backs are adorned with historically accurate imagery from the Riverbank estate, like its windmill and lighthouse. Owls, representing wisdom and learning, are perched on the bookshelves, guarding its secrets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Evil In The North is a solitaire adventure game that is set in a dark wintry realm. The player oversees several game characters as they fulfill missions in this challenging environment. These characters represent a declining pagan population that is caught between the New Religion and the spiteful counter-religion known as the Growing Evil. This latter division includes ruffians, malicious necromancers, the infamous NecroFiend occultists, and demons from foul depths.<br/><br/>Player guided characters will travel on a map that consists of card tiles. These tiles require various checks as the characters move from turn to turn. At the same time, game controlled characters known as NecroFiends will be spawned; eventually traveling the tile map through an automated movement system. When player characters run into a NecroFiend, conflict is likely to occur. Opposition can also emerge through the Occurrence deck (from entering a tile) or through the Demon deck (upon exiting a tile). These encounters gnaw away at a character's vital resource --their followers. A lack of followers makes a character extremely vulnerable and will often lead to elimination from the game if more followers cannot be acquired soon.<br/><br/>Combat in the world of Evil in the North is resolved through two means, Brute Conflict and DarkArts Conflict. The former combat type is associated with physical conflict and uses a Combat Results Table involving up to three 4-sided dice. The latter combat type is associated with sorcery and uses a simpler system involving the combatants' INSIGHT ratings and a single 4-sided die.<br/><br/>The game is divided into 3 stages to represent the different missions to be undertaken. To win Evil in the North, a player must fulfill every mission started. The game is lost if all player characters perish during the performance of a mission, regardless of how many missions have been completed. Without losing, you may end a game after any mission (but before another has begun).<br/><br/>ABOUT THE REIMPLEMENTATION:<br/>This game builds on Black Metal by offering a whole new map treatment. Rather than building the tile map as you play, Evil in the North uses a preset tile map that is arranged prior to play. The preset tile map constrains player movement to a 7 x 7 grid (removing the chances of a run-away tile map). Furthermore, additional map tiles have been added to create the vast Ice Sea; a central area of the tile map consisting of 9 map tiles. Additional rules have been created to serve this new aspect of the tile map.<br/><br/>Unlike Black Metal, a regular game of Evil In The North is played with full map disclosure (all map tiles are displayed face-up from the onset).<br/><br/>Other changes/additions include:<br/>--Updated text on many cards (mainly to accommodate the new tile map)<br/>--An updated and consolidated rulebook (integrating the Mission booklet)<br/>--New and updated rulebook diagrams<br/>--New rules and sections within the rulebook (including a new Q&amp;A and Card Clarifications section)<br/>--An official variant sheet for an advanced game<br/><br/>",

The board starts off empty.<br/><br/>The players are Black and White, with Black going first. Each has a supply of stones in her color that fit the board spaces.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player takes one of the following two actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Drop a stone of her color onto a black space &mdash; a stone may never be entered in a white space.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Shift a stone of her color already on the board a single space orthogonally &mdash; in other words, move a stone from a black space into a neighboring white space.<br/><br/><br/>The winner is the first player to get five of her stones in a row horizontally or vertically, or four stones in row diagonally on white spaces. Stones on black spaces cannot win with a diagonal line.<br/><br/>Optional rule: Players may decide to help mitigate Black's first move advantage by adopting a rule prohibiting Black from winning with the easier B-W-B-W-B orthogonal line and only allowing Black to win with the harder W-B-W-B-W orthogonal line.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll collect symptoms and use them to construct a diagnosis. You&rsquo;ll challenge and outwit your rivals, and you&rsquo;ll get the recognition you deserve &ndash; at any cost!<br/><br/>Your objective in Prognosis Death is to either have the lowest score remaining in your hand when the patient is discharged, or the highest score in the case that the patient succumbs to their illness and perishes.<br/><br/>At the start of every turn in Prognosis Death you&rsquo;ll add symptoms to your hand by either drawing an unknown card from the deck, or by taking a card from the public discard area. At the end of every turn, you&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to remove symptoms from your hand either by making a diagnosis, which consists of a set of matching symptoms, or by discarding a card to the public discard area.<br/><br/>Every symptom card has an effect that will either trigger when that card is discarded, or when you make a diagnosis with that card as the top-most card. Symptoms also have effects that will trigger when they are retrieved from the public discard area. Whether these effects help or hinder you will depend on the card!<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the game cards in each player&rsquo;s hand will become revealed and will become accessible to players who can see them. For the most part you can use accessible cards in any player&rsquo;s hand as though they were in your hand, but beware, cards that you have revealed become inaccessible to you - if it is still in your hand at the end of the game it will count towards your score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This is achieved by entering the box where the stones are or by taking them away from the other players, using the same method.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player can move their avatar, use nature powers, or change nature cards to summon one of the 4 animals on the board, so that more than one avatar can be used per player. If a player is caught, he loses the elements that he has been adding in his game (cards, powers, stones, animals) and returns to the origin, from where he re-enters the board.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player manages to collect the 4 Stones of the Universe<br/><br/>Throughout the game we can find sacred spaces of protection, with characters known to all such as the flap, the pachamama, the salamanca, native animals and the use of powers of nature to achieve objectives.<br/><br/>Piedras del Universo invites meeting, collaboration, concentration and strategy development, in addition to training adaptation to the unexpected and problem solving. Its instruction manual is at the same time, the construction of a story full of characters and situations that help us learn more about our own mythology.<br/><br/>",
