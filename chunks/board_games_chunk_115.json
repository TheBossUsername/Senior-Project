        "description": "Have you ever hooked up with someone within an hour of meeting them, or blacked out before 9 p.m. because you were too drunk?<br/> Unlike most of the party games you have played, THIS ONE TIME, I... provides an explicit, hilarious opportunity for friends to relive their funny, dirty and downright crazy life experiences. We have probed deep into the dirty pasts of people to compile hundreds of ludicrous life choices that we can all relate to.<br/> The game is played with Confession Cards, which are examples of ludicrous life choices, and Rule Cards which tell you how to play each round - that make it easy and fun to learn who&rsquo;s the craziest, dirtiest, wildest friend of the group!<br/><br/>Every round, a player selects a Red Rule Card from the top of the pile, reads the instructions aloud and must then do as the Rule Card says.<br/> If you are guilty of an act detailed by a Blue Confession Card given to you, you must add it to your losing pile (face up) in front of you until the end of the game, so that everyone can enjoy reliving your bad decisions. If you are not guilty of a Confession Card, you must scrap it.<br/> The first player to have 10 Confession Cards in their losing pile loses the game. There are no winners in this game, only losers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "弱者の剣 (Jakusha no Tsurugi, &quot;Sword of the Weak&quot;) is the first game from Polygonotes. It resembles the classic card game Daifugo but adds many twists.<br/><br/>At the start of a round each player is dealt six normal cards and one Sword of the Weak card. Normal cards have two numbers on them, one blue and one red, that always add up to nine, as well as a colored symbol in the middle. The Sword of the Weak has a different pattern on the back and its red and blue numbers are both one.<br/><br/>Your goal is to play all your cards. Each turn you have to either pass (and draw a card) or play cards to the middle. In order to play cards to the middle you have to have a higher total than the previous hand, and whether you use the red or blue numbers depends on the Scales card by the deck - it starts on blue, but every time a Sword of the Weak is played it's flipped. Being lucky will help you play larger hands, but in order to win you'll have to correctly time when you play your Sword card for the greatest advantage.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Three markers each go into your action supply, and three more go into your energy supply.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a round, turn over a Spare Parts card.<br/><br/>Take turns placing a marker from an Action Supply onto one or more Spare Parts.<br/><br/>If you lack the appropriate skill in your role, you may still place a marker on the card, but you must also place a marker in your energy supply. The task has you particularly strained.<br/><br/>Every now and then, you'll need to rest instead so that you can replenish your action supply.<br/><br/>If a spare part has all the markers you need on it, you may use it to start repairing a machine by placing one of the markers on it. Each color may only appear once.<br/><br/>When you have completely repaired a machine with the help of the spare parts, it is ready for use again and you may turn over a training card.

        "description": "Squiggly Worms features a large plastic &quot;apple&quot; that contains 20 plastic worms inside of 20 holes. The apple is mechanically operated by pulling a lever (no batteries required). A player pulls the lever which causes the worms to move up and down, popping out of the holes. The player must grab the worms one at a time and check to see if the color on the tail matches one of the color cards in his hand. If it matches he keeps the worm. If it doesn't match he puts it back in the hole. Other players can watch to see what colors are put back in case they need them. When the worms stop moving the player's turn ends. The player with the most color matches wins.<br/><br/>",

Then imagine what it would be like to strap it on some unsuspecting soul.<br/>Now let's imagine putting that person through a series of all sorts of embarrassing questions. Can't you just see all the other guests laughing every time the machine registers a lie? Imagine the fun, imagine the spectacle...Imagine no more!<br/><br/>Call it the perfect ice breaker, a novelty, a gizmo from hell, call it idQuest the lie detector game.<br/><br/>idQuest is a socially interactive adult party game that consists of a hand held lie detector and 216 socially provocative questions. The lie detector was developed and patented by a police polygraph examiner and an electronics engineer. The questions are designed to contrast the id and the ego. The questions are about things that most people have done or thought about, but don't want to admit.<br/><br/>Players are divided up into two teams. After determining who will be questioned first, the question cards are then randomly selected and read to all players.<br/><br/>The other team must then discuss which question will generate the highest emotional response from the player being questioned. Once this has been decided, with the lie detector engaged, the two questions are asked. The hand held lie detector will then display the size of the emotional response to each question using an illuminated bar graph. If the opposing team guessed correctly the device sounds an incriminating alarm and they are awarded a point.<br/><br/>You'll laugh at each other! You'll laugh at yourself! You'll find out how much you don't know about friends, and how much we all have in common.<br/><br/>Nominated by the National Research Council as one of the most innovative projects of 1996.<br/><br/>",

The second by Scolopendra Games Creator Joseph Pendergast.<br/><br/>Rules of play:<br/>Each person gets a player strip and the cards are placed face down on the table. If you do not have enough strips for all the players just remember to stop at 6 cards. Take turns flipping cards onto your player strips in turn.<br/>Squirrel cards clear your line and you get no points.<br/>Hawk cards clear all lines and no points are collected.<br/>White raven cards are wild and the suggested use is to double the score of a line but, it is up to you.<br/>Once you have successfully filled a line with cards you may choose to keep your score by counting the number of birds up and adding them to what you already have acquired or if any blank cards are present you may try to gain more points by waiting to cover them a turn at a time until you desire to stay with what you have. After a line is successfully cleared draw a new card and play resumes. If a hawk or squirrel clears your line you do not pick up a new card.<br/>Place all used birds in a face-up discard pile.  You may not draw from this discard pile. When you run out of cards shuffle the discard and continue play.<br/>Once the agreed upon score is reached by any player either that player wins after all other players finish their turns or all other players have a chance to overcome the winner before the deck runs out.<br/>This rule card may be used as an optional 4 bird card.<br/>For a quick single player game, try to make it to 30 points in one round through the deck.<br/>The number of points you choose to go to decides how long gameplay will be I generally play to 30 but some people will play to 1000.<br/><br/>",

These letters are attached on circular pegs that freely rotate. This enables you to rotate each letter so that you can spell words in any direction.<br/><br/>Players have 90 seconds manipulate the cube to form a word in a straight line that may wrap around the cube. Other sub-cube faces have Scrabble-type point modifiers such as double letter score or tripe word score. You get to use these point modifiers if they appear at the beginning or end of your word. A variant allows you to use these modifiers to represent any letter. Players also score bonuses if their word covers more than one face and if it intersects a previously created word (and that word still appears on the cube).<br/><br/>From the web site of the game, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.scrublecube.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.scrublecube.com/</a>:<br/><br/>If you can spell you can play ...

Taking turns, each player rolls the special die and draws a deck from the indicated deck to start testing his or her knowledge (and to move his or her token).<br/><br/>The four different categories have different styles of tests and rewards.  The Big Picture provides a snippet of a plot and asks for the movie title and two of its major stars; a correct answer allows the player to move their token ahead a space.  Fast Forward/Rewind provides three clues on an actor or film, advancing the player's token two spaces for a correct answer but backwards two spaces for an incorrect one.  Correctly answering Outtakes' questions about trivia allows a player to move an opponent's token back three spaces.  Action's task is basically a scramble against time for everyone to write down 6 films related to a category, advancing those who answered correctly.<br/><br/>The first player to move his or her token to the last space on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In stage one players travel around a a perimeter track, 'the inner ring road' on the roll of two dice, collect income on one corner and pay taxes on another.  Each space represents a parking space.  These give either an option to purchase either property  or pick up a card and follow the instructions on it. The object is to collect a complete site made up of ten back-land plots together with a drainage easement.  When a player has achieved this, movement moves to the outer (ring road?) track that is meant to represent the process of obtaining Planning Approval for the development. This is achieved by firstly collecting cards giving recommendations for approval from three separate local authority departments and then being the first to land on the town hall space: yes, on the roll of the dice and, yes, doubles mean another go!<br/><br/>",

Rule Cards are in effect until replaced by the next rule card that is placed on top.<br/><br/>Red Boxes - The boxes on the bottom half of the Rules Cards are known as the Action Boxes. These are specific tasks that must be completed by the person that plays the card.<br/><br/>Numbers on Cards - Located in the upper left corner of all cards. This is the number of drinks to be had if anyone breaks a rule or loses a challenge.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt four cards. Play begins to the left of the dealer. The first player can choose to play either color card to begin the game. The next player must play a card of the opposite color (or take a drink and skip their turn.)

        "description": "EleMental is a 3D strategy board game for ages 10+. Players take charge of the five EleMental forces of Earth, Water, Fire, Air and Time and battle it out across the EleMental planes to reach the center of the board - Creation.<br/><br/>Once a player has reached Creation they must build up a collection of EleMents to the extent that they are immovable, or better still, get all five types of EleMent onto the creation spot, thereby making an 'Ultimate' or 'Perfect Force'. An IMMOVABLE, PERFECT or ULTIMATE FORCE instantly wins the game.<br/><br/>How a player wins the game determines how many points they are awarded at the end; this points tally can be affected by throwing the EleMental dice. If a player is confident they will win they can throw the dice to multiply the points - multipliers range from 2x to 20x the winning points total.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mare Bella is a children's game that takes place at the sea side. Players have to collect 5 hidden types of sea animals and avoid picking up rubbish such as tires and old boots that have been washed up by the tide. But if they do, they will have the opportunity to rid the beach of such litter, which brings its own reward.<br/><br/>For the younger player, the game has a simple environmental message; for the older player it has a gameplay in which a certain amount of skill and memory is involved.<br/><br/>Basic Rules:<br/><br/>Each player has a 'lotto' board, with space for 5 sea animals: a fish, starfish, crab, sea urchin (type thing) and an octopus. The aim is to be the first to collect all 5 of these, from amongst the square tiles that are laid out over the playing area. Players receive the 'beach bag' from which they draw a round token (same idea as dipping into the Scrabble bag that holds the letters). This token has on it a particular fish type or a particular colour on it. The player then chooses a square tile from the playing area whose upside corresponds in colour or fish type to the round token. He/she flips over the square tile to reveal its underside (which is likely to be different). If the underside is a fish that he/she hasn't collected yet, then the player adds it to his 'lotto' board. If the underside shows a pollution, he/she must collect the pollution. Once a player has three, then he/she may remove them from the game and get a 'free dip'.<br/><br/>Memorising the underside of certain tiles definitely helps, but is not essential, meaning that anyone can play from the age of 3 and up, although the game is certainly illustrated with kids in mind.<br/><br/>The game is soon to be available in the UK, costing around &pound;18.

It may be used during any combat.<br/><br/>     Show everybody the bottle so they can read the rules and see whether it's sealed.  Only if the bottle is sealed at the beginning of the game can you be sure it contains genuine Munchkin Water.  Refilled bottles cannot be used for a combat bonus, even with a cheat card.<br/>     A sealed bottle contains three swallows - that is, doses - of Munchkin Water. Each swallow gives +1 in combat.  You must unseal the bottle and actually drink one swallow for each +1 you want.  You may drink all for one combat, to get +3, or spread it out between combats.  You may give swallows of your Munchkin Water to other players, but be careful not to share Munchkin germs.<br/>     After each swallow, you must mark off one of the three boxes on the label.  When all three boxes are marked off, the bottle is empty for game purposes, though you should still finish all the water, because it's good for you.<br/>     For alternate expanded rules see <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.sjgames.com/munchkin/water\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.sjgames.com/munchkin/water</a><br/><br/><br/>",

One card is dealt on the table face-up and the dealer calls &quot;MIX&quot;. Players now simultaneously pick up their cards and try to create an equation using exactly three of them with addition, subtraction, or multiplication that will result in the number on the face-up card. For example, if the face-up card shows 11, then (2 x 3) + 5 would do. Fastest player to create a valid equation calls &quot;FIX&quot; and wins a point; play until 21 points to find out who's the winner of the whole game.<br/><br/>Box back claims three play variants, but the rules actually have four: Solo game (practising math), Team game (team gets a point if any team member is the fastest), Joker game (jokers are included in the deck, can be any number) or Memory game (cards are simply used to play the traditional flip-a-card-at-a-time memory game).<br/><br/>",

Each time that they catch a fish, penguins msut return to the Penguin Club through one of the four blue entrances marked &ldquo;Start.&rdquo;  Penguins must catch the fish of their own color last.<br/> Penguins who land on or next to another penguin can freeze that penguin by covering it with a Freeze-Tag Ice Cube.<br/> Frozen penguins stay frozen, and may not move, although they roll the die on each turn.  On the turn that they roll either a one or a six, frozen penguins thaw out, and roll again and move.  Penguins get an extra turn whenever they freeze another penguin.<br/> Penguins may move in any direction that they choose, although they may not move diagonally or move through a square that they already moved though on that turn.  Penguins who start their turn on a Swimming Hole may move to any other Swimming Hole, then roll and move.<br/> To reach a Swimming Hole, the Penguin Club, or one of the squares with a fish printed on them , penguins must roll the exact number of squares needed.

        "description": "This is a game that was developed to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Henkel group (which manufactures adhesives).<br/><br/>It is a combination of different mechanics.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to collect a complete set of picture cards. A complete set consists of 8 cards, each with a different colored border. There are also 3 &quot;joker&quot; cards in the game, which can be used instead of a colored picture card.<br/><br/>The picture cards are placed face up on the board around the movement fields, 4 picture cards are placed face down on special &quot;guessing&quot; fields.<br/><br/>Each player also has a hand of 3 movement cards, which can be used to move the pawn around the track. When you have played a movement card, the pawn is moved according to the instructions on it (it can be a fixed number or you may have to throw a die).<br/><br/>You can land on different kind of fields, some allow you to take the picture card that is placed next to it. Others allow you to take a guess at the color of one of the face-down picture cards. You can take it if the guess is correct. You can also be allowed to swap picture cards with opponents, you can be forced to give one of your picture cards to another players, you can steal a card from another player or you must play a game of poker to win extra picture cards.<br/><br/>Players with complete sets score 8 points plus 1 extra point per joker. The others score points equal to the longest sequence of cards.<br/><br/>You play 3 games to determine the overall winner.<br/><br/>",

But watch out where you dig!  The last thing you need is a zombie on your trail!  Be the first to find the old key and escape the Maze of Mayhem . . . on a full belly of 'Scooby Snacks' of course!&quot;<br/><br/>This is a basic roll-and-move game where players race to collect a key and three snacks before escaping from the maze.  The keys and snacks are all hidden throughout the board but among them are three different monsters from various Scooby-Doo episodes.  Once a monster is uncovered, it remains on the board and moves on a separate die roll each turn.  Monsters catch players and send them back to start, complicating the process of gathering keys and snacks and moving to the exit.  Because each player has the chance to move the monsters, there are typically many opportunities to slow down the progress of other players.<br/><br/>",

Interestingly, game is sealed with a simulated &quot;tax stamp&quot; featuring the serial number and company logo.<br/>-52 playing cards in 4 sets of 10 (each set features 10 different birds), and 12 special play cards (4 bucks, 4 bears, 2 ducks, 1 doe, and 1 skunk) with variable special abilities.<br/>-50 wooden nickels with company logo on one side, and game title and image of Buck on the other.<br/><br/>Game Play description:<br/>Each player starts with 5 wooden nickels.  The dealer deals each player 1 card.  In turn, each player looks secretly at the card and decides whether to keep or trade with player on the left.  A player is stuck with their choice (keep or trade) once completed.  Since players want the lowest value card possible, this adds an element of risk assessment, as the player(s) with the highest value must pay a nickel into the pot.  Last player standing with nickels, after others are bankrupt wins.  Special play cards change order and value of play for more variability to play.<br/><br/>",

Both players have just one single playing piece for their regular moves. The rest of the playing pieces (34 chips for the defender, 2 tokens for the attacker) are used to keep track of the movement limitations of the players: while the attacker can use every path outside the castle only once, the defender cannot use the same path within the castle more than two subsequent turns.<br/><br/>If the attacker manages to enter the castle exactly on the point where the defender is staying, he is the winner. If he is forced to enter the castle on an empty point, he has lost the game, because the defender will catch him on his next turn. The attacker has also lost the game, if he has no possible move left (outside of the castle).<br/><br/>The game exists in 2 editions with different rules. According to the designer Tom Werneck, the first edition had the problem, that the attacker won in most cases, but the second edition did not help this game from being broken, because now, the defender won most times!<br/><br/>",

If he lands on a space marked with one of the seven different plant symbols, he may take the matching plant card. But before all 64 board spaces have been &quot;planted&quot; with altogether four kinds of plant, the amateur gardener may suffer several cruel turns of fortune. Drought may wither his lawn, sunflowers or plums, caterpillars and greenfly attack his pansies and lettuce beds. The lucky player will be protected against such ravages by having earlier drawn an &quot;antidote&quot; card, such as insurance against flooding, bug killer to combat a plague of maybugs. A player landing on the &quot;Garden Party&quot; space is served a small refreshment for relaxation, such as a sweet or a glass of lemonade. Adults will prefer a glass of the harder stuff.<br/>Winner is the first player to plant the 16 spaces of his garden with 4 different types of plant cards.<br/><br/>",

Instead of playing individual countries for individual players, my rules NOW have all the countries going together at the same time, the incomes are still separate and Japan still controls Japan's income, etc, but NOW ALL players will conduct their turns all at one time, with separate incomes for separate countries and they will all purchase their units at the same time, their turns at the same time, placed on the same &quot;Place Units&quot; board on the game and all playing pieces are color-coded like the regular game. Germany spends income on Germany's pieces and places them in German-held territories with industrial complexes, and Britain does the same, etc on down the line.<br/><br/>United States is NOT at war with anyone and therefore cannot declare war, unless and Axis player declares war on it first or after its 3rd turn for example, like in the real Global game.<br/>The question of ownership of the Dutch territories in the game has been solved. Players will no longer need to land grab the Dutch territories in the wake of Hollland's collapse. Instead, ownership will go to the United Kingdom because they control and are patrons of the Dutch Govt in Exile in London  and the Dutch Govt. In Exile is under British control, therefore they belong to the United Kingdom. They will receive the usual bonus for having posession of them. See my PDF document for additonal changes.<br/><br/>The goals of the game are similar to a regular Axis &amp; Allies game. The Axis will capture London, Paris, Kiev, Moscow, and Washington. The Allies will capture the Axis capitals of Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome.<br/><br/>The players are France, Soviet Union, Italy, United Kingdom,(Pacific and Europe) and USA.  The goals for the Axis and the Allies are the same as Europe 1940 and Global 1940. Nothing's changed there.<br/><br/>The Allies capture the Axis capitals of Berlin and Rome.<br/><br/>The rules are the same as regular Axis &amp; Allies.<br/><br/>I wanted to expand upon the whole Axis &amp; Allies game by adding more to it.  This pack also adds new territories, such as Crimea. Crimea is now important for control of Sea zone 125 as it was in real life. The Black Sea Fleet is also represented with one Battleship and 1 destroyers, and 1 Transports. The Romanian fleet and Russian fleet will inhabit the same waters, but Romania will not be at war until Germany is at war with the Soviet Union because Romania and Hungary are controlled by Germany.<br/><br/>There also new rules regarding the setup.<br/><br/>Germany will receive 1 Major Industrial Complex in Romania to represent the Ploesti oil refinery, which was a large portion of Germany's oil production and gasoline in World War II and 1 Major Industrial Complex for Slovakia-Hungary, which was a large portion of Germany's armaments production that supplied the Germans with the tanks they used to invade France in 1940.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Amazonas is a dice-roll based game for 2-4 players. The players score points by &quot;shooting&quot; animals on the way to the finish line. Everyone starts with 10 bullets and uses the 1-2-3 dice to move forward and the regular dice to shoot at the animals. When you arrive on a tile with an animal on it, you can decide if you want to shoot at that animal. This is done by the regular die. If you roll a number (1-6) that has an animal token on it, you &quot;shot&quot; the animal, you remove the token and keep it. Every shot costs one bullet. If you miss, you can try again by using another bullet. Obviously, if less animals remain, your chances to shoot one is smaller. Once you hit an animal, the next player's turn begins. If you arrive on an &quot;Amazonas&quot; tile, you can choose the animal you want to shoot at. Different animals give you different points (e.g. parrot one, lion six).<br/>There are also obstacles on the way that players must cross. If they fail to cross them, they loose animals worth of 6 points. If you don't have enough animals to return, you can give back your bullets (1 bullet - 1 point).<br/><br/>SWAMP: In order to cross the swamp, you need to roll a number (with the regular dice) that corresponds with the value of a neighboring tile (except the one behind you). In this case, you can move to that tile, making your way across the swamp.<br/>Once you make it through an obstacle (or even if you fail), you arrive in a village, where you can sell your animals for bullets according to the animal's value. (For a 6 point lion you get 6 bullets).<br/><br/>CHASM: In order to cross the chasm, you need to get 10 points out of 3 rolls.<br/><br/>COCONUT: Monkeys are throwing coconuts at you, and you must avoid them. You place your marker anywhere on the first row (there are four) and throw with the blue and red dice. The values of the colored dice show you where the monkeys are throwing the coconuts (red value counted from the left and blue from the right). If they miss, you go to the next row, if either of the hits you, you fall.<br/><br/>SUSPENSION BRIDGE: from 8 rolls you must get all the 6 values of the dice (1-6, in any order)<br/><br/>CROCODILES: You need to row through the water by using the green and white 1-2 dice (Right paddle green dice, left paddle white). Equal numbers: you go straight ahead 1 or 2 tiles. Green 1, white 2: you move one ahead and one left. If you hit a croc on the way, you fail.<br/><br/>ROPE: You have 8 rolls and you need to get to the other side by always rolling a bigger number than the previous.<br/><br/>Once you get to the finish line, you count the value of your animals.<br/><br/>",

In Let's Pumpkin, you're trying to help this fragrant fruit find their way to safety, mostly so that you can plant them again later.<br/><br/>Starting with an array of face-down, vibrantly orange triangular tiles arranged in a circle, players take turns planting a pumpkin on an unrevealed tile &ndash; at which time the landscape beneath the tile is discovered, often to the pumpkin's detriment as each terrain tile hides a trap. The pumpkins can catch fire, freeze, be sucked up by tornado, and so on. To counter the devastating effects of these traps and save the pumpkins, a player can use tokens acquired from burning or frozen terrain; alternatively, a player can use these tokens against opponents, really grinding their gourds by strengthen traps that affect them.<br/><br/>Whoever manages to plant the last pumpkin, whether owned or already on the game map, wins!<br/><br/>",

Learn to prioritize and distribute resources - both according to political affiliation and for the common good.<br/><br/>In the last round an opinion poll will be undertaken - the winner of that also wins the game.<br/><br/>At the start of the game you randomly choose one of six different political characters (from six different, fictional, political parties [Alfa, Beta, Kappa, Delta, Sigma and Gamma]).<br/><br/>Each political character has one issue that he or she must fight for and another three issues that they must prioritize in the game. These issues are: &ldquo;school&rdquo;, &ldquo;leisure&rdquo;, &ldquo;local transports&rdquo;, &ldquo;culture&rdquo;, &ldquo;business&rdquo;, &ldquo;social services&rdquo;, &ldquo;elderly care&rdquo;, &ldquo;waste management&rdquo;, &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;, &ldquo;housing&rdquo;, &ldquo;water &amp; sewer&rdquo;, &ldquo;fire &amp; rescue&rdquo;.<br/><br/>As elected you spend resources (chits) on one or more of these areas that you are assigned. But look out! The next player has another set of issues that they must fight for &ndash; and they will grab every opportunity to take resources from your areas and put on their own.<br/><br/>The best way to try to win is to get the other players on your side, to contest and argue. There is no successful &ldquo;sneak under the radar&rdquo;-strategy in this game. Loud and vocal and on the attack but smart, is a winning strategy. But that is not enough; sooner or later you (your issues) will be stripped of resources &ndash; and you must be smart when trying to get them back to your most important issues.<br/><br/>During the course of the game you will start one turn, the next player starts the next turn et cetera (that means if you are more than four players, one or more will not get to start a turn). Each player gets the same amount of new resources, but not the same opportunity to shift resources from issue to issue, that is decided by the dice.<br/><br/>There is another random factor in the game, a deck of event cards that is used once at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to win the &ldquo;opinion poll&rdquo; at the end of the last turn, year four (one election cycle in Sweden). The opinion poll is won by the player that has collected most resources; double points for each resource on one&rsquo;s issues at heart and one point on the other issues that you fight for!<br/><br/>There are also rules for winning the overall game &ndash; not only do you compete against the other players, you all must successfully meet the public opinion and you all must collectively have enough points to pass the game. So it is not all about competition, you must also collaborate with your opponents from time to time. And that&rsquo;s trickier said than done.<br/><br/>",

The planes are moved by a simple kind of catapult and they are successful in visiting a country if they at least touch the border of a country tile - in this case they get a country token. However, there are 10 Storm tokens randomly distributed on the table as well. When a plane lands on these tokens the player must skip a turn. If a country is reached, the player gets a reward: spin a spinner and see the consequences (it's your turn again, or choose another player who has to put back one of their country chips, or make a country tile smaller by adding fog, or redistribute the thunder tokens, possibly hurting other planes). The game ends when the first player returns to Propwash Junction with the three different country tokens in their bag.<br/><br/>",

These Demons fight at longer range, spitting poison and throwing spider web nets. Pilgrims will be more likely to suffer on-going conditions, like Poisoned and a new condition Entangled. Webs act as traps that hold the Pilgrims and attract the Demons when the Pilgrims are entangled. Each Demon moves towards the closest entangled Pilgrim, and may get to attack while the Pilgrim is unable to defend: an entangled target cannot use the Defense Dice.<br/><br/>",

Become the healthiest player of the table, and live all your life free of harmful diseases! Take the control of virus, bacteria and parasites, and strike the vital organs of your rivals! The game emulates in a proper way some aspects of the immunity, like the inflammation, adverse effects of medicaments, the disease transmission, the spread of tumors, and many others.<br/><br/>In this card game, each player receives an organism board which shows the health of your five vital systems (nervous, cardiorespiratory, digestive, hepatic, and renal), as well as your age throughout the life.  There are also two environment squares that will be occupied with the pathogens before they invade your organism. In addition, the board shows different human cells (red blood cells, immune cells, platelet, etc) that can be bought with oxygen. These cells are responsible for eliminating pathogens.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of deck cards in the game. Pathogen cards can be placed on the environment squares of the rivals, in order to infect and harm their organs. Medic cards can be used to prevent damage, transplant organs, eradicate microorganisms, etc. There is a common deck for all the players, the environmental deck, which represents hazardous effects that can affect the health of a person, like occupational accidents, blood donation and school fights.<br/><br/>",

A Princess Scarlet pawn is placed on one of the location.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling the die and moving Princess Scarlet a number of spaces clockwise, as indicated on the die. If Princess Scarlet ends her move in a location that still has an empty spot for a crystal, the active player has to place one of his crystals there, and may then roll the die again, if desired. On the other hand, if Princess Scarlet ends her move on a location that has no more empty spots, the active player may take all crystals from that location, and his turn ends.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has no more crystals left. Then, the player who has collected the most crystals wins.<br/><br/>",

Each turn player rolls a die and selects one of his pawns to move. Pawns can enter the track from Home base only on a roll of five or six. Each pawn needs to travel around the board and finish on the Finish lane. If pawn of another player is stops in to a same game square , the bumped pawn is returned to home. The goal is to be the first one to get all the pawns to the Finish lane.<br/><br/>The trick is that the game board is a squere with circles in the corners. The home bases are in these circles. There are also X shaped gates at corners wich turn everytime a pawn goes through it. This way every other pawn would go to the square route and every other to the circle route.<br/><br/>",

After each throw, one or more dice must be &quot;locked&quot; and the player can then choose whether to roll again or to bank any accumulated points. However, if a player eventually spells out &ldquo;B-U-S-T-E-D&ldquo; on the dice, they lose any accumulated points for that hand.

After that a pandorra card is taken from the pile and if that also matches the pair you just made they stay on the table and can only be collected by playing the last matching card. This will also get you a bonus card from all other players collected cards.<br/><br/>You score by collecting cards in different groups: Throne, Lords, Knights and Citizins. Each group has a different scoring threshold and lot's of extra scoring options for special combinations.<br/><br/>When you score a certain minimum number of points (depends on the number of players) you can decide to end the round (declare peace) and score the points or keep playing (declare war) which will give you the obligation to score extra points each additional turn untill you stop the game. This process enables you to multiply your score by 2, 4, 8, 16 ... depending on how long you keep improving your score. When you declare war all other players are automatically forming a team which will allow them to exchange cards.<br/><br/>",

Whoever reaches it first, is invited to the Council of Mages.<br/><br/>However, because the magic realm Hexane literally lives and its parts are constantly moving back and forth, it is not so easy to find a single building. Before the game, all hexagonal pieces of the world are randomly placed into a single hexagonal unit. Each player gets three magic cards and three wizards he controls. Magic card can be played only if the player masters the school of the magic card. At the end if some player disagree with the partial result, all wizards are placed in the middle of the board to compete in the final match.<br/><br/>Every move is accompanied by tension because wizards could end up trapped in a swamp, from where he can get out by throwing sixes. The player can choose any piece that moves with a given direction.<br/><br/>Because it is a small world, there are many encounters between  individual wizards. Their rivalry triggers a fight at every meeting. Winner gets one card from the loser who must also return to the starting tile.<br/><br/>",

In Royal Comette, players place tokens on astronomical sections on the board, lay cards in a sequence, and when your card matches a section, you collect the tokens.<br/><br/>Unlike the title, there is little speculation in the game.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>At the start, all players (including the dealer) place a token (a small yellow rod) on each of the eight compartments of the game-board. The dealer then places extra tokens on certain compartments and hands every player and equal number of cards. One extra hand of cards is dealt to the center of the game-board. When all cards are equally divided, the remainder cards are added to the center. The dealer turns the last card over to determine the trump of that round. If the trump is a certain card, the dealer instantly wins all tokens on the board, else, the round is played.<br/><br/>A round of play consist of players playing card out and calling their names (e.g. the Ace of Spades). The next player is the player who has the first next card in that sequence. The round comes to an halt when either the card to be played cannot be played (it was already played before or is in the center 'hand') or when all players have been dealer once or when a previously agreed number of rounds has been played.<br/><br/>Players collect tokens from the board if they have won the round. Winning the round depends on the cards a player has in hand. The player that has the most tokens at when the game ends, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

To get the right to place a Global Windmill on one of the World&rsquo;s 7 Continents you need to have been able to place a Forrest and a Windmill on your Lot.<br/><br/>You receive a salary each time you pass START including a bonus in case you have made wise environmental disposition! You need money to build up a windmill empire! You can increase your income and your chances of winning the game by investing in sustainable energy solutions such as buying an Electric car, Solar Panels for you House &ndash; or by winning in the Casino. If you are lucky you may even receive a contribution from the Global Cooling Foundation.<br/><br/>If you are in need for cash you may pawn your assets at any time. But be aware - it can be risky! The other players might get a chance to buy your pawned assets if they subsequently land on the Pawn square where you have placed your pawned assets.<br/><br/>You occasionally get the opportunity to draw so-called &ldquo;Global Cards&rdquo; which describe realistic climate and/or environmental scenarios giving you either an advantage or a disadvantage in the game.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the game there will often be a hectic race against the other players. The winner of the game is the player who first passes START having placed the most Global Windmills on the World Map - subject to all 7 Global Windmill having been placed on all the World&rsquo;s 7 Continents &ndash; alternatively the player who first succeeds in having placed a total of 4 Global Windmills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A trivia game where players collect colored stones for answering questions correctly.  The object of the game is to collect all colors of stones and move to the central square of the board (similar to Trivial Pursuit).  The four categories of trivia are: Parapsychology, Science, Theology, and Occult.<br/><br/>Four of the stone colors are collected by answering a question correctly of the appropriate color, you can only have one stone of each color.  The fifth stone (black), is special, there is only one of them.  It is collected by either moving your pawn to the center of the board, or stealing it from another player (by landing on the same board square as their pawn.)<br/><br/>There is a &quot;special rule&quot; variant that allows players who have collected stones to use them after a six is rolled on the movement die.  Each color gives the player some kind of advantage (free movement, card skipping, etc).  As well, you get to keep the cards that you have answered correctly (though only one at a time), and use them in much the same way as you use the stones.<br/><br/>From the back of the box.<br/><br/>&quot;Why? This question has plagued humanity since... well... forever. It is what drives people and science to explain the unknown. While others embrace the unknown, some fear it... but that's why this is a GAME.<br/><br/>The X-Game combines current knowledge of our world into a fascinating combination of Science, Paranormal, Theology and the Occult trivia. The X-Game contains 1000 questions on 250 cards, 16 Power Stones, 4 Player Pieces, 4 Power Cards, 1 Black Power Stone, instructions and a fantastic playing board. Anywhere from 2 players can compete for the glory of winning (abducting) the Black Power Stone and the rest of the X-Game...&quot;<br/><br/>",

The cards all feature Sooty but they also have amounts of money on each one, ranging from 1 penny to 1 shilling (that is 12 pennies). Four cards are laid face-up in the middle of the table and each player is dealt 4 cards. In your turn you can take a card from the display by using a card with the same value from your hand. Alternatively, you could add a card from your hand, and add it to the amount on the card on the table, with a view to taking it next turn with a card equal to the total on the two cards which you were 'building'. However, before your next turn comes round, another player might be able to take your 'build'.<br/>There are special cards that score more than normal.<br/>The game ends when the pack runs out. Cards you captured are added up, their face value in money. Then any Lucky Pennies score as 1 shilling. Any Lucky Sixpence scores 2 shillings. Any Money Boxes score 4 shillings and twopence. The player with the most in his 'savings' wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There are two pieces of every number and plus, minus and equality signs. Basic idea is to recognize numbers by feeling them in your hand. To prevent you from seeing the numbers, you construct bigger box from the game box and two cardboard walls. Those walls have an hole to put your hand into the box. Hole is covered with cloth.<br/><br/>Basic idea of the games is to find the wanted number(s) from the box. Some examples: 1. You have to pick up numbers in ascending order. 2. You throw 12 sided die and you have to find two numbers that add up to the result. 3. You pick up a tile with a two digit number and find corresponding numbers. And so on. In most advanced games you have to add or subtract numbers or you have to recognize number sequence.<br/><br/>",

They vie for control over nebulas and planetary systems, which they level up to gain an advantage over other players. What is at stake is taking possession of the powerful technology left behind by the unequaled race of the Trian. Over the course of the game, players use beautifully illustrated, double-sided tiles to create outer space and fill it with nebulas, planetary systems, and gas clouds. Using their emissaries and ships, they explore and take control of these parts of the galaxy which have hitherto remained undiscovered. With a ﬂeet of vessels at their disposal, they fight for dominance over areas filled with rich mineral deposits. Players can choose from 8 diﬀerent alien superpowers, each characterized by a unique constellation of features and skills. Close your ranks and enter the race for the hegemony over the Galaxy of Trian. What is at stake is taking possession of the powerful technology left behind by the ancient yet unequaled race of the Trian, and conquering the entire Galaxy!<br/><br/>",

Take the role of a master builder and square off against fellow scientists and engineers in a battle of robo-supremacy in KILLBOTS!<br/><br/>There's a small catch though...<br/><br/>Each robot has a positive and negative action. Every time a robot attacks it could deal damage, heal a fellow robot, or even steal another player's cards. But maybe something will go wrong and your robot will attack you, or switch sides, or simply explode. Robots are unpredictable - they're more of an art than a science, really. This element of chance keeps the action dynamic and unpredictable, as well as leveling the playing field a bit for new players. Players able to better manage their robots in play and anticipate these events will ultimately come out on top!<br/><br/>Killbots is a competitive tabletop card game for 2 to 6 players where each player builds and controls an army of imperfect killer robots. The functions of each robot are determined by a custom 8-sided die - effectively making all moves calculated (or uncalculated) risks and keeping gameplay fresh.<br/><br/>",

In Angry Town players will choose from 8 different Fighters all with their own unique abilities that gives them an edge over their opponent.  Players will be able to chain together amazing combos, build a Meter and BLAST their opponent away all in the hopes to become the new Mayor of Angry Town.<br/><br/>It is Election Season in Angry Town, but instead of the boring stuff like voting, debates and fundraisers, the candidates enter the Mayoral Tournament and FIGHT for the chance to challenge the current Mayor, who has been Mayor for over fifty years.  The winner becomes the new Mayor and has absolute power.<br/><br/>Players will choose one of the 8 Fighters: a Ninja Howler Monkey, a Failed Martial Artist Bum, a Quack Doctor, an Angry Nerd, a Demented Girl Scout, the Don of the Baby Mafia, a Luchador Rabbi, and an Irish Catholic Nun who knows over 87 ruler based attacks.  Each Fighter's play style is simple to learn but challenging to master, but once mastered you will be one step closer to achieving ultimate power!<br/><br/>There are 2 Modes of Play: &quot;Classic Mode&quot; (2 Player head-to-head), and &quot;Tag Team Mode&quot; (2 Player head-to-head with 2 or 3 Fighters each).<br/><br/>Are you ready to fight?  In that case, Welcome to Angry Town, where everyone is happy, happy to kick your ass and stomp you into the ground!<br/><br/>",

It requires tax players who are willing to take a chance with a &quot;Tax Shelter&quot; that may give financial security or may backfire. After four tours around the Board, the Tax player who has the most after-tax cash wins the game and has successfully been able to STICK THE IRS. The players move around the colorful board, landing on opportunities to earn income, spend money on non-deductible expenses and to purchase a variety of tax shelters. In addition, the players have a chance to receive &quot;annual reports&quot; that determine whether the tax shelter investment made them rich or, as in most &quot;real life&quot; shelters, turn out to be a bust. Finally, an exposure to the horrors and humor of audit lurks with every roll of the dice. Drilling for oil in Hawaii, establishing a baseball team in Alaska, reviving an old motion picture, and building ski condominiums in Texas are just a few of the fun and exciting tax shelter opportunities that the player is offered in STICK THE IRS. Although humorous and in good taste, the game also offers certain educational benefits in highlighting the good and the bad in the use of shelters to reduce taxes. The player who manages to best use his income, his CPA and his shelters, and therefore who manages to pay the least tax, is the winner, having successfully been able to STICK THE IRS.<br/><br/>",

The rules are easy to understand and allow play to be friendly or cunningly crafty, depending on your style of play and the group of players.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score 500 points (or over) by visiting as many European Cities as possible whilst keeping one step ahead of the Hit Man.  However, as the Hit Man, you can score points off the other players.<br/><br/>You will soon master the rules, and some, but not maybe all, of the possible stategies, but if you do, there are optional rules to alter the play to make it an easier or harder, shorter or longer game.&quot;<br/><br/>The game has a homebrew quality about it (comparable to Cheapass Games products, but in a nice carton).  Noteable for being acquired by The Avalon Hill Game Co and being reissued as the much maligned Assassin, featuring better components but adds some rather odd tweaks and revisions to the rules.<br/><br/>",

The contract can then grow by playing in order: Scene and Hit cards of the same suit as the Means card (which there are seven suits - Strangulation, Poisoning, Drowning, Torture, Shooting, Starving and Hit &amp; Run). Thereafter, you can optionally play a Disposal, then an Alibi card on the sequence Means, Scene, &amp; Hit that you've built up. You can play a motive card on top (at any time on an open contract) - which must be of the same suit as the victim (there are eight suits - Royalty, Union Leader, Movie Star, Pet, Politician, Business Person, Religious Leader and &quot;Choose your own victim&quot;).<br/><br/>The aim is to earn the most money, and money is earned by closing contracts.

The rest of the players write down a definition for the word secretly on a piece of paper. Then, the referee reads aloud all definitions and players have to vote which one they think is true (they cannot vote their own definition). According to the number of votes received for their definition or if they where able to find the true definition, the players can move their rockets towards Mars. Also, the dice can determine if the players ought to write a funnier definition instead of trying to find the true one, or if instead of a word it's a famous star that they have to define, or if the definition is given to them instead of the word and they have to find this last one.<br/>The first player in Mars wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The components are items created from two jigsaw puzzle pieces each, plus some tiles which show the entire shape of an item and a kobold figure. There are various game ideas included.<br/>The youngest children just assemble the items. The second stage of the game includes finding a shape that matches one of the items, then places the kobold on another shape which the next player has to identify. <br/>In the most advanced game, some items are laid out on the table and the tiles are placed into groups. Now a shape tile is flipped open and the players check whether it matches any of the items currently open. If yes, the item is placed on the tile and a new item is added. If not, the kobold moves on. If the players manage to put all the items on the tiles before the kobold is back in its original position, all players win.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

On a turn, the active player  rolls the black die and red die, then places the flame/UFO indicator card so that red is associated with flames and black with UFOs (or vice versa). This indicator card shows how many flames and how many UFOs players need to spot &ndash; for example, 1 flame and 3 UFOs.<br/><br/>For all cards that show precisely this combination of icons, the player sums the numbers (1-10) next to these cards and yells out a total. The first player to do so claims these cards, which are worth one point each if they don't have planets. (If a card has planets, it's worth that many points.) One side on each die shows a star; when a star is next to an icon, that icon is ignored. If stars are next to both icons, you total the numbers next to cards that bear planets.<br/><br/>After replacing any cards claimed, the next player rolls the dice. The game continues until someone has twenty points; this player wins! For a more challenging game, use the reverse side of the game board, which has spaces numbered 11-20.<br/><br/>",

Emil has got himself into trouble once again and therefor finds himself in the tool shed, carving his wooden figures. However, over the course of his mischieveous childhood the wooden figures have become rather numerous and Emil has trouble fitting them all on his shelf.<br/><br/>The game Emil: Stapla tr&auml;gubbar (Emil: Pile up the figures) is about piling the figures and trying to be the player who places the last figure on top of the pile without making it fall.<br/><br/>The players take turns drawing figures from a bag and try to place the figures on top of the pile in any way they want, as long as the figures don't touch the table.<br/>A player that causes any figures to fall has to collect the fallen figures except from one that goes back into the bag. The player must then use the figures from his/her own collection before drawing from the bag again. The player who places the last figure from the bag onto the pile without it falling is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is very fast and suits ages 3 and up.<br/><br/>Even though the box states 1-6 players, there is no real limit to the amount of players since everyone draws from the bag.<br/><br/>The game also offers a solo play version where a player can try to break different records, such as widest structure or highest structure or most figures.<br/><br/>",

The theme is almost the same but instead of buying properties, players buy shares of companies.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player rolls one die and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned company share, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio (there is no option to auction it). The more shares of one company a player owns, the more profit he will gain when any other player lands on the company. There are no houses or hotels in this game.<br/><br/>There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes or collect income.<br/><br/>The main difference between Makler Giełdowy and Monopoly is the marketplace. Every time the player passes by the marketplace, he can go to it. Depending on the number thrown on the die the player may buy 1, 2, 3 or 4 shares. Selling is unlimited. Just before acquiring the player draws a market card which shows the price change. The share may be more or less expensive. It is possible to buy every unowned share in the game. It is not possible to buy shares from another players or sell them. There is no negotiation in this game and the trading is allowed only through the marketplace.<br/><br/>The game ends when first player goes bankrupt. The most wealthy player is declared the winner. There is also a variant when the game ends when all but one player go bunkrupt.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game relies on placing money on a small board in accordance with dice thrown. The player places some money on the number that represents what the player throws. In the 1800 version, money placed equates to one cent.<br/><br/>If there is already a cent placed, the players takes that money and throws the dice again. He/she takes money as long as there is already money placed, and places money as soon as a number is thrown that is empty on the board.<br/><br/>If a player has no more money to place, the player may throw the dice once more. If the player does not receive money on that turn, the player is out.<br/><br/>The game continues until there is only one player left, who collects all the remaining money.<br/><br/>This game is related to Harlekin och hans sju korvar and Der Deutsche Hanswurst, though the game intent here is a game for money and placement of coins (the others are roll and move games)<br/><br/>",

Then, each player simultaneously turns up the topmost card in their pile, starting to build a face-up pile. If one or more of the cards turned up are in the same suit, the player with the highest card showing in that suit wins all the cards in those face-up piles (but not the piles currently showing any other suit), adding them to the bottom of their face-down pile. This procedure of turning up cards continues until all cards are held by a single player, who wins the game. A player who runs out of face-down cards flips over their face-up pile and continues playing, while a player with no cards whatsoever is (mercifully?) out of the game.<br/><br/>",

There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks, though there are limited selective options for these.<br/><br/>The main new rule is the option to discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn.  This is very useful if you are desperate for engines or a particular colour card. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NAME THAT COUNTRY is a childrens' geography game Ages 7 - 12<br/><br/>The gameboard incorporates a spinner listing 60 Countries and their respective Continents.  Players take it in turns to spin the spinner and then identify on the map the location of that country - this is done by calling out the appropriate number from a map and then cross-referencing it to a look-up table.<br/><br/>A correct answer earns a number of movement points which are used to move playing pieces around the board.  Many of the spaces on the board show postage stamps from various countries - these have no effect on play.  Other squares, however, contain special instructions (move forward 1 space, go back 3 spaces etc...) which must be followed.<br/><br/>Certain squares have a depiction of a postcard.  If the piece lands on one of these spaces then a postcard is drawn from a deck and read aloud.  The language and greeting, and the name of the sender, are clues to the identity of the country from which the card is sent.  If the player correctly identifies the country then the playing piece is advanced a further two spaces.<br/><br/>The first player to complete one circuit of the board (35 spaces) is the winner.<br/><br/>Also published as Worldwide Pen Pals - World Geography Game.<br/><br/>",

Good behaviors are blessed with money, foolish behaviors pay penalties.  At the beginning of their turn before they move, a player may choose to draw an &quot;Opportunity&quot; card.  This is an opportunity to bless someone else, and involves giving away a certain amount of money to someone in need.  In return, the player will earn &quot;Treasures in Heaven&quot;.  If a player cannot afford to pay the amount on the Opportunity card, they must pay a smaller fee for not wisely managing their finances.  The first player to collect a set amount of Treasures (different based on the number of players) is the winner.<br/><br/>Bonus cash awards go to those who can quote the verses from memory, have read the Bible recently and those who learned something from a Bible teacher recently.<br/><br/>",

The shape of the board and movement rules are similar, however there are only four question categories, which are:<br/><br/>Disappearing folklore<br/>General knowledge<br/>In the opinion of men...<br/>In the opinion of women...<br/><br/>Also, each player gets dealt two voting cards, a Right and a Wrong. If a player answers a question almost right, but not quite, they can ask for a vote on whether the answer will be accepted (a draw counts as a fail). They are also used in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-squares, for example &quot;In the opinion of men, female bodybuilders are sexy?&quot; If the majority of other players agree with how the player thinks men and women generally think, they win that card.<br/><br/>As an elimination/game lengthening feature, there are also 'Black hole'-squares on the board; category gets chosen by opponents and if the player is wrong, they lose ALL categories so far collected, ie. start from the beginning again.<br/><br/>Once all four categories are collected, player may proceed to the center of the board, where they need to answer one question from each category during the same turn, and get at least one right, in which case they win.<br/><br/>Questions and answers are sometimes slightly naughty/risque especially in the &quot;Opinion of...&quot;-categories, hence the high age limit.<br/><br/>",

It is not for monks, nuns or hermits.  Quest for the Ideal Mate is a game for the liberated male and female.  You will discover who you are, who others are--and what you can be together!  Playing with 3 to 12 friends, strangers, lovers, marital partners (or any combination of these).  It could result in a single person discovering their Ideal Mate within the group.  You'll laugh your head off at the responses of the other players while awaiting what's in store for you.<br/><br/>&quot;Shirl Solomon, internationally known handwriting analyst, author and lecturer on personality and compatibility has created Quest for the Ideal Mate to provide an entertaining diversion for people to get to know each other.  One game will tell you more about someone's hidden character than a dozen dates and bare feelings on countless subjects that would not surface in a normal relationship until too late.&quot;<br/>End of box quotes.  There are also &quot;ideal mate trait cards&quot; to be filled out and at the end of the game, you find out how compatible you are with others in the group.  Box says it plays best with an equal number of each sex.<br/><br/>",

If you are not ok with HIGHLY politically incorrect comedy themes, read no further. Recommended for Ages 18 and up<br/><br/>Prison Bitch: The Card Game is a humorous satire card game based on the struggle of existence within male prisons. For 2 or more players, each player assumes control of one of four unique Character Decks and competes to become top dog within their prison cell. Recruit Bitches, and gather a gang of Thugs to attack other players. Use event cards such as Parole, Trip to the Infirmary and Thugs on Dope to effect or eliminate opposing Thugs. Defeat other players by beating opposing Characters in combat or reducing their Reputation Points to zero.<br/><br/>Each character deck includes 72 cards and a Character Card. Plus cut out money and bitch tokens. The package deal includes a &quot;Starter Set&quot; and &quot;2 Character Decks&quot;. This works out so you get all four characters decks plus the game rules and dice.<br/><br/>This game was banned from the 2003 Origins Game Faire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "  An exciting dice game that is a good filler. There are four dice with different numbers 0-8 (only one 0). There are four Explosive Power cards (one for each round or stage) and one Countdown card, and two Countdown markers. There is also a card which shows the action to be taken on the result of the dice roll:<br/><br/>     Pair - pass to next player<br/>     3 of a kind - Reverse direction (pass to next player)<br/>     2 pairs - pass the dice to the second player along<br/>     4 of a kind - end of the round<br/><br/><br/>The dice are rolled. The marker on the Countdown card is moved if the next number(s) in the countdown sequence is shown. If none of the sets are rolled and no action can be taken, the marker on the Explosive Power card is moved up and the same player has another turn.<br/>   When the Countdown marker reaches 0 or the explosive Power reaches maximum, the player who rolled the dice receives damage points, according to the current Explosive Power. On some explosions, players on either side of the dice roller may also receive reduced damage points.<br/>   The player(s) at the end of four rounds with the least damage points wins.<br/><br/>",

This decides what kind of pieces each player is trying to collect. To each circular piece belongs six segment pieces, each with a picture, e.g. a pig or a horse (Animals), or a doll or a ball (Toys). These 36 segment pieces are laid out face-down.<br/><br/>The game proceeds much like a common Memory game, except that players are not collecting pairs but pieces that belong to their category. Players take turns picking up a face-down piece. If the piece belongs to that player&acute;s circular piece, he/she puts it there. The segment pieces fit the circular pieces like a jig-saw puzzle, and when all six pieces have been added the player has a full circle of Toys or Animals etc. Hence the name of the game, The Cake Game, because the pieces fit like pieces of cake.<br/><br/>The first player to collect all six pieces is, of course, the winner.<br/><br/>Each category has its own background color, so players don&acute;t have to be able to read the name of the category on the circular piece. With two players, you can play with two or three categories each.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>6 wooden circular pieces<br/>36 wooden segment pieces with color drawings<br/>Rules<br/><br/>3 years and up, language independent<br/><br/>",

If the target number is greater than 0, the players grab the chopsticks and try to pick up as many chickens as the target number demands. The player who manages to do this first, scores that number. If the target number is less than 1, grabbing the chopsticks gives the player 1 negative point.

Players choose a character piece - one of the family members from the book, or even the family dog - and then spin and move around the board. There are two piles of cards on the board - the Uh-uh! cards and the What's that? cards. If a player lands on an Uh-uh! space on the board he/she turns over the top card in that pile. A green card allows him/her to spin again and move past the obstacle; a red card means he has to wait until his next turn before moving.<br/><br/>Two thirds of the way around the board a player will reach the rainbow space just before the cave. Tentatively he turns over the top card in that pile. If the card shows an empty cave he yells 'Quick' and speeds past the cave to the next space. But if there is a bear in the cave ... Yikes! wait another turn and hope to get past next time.<br/><br/>This really is a simple game but small children who know and love this wonderful picture book are likely to love the re-enactment of the story in this way.<br/><br/>",

The game is not an exact clone of Monopoly but the gameplay  is really very close to the Monopoply one.<br/><br/>",

Players may start their words on specially marked spaces and build upon words from there.<br/><br/>Words are scored based on the elements used in the word with the scores being that element's atomic weight. Many elements are difficult or impossible to form words with so every element has &quot;Dark Matter&quot; reverse side with a letter and a point penalty for using this side in a word.<br/><br/>Bonus points can be earned by forming element names with only the element side of the tiles.

System, and Yu-Gi-Oh. Turns are fast-paced, and the rules are simple enough for beginners to understand, while allowing for enough complexity that expert players will still have fun.<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses in traditional TCG/CCG fashion - players use resources to play tactics, strategies, and character cards. Any card in your hand can be played as a resource, so customizing your deck is much easier than most other card-based games.<br/><br/>NOVUS is also a Feature Card Game, meaning everything you and three friends need to play is in the box.<br/><br/>",

If it shows up that yourself are the robber (1 chance out of 27), then you must steal back the diamond and escape to the airport.<br/><br/>Note: Nelospelit already published this sometime in the latter half of the 1980's as Silminn&auml;kij&auml; (Eyewitness), when it was a Wild West themed game set in 'Tuscon' (sic). The 'diamond' was 'loot' from a robbery, the cars horses, and so on, the production values a little bit weaker, but otherwise it is exactly the same game.<br/><br/>",

Before each trick, the top card of the trump changer deck is flipped.  Most of the time, the card will determine the trump color for the trick.  However, some cards will make players swap hands with their partner or swap hands with opponents, so you never know for sure if you will have your hand of cards for the next trick, making hand management difficult.<br/><br/>Scoring is simple, with each trick being worth 10 points, and the last trick of a hand worth 30!<br/><br/>",

The diamond is a track in which a plastic base runner can move around the bases. The batter turns on the board to have his batters run, and turns it off to have them stop at a base.<br/><br/>Attached to one end of the field is a large metal &quot;fence&quot;, which includes the scoreboard and an area above which home runs can be hit. The other end of the field has a smaller metal shield, containing a replica of the strike zone.<br/><br/>The pitcher must use a plastic arm to flick a small magnetic chit (the &quot;ball&quot;) onto this shield. Behind the shield, the batter must try to figure out where the ball landed on the shield -- and can either take the pitch (for a strike or a ball) or whack the back of the shield with a different plastic &quot;bat&quot;. If the bat is struck near the ball, the ball will generally fly further -- sometimes even hitting your opponent in the face.<br/><br/>The rest of the board is the ball field, with clearly marked sections for &quot;outs&quot; where the fielders are. If the ball is smacked anywhere else, the fielder must flick the ball into the base areas with the pitching flicker, before the runner gets there.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Capital Talouspeli (economy game) is a Finnish Monopoly-like economy game manufactured by Nelostuote Oy.<br/><br/>From the box (translated from Finnish):<br/>&quot;Make business in stock markets or gamble with savings and interests.<br/>As a real estate agent you buy and build estates and make money with them. As an investor you buy stocks, gain power for general meetings, or maybe you just do some cornering.<br/>To win the game you must have right profile, strategy and tactics, but luck is involved in both good and bad. There are limitless number of player roles. You can thrive in many ways, as in real life.<br/>When necessary, you have to change your chosen tactics and strategy. Inherited assets and lottery prizes can make surprising changes in the game. Wealthy players may buy their very own jet plane and fly around the world from business to business. Illegal businesses may sound nice, but risks are great.<br/>Your game doesn't end in bankruptcy! After the debt restructuring it's still possible for you to win the game. The game may even be used to educate company management.<br/>Have fun while developing your strategical, tactical and psychological skills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A printed cloth, three unique dice, six normal d6 and some tiddly-wink style counters with the rules enable you to play five dice-games popular amongst sailors and other travelling folk.<br/>Extra components are for Crown &amp; Anchor.<br/><br/>The playing cloth denotes 6 symbols (Heart, Spade, Diamond, Club and of course, a Crown and an Anchor). These 6 symbols are displayed on the faces of the unique dice included.<br/>One person is elected as the banker. Players use their counters to 'place bets' on the symbols on the cloth. The banker then rolls the 3 dice and pays out pro-rata where players have correctly bet on the symbols rolled.<br/>If one symbol has been guessed pay evens for each token;<br/>two symbols pay twice;<br/>three symbols matched, and the baker pays triple.<br/>The rules state that the banker should rotate as the odds are in their favour(?)<br/><br/>Rules also given for four other dice games:<br/><br/>Drop Dead: Use 5 dice and a scorecard. A game for any number of players.<br/>Each player in turn throws the five dice. The score is noted but a 2 or a 5 score zero points and the offending die is removed. The player throws again with the number of dice that didn't score 2 or 5. This score is added to his first throw. This process continues until finally the player throws 2 or 5 with his remaining di(c)e, thus losing them and ending his throw. His final tally is recorded and the 5 dice are given to the next player to construct his score. The winner is the person who scored the highest total in a set number of turns or predetermined time.<br/><br/>Yankee Grab: A game for 3 or 4 players using 3 dice.<br/>Each player in turn throws the three dice. The highest of these is set aside, and the player rolls the two remaining dice. The highest of these is set aside again. These two numbers are totalled and then multiplied by the last dice after it has been thrown again. The score is noted and the next player has his three throws.<br/>The player with the highest score wins the round. It is traditional to play 10 rounds with the winner having won the majority of rounds.<br/><br/>5000: A game for any number of players using 6 dice.<br/>The object of the game is to accumulate 5000 points. The dice score as follows:<br/>Any 5 scores 50 points<br/>Any 1 scores 100 points<br/>Three 2's score 200<br/>Straight 1 to 6 scores 1500<br/>6 of a kind = instant win 5000 points<br/>Three 5's score 500 points<br/>Three 6's score 600 points<br/>Three 1's score 1000 points<br/>3 pairs score 500 points<br/><br/>To play: The 1st player throws the 6 dice. The dice which score are set to one side and the remaining dice can be thrown again. Scoring dice are again put to one side. This can be repeated as many times as necessary. A player does not have to put aside all scoring dice if he does not wish. In each turn a player must score at least 350. This is called the BASE SCORE. After the base score is reached the player has the option to STICK or continue throwing. If he sticks the points scored in that turn are noted and play passes to the next player. With each throw of the dice at least one die must score and increase the point count of that turn or the whole score for that turn is lost, and play passes to the next player. If all 6 dice score and have been placed to one side, all six may be thrown again. One can continue as long as the score is improved with each throw.<br/>When a player has stuck or lost his turn, the dice pass to the next player, who must either score 'base' ot at least 50 points more than the previous player's score for that turn, whichever is greatest. Failure to do so means that the score for that round is lost.<br/><br/>Rotation: A game for any number of players using 2 dice.<br/>The possible totals that two dice can make are: 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.<br/>There are 11 rounds to this game - one for each total. In teh first round the players each try and score a total of 2. If he suceeds 2 is added to his score. In the second round players try to score a total of 3 etc. E,g. in round 7 when players are trying to achieve a total of 8, a player throws a 5 and a 3. 8 points are therefore added to his score. The person with the highest total after 11 rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each playing card shows one of the four different pictures: a hen, five chicks, a basket of eggs and a rooster.  Players turn over one card at a time and try to assemble complete sets of four.  <br/>Excitement mounts each time a third card is added because the lucky player with the missing card will claim the complete set. When a player opens the fourth card of a family (i.e. completes it), he or she gets the entire family and puts it under his/her stack. The game ends when someone has no cards left. The player with most cards is the winner.<br/>There is no influence by the players, so the game is aimed at the very young.<br/><br/>Pay close attention and don't miss your chance - the player with the most cards will win.<br/><br/>",

It will have you laughing out loud, rolling in the dough, and comes with enough non-potato twists that you can never quite be sure if you have victory in the bag.<br/><br/>Fast Food Legend is for 2-4 players (or up to 8 with two copies of the game).<br/><br/>It is 1950 and &ldquo;fast food&rdquo; won&rsquo;t be in the dictionary for another year. You&rsquo;ve just returned from a trip to San Bernardino, California, where you ate at the McDonald brothers restaurant and witnessed their &ldquo;Speedee Service System.&rdquo; Sure, there are other fast food restaurants like White Castle, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Jack in the Box, but you can tell this assembly line based cooking system is innovative and will revolutionize the way the fast food industry operates. You can tell there is money to be made and you intend to be the one making it. You decide to start opening your own fast food restaurants, but unfortunately for you, you&rsquo;re not the only one.<br/><br/>How will you distinguish yourself from your competitors? Will you start with the idea of the assembly line and focus on becoming even more productive? Will you focus on marketing to win people&rsquo;s hearts (and dollars)? Maybe you will focus on regulations, making friends with the politically powerful (all in the name of the consumer, of course). Or maybe you will just be a criminal, offering &ldquo;protection&rdquo; to your rivals and laundering money through your restaurants. Whatever you choose, do you have what it takes to defeat your opponents and become a fast food legend?<br/><br/>In addition to the four business focuses (production, marketing, regulatory, criminal), knowing how to play the market is a very important part of the game and adds a whole level of strategy. What you can do is directly tied to which franchises you have purchased during the auction phase. Will you try to corner the chicken market to keep your prices low and margin high or will you try to drive up everyone's prices knowing (hoping?) they won't be able to keep up with your production deck? Will you stock up on inventory this turn hoping to not need any next turn?<br/><br/>Every player starts the game with five cards (one block hostile action and four random cards from the top of their deck).<br/><br/><br/>    Buy franchises (auction style with the minimum bid listed on the card) Play moves clockwise during this phase.<br/>    Buy food (prices range from $1k to $20k. After all players purchase their food the price adjusts up $1k for each player who bought it and down $1k for each player who didn't). Play moves clockwise during this phase.<br/>    Draw a card (all players draw from the top of their deck at the same time)<br/>    Trade one or more cards (trade cards with other players or (depending on the number of players) discard to draw from the community pile).<br/>    Sell your food (for every unit of food you sell, you get $25k) Play moves clockwise during this phase.<br/>    Determine first player (then start with #1 and do it all again)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a very simple game which can be played on a sheet of paper or with real matchstick. You draw (or lay) a random number of matchsticks (behind each other) on the sheet. Now one of the two players starts by taking one up to three (which can be choosen) matchsticks away. The other player does this as well and so on. The player who takes away the last matchstick loses the game.<br/><br/>Winning strategy: The person who starts will be able to win the game, when the amount of the beginning isn't x * 4 + 1 (where x may be every natural number). When this is the fact and the person who plays second is smart, he'll win (read what to do). But what to do when you (person who starts) can build a winning strategy?<br/><br/>Take away a specific amount of matchsticks (1 up to 3 of course), so the amount of matchstick still on the sheet is x * 4 + 1 (where x may be every natural number). Now make sure that in two steps (so one turn of you and one of your opponent) four matchsticks are taken away. Which means that when your opponent takes away 1, you take 3, when your opponent takes away 2 you take 2 as well and when your opponent takes away 3 you take 1. Now your opponent will always lose the game.<br/><br/>To try this strategy out you can play the game online: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.schoolbits.nl/extern-spel-13b.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.schoolbits.nl/extern-spel-13b.html</a><br/><br/>The computer starts, but doesn't directly take the winning strategy. When you make a mistake on your first turn, the computer will take the winning strategy after this turn.<br/><br/>",

Like regular sets, a player completes these sets when he has collected four of the cards. The fifth card counts as a minus point for the player that remains stuck with it.<br/><br/>Futhermore, each card in a Trivia Quartett set lists a number of facts on the topic of the card. This enables the players to play a trivia variant, if they wish: whenever a player is asked to hand over a card that he has in his hand, he is allowed to ask a question for which the answer can be found on the card. The other player has to answer the question correctly in order to receive the card.<br/><br/>",

Find and return the most items to win!<br/><br/>Paw Patrol Beach Rescue is a very simple pick up and deliver game for young children. The object of the game is to earn the most treats. On your turn, guide your pup from Lookout Tower all the way to the beach by driving along the roads. Once there, pick up a mystery token. Find out where it belongs by matching the image on the token to the image on the mat. Place the token in your pup's vehicle and drive it to the correct location on the mat.  Place the token in its spot on the mat and collect a treat if one is available.  Lastly, drive the treat back to Lookout Tower and place it in your parking spot.<br/><br/>There are more mystery tokens than there are treats, so you may not collect a treat after every delivery.  Also, some tokens are worth three treats right away and do not need to be delivered. Once the beach is clear of mystery tokens the game ends and the player with the most treats wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A lighthearted cow-tipping game in which aliens are trying to tip cows for bragging rights.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the first part of the game, players place their cows. <br/>On an 8x8 grid (3 players) or 9x9 grid (2 or 4 players), players take turns placing 12 cow chits of their color, 1 at a time and 1 per cell, inside the fence, which is a 1-cell perimeter. When placing cows, players try to achieve Cow Lock, which is two identically-colored orthogonally adjacent cows. Four cows in a square is called a Bovine Doom Block. Next, each player places their alien chit on the center square of their edge of the board (on the grid, but outside the fence). They take turns moving the alien up to 3 spaces, and then they may choose to tip cows. Tipping starts from the alien and stops at a Cow Lock -- the alien cannot tip a cow directly into a cow of the same color. The player then collects all tipped cows.<br/><br/>To determine individual scores, each player tallies their cows, subtracting the number of cows of their color from the remaining cows. High score wins.<br/><br/>In the 2-player game, each player uses a single alien marker as normal, but chooses and places cows of 2 colors. Cow Lock and Bovine Doom Block can still only be achieved with cows of the same color.<br/><br/><br/>From the packaging:<br/>In Udder Madness you are an alien engaged in a contest with your alien pals to see who can tip the most cows of your opponents while tipping as few of your own as possible.<br/><br/>Why an alien, you ask? Well there are a couple of reasons.<br/><br/>One reason is that by now, any alien visitors we may have must surely have grown bored with abducting people and examining their nether-regions. So with nether-regions out, and crop circles quickly becoming pass, they're going to need some new mystifying activity... Why not this?<br/><br/>The second reason is that we at Placebo Press could not possibly believe that an actual human being, no matter how depraved or intoxicated, would participate in such an activity outside of the confines of a harmless board game? Hence it must be aliens. I don't think that our logic is flawed here.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fantastische Ballonreise [Fantastic Balloon Voyage] is a dice game for 2-5 players. The idea is to fly as quickly as possible. Whoever can land at his destination first wins. Fantastische Ballonreise will take you flying all over Germany and its neighbors following a &quot;must visit&quot; list set at the start of the game. At the various stops you will read a card which is descriptive of the folklore of the location and has a special effect on play, including trivia contests, drawing pictures or singing songs. This game was developed as a promotional item for the soft drink manufacturer Fanta. Includes five miniature plastic balloons which go up and down on stands to show their current altitude. Players race their balloons, and special dice are used to determine the change of orientation of a large wind rose, which indicates the amount of movement permitted in each direction, but lines on the board indicate which directions can be travelled in from each space. Cards are dealt out to indicate start position, end position and four intermediate points in each player's route. Very nice item.<br/><br/>",

Each player control one army (or sometimes 2 if you are 2-3 players) and tries to move any of his characters to Naboo, throwing 2 dices per turn, each for one character. When getting doubles, all four characters can be moved. On the way can you attack your opponents and with luck and skill render them harmless. But be careful, so your not attacked and eliminated yourself.<br/><br/>Armies from the same side are allies during the game and has to cooperate, ie to open a gate to Naboo, as the planet is protected by a shield. It's done when 2 allies from different armies meet at an alliance field, where 'Star Wars' is stated. Throwing 4 dices and adding attack value, they must get at least 22. Enemies cannot go trough the opened gate.<br/><br/>The combat system is simple, by adding attack values and defence values of each character to the dice throws. Regardless who attacked, the player who got smaller number, loses the character. The lost character can be conquered back if ventured in the enemy base and both characters are moved back to own base.<br/><br/>When character reaches Queen Amidala, player takes control of it and tries to move it back to allied base. If Queen loses battle, the winning character is moved to center and control of the Queen is changed.<br/><br/>The game is based upon the the movie &quot;Star Wars Episode I&quot;.<br/><br/>The game does probably only exist in Sweden, Norway and Finland.<br/>&quot;Kampen om Naboo&quot; = &quot;Fight for Naboo&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The game was inspired by the Clinton-Lewinsky sex scandal and the design is a satire of that and all other scandals in history.  The cards are divided into categories, each representing elements of a good public scandal:  the Target, the Trigger, the Transgression, the Trumpeters (media), the Tidbits, and the Testimonials.<br/><br/>Players take turns adding a card to the growing scandal.  Only one target, trigger, and transgression may be in play at any given time, and each is required for a complete scandal, but multiple cards from other categories may be added freely.  When the three required elements are present, a player may trigger a scoring round by playing one of two &quot;It's History!&quot; cards.  Scandals are thus generated until one player reaches a target total score.<br/><br/>The 54 cards are each marked with standard playing card rank and suit (to allow use for traditional card games), and many sport photos of nude or scantily clad women (the box carries a &quot;not for sale to minors under 18&quot; warning).  As part of the marketing, randomly 1 in 12 decks were given an extra card signed by Nina Hartley.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If I tell you Leviathan is a cross between 'Go Fish' and a non-collectible 'Magic: the Gathering', you will instantly know pretty much everything you need to know about this game. Players take turns asking each other for cards matching the ones in their hands, each card being named after a particular fish (or fish-related being, such as Atlantean Priests or Mermaids). When a player manages to get a pair, they place it face-up on the table in front of them, just like in Go Fish. Once the cards hit the table, the Magic: the Gathering aspects come into play, as most of the fish have unique powers that can be used to aid you or annoy your opponents. There are also unique cards (with names like &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot; and &quot;Offshore Oil Rig&quot;), which have more esoteric powers and move from player to player as they get used. When one player runs out of cards in their hand, everyone scores a point for each pair they possess, and a new hand is dealt until every player has dealt once, at which point the final scores are tallied and a winner is declared. (Game time is thus dependant on number of players -- my guess of 90 minutes is a rough estimate of a 6-player game, which may not be at all accurate.)<br/><br/>In many ways, Leviathan epitomizes the &quot;beer-and-pretzels&quot; game -- in fact, it was designed in a coffee shop, out of a need for something to do while sitting in a coffee shop. The rules encourage a light (&quot;jovially rude&quot;) atmosphere, and the writing style generally reflects this, although careful attention has been paid to the way the various cards interact, and to fix any possible contradictions or loopholes. (And the rule set has been edited to remove unnecessary rudeness in the author's writing style, although -- shh! -- an &quot;impolite&quot; version of the rules is rumored to exist, somewhere...)<br/><br/>Players are encouraged to devise new card powers and game variations, and as a bonus for players south of the equator, a special &quot;Southern Hemisphere&quot; option is given, which explains the way the Coriolis Effect changes the order of play.<br/><br/>",

Next players drop tokens that match their empty color seats into their trains returning any non-matches. A lower seat must be filled before you can stack a token into the upper seat.

The game took its name from political opponents in Edwardian England - the suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst (1858-1928) and Herbert Asquith (1852-1928), Prime Minister from 1908 to 1916. The game was first advertised in Votes for Women on the 22 October 1909 and many of the references to recent events are illustrated by the squares. The illustrations on the board show the difficulties encountered by Pankhurst and her supporters in the militant suffragette movement.<br/><br/>Comments from The Jon A. Lindseth Suffrage Collection<br/><br/>The Pank-a-Squith board game was first advertised in Votes for Women on 22 October 1909. It comes with six painted, cast lead, figures for the suffragettes. The board is stamped &quot;Made in Germany&quot; on the back.<br/><br/>The goal of this board game is to reach the Houses of Parliament, the pinnacle of achievement for the campaign for Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage. Although designed to be humorous, the images evoke the darker side of the campaign, making reference to police violence against women protesters and the force-feeding of imprisoned hunger strikers.<br/><br/>",

Published in Warlock (Issue 13 - Dec/Jan 1986/1987).<br/><br/>The board depicts the classic demon-summoning layout, with pentagram and magic circle.  One player is the wizard, the other, the demon; both are armed with tokens, two for each ancient element (earth, air, water, fire).  The wizard plays first, setting up his elements hidden at the points of the triangle and pentagram with no opposing element on the same line.  The demon plays second, laying down one element at a time next to the wizard's and seeing what happens before playing the next.  The idea is that the wizard should create a difficult-to-guess defense, while the demon tries to solve the puzzle and/or hedge his bets.<br/><br/>",

The player picks up a tile of the indicated kind and adds it to the caterpillar he is currently building in front of him. A complete caterpillar has a head, at least one body tile, and a tail. A player must complete his current caterpillar before beginning a new one. If his caterpillar needs a tail, and the pointer stops at a head or a body tile, he may not pick up a tile but must try again on his next turn. There is nothing players can do the affect the outcome. Longest caterpillar at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>There are 40 body tiles, 8 head tiles and 8 tail tiles. All heads are different but they are all happy faces, some with hats and so on. It doesn't really matter which heads you choose, but this may still seem important to young players. It is also the only decision players make.<br/><br/>Scandinavian edition Larven Freddy (&quot;Freddy the Caterpillar&quot;) was published by Brio under the Joker label, but the copyright belongs to John Waddington Ltd. I haven&acute;t found a similar game actually published by Waddington, so any information on this is welcome.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Covered Up comprises two games, a basic game and an advanced game.<br/><br/>In the basic game a murder has been committed.  Two players (or teams of two) play either black or white footsteps.  The twelve playing cards are shuffled and dealt face down to both players.  Players alternatively play a card (which contains some holes) onto the board.  The object is to cover up as many of your own footsteps as possible whilst exposing your opponent&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>In the advanced game (3 to 4 players) each player chooses a role card to establish whether they are a detective or a murderer.  Before the start the 2 murderers must each decide on a board location to hide their victim.  They tell each other their location, one will be a white location and one a black location.  The detective(s), who are not told of the locations, will use the diagrams on the back of their cards to assist them identify the location of the bodies.  Each murderer alternatively places a playing card onto the board, but they must not alter the color or direction of the two hidden locations.  Each murderer will try to expose the other by changing as many of the opponent&rsquo;s steps as possible to help the detective with their eliminations.  When a detective has one location left un-eliminated he has caught the murderer.  If the caught murderer has played one less card than their opponent then the opponent can play one more card to try to salvage a draw.  The victorious detective and the uncaught murderer are the winners. <br/><br/><br/>",

Next, one player choses a character to play. Then, the other player chooses a character and starts the game. The character you pick will give you certain advantages (and disadvantages in some cases). Also, some of the players have special victory conditions. Play is identical to a normal game of checkers, except that the rules that govern a character overrule all other rules.<br/><br/>When your opponent loses the last of his or her checkers, you win.

        "description": "This game shows a lot of lively climbing stairs, because the goal is to be the first player who brings all his tokens on the top platform. Instead of moving step by step, it is faster when you form columns (towers of more than 1 token), since columns allow jumps of as many stages as they are high. After such a jump, the lowest token of the column remains at his staring place and you can move it downwards under certain circumstances, which is interesting, if the remaining token belongs to an opponent. This game requests a lot of strategy and the smartest player will win.<br/><br/>Description from the box:<br/><br/>Become the King of the Castle!<br/>It takes clear thinking to reach the summit of this challenging test of skill.<br/><br/>",

Instead of the usual numbers, the roulette wheel has letters of the alphabet. Each letter of the alphabet has been assigned a value from one to ten points. Once the seven letters for the round have been determined, the players have a time limit to use those letters in words on their individual grids crossword-style. The player with the most points after a predetermined number of rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>In the official rules in the box-lid, it there is a single crossword grid that is shared by all players, each player taking turns adding to the grid.<br/><br/>",

You start the game with a standard poker deck, an Elemental Warriors II play sheet, and a limited number of coins.  The play sheet is divided into 10 columns (number 1 to 10) and 5 rows (labeled Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Combat).  Before the game begins, you allocate your coins to spaces on your play sheet.  During the game, you draw and play cards to activate columns on your play sheet.  Your combat value and any effects you generate are determined by the coins in the column you activate.  Earth effects tend to prevent damage.  Water effects tend to add coins to your play sheet.  Fire effects tend to deal damage to your opponent.  Air effects tend to let you move the coins on your play sheet or draw extra cards.  These special powers enable you to change your strategy during play and adapt to your opponent's behavior.  When you take damage, you lose coins from your play sheet.  If you surrender or run out of coins, you lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Pieces rest on the points of the grid, not the spaces.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can move one of your pieces any distance in a horizontal or vertical direction, like a rook in chess. Your goal is to move all of your pieces to the opposite corner of the board.<br/><br/>When two pieces of the same color share the same line without any other colored pieces between them, imagine an invisible wall extending between those two pieces. You cannot move your piece through any wall nor can you land a piece on a point currently occupied by a wall. (This rule applies even if you're trying to pass through a wall you created!)<br/><br/>Because walls apply equally to all players, it becomes dangerous to be too defensive. A diplomatic atmosphere emerges from these simple mechanics as your pieces dance around the board, avoiding walls and building new walls of their own.<br/><br/>From the Luchacabra website:<br/><br/>This elegant abstract board game is deceptively simple. Move your pieces like chess rooks, trying to get to the opposite corner of the board. Uninterrupted lines between your pieces form imaginary walls that no pieces, not even your own, can cross. That&rsquo;s it! Embargo is a strategic game of territorial control and sharing.<br/><br/>",

Lastly a spinner is spun to select a bug and if you&rsquo;re the unfortunate person holding the most cards with that bug then you&rsquo;ll have to eat it, that is unless your team can complete a challenge card&hellip;<br/><br/>",

The board is made up of four straight tracks each with 20 spaces.  Players pick from 20 cardboard Sesame Street characters and insert them into the slot of one of the triangular pieces and put the piece on a Start space.  The players take turns spinning the traffic light spinner which is equally divided into a 1, 2 and 3 area.  The player then moves the number of spaces that was spun.  When a players lands on a stoplight space they must stop there.  When a player lands on a friendship space they get to pick a new Sesame Street character, insert it into one of the circular pieces and hook it to the back of their current character making a train.  Play proceeds until a player makes it to the park space at the end of the track.<br/><br/>",

It is interesting to read the first stanzas of the book and appreciate the importance he gave to play.<br/><br/>'I hereby describe the organization, structure and rules of this ancient shastra (games), the reason being that there is no such book available and the scholars do not study them. In this book there is a description of several board games, and the intention of this shastra being that people will enhance their brain power by playing them.'<br/><br/>He goes on to conclude the book thus:<br/><br/>I have described the famous games of my time. I do not claim this to be exhaustive, there are several games of various types played in the world and it is physically impossible to compile all of them. I have done my best to compile the most important of my time. ... I, Harikrishna, son of Venkatram was born in Aurangabad in south Maharashtra. I have described in this book many wonderful games and the ways to play them.<br/><br/>It was about the same time that Krishnaraja Wodeyar of Mysore developed and promoted many interesting games.<br/><br/>The game we have here is a simple strategy game described by Harikrishna as a game in 24 squares. We have used the Sanskrit description he has given as the name of the game. Chathurvimshathi Koshtaka simply means 24 boxes or squares.<br/><br/>Contents: game board, two sets of 8 coins each, rule sheet.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets their &quot;own&quot; random country in the beginning to start from, and the idea of the game is to try to gather as many different flags for yourself as possible; players move on the board using colour-dies and a right combination of colours allows a player to turn one of the flag cards - they are shuffled on the table face down, forming a memory game element - hoping for the flag of the country they're currently standing on, or at least a flag of same colours.<br/><br/>Flags are scored at the end of the game with the Finnish flag and each player's &quot;own&quot; flag carrying bonus points.<br/><br/>One of the last original Paletti publications; the brand ceased to exist soon after, and most of it's games were taken over by Peliko Oy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epyx VCR Golf features 18 different holes from the world's most famed golf courses. Pinehurst, Jupiter Hills, Miami's Doral Country Club and other equally spectacular courses. Epyx VCR Golf tests the very soul of classic golf strategy.<br/><br/>Play against yourself, against an opponent or three opponents. You move the ball from tee to green deciding each shot along the way. There are three ways a player can make a stroke: You can select a club card which includes a predetermined shot distance. You can roll the dice once you hit the green. Or you can play the videocassette featuring real live action footage, courtesy of ABC Sports and the PGA of America. And all the pros are there.<br/><br/>But, of course, the hottest pro on the tour is somebody you're very familiar with, You. You're the one who decides everything. Beginning to feel the pressure?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Miniatures rules for the Colonial Period (late 19th Century).<br/><br/><br/>Rampant Colonialism! was designed to recreate colonial engagements both real and fictional with miniature figures.  <br/>While these rules were written with 15mm figures in mind, there are just as well used with 20mm and 25mm figures. <br/>The period covered by these rules includes the French and Indian Wars through the late 19th Century, and even beyond into the early 20th Century for such conflicts as the Boxer Rebellion, and the African and Middle Eastern theaters of World War I.<br/><br/>Rampant Colonialism can be played with two or more players, and in fact makes a great multi-player game.  <br/>Each side is organized into a number of units, and optional command and control rules have been provided to maintain a chain of command for issuing and receiving orders.  <br/>Individual models are also used, and include officers/leaders, NCO's, sharp shooters and heroic individuals.  <br/>During a turn, a unit may move, fire and/or engage in melee with the enemy.  <br/>All combat is resolved with the use of a ten-sided die.<br/><br/>The weapon chart covers everything from black powder muzzle-loaders through magazine-fed rifles using smokeless powder.  <br/>There are also rules for cannon (both muzzle and breach loading) and machine guns.<br/><br/>The lists in the book include:<br/><br/>     The French &amp; Indian Wars<br/>     The Asante War, 1874<br/>     Second Afghan War, 1879<br/>     Zulu War, 1879<br/>     First Boer War, 1881<br/>     Sudan, 1885<br/>     Boxer Rebellion, 1900<br/>     WWI in the Middle East and Africa, 1914-1918<br/><br/><br/>Best of all, the rules are simple, and they play quickly.<br/><br/>If playing Rampant Colonialism doesn't cut down on the &quot;rules lawyering&quot; syndrome in your gaming group, we'll eat our pith helmets!<br/><br/>&ndash;Description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players answer questions in one of 5 different categories: Characters, Words, History, Geography, and Miscellaneous, and these questions are in 3 levels of difficulty: Easy, Harder, or Hardest.<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first person to move their token across the board to reach the space indicating &quot;Eternity with Jesus&quot;.  A player simply answers a question taken from one of the hundreds of question cards corresponding to the color of the space their token is on.  The color of the space indicates the question's category and the number on the space indicates the difficulty level of the question.  If answered correctly, the player rolls the die and moves accordingly.  Should a player be unable to answer a question, the player on their next turn may attempt a lower level of question in the same category.<br/><br/>This game can be played in teams.  There are also &quot;Advanced Play&quot; rules, in which the die is not used.  In this rule set, once a player answers a question correctly, the token is moved ahead on the board the same number of spaces as the level answered (1, 2, or 3), and the player retains her turn until an incorrect answer is given.<br/><br/>",

(Any number can play)&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The object of OFFICE PARTY is to have a rollicking good time.  This will be achieved by drinking, stripping, winning chips, and indulging in general hanky panky.&quot;<br/><br/>The game consists of a board, die, candle with holder, chips, pawns, a &quot;Boss's Cards&quot; deck, and a &quot;Sexetary's Cards&quot; deck.  The candle goes in the center of the board for ambiance.<br/><br/>The board has many tracks, similar to a Careers board.  Players roll and perform various actions depending on the space landed on.  The currency in the game is chips and articles of clothing.  Chips can be bought for articles of clothing.  &quot;When a player has run out of both chips and clothing, he is declared a PARTY POOPER, and is at the mercy of the other players.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;NOTE: OFFICE PARTY does not condone gambling nor alcohol.  Neither does it specify the measure of each drink taken.  What the chips represent, and what is used for drinks, is left entirely to the discretion of the players.

        "description": "A spin-off from British TV series &quot;Property Ladder&quot;, this game sees players navigate around the board trying to acquire, renovate, and sell prime residential property.<br/><br/>A bit like a far simpler and more modern 'Monopoly'. Players must first land on a 'buy' square to purchase up their first property: then increase its value with by spending money on 'developments' and 'advice cards'. Once the kitchen, bathroom and garden are renovated, the player can sell - if they land on the right square. A renovated property means a profitable sale: the extra cash can then be spent buying, and improving, a more expensive property. The winner is the first player to buy, renovate and then sell three properties in succession.<br/><br/>Landing on 'repairs' or 'council tax' squares can cost the player money; if you run out of money in hand, you have to 're-mortgage' your property, meaning you can't develop until you get more cash by passing Go. And if you're out of cash and have no un-mortgaged property, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>There's a balance to be struck between cash now and cash later: buying an expensive property early on, or investing a lot in the optional (but profitable) 'advice cards', pays higher dividends - but it can leave you stuck for ready cash and hold up your progress by re-mortgaging.<br/><br/>This amusing game was exclusively available at Marks &amp; Spencer in Q4 2007.<br/><br/>",

Four player games can be played as individuals or as partners. Each player receives 3 shells and only one pea. The players secretly shuffle their shells, and places them on the three squares of their color. Players take turns. Two dice are rolled, and one shell is moved the number of one dice and another shell is moved the number of the other dice. A challenge occurs if one player's shell lands on the same space as an opponent's shell. The challenged player must lift up his shell, and if the shell contains the pea, then the challenger loses. The challenged player loses if no pea is uncovered. The following points are added to each player's score: 20 points for reaching the finish with your shell that has the pea; 10 points for a successful challenge; and 5 points for successfully defending a challenge. Several rounds are played until a player or team reaches a score of 100 points.<br/><br/>",

The play cards are made up of 5 each of the 4 combinations of backhand/forehand to backhand/forehand and 4 smash and 4 lob cards. Scoring is the same as in lawn tennis. The two packs (service and play) are shuffled and both players receive 4 play cards to form their hand. The server then places the top service card face up to show the type of serve. An ace is a point immediately won and if a fault is drawn then another card is immediately drawn and if this is another fault, the point is lost. If it is any of the other service cards, the opponent can return it only if he has a corresponding card that allows him to play the return type or he can play a lob card. A lob card can only be returned by another lob card or a smash card. A smash can only be returned by a lob. If a player cannot return with the appropriate card then he loses that point. Players replace cards as they are played from the draw deck to make a 4 card hand. Play continues until the correct number of sets (predetermined at the start) is won.<br/><br/>",

The games stimulate motor skills and acquaint the children, depending on their age and the variation chosen, with the numbers 1 to 10. For children a little older they offer a first approach to adding and subtracting. For the games, it is not always important that there is a winner.

The seventh evil unit, the powerful Makuta, does not appear unless the other six Rahkshi units are all eliminated.<br/><br/>The cards are central to the play of the game. The players draw a hand of cards from a common deck. Card play determines when units may move, attack, defend, or use special powers.<br/><br/>",

Mikkeli (S:t Michel) is a town in Southern Savonia, and hosted the headquarters of the Finnish armed forces during World War II.<br/><br/>Kaupunkipelit is a series of games, each of which is basically a light version of Monopoly localized to a city/region of Finland. The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.<br/><br/>The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:<br/><br/>-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.<br/>-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.<br/>-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.<br/>-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.<br/><br/>",

In this game the German player must take the Battleship Bismark and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen out to sea and north of the British isles past the Denmark Straits and out into the Atlantic where it can prey upon and sink vital British convoys.<br/><br/>The British must sink the Bismark at all costs. Failure to do so will mean a menace upon their shipping they can ill afford. The might of the Royal Navy is surely capable of the task, but the real challenge will be, how long will it take and what will be the costs. Victory in Bismark will depend on how much shipping the Germans are able to sink before the Brits are able to sink the Bismark.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>1 22x17 inch Full Color Map in 2 pieces<br/>1 D10<br/>Rules<br/>Over 90 full color cut out units on adhesive paper<br/>Cardboard to stick counters on<br/><br/>",

Octavian's legions were training for the inevitable clash by campaigning on the Rhine, and Antony needed a campaign to get his forces, living in the luxury of the East, in top shape. Political turmoil in Parthia suggested easy pickings, together with an opportunity to avenge Crassus' famous defeat in 55BC. Antony therefore assembled an army of eighty thousand men, including Armenian allies of dubious loyalty, and late in the campaigning season he set off through Armenia to attack the Parthian capital at Ecbatana, The first objective was Phraata, a Median city which must be captured to maintain communications with Armenia. Here Antony halted to wait for his siege train to catch up. Unfortunately, it never arrived. A Parthian army under the command of Monaeses ambushed and destroyed the train, and at this point the Armenians deserted en masse. Antony was now left in the middle of Media, with no siege train and his communications cut, and one quarter of his army already lost.<br/><br/>2 players game on the disastrous retreat of Antony's army from Parthia in 36 BC.

The men get a movement allowance equal to the roll of a die, and on an odd roll the player may continue with another turn. Rules for nearly every conceivable real-life soccer situation. Two egg timers are available to limit each player's time to move.<br/>However, the rules sometimes seem far-fetched and often do not give real choices to the players. This, of course, also affects the value as a training and simulation game, and the game vanished from the shops as quickly as it came.<br/><br/>The 1987 edition contains a smaller variant of the game named &quot;Hallen-Cup&quot; on the reverse side of the board.<br/><br/>",

The idea is to roll the 3 dice and to follow up with cards from your hand to make point-scoring series; for example, 3 triangles from the dice followed by 3 triangles from your hand scores 10 points. Triangle and circle are 'normal' suits while star is a kind of joker suit in that it can be combined with the other suits as well as stars, and the square is a negative suit but only if you get 3 of them on the dice; the other players can then follow with more squares from their hand to give you more negative points. There are also 9 different special cards which allow you to steal points from other players, change the direction of play, etc., while the empties are only there to mess up your hand. The board has slots for each player's point card and players use the transparent chips to keep track of their scores.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first to score 100 points or win the game directly by getting the Jackpot ie. 3 stars from the Pop-O-Matic followed by 3 stars from your hand.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/> <br/>     1 plastic gameboard with Pop-O-Matic dice roller<br/>     150 cards<br/>     8 transparent plastic chips<br/>     4 point cards<br/>     4 point tables<br/>     Rules<br/><br/><br/>",

These games intend to bring parents and their little ones together by participating in a fun and interactive setting.<br/>The three games in the trilogy (Puppy Pals Bingo, Duck Duck 1-2-3 and Polar Bear A-B-C) are a fun way for your preschooler to learn about matching shapes and patterns, simple counting and spelling.<br/><br/>In Polar Bear A-B-C, a word is chosen for the round and you must use your magnetic fishing rod to fish for letters from the icy lake, and then use these letters to help spell out that word. Players take turns in fishing but any letters caught that are not needed for the word must be dropped into leftover letter lake!<br/><br/>",

It includes a somewhat Pacheesi/Sorry-like board, rules/questions booklet, 12-sided die, 4 pawn, 4 Celestial Markers (colored tokens), 10 white bonus tokens.<br/><br/>In a turn, a player is first asked a trivia question from the booklet, about the Book of Mormon, along with the 3 suggested answers.  (Wee folk can get just 2 answers to choose from.)  If answered correctly, the player rolls the die and moves his pawn around the outer track.  Several outer spaces affect the player's next turn (roll &amp; move twice, choose which direction to go, etc.)<br/><br/>Each player also has an inner path, whose steps are labeled with important spiritual steps (baptism, confirmation, temple marriage, enduring to the end) toward the center (heaven).  Their Celestial Marker is placed on the first step when the pawn lands on a colored space; each step after that comes from turning in 2 bonus tokens, which are earned by landing on a corner space.  The first player to the center wins.<br/><br/>Options are also described for cooperative play, team play, activities, chance cards, etc.<br/><br/>",

On the<br/>map is that it has a grid of hexagons ('hexes'). There<br/>are railroads in some hexes. One hex (Konigsberg) also has a fort.<br/>On the map tile is also printed the Combat Results Table<br/>(CRT) used to resolve combat (see below) and a turn track.<br/><br/>Army Tiles<br/><br/>One player (the &quot;Russian Player&quot;) plays the attacker, controlling the two tiles representing the Russian 1st and 2nd armies. The other (&quot;German&quot;) player plays the defender, controlling the third tile, representing the German 8th army. Each army tile has two numbers printed on it. The one to the left is the combat power of that army. The one to the right is the movement allowance of the unit,<br/>which is 1 (one) for all armies. In the rest of these rules, the army tiles are refered to simply as &quot;units&quot;. A unit, as long as it is in the game, is always in (only) one hex on the map. Two units are adjacent to<br/>each other if they occupy hexes that are adjacent (that is if they share a common border). Two units may never occupy the same hex. The Russian units are enemy units to the German unit and vice versa.<br/><br/>Victory<br/>If only one player has (an) unit(s) remaining on the map, then that player wins immediately. Otherwise, after 10 turns the Russian player wins if there is a Russian army in the fort (Konigsberg). If the Russian player did not win the German player wins (there can be no draw).<br/><br/>Part of the 4 Tile Contest:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/383408</a><br/><br/>Freely available: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3170712#3170712\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3170712#3170712</a><br/><br/>Added under a Creative Commons Attribution licence.<br/><br/>",

The treasure was well hidden, and marco Polo left hints on where to find it in various pagodas and buildings across the city.<br/><br/>In &quot;Der Schatz des Marco Polo&quot; (The Treasure of Marco Polo) the players search Hang-Tschou for that treasure. Once a player has found it, the others will try to snatch it away.<br/><br/>In the first part of the game the players move through Hang-Tschou looking for hints. The hints always point to buildings in the city. When a player has gathered two hints of the same kind he needs to move to that location to uncover where the treasure is hidden.<br/><br/>This starts the second, co-operative phase of the game. If the player who got the hint manages to reach the treasure he wins. From now on, though, all other players will try to hunt him down. If they succeed they share the loot among themselves and the first player loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Game of the Snake is an adaptation of the Game of the Goose Game of Goose. It is a simple roll and move game played with two dice, with spaces that cause you to move back, lose a turn, etc. If one reads the rules which are printed on the game board, there is also an element of gambling as well as elements of an early party or drinking game.<br/><br/>The game starts by the players agreeing on &quot;what to play for,&quot; &quot;which is to be lay'd down and then you must throw who shall play first.&quot; Some spaces require the player to put up an additional wager: &quot;He that throws upon 38 must feast with Cupid paying his share, that is, as much as he stak'd down first, and must remain there till his Companions have play'd once about.&quot; If you land on space 30 you have to wash yourself in the fountain &quot;until dispac'd by some other.&quot; If you land on 59, the bottle space, the player is &quot;to drink a Glass and pay a stake till his turn comes to throw again.&quot;<br/><br/>The earliest known version was published in Antwerp, ca. 1620, by Pieter de Jode as &quot;El Juego Real de Cupido&quot;.  A copy of this version, published for the Spanish market, can be seen in the British Library (ref: Maps * 999(1) See also: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-of-cupid-a-17th-century-board-game\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.bl.uk/picturing-places/articles/the-royal-game-o...</a>). A French translation was published in Paris, ca. 1640, by the widow of Charles Petit as &quot;Jeu Royal de Cupidon&quot; (private collection <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.giochidelloca.it/scheda.php?id=1240</a> ) and a version was published in Amsterdam, ca. 1625&ndash;1640, by Claes Jansz. Visscher. This version, &quot;Het Nieuw slange Spel anders Genaemt Koninclycke Tytkorting van Cupido&quot; (&quot;The New Snake Game, otherwise known as the Royal Pastime of Cupid&quot;), introduced the peasant dance as the central motif, which was reproduced in some later English editions. A copy can be seen in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam (<a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-P-OB-77.369</a>).<br/><br/>The earliest known British edition was published ca. 1690&ndash;1700 by John Garrett at his shop &quot;next the stayres of the Royal Exchange in Cornhill&quot;, London, with the peasant dance motif. A copy of the Garrett edition is included in the George Clarke print collection, Worcester College, Oxford (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://prints.worc.ox.ac.uk/about.html</a>).<br/><br/>William Dicey published an edition ca. 1736&ndash;40 from his press in Bow Churchyard, London, using the same design. An example of the Dicey edition can be found in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library [where it is incorrectly dated &quot;1794&quot;]: (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-4276-a090-cc2b2851ffba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/6ff20133-45bb-427...</a>).<br/><br/>A different design was employed in the edition published by Laurie &amp; Whittle, 53 Fleet Street, London, in 1794. The central motif shows cupid sharpening his arrow. A copy of the Laurie &amp; Whittle edition is included in the John Johnson Collection of Printed Ephemera, Bodleian Library (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0a-9055-f3418ff9dd94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/7e4aa3bb-b2e6-4f0...</a>). This edition was published in a later state by R. H. Laurie (Laurie's son) ca. 1850. An example can be found in the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum (V&amp;A E.1747-1754 <a target='_blank' href=\"http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-of-cupid-board-game-r-h-laurie/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O26286/the-royal-pastime-o...</a>). James Lumsden &amp; Son of Glasgow also used this design in an edition published ca. 1810&ndash;1830. A copy of the Lumsden edition is also included in the John Johnson ephemera collection (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a0-93e4-631277631bef\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/inquire/p/278f99e8-623d-45a...</a>).<br/><br/>A third design was used by the Bowles family. The first Bowles edition was published by Carington Bowles, St Paul's Churchyard, London. The game is included in Carington Bowles's &quot;New &amp; Enlarged Catalogue&quot; published in 1784, so we can estimate a similar publication date for the game (it is not included in the earlier Bowles catalogue, published by John Bowles &amp; Son, in 1753). A later state of this edition was issued Carington Bowles's son, Henry Carington Bowles, who traded from the St Paul's Churchyard address as Bowles &amp; Carver between 1793 and 1830.<br/><br/>While the coiled serpent design is reminiscent of the ancient Egytptian game  Mehen, there is no evidence of any relation between the two other than the spiral track.  The same can be said of the relation between this game, as well as of Mehen and the Game of Goose being related to the Phaistos Disk, which dates to about 1600 BCE and which some have theorized may be an ancient board game. We are sure, however, that &quot;The Royal Pastime of Cupid, or Entertaining Game of the Snake&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;The Game of the Goose&quot;.<br/><br/>",

As tiles are used to make a &quot;22&quot; a player yells &quot;Ku-Do&quot; and draws more tiles so that they are always working with 7 tiles. Play continues until all tiles are gone.

For each wrong answer, one life point is lost.<br/><br/>In each history periode, there is also an enemy card, representing an evil character or event in history. Each enemy has a printed value. When reaching such an enemy, the active player may try to defeat the enemy. For that purposes he bid a number of hour glass tokens and throws a ten sided die (values 0 through 9). The number thrown is then multiplied by the number of hour glasses bid and if that number is equal or higher than the enemies value, the enemy is defeated and life points are gained.

Each turn, a Winding card will be drawn from the deck, and any Cogmen standing adjacent to a Winder will be wound up by that amount, gaining Energy. Once all the Winding cards have been used, a Rainy Day card is added and the deck is reshuffled. If a Rainy Day card is drawn, any Cogmen who don&rsquo;t find shelter will get wet and rust (a terrible fate!)<br/><br/>Beginning with the starting player, players take turns moving all of their Cogmen, who must spend Energy to move. At the end of the turn, any Cogmen dangerously low on Energy (and not near a Winder) may make a Desperation move, one last push towards a Winder before becoming unwound. A Cogman that becomes unwound is inoperable until he is wound up by an ally.<br/><br/>Cogmen gather the cogs that are scattered about Cogsburg, returning them to the Cogtower to gain victory points, or he may choose to repair a broken/rusted Cogman instead. A Cogman can only carry a single cog at a time (They&rsquo;re very heavy!)<br/><br/>Once the Cogtower has been rebuilt, final scores are tallied. Each player recieves one Victory Point for every cog they supplied to the Cogtower, plus an additional point for each operable Cogman.<br/><br/>The basic game is for two players. Rules for three players and four-player team play are included. Official rules for entirely cooperative play are forthcoming.<br/><br/>",

So....the more you know about Mark Messier and how many assists he averaged per season, the better guess you can make as your answer.<br/><br/>You don't ever have to be exact, but the closer you are, the faster you move up the fantasy category charts.<br/><br/>",

Reversable game boards and cards allow children to explore the wonderful world of the Friendly Farm and learn the letters of the alphabet.  Same general idea of the Classic Bingo, but with pictures on one side of the board and letters on the other. As in traditional Bingo, a player calls a particular picture or letter that is selected at random, and each player covers that figure on their personal board.  A player who gets a row covered wins.  <br/> A colorful way to get children to play with and recognize letters.<br/><br/>",

Players compete to gain the most money without going bankrupt.<br/><br/>In terms of actual game play, there is very little decision making other than the amount of particular bets though even this is fixed for some of the games.  Occasionally players have the option of switching between tracks.  All games are determined by random spins, dice rolls, or draws.  For example, the horse race has six horses starting at the same point and all players bet on a horse; a die is rolled and the corresponding horse advances one space; this continues until one horse has advanced to the finish.  As another example, lottery tickets are simply distributed as one lands on the spot with a random winner drawn later in the game.<br/><br/>The game board is a thin cardboard, the chips and horses are generic plastic pieces.

(Each player controls 6 of the 12 signs.)<br/><br/>The object of Zodiakos is to move one of your 6 pieces into your opponent's Gate, which is located at the opposite end of the board, in between your opponent's Spawn Areas.<br/><br/>Players begin at either end of a board comprised of 23 circles. <br/>At the start of the game there are not any pieces on the board. Any pieces that a player wishes to use must be &quot;spawned&quot; in one of the Spawn Circles on that player's side of the board. <br/>Players may move the pieces that they already have on the board either by moving them into adjacent circles or by jumping over friendly pieces.<br/>Players also may use their animals to capture their opponent's animals by jumping over them.<br/><br/>Zodiakos is a simple and fast paced abstract strategy game that is easy to learn and usually plays in under 20 minutes. It comes in a little cloth bag that also serves as the game board<br/>and it can be carried in any pocket that is big enough to hold a pack of gum.<br/><br/>Zodiakos is a complete game that can be expanded by combining it with its sister games Junishi, 12 Moons, and Neteru.<br/>(source : the publisher)<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    12 Moons<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Junishi<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Neteru<br/><br/><br/>",

A set comprises of three cards, Mr Hippo, Mrs Hippo and Baby Hippo, for example, and once played that family is said to have boarded the Ark. However the player might choose to lay down only two cards (which must be the mother and father) and place them into the Ark without their Baby. The Baby is now unable to join his parents in the Ark.<br/><br/>The player holding the Noah card may 'drown' babies in his hand if the parents have entered the Ark. Drowned babies are kept in front of the player who drowned them as they score bonus points at the end. The Noah card might move to several players during the game as part of the random draw from each player each turn. So different players might get the chance to drown the babies.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the parents have entered the Ark.<br/><br/>Each card has a points value once placed in the Ark. Drowned babies score 5 points for each one you have in front of you. Undrowned babies in your hand at the end score -10 points which is added to the player who holds Noah at the end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publishers web site:<br/>Here comes the adult game from the pipe (game box is cylinder), which includes seven adult dating games favored by the rules. Throwing dice, card games and beautiful components combine in this hilarious package, which is enough fun for the whole bunch! The game needed a stimulant substances are not included in the package.<br/>The game comes with a lot of cards, including regular deck (two) and special card decks. Game has 7 different adult games from drinking games (2) to actual serious adult fun with scoring and also a trivia game for couples.<br/><br/>Trivia game:<br/>Game comes with a special trivia cards and dice. Players play in couples and roll a dice. Dice shows the category from which the roller needs to answer. The weird thing is that couple needs to choose another couple from which to give the answer for. For each correct answer you keep the cards. First couple that knows other couples best and collect 6 cards are the winner couple.<br/><br/>Card game:<br/>Uses 2 classic game decks. Can be played with 2 or with 4 couples. Each couple gets a deck of cards or 2 suits in one color. Hearts and spades in this game act as trumps.<br/>Hearts are a life together and spades are the separation. Game is played in one full circle. With 2 couples the idea is to get rid of all the spades and collect all the hearts. Problem is that they both act as trumps, so getting rid of spades is hard, but there are special rules for Jacks and Queens in other suits that help to make that easier. When all cards are played, couples read their hearts and spades. Each heart is 2 points, each spade is -2 points, each Jack and Queen is extra 2 points (whatever suit) and each Ace is a free drink card (still a party game). Winner is the couple with the most points.<br/>In 4 couple game, game is played the same, but the winning conditions are different. Couples now only score how many cards they have - each red 2 points, each black -2 points. Rest is the same with the exception that 0 is the worst result. That means the further you are from the 0 the higher your score is.<br/><br/>Couples game:<br/>Uses the special trivia game cards. This is played in circles, couples sitting against each other. When the times comes to a player, he/she pulls a cards and ask one question from his partner about herself/himself. Partner then writes down an answer along side with the question asker. When the answer are more or less the same, they score one point (a kiss or a hug). Game lasts 10 rounds. Couple with more points (kisses) wins the game.<br/><br/>Other 4 are drinking games (one seems to be a sex game) where there is no actual winners or scoring of any kind. Like they say in the rules - all players are winners with these games.<br/><br/>",

So, one might say, that the game is meant for all ages just like the differential Estonian music. The can be played alone and as a team.<br/><br/>In this game you need to answer six different questions. Players move around the board according to the track drawn there and answering the questions according to the space they are standing on. Important thing is to keep a fun and happy attitude and even sing along with the songs. When a player suddenly finds themselves on  Rock board on a Pirate space, the player must give up one card he had already won. The reason this game has a Pirate space is because in real life a lot of music is stolen as well, so hopefully this space has a small motivational purpose as not to steal music. We are sorry! The Pirate space will not affect a player who already has 6 cards. When players finds himself on a corner, then he can choose the category. You need to collect 6 different colored cards, this is how you win the golden record. <br/>To win the game, you need to stand on one of the finish squares and the player to the left ask one question and this time you need to sing the answer. Get it right, and win the game.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns moving the spinner, throwing the die/dice (except during a thunderstorm) and moving their pawn.<br/>The spinner shows the weather: Sun helps the farmer with the harvest - use both dice and move the corresponding number of spaces. Wind also helps the farmer to move faster - throw one die, move, turn the spinner again. Rain slows the farmer down - use only one die. Thunderstorms mean its too dangerous - the player loses one turn.<br/>Pawns are moved from the farm to the field, where one harvest card is taken up and then brought back to the farm. On the players next turn, he moves his farmer to a different field etc.<br/>The game ends when one player's farmer has taken all his harvest cards to his farm.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Soccer simulation. The field is a grid of 6 x 5 boxes. Each player receives a pack of action cards. Either coach place the 11 pawn in the pitch.<br/><br/>The mechanism is simple: the player with possession of the ball takes three cards attack action and puts them into three boxes of your choice on the board, empty or occupied by pawns or their opponents. Two of the three cards played, however, are &quot;cards bluff&quot; and only serve to pull the wool over the eyes of the defender, who has two cards only line of defense to counter the effect of the cards of attack and must therefore try to guess where the attacker has the real paper and where the bluff. Place the cards, move the pieces closer to where they were put in the boxes of the tiles, the tiles are discovered and resolved effects. If the defender did not guess where the attacker has put the card real action, this explains its effects immediately. If you have guessed, it resolves the conflict according to a mechanism completely devoid of throwing dice (sic): the proceeds to count a series of penalties against both the defender the attacker (for example, for each opposing checker that is located on the trajectory of a passage the attacker receives a penalty). If you are under penalty wins the contrast. In case of a tie the defender wins. If the attacker loses the ball as time counter moves forward one minute.<br/>The action cards allow it to attack steps, jumps, throws, crosses, headers and volleys.<br/><br/>The action cards allow defensive tackle and advances (ground ball or head).<br/><br/>Resolved shots: the attacker has a certain number of points distributed on a shot that has a football goal (drawn on a separate sheet) divided into six sections. The goalkeeper has 14 points that can be distributed parade of no more than five of the six sections. The choice is made for both in secret. If at least one section there are several points that shot points parade's goal. Otherwise, parade. In case of a tie, corner.<br/><br/>Who wins at the end of the two times (the duration of which may be agreed between the players) have scored more goals.<br/><br/>",

The other 27 cards are used in part 2, Playing the Arranged Matches.<br/><br/>Arranging Matches: Each player getrs a hand of cards and a turn consists of laying down a pair of cards from the same division, or drawing a card from the stack. Depending on the number of players, this goes on until all players have arranged the correct number of matches or there are no more cards to draw from the deck. Points are awarded or lost depending on whether you did or did not arrange the correct number of matches.<br/><br/>Now play shifts to the second deck. All the arranged matches are placed in the middle of the table. These nicely illustrated cards are in four suits, marked A to D. A is trumps. Now you play 6 hands of cards in Whist fashion. Must follow suit, if not can discard or trump. The winner of the most tricks decides the result of any match on the table. He does this by choosing one of three face down cards - Away Win, Home Win, Draw. An Away Win scores him 20 points, a Draw scores him 15 points, a Home Win scores 10 points. Then another hand of cards is played, and the winner chooses a card to be the result of that match, and so on, until all the matches have been played.<br/><br/>The points in Part 1 are added to the points in Part 2 and the winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

Depending on the number of players, each player gets an equal area featuring these counters.<br/><br/>The game is simple. Throw the dice with the colours on it. If you roll a colour in your area, you may remove the counter (it goes out of the game) or you can move that counter into an opponent's area if he has a space of that colour without a counter on it. There is some strategy required by the little ones who will play this game and that is a good thing in my opinion.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to clear out all the counters in his area.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game found in The New Book of Games, circa 1950.<br/><br/>For this game a large board must be drawn like the one in the image. The football is a counter, which at the beginning of the game is placed on square 14 for the kick-off. The two players, or sides &mdash; &ldquo;Rovers&rdquo; and &ldquo;United&rdquo; &mdash; throw the dice alternately. Rovers add the value of their throw to the number of the square on which the ball lies, and move it on to the square indicated; thus, if the ball is on 17 and they throw a 4, the ball is moved to 21. United subtract the value of their throw from the number where the ball previously was: thus if it is on 8 and they throw 3, the ball goes to 5. A goal is scored when the ball enters square 1 or square 27.<br/><br/>After a goal has been scored, the game is restarted, and the side which has lost the goal kicks off. If a throw leads to a number over 27 or less than 1, it is a goal lick, and the other side places the ball on the square in front of goal, and throws. If 1 is thrown while the ball is in a touch-line square, the ball is out of play and not moved, the other side taking a throw immediately.<br/><br/>A time limit, say five or ten minutes, must be fixed for the game before starting. When elapsed, the side with the most goals, wins.<br/><br/>",

All players move at once, and moves performed by more than one player at a time means the villain gets away!<br/><br/>Each of the jumbo cards features a villain and a points value on one side of the card. On the other is one of four ninja moves: swing, kick, spin, or jump. Cards are divided into four equal decks with the villain face down; players should have plenty of room to move actively without hitting each other. Together, all players shout &quot;1 - 2 - 3!&quot; and perform the ninja move showing on top of any deck. If a shown ninja move is performed by only a single player, that player turns over the card and captures the villain on the other side, scoring those points. If more than one player performs the same move, even if the move is showing on more than one card, no points are scored and those cards are discarded. The game ends when one deck runs out of cards. Points are counted to determine the winner.<br/><br/>The box declares this a game for ages 5+. The jumbo cards feature artwork from the 2013 Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quoted from the rulebook: Policemen have to catch a disguised thief. Whoever wins the largest number of medals becomes the best policeman. Policemen can jointly investigate in catching a thief and they can win and share more medals,<br/><br/>In each round one player is the thief and the other players are the policemen. The thief draws one thief card (from 32) and the policemen have to find out that card.<br/><br/>In turn, the policeman turn over 4 cards from the suspect deck, which consists of the same cards as in the thief deck. Then they ask a closed question (yes/no) about a feature of the thief, like baldness, wearing a beard, wearing glasses, having a red jacket etc., which the thief has to answer. After that, the thief is allowed to turn over one face-up card.<br/><br/>After six questions the remaining cards are turned face up. Now the policemen have to point to the suspect, they think suspect being the thief. If all policemen guess correctly, they get a number of medals that is printed on the thief card. If they point to different suspects, only the correct guessing policemen gain 1 medal. If all policemen fail with their guesses, they all lose one medal.<br/> The game ends when each player was the thief once. The player with the most medals wins. Ties are possible...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Memory-style game to build Hessian-German swearwords out of pairs. Just for the fun of learning or revisiting Hessian dialect words.<br/><br/>The game plays like memory (unlike memory you don't keep matching pairs - put them back on the table, again). One word is the first half of the full word, one the second (1:1 match). To avoid unclarities, the matching parts have the same color - wrong combinations result in funny new creations, adding to the fun.The cards contain also an explanation what the resulting words actually mean (for those that did not know the word before).<br/><br/>It's mainly a fun party game leading to dicussions about local dialects, but the one finding most (new) matching pairs is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Super Bis is pretty simple language learning game. The game comprises of two decks of cards (one deck of questions and one deck of answers). For every question card, there is just one matching answer card. There is also one joker and one jack-in-the box -card. There is two rule sets in the game.<br/><br/>In the first game you just deal out the cards. Joker is removed. Everybody then removes matching pairs from their hands. Then the player in turn takes a card from the previous player. If the card matches a card in the players hand, he/she reads it loud and removes the pair. Then it's next players turn. This goes on until cards run out. Winner is the player who gets rid of his/her cards first and the loser is the player holding the pairless jack-in-the-box when pairs run out.<br/><br/>In the other game you just deal out the question cards. Joker and the jack-in-the-box are removed. Answer cards are shuffled and put in the table. One player then turns up the first card from the answers deck and reads it out. The player with the matching question reads it and then discards it. Then you read out the next answer card. Winner is the player who first gets rid of his/her cards.<br/><br/>",

The playing pieces have two sides, the costumed hero and his alter ego (for instance Spider-Man and Peter Parker). While in their secret identity the players are safe from attack and can move into position. To attack Mephisto they have to change into their superhero identities. On the Zoom Spaces the heroes get to collect Power Cards to use in the fight against Mephisto.  If a Superhero succesfully attacks Mephisto, he gets a Talisman Card. The first Player who gets 3 Talisman Cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",
