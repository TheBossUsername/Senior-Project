Once powerful relics are being drained of their magic, and strange solar flares are interfering with your spellcasting. Can you gather the paradox crystals before the continuum is beyond repair?<br/><br/>The new cards are:<br/><br/>Depleted Relics (4)​: You may use the number and object on these relics to travel as normal, but they do not have an element. They also may not be used to form paradoxes.<br/><br/>Solar Flares (2)​: These cards may never enter your hand. This means you cannot travel to their location, nor can you form a paradox that would require you to pick up a Solar Flare, including a potential game winning paradox. They may be discarded when new cards come out of the deck.<br/><br/>&mdash;from the publisher<br/><br/>In the Solo Flare single player version of the game you are still collecting Paradox Crystals in a manner similar to the base game.  Depending on the difficulty you choose, you will be aiming for 5-6 of  them. However, like all good games, there is a timer that creeps toward a loss condition in the form of a deck of cards. After all, without an opponent there are three cards (which would normally be the opponent&rsquo;s  hand) and the six new cards from the expansion that you mix together to  form a draw pile. If this pile is depleted, you immediately lose the  game. The unused staff card is set next to this deck with three crystals placed on it to serve as counters.<br/><br/>On your turn, you remove a counter  from that staff card if you do not complete a Paradox. When the third  counter is removed, you draw the top card of the deck and replace any card in the Continuum with this card - but it must match at least one feature on the card. However, the card it replaces is removed from the  game. Which means you are reducing the number of possible Paradoxes you can form any time you remove a base game card.<br/><br/>To further complicate matters, you  also draw a card off the top of this deck when you form a Paradox! Yes,  you read that right. When forming a Paradox you remove a card in your  hand from the game, draw the top card of the deck and place that into your hand, shuffle those three cards, and then place them into the  Continuum as the formation of your Paradox. The other way this deck can play cards is by skipping your entire turn. This allows you to draw the  top card of the deck and use it to replace a card in the Continuum, but it also does not remove a counter from the staff because you skipped your entire turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is played out by comparing Hunt Value totals between the attacker and defender.  The defender will reveal cards from their Ambush Point and/or their hand, to generate Hunt points.  If the attacker wins they invade their targets territory and steal any card from their Hoard.  If the defender wins, they are chased off and gain an Affliction card to their discard pile.<br/><br/>",

This version is significantly different from the original: it changes the encounter mix around, adds a deck of treasure clue cards, and expands the character selection with a dwarf and a &quot;hairfoot.&quot; The nice Darlene Pekul map painting is traded in for a hexmap with generic terrain symbols that Wham suggests you mount to cardboard and cut apart, thus creating a new map each game a la Kings &amp; Things. The cards force characters to move a lot more, and most encounters can no longer be given away, so this edition plays quite differently.<br/><br/><br/>For a complete list of Dragon Magazine games, check out this wiki:<br/>Dragon Magazine<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Millennia ago, Humans found their way into the Swamps of Jargono and became trapped there. It is unknown exactly how or when this occurred, but they have spent generation upon generation creating a primitive culture and civilization in a hostile and deadly world. Hunted and enslaved by the ruthless Serpentmen tribes that call Jargono their home, the Native Humans have adapted to become fierce tribal warriors and hunters. Everyday is a struggle for survival against the carnivorous plants and beasts that roam the swamps.<br/>On occasion, one of these Jargono Native warriors will leave their village and their tribe to go on a Pa&rsquo;kiarri or Warrior&rsquo;s Quest, passing through one of the magical gateways into another world and a new life of adventure.<br/><br/>As a predominantly hand-to-hand Class, the Jargono Tribal Native is a fearsome warrior that specializes in close quarters movement and combat. Their Hunter&rsquo;s Reflexes give them an advantage when fighting off an Ambush or a pack of Beasts, while their Primitive nature prevents them from using Technology, Guns, or reading Books. As an OtherWorld Native of Jargono, they do not begin with a normal Personal Item, but rather a Jargono Personal Item. They also have the option to start their adventuring career with a Swamp Fungus Token in their Side Bag, rather than the normal Bandages, Whiskey, or Dynamite.<br/><br/>Includes Male and Female Jargono Native miniatures in high-detail resin, two 30mm plastic bases, Jargono Native Double-Sided Hero Character Sheet, Rulesheet, Jargono Native Upgrade Chart, Starting Upgrade Cards, and Starting Gear.<br/><br/>",

If, on your turn, you don't want to take the card that's currently in the center, you can put the pig chip from your supply on the card.<br/><br/>This will have the following effects:<br/><br/>     You're not taking part in the remaining negotiations about this card, meaning that the next time it would be your turn to take the card or pay a chip, you're skipped.  You play along normally once the next card is up.<br/>     When another player takes the card, which by now has one or more pigs on it, they put these pigs in front of themselves next to their face-up cards.  The pigs don't go into the player's supply, so they can't use them again.<br/><br/><br/>Note: If all players place their pigs on the same card, that card and all the pigs are removed from the game.  Turn over the next card.  The last player who put a pig on the previous card goes first on the next one.<br/><br/>Each pig is worth a plus point at the end, regardless of whether you've received another player's pig together with a card or haven't used your own pig and still have it in your supply.<br/><br/>",

If you place a column on a ruin area, then the units in these ruins benefit from the ruin rules and thus gain a +1 bonus against melee attacks.

If you manage to fulfill the list you've been given, you create a Philosopher's Stone, the game ends, and you earn additional points.<br/><br/>Potion-Making: Guild Of Alchemists also includes new formulas, spells and rules, and while you need the base game in order to play, the Practice and Guild Of Alchemists remain separate. Each turn now consists of three phases in which you can draw cards from either deck and play them as elements or formulas, therefore giving you new opportunities to carry out your strategy and invent ingenious combinations.<br/><br/>&quot;Elementary granum&quot;, a new element in the expansion, can be used as any element when creating a formula, then can replace any other element. The expansion also includes &quot;Elixir of Omnitude&quot;, which can replace any simple (two-component) elixir &ndash; but if someone takes your completed formula made with this Elixir or with Elementary granum, you won't score half the points in compensation. Yes, there are benefits for paying for everything.<br/><br/>The expansion Potion-Making: University Course can also be &quot;combined&quot; with Guild Of Alchemists, which means three separate decks would be in play.<br/><br/>",

One card from a deck of 20 is placed face-up next to each space. Whenever a player goes to one of these spaces with a buyer, he takes the card, and executes the action shown on the card: acquire 4-6 gold, buy one tower tile of the depicted type (top, middle or bottom), earn two prestige points, or choose one buyer from the deck. At the end of each year, each location receives a new card (in addition to the ones still there).<br/><br/>In the advanced game, one of the spaces in the &quot;House of the Lighted Windows&quot; is marked with a treasure chest marker as well, and also receives cards with bonus actions. In addition, four cards are added to the deck which force a player to buy a lighted window at a cost of four gold when he visits the space.<br/><br/>",

And where once there was peace amongst the Great Clans, there is now conflict. Though mending this wound in the world is of the utmost importance, a monumental edict from Hantei XXXVIII will once again shift the course of history, and it will fall to the children of the empire to find a peaceful way forward for the Emerald Empire.<br/><br/>Children of the Empire is a premium expansion for Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game, with this being a new level of product that features 234 cards (three copies each of 76 cards and one copy each of six cards), a number comparable to the Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game Core Set. Unlike previous expansions, premium expansions are not tied to a specific clan, nor do they form part of a cycle; instead, these expansions focus on developing specific themes and mechanisms, rewarding every clan with a wealth of new cards in a single expansion!<br/><br/>In Children of the Empire, you'll find a celebration of the tranquility brought to Rokugan by the Hantei Dynasty. Every Great Clan gets new tools, with themes of dueling and honor persistent throughout the expansion. Children of the Empire also provides a snapshot of characters and events in the Legend of the Five Rings story as they stand today. Look for cards that represent some of the biggest moments from Legend of the Five Rings fiction, and an updated version of an iconic character whose role in the celestial order has shifted!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then:<br/><br/><br/>    If the terrain card is unoccupied, remove it from play and place the tree or fountain in this space.<br/>    If the terrain card shows an owl, remove it from play, place the tree or fountain in this space, then draw two cards from the defender deck.<br/>    If the terrain card shows a swallower, remove it from play along with the tree or fountain that you were going to place; you receive no compensation. (If the removed card was a fountain, draw one card from the defender deck as if the fountain were defeated in battle.)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This new map represents the planet of Shaggai, annihilated centuries ago. It is, of course, the original home of the Insects from Shaggai (who made their appearance in Onslaught Two). In those days, the horrendous hellworld Ghroth wandered too near Shaggai, and initiated the process that resulted in Shaggai&rsquo;s complete destruction. The map of course is set during the time of Shaggai&rsquo;s eradication, which is represented by the Worms of Ghroth &ndash; horrendous tools of woe which spread across the surface, leaving oblivion in their wake.<br/><br/>The map is divided into hex-shaped areas, representing the insectile nature of the world&rsquo;s native inhabitants. Some are oceans, other land, and the game starts with a single Worm of Ghroth &ndash; a harbinger of ruin.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, each Doom phase existing Worms of Ghroth tend to annihilate the areas they are on, and new Worms are spawned. Eradicated areas actually generate power, and can even benefit the players. For example, if your controlled gate gets eradicated, you earn an Elder Sign. For each unit that is eradicated, you earn 1 Power. The Power gain may not be enough to make up for losing a big monster or Great Old One, but at least it helps.<br/><br/>And, after all, the destruction has been telegraphed by the presence of a Worm &ndash; so you had your chance to escape!<br/><br/>The Shaggai map has other fun elements. For example, you can &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; Eradicated areas, and thus access the map more easily. This does cost a unit though, so be sure to include someone cheap to sacrifice to the hungry void. Also, if the map deteriorates too far, the game can end regardless of whether anyone has 30 Doom yet. In such a case, all players add up their Doom and Elder Signs and see who is victorious.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The Worm of Ghroth sculpt is credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Common Action cards are activated by any player, Common Special cards and Module cards operate in favor of each player. Any player can use Common Shortcut cards, while Common Traps damage each player.<br/><br/>Common cards are meant to diversify the gameplay, and their use significantly changes the situation in the sector from the very beginning of the game, forcing players to change their usual strategies. These cards are designed for experienced players who already know the game well and want to try something different and more challenging.<br/><br/>When players want to use the Common cards, they should shuffle them, draw one or two and place them in any of the 3 Common sectors (not the Faction sectors) in the game. It's up to the players to decide how many cards they use and where to place them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>PL:Tych 10 kart dodawanych było do egzemplarzy Tezeusza zamawianych w przedsprzedaży bezpośrednio z Portal Games.<br/><br/>Karty Stacji Kosmicznej są kartami Wsp&oacute;lnymi.<br/><br/>Karty Wsp&oacute;lne nie przynależą do żadnej frakcji.

Karty te zostały stworzone z myślą o graczach, kt&oacute;rzy poznali już grę na wylot i chcą ją urozmaicić i dodatkowo odświeżyć.<br/><br/>Jeśli gracze chcą użyć kart Wsp&oacute;lnych, tasują talię kart Wsp&oacute;lnych, losują jedną lub dwie z nich i kładą w dowolnym (dowolnych) z trzech sektor&oacute;w uniwersalnych (nie należących do nikogo).<br/><br/>",

Philip V of Macedon built a fleet of 200 lemboi ships, and was ready to sail to Italy, following in the footsteps of Pyrrhus. This didn&rsquo;t happen, as Rome reacted quickly with a sea blockade and inciting war in Greece, binding Philip&rsquo;s hands. But this provided an opportunity for serious reinforcements for Hannibal in Italy. We had to have this as a variant! Sun of Macedon brings you a new general for the Carthaginian player and two new strategy cards, which focus on stealth movement.<br/><br/>Desert March: Move an army of up to 5CU between Zuccabar or Icosium and Gades. Roll for Attrition prior to arrival. Hannibal&rsquo;s father Hamilcar has reached Gades overland from Carthage. Such a successful journey across hostile territory might have actually been an inspiration for Hannibal for his march over the Alps. The card allows a small army to follow Hamilcar&rsquo;s footsteps.<br/><br/>Hidden Cove: Move an army of up to 5CU to or from Genua as if it was a port. This move is successful unless countered by a card. As we know, not every existing harbour is shown as a port in the game. And there is a good reason for that: some of them were not capable of receiving large armies. Some of them were not shown as a game design decision. Genua, however, was used twice in very specific circumstances. Mago arrived there with reinforcements and then, after few years of fighting, most probably evacuated through the same port when things become too hot to handle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dynasties you&rsquo;ll be allying yourself with your Nation's most prominent families, using their skills to make your Civilisation even more powerful. There are 6 Dynasties, which each great family being associated with one of Dominations' Knowledge Domains.<br/><br/>Each Age, you will be playing Dynasty cards. Each one of these cards represents a family member of a particular Dynasty &ndash; an individual of great prowess who will lend you their aid in leading your nation to glory! These cards set off powerful effects that can generate resources, victory points, (sometimes both!) as well as other effects that give you a big boost during your turns. Additionally, the order in which you play these cards over the course of the game is important, as it represents the Dynasty that will be leading your people through the Ages and you gain extra points by collecting sets!<br/><br/>When playing with Dynasties, you&rsquo;ll be drawing Dynasty cards at the start of each Age and drafting them. There&rsquo;s a deck of cards for each Age: I, II and III, each with exponentially greater abilities. Each player draws 4 cards and chooses one before passing the remaining cards to the player on their left. They then take the three cards from the player on their right and choose another card to keep. This is repeated one last time so that all players have 3 Dynasty cards in hand. All unused cards are then returned to the box.<br/><br/>",

Indeed, it provides a method of creating a free company made up of fighters from the four corners of Aarklash to amass glory and riches. The rules on alliances must nevertheless be respected.<br/><br/>This new gaming mode is based on the idea that the battles they wage have consequences on the soldiers and that these consequences cause an evolution of those they affect. Unlike the old Incarnation system, which was focused on a Character, it gives you the opportunity to unite different fighters, to personalize them and to let them evolve freely from one exciting skirmish scenario to the next. This new gaming mode makes the fun of a good game of Confrontation last well beyond each battle by involving recruiting, improving characteristics, abilities and equipment, managing the wounded and the fighters&rsquo; resources, etc.<br/><br/>The young free companies will need new challenges. That&rsquo;s why this first extension provides enhanced rules on fortifications and scenery, as well as the revision of those on nexuses (see Cry Havoc, vol. 01).<br/><br/>And this extension has many other surprises in store&hellip;<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Confrontation<br/><br/><br/>",

When the sacred chickens refused to eat, Claudius threw them into the sea, saying &quot;Since they do not wish to eat, let them drink!&quot; He didn&rsquo;t listen to the Gods, and was punished by them seriously. Yes, in ancient times, war was a religious act - one of the most important events in a man&rsquo;s life. The religious ceremonials were bloody and drastic. That is why we wanted to have a variant showing the importance of these sacred rituals. So, we have added to the HAMILCAR game a new Roman leader and two new strategy cards based on Pulcher's disaster.<br/><br/>Bad Omen: Play prior to Battle. Rome&rsquo;s General Battle Rating is decreased by 1. This can be cancelled by an immediate Attrition Roll. This event has been inspired by two similar events. Caius Flaminius did not properly carry out the rituals after becoming a Consul and pressed for a battle, known later as Battle of Trasimene Lake. Claudius Pulcher had disregarded a bad omen prior to the battle and lost at Drepana.<br/><br/>Price of Failure: Play after a victorious Battle. The opposing player must either immediately remove his commanding General from the map or a number of PCs equal to his Battle Rating. Carthaginian leaders Hannibal Gisgo and Hamilcar (the other Hamilcar, not Hamilcar Barca) were removed from command after losing engagements. Well, not only removed from command but also crucified. Carthage didn&rsquo;t have much sympathy for losers. Also Pulcher faced charges and was never again offered an office.<br/><br/>",

The last one only browsed for ages. A large order now might set you up nicely for the rest of the day...<br/><br/>Tussie Mussie: Flower Shoppe Customers expands on the solo play of Tussie Mussie: Flower Shoppe with 6 new cards. Mike Mullins (Bottom of the 9th, Pentaquark) did such a fantastic job capturing the feel of the multiplayer game when he designed the original Flower Shoppe that we knew we&rsquo;d want more of his work. Flower Shoppe built on the base game by using Turn cards which direct how cards must be dealt (and taken) while letting the player decide how they&rsquo;re actually assigned. It&rsquo;s a great solo mode, but it&rsquo;s still missing something that every Flower Shoppe should have: customers!<br/><br/>The new Customers expansion features 6 Customer cards, 2 of which are added to the deck between each round. Whenever a customer comes up, their unique ability will be resolved. Customers might reorganize the player&rsquo;s arrangement, replace claimed cards, let the player sneak a peek at the opponent&rsquo;s cards, or otherwise change the game. Not all of these abilities are helpful: sometimes the player will have to adjust on the fly. Just remember that the customer is always right!<br/><br/><br/>Contents: 6 Customer cards<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>    During setup, shuffle two random customer cards into the Turn deck.<br/>    If the first card revealed in any round is a customer, set it aside and resolve it after the<br/><br/><br/>first turn.<br/><br/>    All customers must be resolved unless the effect description includes the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.<br/>    If there are no valid targets for an effect, it is ignored.<br/>    After resolving a customer, it is removed from the game.<br/>    Between rounds, shuffle two new random customers into<br/><br/><br/>",

In addition, the deluxe version includes all of the stretch goals from the Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>From the description of Tiny Epic Mechs:<br/><br/>Tiny Epic Mechs is an arena-style player-vs-player action-programming game. It features ITEMeeples with plastic molded power armors and a Mech suit that the ITEMeeples actually go inside of.<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Mechs, players take on the roles of highly skilled and athletic Mech pilots. They compete in a free-for-all battle royale over the span of six rounds. In each round, players select four of eight available actions to program. These actions keep you moving around the arena while allowing you to deploy high-scoring defensive turrets, plant explosive land mines with hidden values, collect resources, purchase weaponry, and power up into your Power Armor or eventually the highly-sought-after Mech Suit. While each player has their own Power Armor, there is only one Mech Suit, reserved for the king of the hill.<br/><br/>Your programmed actions are played out one at a time around the table until all players have executed their four actions. When you cross paths with another player, combat ensues. During combat, players exchange fire until one player is out of ammo and must retreat, or they are defeated and forced to reset.<br/><br/>Combat is fast, and you can use each weapon only one time per fight, so the more weapons you have, the longer you'll last. Weapons are categorized into three types, and each type counters one of the other types. If you time your weapons correctly, you can counter your opponent and unleash a more powerful attack and gain an edge over them. Dealing a lot of damage to your opponent will wow the audience and earn you lots of points, which brings you closer to victory. You also score victory points every other round based on area control and who controls the Mech. At the end of the game, you also earn points for each weapon you own.<br/><br/>",

The fighting beneath Gibraltar reaches a feverish pitch as each side suffers horrendous casualties to gain a few feet only to lose them again the next day. Bodies, dead and undead, stack up like cordwood.  In desperation, the allies refit the US Lucky Seventh with even heavier weaponry and deploy the elite of elite: the MI-13 Commandos. British leaders pull the sentinel Zip Kelly, the HURRICANE out of combat operations against the Japanese Empire and send him into the meat grinder in a last-ditch attempt to break the deadlock. As they delve deeper into the bowels of the German abattoir, Hugo von X unleashes his deadliest weapons: the  Drohnes, and the dreaded Panzeraffes, against which nothing can stand.<br/><br/>The 64 page full color perfect bound SNAFU takes the game to the next level. It contains the following mayhem, madness, and badness:<br/><br/>- 19 new missions to add to the 7 infinitely replayable missions provided in the boxed game. These include solo play, expanded  two  player, and multi-player options. There are also  missions that utilize both sides of the board simultaneously...at last!<br/><br/>- Rules for a host of new (and old) models including MI-13, German SWD, and Lucky Seventh upgrades.<br/><br/>- Up to date FAQ<br/><br/>- Extraordinary model imagery<br/><br/>- Loads of new fictional bits, background, and character: all the grittiness and thematic triumph you've come to expect from the Grindhouse.<br/><br/>",

This campaign covers those critical days. The Campaign consists of seven new missions featuring a new Terrain Deck for the forests, fields, and villages of the Ardennes. The counter sheet includes a U.S. heavy machine gun platoon, Bangalore torpedoes, anti-tank mines, wire entanglements, German tanks, assault guns, Panzergrenadiers, and Volksgrenadiers.<br/><br/>We left the &ldquo;Manchus&rdquo; of World War Two in Fields of Fire: Volume I at the close of the Normandy Campaign. The 2nd Infantry Division was rapidly moved to join the assault on the port city of Brest, in Brittany. The city was captured after heavy fighting from August 21st to September 18th. By that time, the German resistance elsewhere in France had collapsed, and the 2nd Infantry Division raced to Paris, arriving on September 29th. The rapid advance ended on October 4th when the Division entered the region just east of St. Vith, Belgium called the Schnee Eifel on the highly symbolic German border. The 2nd Infantry Division relieved the 4th and 28th Infantry Divisions, completing the relief on October 5th. Ahead lay the German border, defended by the Siegfried Line cutting across difficult terrain.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Manchus&rdquo; were able to incorporate replacements and prepare for whatever would come next throughout October and November. This period saw frequent patrol activity but no major combat actions. On December 10th, the 2nd Infantry Division began a relief in place by the 106th Infantry Division. By the 11th, the relief was complete, and the Division gathered at Camp Elsenborn to prepare for the renewed offensive. The attack north through the Siegfried line would commence on December 13th.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Before, these tiles were just penalizing you if you placed them in the wrong direction, now Mrs Noreturn will actually reward you for each arrow in the right direction.<br/>- Mr Intheway gives points for a tile feature that was not exploited yet in the game: obstacles.<br/>- Mrs Camper likes the grass tiles, which will be perfect if you chose her with Mr Short, but will be more challenging with Mr Long.<br/>- Mr Perfect will satisfy perfectionist players, as he gives you points for each perfectly respected constraint (3 victory points for playability, 4 for the land constraint, 5 for the circuit constraint, and 6 for the par constraint).<br/><br/>-- Publisher description<br/><br/>",

So what is in the box?<br/><br/>The Spire of Zogar This is the final Adventure Pack for Iron Helm and pits you against the evil tyrant Zogar himself! It consists of 18 cards including new loot, plot, and enemy cards, and a new boss, Zogar himself!<br/><br/>The Lonely Troll Inn This 18 card pack unlocks the ability to hire henchmen before you set off on an adventure. Simply pay some gold and they will tag along. Each one will provide different perks and each will have unique ways that their morale will drop. If they lose all their morale, they will leave, unless you pay them some more money. The provided 12mm die is used to track your henchmen's morale. This pack also includes a bunch of new trappings to equip your hero with!<br/><br/>Beasts &amp; Burdens This 18 card pack introduces Afflictions! These nasty cards are gained in a number of ways and will cause the mechanics for play to change. Maybe you will suffer from gluttony and need to eat twice as much in between dungeon levels, or perhaps, you become plagued and start gaining poison at an alarming rate! This pack also includes a bunch of unique, and stronger, enemies to deal with and three mini-bosses that are actually plot cards!<br/><br/>Realms &amp; Relics So you want more powerful items in Iron Helm? Now you get them! Artifacts are powerful relics that you can gain by spending blessing tokens when you are asked to draw a loot card. Spend the required blessing tokens and draw an artifact card instead! That is only half of this pack. It also introduces environment cards. These are drawn at the beginning of each dungeon level and they change the mechanics for that level. Maybe you are on the Shadow level and you are ambushed whenever an ambush card is drawn, even if it is the first card drawn! Or maybe you are in the Parched and all fire creatures are stronger.<br/><br/>Random Encounters This includes four double-sided jumbo map cards to track what level of the dungeon you are on. Also included are three minis (Male Ranger, Female Warrior, and Male Wizard) to use to track your position. Random Encounters adds a new mechanic where your hero encounters something in between each level of the dungeon. Symbols on the map cards indicate what the player will run into. Maybe Bolda trap, or some mushrooms, or a nasty foe lurking in the shadows...<br/><br/>Card Dividers This is not the sexiest addition, but these new dividers will keep your copy of Iron Helm nice and organized and sometimes order is sexy...<br/><br/>",

The expansion also introduces a new mechanism &ndash; Enrage &ndash; offering players new tactics.<br/><br/>Aside from new units, Shattered Aegis presents three new game modes for even more variety, including advanced deck building and a four-player variant.<br/><br/>The Second Edition of Omen: A Reign of War, released in 2012, combines all of the content from the first edition base game and all of the content from the Shattered Aegis expansion.  Since this expansion is now included as part of the second edition game, it is no longer for sale by itself.<br/><br/>",

Something that the people of the village tried to forget for years, a demon who can enter people's dreams and twist them into horrible nightmares&hellip;<br/><br/>After the unexpected deaths of their friends, a group of young men and women realize that they must try to stop this demon. They need the help of someone who truly understand what they are facing &mdash; the Marshall, who long ago was the &quot;Predestined&quot; who defeated Camp Apache's maniac. But the Marshall disappeared, and they must get to Camp Apache to find him.<br/><br/>Soon, the boys and girls will find themselves trapped in a new nightmare, with two supernatural, homicidal entities to fight. Will the maniac stop the demon, or will they work together to slaughter their mortal enemies? Will the Marshall be able to stop the horror again? It's time to go back to Camp Apache!<br/><br/>With the Last Friday: Return to Camp Apache expansion, you can play Last Friday with up to seven players, with two of those players controlling the evil demon and maniac. The box includes two new chapters, a new opponent (the demon), new clue tokens, new board overlays to represent a raging fire in the camp, new equipment, five new characters, and two new special characters: the Marshall and the Witch.<br/><br/>The original Last Friday chapters may also be played with the new contents, as well as with the new &quot;Survival Horror&quot; game mode, with real-time constraints to make the game even more exciting.<br/><br/>",

Do you have what it takes to restore peace and civility to the good people of Penn-Scarr?<br/><br/>Lead Four New Heroes! Kapoka the Gladewalker Druid and the Salamander named Hrrath enter the fray, along with Thesilar the ranger and fighter Guraf<br/><br/>Invade the Orc Lair! Journey through the dank, subterranean habitat of the green-skins as you hunt down the menace bringing terror to the land<br/><br/>Vanquish the Horde! Wade through legions of Orcs, Goblins, Mawbeasts and other beings of brutal ferocity in a visceral fight for survival<br/><br/>Confront Thrundak Skullsplitter! Renowned even among his own kin for his extreme cruelty, this furiously violent Orc leaves nothing but rivers of blood in his wake.<br/><br/>Show the savages no mercy.<br/><br/>In the base Dungeon Saga one player takes the part of the evil dungeon overlord with the forces of evil at his command, and the others divide the mighty heroes between them. Each hero has strengths and weaknesses and teamwork is the key: The mighty barbarian can slaughter many foes at a time, yet he is lightly armoured and vulnerable to strong enemies. The Dwarf, on the other hand, is steadier as his thick armour can resist most attacks. The Elf is not as skilled a fighter as either of these, instead preferring to stay at a distance where her finely-honed archery skills can best be used. Finally, there is the wizard -the others may laugh at his lack of fighting skill, yet it is often his magic that carries the day. If the others can keep him alive, that is.<br/><br/>",

The expansion will have just that. Extra Evil. Hellevators, make-up kits and the legendary Wine of Drunkenness. Extra Sin.

        "description": "Kickstarter Exclusive set of 6 original Survivors designed by the great Karl Kopinski and sculpted by Patrick Masson, including their figures and ID cards.<br/><br/>Ever since the St Stilton orphanage was burned down during a riot, there has been an Orphans Gang formed by the abandoned survivors of that incident. The gang roams the galaxy, staying out of the way of the authorities and carving out a living by scrounging, scamming, or whatever else works. The Orphans Gang is always ready to welcome new members, as it's also used to losing members to tragedies such as prison, death, or becoming an adult. Perhaps in a remote mining outpost they can lay low quietly for a while.<br/><br/>All members of the Orphans Gang share the same trait, common to street urchins: it's impossible to hold them down. As such they all have the Unstoppable skill as a bonus, allowing them to slip by mobs of Xenos (or burst through them, in the case of Goliath).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Created by renowned game designer Reiner Knizia, Ingenious Challenges contains three games of mental dexterity for 2-4 players. Retaining the spirit of its predecessor board game Ingenious, the games in Ingenious Challenges challenge players to score as many points as possible in each color/symbol while also forcing them to score points in all colors/symbols in order to do well. Four scoreboards with colored pegs and tracks for each color are used in each game, while the dice, cards and single-symbol tiles are used separately in their particular games.<br/><br/>&bull; In the Card Challenge (published separately as Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel), a player receives a hand of six cards, with one card placed face-up in front of him. On a turn, he plays one of his hand cards and scores as many points for each symbol on the played card as there are symbols lying in front of all players. These points are marked in the matching color track on a player's individual scoring board, and the first player to have seven or more points in all colors wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.<br/><br/>&bull; In the Dice Challenge (Einfach Genial: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel), players roll dice up to three times, then score as many points for each symbol on the rolled dice as there are symbols on the dice in front of the other players. Players record these points on their scoring boards, with the barriers causing hiccups on the way, and the first player to move all colors to seven points wins.<br/><br/>&bull; In the Tile Challenge (Einfach Genial: Wer zu viel riskiert, verliert!), all 126 tiles (21 of each color/symbol) are shuffled face down, then three are placed face up in a shared pool. On a turn, a player reveals a tile. If the tile doesn't match one in the pool, he adds all tiles revealed this turn to the pool and ends his turn; if it does match, the player can collect all tiles revealed this turn and all matching tiles in the pool, or take another turn. If you're the first player to collect seven tiles of each color, you win. If a player has a single color with fewer tiles in it than all other colors and a tile of that color is in the pool, the player can take one such tile and end his turn; this rule allows players to work toward that final color they need, while also pushing other players to try to remove that color from the pool.<br/><br/>Incorporates:<br/><br/>    Einfach Genial: Das Kartenspiel<br/>    Einfach Genial: Das Würfelspiel<br/>    Simply Ingenious <br/><br/><br/>",

Rules are provided to link all the games together seamlessly and add units for neutral and minor powers in Europe.  Further, rules are provided so that simulate the political history and allow for the possibility that non-historical outcomes occur with respect to how minor powers react to the events of WWII.  Part of the EuroFront series.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system.  While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their games are based on the block system.  Basically this means that rather than using the traditional  counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side.  This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength.  Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number.  Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides.  Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide.  With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Abominarat<br/><br/>Rats are long-time friends and enemies of mankind. We should have imitated them as they flew in a panicked manner when the zombie plague began, as if they instinctively knew Death was in the air. For a few weeks, we got rid of rats and didn't have to fear them to steal our food or worse, to bite us. The respite could soon be over, though, as some rats got infected and turned into giant monstrosities.<br/><br/>The Abomniarats lurk around tunnels, floors and ceiling, laying ambushes to catch the unwary off-guard. I don't know what scares me the most: their nasty fangs, the nightmarish diseases they carry, or the way they lurk around, remaining unseen despite their size... and stench!<br/><br/>Doctor Stormcrow<br/>&quot;A most remarkable infection.&quot;<br/><br/>Doctor Stormcrow is in this fight for the research. An expert on every form of infectious disease existant, the sheer virulence of the zombie plague staggers him with its sordid beauty. he's convinced that while magic is at the core of the initial outbreak, the subsequent spreading infection has wholly natural elements. He cites the Creeping Death and the Bloody Flux as his sources (which have slain untold hundreds of thousands when left unchecked), in addition to the complete lack of magical emanations seen in most mobile zombies. If he can prove his theorems (and develop a cure), perhaps the necromancers can be deprived of their seemingly limitless hordes.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>The one thing that Down in Flames series players are always looking for is additional aircraft for their favorite game series. So we have decided to satisfy that desire with our first C3i-DiF Squadron aircraft pack. This pack consists of 64 fighter aircraft cards, printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years. Most of the aircraft cards are NEW aircraft types, although we have included a few reprints (with corrected ratings) of aircraft that have appeared previously in one or more of the DiF Series games.<br/><br/>Included are such important aircraft as the British Typhoon and Tempest, the German Bf-109G-6/R6 and Fw-190F and the American P-63A Kingcobra (which was used extensively in combat by the Soviet air force). The pack also contains a number of more obscure but interesting aircraft, like the Rumanian IAR 80, the German TA-152H and the Polish PzL 24, the only fighter in the Greek inventory at the time of the Italian invasion in 1941. Speaking of the Italians, there are a number of Mussolini's fighters in the pack as well, including the Cr42 Falco, the M.C. 202 Folgore and the G.50bis Freccia. All of these planes are done in the upgraded graphic style of Corsairs and Hellcats, courtesy of Dave Lawrence, Martin Scott and Rodger MacGowan.<br/><br/>The package is wrapped in a ziplock format with an 11&quot; x 17&quot; (folded) cover/rulesbook. The front cover is graced with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous DiF Series style artwork, while the inside will contain the rules necessary to use the aircraft in DiF dogfights. Some of the rules will be reprints from Zero!: The Rise and Fall of The Imperial Japanese Air Force Dec 1941 - June 1942 and Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who only own the European Theatre DiF series volumes (Rise of the Luftwaffe and Eighth Air Force). There will also be a few new rules. For example, ace researcher Chris Janiec has come up with a way of modeling aircraft carrying a single, large caliber cannon, such as the P-39.<br/><br/>If this first C3i-DiF Squadron Pack proves to be popular, we're planning a series of these expansion packs. This is your chance to expand your Down in Flames series air force and add new aircraft cards at a very low price. Enjoy the games!<br/><br/>",

With the Prussians realizing they have already been out maneuvered, their army is desperately trying to re-position itself while the French attempt to encircle and destroy them. Can the Prussian rear guard under Hohenlohe hold off Napoleon's Grand Arm&eacute;e long enough at Jean to allow Brunswick's main body to crush Davout's lone French corps under which blocks their path to safety, or will the &quot;Iron Marshal's&quot; veteran 3rd Corps stand firm against three times their numbers and seal the Prussian's doom? The fate of two great empires is yours to decide.<br/><br/>Fought in some of the most severe weather conditions imaginable, the confused and indecisive battle of Eylau 20! (February, 1807) stands as a testament to the misery and horror of warfare. In the dead of winter, Russian General Levin August von Bennigsen halted his exhausted army at a small deserted crossroads village and prepared to give battle. For two days, in sub-zero temperatures with heavy snow falling almost continuously, Napoleon's troops battered themselves against the unyielding Russian lines to little avail. Is the historical bloody and inconclusive draw the most likely outcome, or can you do better than the actual commanders and manage to eke out a victory in the terrible &quot;Battle in a Blizzard?&quot;<br/><br/>",

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams! You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion! In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner.<br/><br/>But wait! It must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn't be proud, but your grandparents, on your mother's side, would be delighted.&quot;<br/><br/>In Dominion, each player starts with an identical, very small deck of cards. In the center of the table is a selection of other cards the players can &quot;buy&quot; as they can afford them. Through their selection of cards to buy, and how they play their hands as they draw them, the players construct their deck on the fly, striving for the most efficient path to the precious victory points by game end.<br/><br/>Dominion is not a CCG, but the play of the game is similar to the construction and play of a CCG deck. The game comes with 500 cards. You select 10 of the 25 Kingdom card types to include in any given play &mdash; leading to immense variety.<br/><br/>Dominion: Special Edition includes the Dominion base game &mdash; with the coin cards bearing new artwork first seen in the Dominion Base Cards accessory &mdash; as well as the &quot;Black Market&quot; card originally released as a promotional item.<br/><br/>Part of the Dominion series.<br/><br/>",

Etna which the British required, intact, to continue their drive along the coast. They dropped airborne elements to seize the bridge and wait for their ground forces to arrive. The problem was the Germans also realized the importance of the bridge, and landed their own Fallschirmjaegers nearby to hold the bridge and reinforce the Axis units in the area. With both sides having crack troops on hand the battle was fierce with the British nearly collapsing when their ground troops finally came to their rescue.<br/><br/>Contents include a full color 20.5&quot; x 30&quot; map, 20 pages of campaign specific rules (Z39-Z58), 3 campaign games, and 3 scenarios (J95, J96, J97).<br/><br/>",

During all his life, Axl has worked in one of the many orbital factories connected in the Human Edge System. Not long ago, his employers organized an illegal Aristeia! competition and Axl shined so much that they automatically decided to make him an AGL star.<br/><br/>Hippolyta&rsquo;s character was created in close collaboration with Manu aka Kelthret, the first season AGL champion. He earned the right to participate in the design of an Aristeia! character. Manu shared with us his passion for the Infinity Myrmidons and suggested a Myrmidon Officer as a starting point. The result is a spectacular leader support, both in design and game profile.<br/><br/>In addition to including the two pre-assembled plastic miniatures with the highest quality Corvus Belli seal, this Aristeia! expansion incorporates the 2 character cards, the 2 initiative cards, 8 tactical cards and the necessary markers to play this expansion. A total of 42 cards in each box, since a copy is incorporated in each of the game's languages: Spanish, English, German and French.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an official mini expansion from the author of Coloretto. It introduces limit cards that limit the number of cards in a scoring group.  Each Limit Card contains two numbers.  The top number indicates the number of scoring groups that score positive points, and the bottom number indicates the maximum number of cards in a scoring group.  So, for example, a Limit Card with the numbers 5 and 3 mean that players are optimally trying to collect five scoring groups with three cards each.<br/><br/>It was released as a promo on BoardGameGeek in March of 2012 in an edition that matches the card quality of the base Coloretto game.  This edition includes rules in both English and German.<br/><br/>It can be also be downloaded for free at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.zooloretto.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.zooloretto.com</a><br/><br/>Home Page &amp; Newsletter:<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.zooloretto.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.zooloretto.com</a> <br/><br/><br/>(German, english, dutch, hungarian, spanish, swedish)<br/><br/>",

He served his stint as a noob trainee, spending more time carrying coffee than programming, just to become a Useless Probationer (with a right to make photocopies).  After three difficult years, he finally got a fulltime job and his own noob trainee.  Only his passion for videogames- and above all, zombie videogames- gave him the will to endure this.  Now that zombies have come for real, everything is perfect.  Except for his noob teammates (who often refuse to share the interesting rare drops).  But Will knows he can train them to the top tier!<br/><br/>Will is an optional promotional survivor available to those that raise an extra amount on their pledge for the Zombicide Season Two Kickstarter campaign. A zombie version (Zombivor) and an ultrared weapon card will also be included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nightmare Decks for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game allow players to revisit their favorite scenarios cast in the shadows of the game's challenging Nightmare Mode. Featuring deadlier enemies, darker locations, and more terrifying surprises, each Nightmare Deck introduces new, alternate encounter cards and instructions for using them to reshape a scenario's encounter deck. The result? A nightmarish journey through territory players thought they knew, but with new twists and turns that will have them on the edges of their seats!<br/><br/>Each Nightmare Deck comes with twenty new encounter cards to add to the matching original quest, as well as a Nightmare Mode card that explains which older cards are removed from the original set-up and a card providing additional game rules.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks first appeared in FFG's &quot;Game Night Kits&quot;, which are available to retail outlets, and were later released as print-on-demand items.<br/><br/>",

It provides an eastern map extension of Russia so that a complete picture of the strategic possibilities during WWII in Germany's fight with the Soviet Union.  It also comes with an additional EastFront rulebook and a set of new scenarios that utilize the map extension directly.  EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45 is required to play with the VolgaFront map.  VolgaFront is also part of the EuroFront series.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets for each of their games none the less all of their games are based on block system. Basically this means that rather than the traditional use of counters to represent units on the map the game instead uses wooden blocks that stand upright and with unit details only shown on one side of the blocks. This does two things: First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is and it&rsquo;s current strength. Second, by having the blocks stand on end it provides a way to keep track of a units strength by rotating the block so the current strength is the top number. Most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength. Counters normally have at most two steps because of they only have two sides, however blocks have four and so now you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding further complex layers of bookkeeping and thus allow for interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>EastFront: The War in Russia 1941-45 – Second Edition includes most of the VolgaFront map (but not scenarios).<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    EastFront: The War in Russia, 1941-45<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    EuroFront: War in Europe, 1939-45<br/><br/><br/>",

When the fifth one has been defeated, the five castles merge to become one final titanic challenge. The card backs of the Super-Villains each form a portion of the giant merged castle, with The Joker's head at the top.<br/><br/>Each Super-Villain has colors on its four sides matching the main card types: Hero, Villain, Super Power, and Equipment. During your turn, if there is a card matching one of those types in the Line-Up, you must take the card and place it next to the corresponding side of the Super-Villain. When you defeat a Super-Villain, instead of placing it in your deck, you earn each card attached to it.<br/><br/>The new keyword &quot;Ninjutsu&quot; provides the heroes some much-needed help as they take on the fearful might of the combined Super-Villains' super castle!<br/><br/>",

Also, a legendary animal has its power activated when it is eaten.<br/><br/>The legendary animals are unique in two ways:<br/><br/><br/>     First, they start hidden. A legendary animal cannot be eaten until it is face-up. When an animal is eaten orthogonally adjacent to a legendary animal, then it is flipped face-up. It can then be eaten.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Second, a legendary animal has its power activated when it is eaten. It does not have a special ability that activates when it eats. The animal that eats the legendary animal will also have its effect active, and you must fulfill both effects.<br/><br/><br/>In addition, some of the numbers included in this expansion already exist in the base game. Animals of the same number cannot eat one another, unless they have an ability that allows them to do so.<br/><br/>",

They are mystic warriors, arising from the Jade Kingdom, a realm in which all surviving otherworldly creatures found shelter, after humans began killing and hunting them. The Sentinels still protect the earth whenever Oni walk it. So they return through their jade portals. Possessed with the magic of ancient times, like the Kami had, they can hide in plain sight. Their jade armor hides them, when a mortal is looking at them.<br/><br/>As Oni appeared in several times during earth's history, the Sentinels adapted to these times. Although they are ancient warriors, some use modern technology while others stay traditional. But in the end, they are here to save the earth - but not the humans anymore. They walk between both worlds, the protectors of two realms.<br/><br/>Playstyle:<br/><br/>The Sentinels are the first game changer faction for Tsukuyumi. They modify the game dramatically, as they have a special winning condition: If there are no more Oni on the board, they immediately win - both, if they killed the last Oni or any other player did. In this case, no score points are counted. If they are not able to kill all Oni before the end of the game, they are awarded score points for killing Oni units.<br/><br/>Instead of placing a homezone, they place six portal markers next to which they are allowed to place new units. Sentinel units are even allowed to move from one area with a portal to another of its kind for only one movement point.<br/><br/>Any unit has at least one exact copy in play, representing its camouflage. Both standees can be moved separately and are treated as real. Only in battle, the player has to decide which of both standees is the real unit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Building off of Mark Herman and Volko Runke&rsquo;s legendary game Fire in the Lake, the Sovereign of Discord Expansion provides a prequel to the events depicted in the base game, covering the years 1961-1963. The expansion allows players to see how the war escalated from an insurgency between ARVN and Viet Cong, assisted by the US and North Vietnam, to the eventual conventional interventions by North Vietnam and the United States at the start of the base game. New scenarios allow players to extend the game backward to 1961 right after the formation of the Viet Cong, or to 1963 during the tumultuous last year of the Diem regime. Players owning both expansions, Sovereign of Discord and Fall of Saigon, will be able to experience the full Indochina War from 1961 to 1975. This allows players to see how the war evolved from the lower intensity insurgency of the Diem period all the way to the massive conventional offensives of the last years of the war. A copy of Fire in the Lake will be necessary to play the Sovereign of Discord expansion.<br/><br/>New mechanics are introduced to reflect the war prior to escalation by the US and North Vietnam and the unique aspects of the Diem Regime:<br/><br/>     1961 and 1963 Scenarios with a Fall of Diem Sequence allow players to continue play into the Fire in the Lake Campaign Scenario (1964-1972), or even through to Fall of Saigon (1973-1975) if players also possess the sequel expansion.<br/>     New ARVN Strategic Hamlet pieces and mechanics reflect the Diem regime&rsquo;s strategy of relocating the population into fortified villages.<br/>     Hanoi and Washington Tracks control the number of available pieces and some abilities of the Viet Cong and ARVN factions. In addition, rather than possessing Troops, the US and NVA each use Advisor pieces, which allow them to enhance and control the units of their South Vietnamese allies.<br/>     A Regime Stability Track affects the cost of ARVN Operations to model the rising urban instability and coup plotting against the Ngo Dinh Diem regime.<br/>     A head-to-head 2 player scenario uses the Initiative system from Brian Train&rsquo;s Colonial Twilight for players wanting to focus on the internal clash between the Viet Cong and ARVN, and might also be suitable as an introductory scenario for players new to Fire in the Lake.<br/>     72 new Events cover the 1961-1963 period, and four new Pivotal Events represent debates in Washington and Hanoi over their level of aid, the Strategic Hamlet Program by the Diem regime, and the major summer offensive by the Viet Cong. In addition, a new ARVN leader Card, Ngo Dinh Diem, is in play throughout the early 1960s scenarios and new Coup! Events reflect threats to Diem&rsquo;s hold on power.<br/>     A solitaire system using the card-based Non-player system, similar to those provided with the Tr&rsquo;ung Bot Update Pack and Fall of Saigon. <br/><br/><br/>Fire in the Lake Bonus Content<br/>In addition to extending Fire in the Lake back to the early 1960s, Sovereign of Discord also includes additional bonus content for the base game: <br/><br/>     40 new Events (8 new 1964 Events, 16 new 1965 Events, 16 new 1968 Events) covering themes such as women&rsquo;s role in the war, civilian victimization, the effect of the war on South Vietnamese society, North Vietnamese strategies, and the 1964 escalation debate. Among the new Events is also one new Capability Event for each faction.<br/>     Two new short scenarios:<br/>         Turning Point (1967 to 1969), covering the period of fiercest offensives by both communist and allied forces to win control of the countryside.<br/>         Long 1964 (Mid 1963 to Early 1965), covering the period that historian Frederick Logevall refers to as the &ldquo;long 1964,&rdquo; representing the crucial escalation debates in North Vietnam and the United States.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There's an epic battle of wits being slyly waged among you and your roommates. No one speaks of it, or even acknowledges its existence, but when it comes to taking out the garbage, it's all about the art of the dodge. In the pursuit of avoidance, each dexterously stacked banana peel represents a small victory. That candy wrapper hidden in the deep recesses of your room is a silent success. But the greenish milk carton you secretly stashed under your roommate's bed, that was a stroke of genius! That is, until you get caught making a mess while everyone else pretends they would never be so childish &mdash; as to get caught. Be careful and be cunning because only the champion can gloat in a hammock while everyone else lugs out the trash on garbage day.<br/><br/>In Garbage Day, players take turns stacking garbage cards one at a time onto the overflowing garbage can, or stashing garbage cards in their rooms. But once a player's room gets too full, they must clean it by stacking all the cards from that room on top of the garbage can, very carefully, one by one. If garbage cards fall off the garbage can during your turn, place them in your overflow pile. If your overflow pile gets too big, you're eliminated from the game. If all other players have been eliminated, you win!<br/><br/>Garbage Day (Limited Edition) comes in a silver can and includes the Garbage Day: Smelly Expansion (21 cards).<br/><br/>",

This deck is not mixed with the deck of the base game, Potion-Making: Practice, but rather placed next to it. Each of your turns will now consist of three phases in which you can take cards from either deck and play them. For example, you can draw two cards and make a potion, or you can place a card on the table as an element and use this element for a new potion immediately. Thanks to the new rules, it's possible to make different sophisticated combinations.<br/><br/>Four &quot;Lesser Talismans&quot; give players certain bonuses; for example, the Lesser Talisman of Usefulness gives you 1 point for any card you play as an element, even if the desk already holds that element. The special artifact &quot;Scruple of Conscience&quot; can be passed to any player who has more points than you; he must add the card to his hand and lose 5 points &ndash; but be careful as this card can boomerang back to you. The new &quot;Haste&quot; spell let you play two cards in a row, while &quot;Magic Vortex&quot; places all ingredient cards of all completed formulas on the desk of elements.

Yes, those zombies are gnashing and gnawing at The King's hairy ankles, and scratching at Cyber Bunny's metallic legs. (Even the Kraken will be chewed on, believe it or not! He's chewy, and tastes fishy...)<br/><br/>Sure, the zombies are tiny compared to the giant monsters, but the zombies won't stop, and they are incredibly hungry! Someone told them how delicious Kaiju brains are, and now the zombie horde won't be satiated until they get to taste some. (That's an Alistair word, satiated. Blimey!)<br/><br/>Oh. Yeah. Sorry. I got carried away there.<br/><br/>So, you buy this card, and at the end of your turn, every turn, you either pay one energy cube, or the zombie horde bites every monster - including yours - and does one point of damage. If, however, you pay the energy cube, the zombies are mesmerized by the pretty glowing ball of energy, and forget to bite anybody - including you.<br/><br/>We think that this card is a lot of fun to play with, and will add a certain classiness to any King of Tokyo game. And, as we used to say back in my table top role-playing group, there is no situation so Dire! so Dangerous! so Desperate! that it can't be made just a little bit worse by the introduction of Flesh Eating Zombies!. (After a while, we shortened that sentence to FEZ!, and everybody knew what that meant!)<br/><br/>Part of the King of Tokyo series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Get Bit! Collectors Edition contains Walk the Plank!, Get Bit!, and Hold Your Breath! &mdash; three independent games that collectively tell a larger story.<br/><br/>In Walk the Plank!, players represent the worst pirates in a captain's crew. The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!<br/><br/>Get Bit! is a card game in which the player pirates find themselves in the ocean, competing to stay alive as others are being eaten by a shark. The order of the swimmers is determined by simultaneously playing cards face down, then revealing the values. The number on each player's card determines position in line (higher numbers in front, lower numbers in back), however ties don't move. The swimmer at the back loses a limb to the shark and is flung to the front of the line! The process is repeated until only two swimmers remain on the table. When this happens, the swimmer at the front of the line wins the game!<br/><br/>In Hold Your Breath!, the game is played in two rounds. In the first round each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot; and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before they run out of air and therefore decide to take a rest (aka LOSE). Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner.<br/><br/>Included in each copy is a bonus chipboard with a newly designed pirate ship, an additional &quot;Captain&quot; stand-up starting token, and even some hunger tokens to go with the now included Sharkspansion for Get Bit.<br/><br/>",

Now she&rsquo;s back to cause a split within the Matriarchy, the powerful faction introduced in the Operation Novgorod expansion. Just as likely to side with the Union as she is with the Matriarcy on her path to vengeance, Oksana is a powerful ally or a dangerous foe, depending on where you stand in her eyes.<br/><br/>Oksana utilizes the mechanical drones known as Vo&iuml;vodes, which are utilized heavily in Operation Novgorod. These Vo&iuml;vodes operate under Oksana&rsquo;s control, doing her bidding without hesitation.<br/><br/>Oksana comes complete with a detailed pre-painted figure of Oksana Gusarenko, two pre-painted Vo&iuml;vode miniatures, two character sheets, and tokens for all of her equipment. Oksana has the ability to field two Vo&iuml;vodes when she is chosen as a hero. Players wishing to utilize Oksana&rsquo;s technological talents must replace one of their Troopers with her two Vo&iuml;vodes. She cannot be used on the same team as Zor&rsquo;ka from the Operation Novgorod expansion.<br/><br/>In addition to these components, Oksana also comes with a rulebook featuring a custom scenario that sends her into Reich territory on a quest to recover lost documents.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Its innovative gameplay mechanics, unparalleled artwork, historical scope, and accessibility have entertained veteran and new gamers alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>Lock &lsquo;n Load Tactical is a fast and furious squad-level tactical game using a quick impulse system and great immersive graphics gives you a true feeling of being there. In LnLT you get squads, weapon teams, armored vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and, in the modern-era games, helicopters, and Jets.&nbsp; As a Tactical Squad system, special skills and leadership are all part of the base game. Single men such as Leaders, Snipers, Medics, Nurses, Advisors,&nbsp; Chaplains, and, of course, Heroes.&nbsp; Your troops' leadership and special unit skills can affect your battles by inspiring your men; leading them to feats of heroic bravery and more. Random events triggered during play causing events like ambushes, squads panic, and special support to name a few. Battles so intense that stories can be written about them. It's all here in Lock 'n Load Tactical.<br/><br/>The&nbsp;LnLT&nbsp;system has set a new standard in Squad-level gaming with scenario-based gameplay. Its innovative gameplay mechanics, unparalleled artwork, historical scope, and accessibility have entertained veteran and new gamers alike. Over that time, our rules have grown, too, introducing new unit capabilities and concepts; they have also matured in their presentation.<br/><br/>The&nbsp;LnLT&nbsp;version 5.1 (v5.1) rules&nbsp;combine the soundness of its design with its ease of play.&nbsp; This version benefits from all the fine-tuning accumulated over the past 20 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our goal is to present the rules in a straightforward manner without disrupting their existing structure and foundation. For clarity, some rules sections have been modified not with content but with a new structure, e.g., additional subsections, more bullet points, or more images and examples&mdash;and even in-depth examples. Additional cross-referencing of rules expanded unit-image diagrams,&nbsp;large font size&nbsp;for easy reading and a detailed Index and Glossary have also been updated.<br/><br/>Other new additions to the&nbsp;LnLT&nbsp;v5.1 rules are numbered examples within each rules section and throughout the manual, to make referencing certain sections and subsections easier.&nbsp; The&nbsp;LnLT&nbsp;rules manual has received high ratings and praise for getting players into the game and out of the rules.<br/><br/>Changes to the rules can be easily spotted as they have been highlighted in blue text. We encourage new players to read the two gameplay narratives (for infantry and vehicles/ordnance) found at the back of the book before reading the rules, to familiarize yourself with how a scenario plays in an intuitive and observational manner. The LnLT&nbsp;v5.1 rules can be used with any previously published module, including the LnLT Solo system.&nbsp; The Core Rules have seven additional sections adding an additional 110 pages.&nbsp; The additional sections are listed below.<br/><br/>Additional Manual Sections Found in the Core Rules:<br/><br/>Infantry Gameplay Narrative<br/>Vehicle &amp; Ordnance Gameplay Narrative<br/>Outline of Play<br/>Charts and Tables<br/>Rule Reference<br/>Starter Kit TEC&rsquo;s, Scenarios, and Game Tables<br/>Starter Kit Counters and Maps<br/><br/>The LnLT Core Rules can be viewed and downloaded via the Online Library&nbsp;including our Bootcamp Training Videos.<br/><br/>Please Note:&nbsp;There is no difference between the Printed, PDF, or Online Library Editions except were noted.&nbsp; &nbsp;The LnLT Core Rules do not include any printed versions of our game map,&nbsp;counter sheet, or player aid cards.&nbsp; Our printed edition of the game map, counter sheet, and player aid cards are available within our&nbsp;LnLT Starter Kit product.&nbsp; The LnLT Starter Kit included with LnLT Core Rules is a Print and Play Edition.<br/><br/>UPDATE: All of our LnLT manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

As your journey reaches its final stages, this 60-card pack takes you deep into this labyrinthine cave system where you&rsquo;ll face dwindling supplies as well as the nameless terrors that dwell there.

Many tried to rule over us, but their reign never lasted more than a couple decades. You see, the throne is cursed and it feasts on the ruler's power. and the weaker they get, the more our magic fades away. Soon the gates to the spirit realm will be forever closed, and our legend forgotten...

The Standard Rules are common to all four games.<br/><br/>Game scale is one mile per hex and 12 hours per game turn.  Unit sizes range from battalion to Brigade.  Design is a simple IGO-UGO sequence of play utilizing rigid Zones of Control and a differential based CRT.  Artillery units can participate in combat from non-adjacent hexes in attack and defense.<br/><br/>The games included in this quad are:<br/><br/><br/>    Chinese Farm - covers the combat between the Israeli and Egyptian force around the Suez Canal, during the latter half of the Yom Kippur War, October 15 to 21, 1973.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Wurzburg - (Hypothetical) A vital communications center, dominating the route of Soviet invasion into West Germany, which would be the site of a clash between Soviet Mechanized Rifle Divisions and the American Third Mechanized Infantry Division.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Golan - On October 5, 1973, the Syrians launched an offensive with the objective of driving the Israelis off the Golan Heights.  They came close to success, but were eventually hammered back to the outskirts of Damascus.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Mukden - (Hypothetical) Mukden is a great industrial center which lies at the edge of the vast Manchurian plain.  It would be a vital objective in a Soviet invasion, and would be hotly contested as the first threatened Chinese city.<br/><br/><br/>A follow up set of four new games was later published as Modern Battles II: Four Contemporary Conflicts.<br/><br/>",

There are multiple cards available for each type of die so players get to choose which one  to use. This lets players specialize dice to suit play style.<br/><br/>The name and theme of the new expansion set will be the Tomb of Annihilation, set in the Forgotten Realms.  This set will offer new adventures, monsters, and spells for the game, as well as a new &ldquo;Draft Pack&rdquo; format, designed for tournament play.<br/><br/>Each Draft Pack will include 2 Basic Action cards, 12 Character or Action cards, 24 dice that match the 12 cards, and a rules insert.  All components can be used with other Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dice Masters sets, but the sets have been designed for better use in draft-based games. Any Dice Masters Starter Set will be required to play (for starting NPC dice and Basic Action color indicator cards and dice).<br/><br/>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dice Masters: Tomb of Annihilation will be sold in countertop displays.

A massive, swirling cavalry battle so large that one wing never knew what was happening on the other wing, a factor which led to the Mongol downfall.<br/><br/>Mansourah brings in what many gamers have been waiting for: a full-blown Crusader army. This time its that of Louis IX, invading Egypt for a second time, advancing up The Nile only to get stopped by the Mamluks of the last-gasp Abbuyid Dynasty outside their brand-new city, Mansourah. Not only do we have 3 &quot;battles&quot; of Crusader heavy cavalry - acting as so many of their bretheren too often did throughout these wars - but lots of crossbows, field artillery, and even street fighting.<br/><br/><br/>Designed by Richard Berg and Developed by Al Ray, Mamluk contains one full map, one sheet of counters, and all rules needed for these two scenarios. Everything else needed is in your Devil's Horsemen box.<br/><br/>Note: To play Mamluk, you need a copy of Devil's Horsemen.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>    280 full-color counters<br/>    One full-color 22x34&quot; mapsheet<br/>    16-page Rules and Scenario book<br/><br/><br/>",

From charity to jet-set life, she wanted to do a little good and have a good time while she was at it.<br/>Now, with the zombie outbreak, Ivy&rsquo;s dusting off her old skills. Saving lives is a little change of pace, and it does feel good. And well, a head shot is still a head shot right?<br/><br/>Ivy is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Kickstarter campaign.

The opening battle of the war, what looks to be a straightforward Napoleonic battle line special but ends up nothing of the sort, thanks to Ringgold's &quot;flying artillery&quot;, grass fires, and a cast of most unusual characters.<br/><br/>Resaca de la Palma: May 9, 1846. A numerically superior Mexican force in an extremely strong defensive position, mostly hidden from the incoming Americans. One of the most unusual battlefields in gaming, the scenario is given a variety of gaming possibilities as well as two-player hidden deployment.<br/> Contreras: August 20, 1847. An assumedly unassailable and unapproachable Mexican position is trumped by some great scouting work by a young Robert E. Lee, resulting in a Mexican rout. But it did not have to happen that way. Maybe Santa Anna will use his reserves to negate the American attack. Maybe it will turn out completely differently.<br/><br/>Puebla: May 5, 1862. A venture into another way, for the battle that resulted in the well-known Mexican holiday, Cinco de Mayo. A strong division of veteran French soldiers, fighting for the Emperor Maximilian, attack a nicely-defended Mexican position right outside this important, of-fought-over city. Cavalry charges, assaults on forts, and a rather prescient use of trenches result in a nicely balanced game.<br/><br/>Components <br/><br/>    Two 33&quot;x22&quot; mapsheets (each with 2 battles) <br/>    One sheet of counters <br/>    Battle Rules <br/><br/><br/>You will need GRINGO to play the battles herein.<br/><br/>(adapted description from publisher)<br/><br/>",

A player can only have one of their heroes holding a torch at any given time. If a hero takes damage while holding a torch, the torch goes out. If a hero brings a torch to a village and lights the lantern of that village, the player who controls that hero collects the lantern for victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Note: This mini expansion is packaged inside the Deluxe Edition.

His pencil illustrations for the American publisher &lsquo;SQP&rsquo; are featured in &lsquo;Vampire Girls&rsquo;, &lsquo;Coven 2&rsquo; and &lsquo;Eternal Temptation&rsquo;. He painted numerous covers, interior art, and character design for a great number of video games and role playing games such as &lsquo;Forgotten Realms&rsquo;, &lsquo;Eberron&rsquo;, &lsquo;Magic&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hecatomb&rsquo;.<br/><br/>He&rsquo;s illustrated dozens of cards seen in &lsquo;Magic the Gathering&rsquo; and &lsquo;Warcraft&rsquo;, and executed interior illustrations for &lsquo;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&rsquo; and a number of comic books for &lsquo;Magic the Gathering&rsquo; (Jace vs Chandra).<br/><br/>Lucio has worked for many European and American publishers in Germany, France, Italy, Sweden, and USA.<br/><br/>The two survivors include:<br/><br/>BROTHER MAX the MONK<br/>&quot;Blessed be the undead, for they have inherited the earth.&quot;<br/><br/>Brother Max&rsquo; monastery was destroyed during the zombie outbreak and the rampage that followed. Scrounging weapons from the rubble, he emerged for the first time in years to face the world. Brother Max views the zombie outbreak as the start of the Apocalypse and believes that the zombies are rising from the dead and are therefore holy. By blowing their heads off he is sending them to Heaven where they belong. Brother Max&rsquo; religious fervor makes him an excellent fighter, although his zeal to send as many zombies to Heaven as possible can be unnerving.<br/><br/>DONNA the FASHIONISTA<br/>&quot;At least I don&rsquo;t have to worry about price tags anymore.&quot;<br/><br/>Donna has always had superior taste. Her sense of art, music, and especially clothing was far superior to more pedestrian intellects. Unfortunately, she had zero talent for craftsmanship. She had the eye, but the ability always eluded her. Still, she made a decent living as a consultant, especially for a number of B-grade martial arts films. She was on the set when the zombie apocalypse began, surrounded by elegant weapons. While Donna hasn&rsquo;t quite gotten used to the grunge and squalor of Survivor living, she has found one bright side: She has her pick of clothes. The zombies are almost an aside when they stand between her and particularly elegant evening wear. Any Survivor groups are guaranteed to improve their image, just by having her around.<br/><br/>",

If Bloody Mary dies, she starts killing the players who killed her...from the grave. The ferocious Chupacabra loves the taste of werewolf, but if he runs out of them, villagers will do. The Wolf Man hunts with the werewolves, but to the Seer he appears as an innocent villager. The tricky Leprechaun sides with the village, messing with the werewolves by changing their nighttime target. All Sasquatch ever wanted to do was to help the village kill werewolves...but if the village wavers on this, Sasquatch will turn on them. And finally, Nostradamus has to make a name for himself by predicting who will win each game of Ultimate Werewolf &ndash; and then helps out his prediction. All or some of these characters can be added to your Ultimate Werewolf games to make them even more compelling than before!<br/><br/>Urban Legends is included in the 2013 edition of Ultimate Werewolf, is compatible with earlier editions of this game, and is also available on its own.<br/><br/>",

The remaining Russians expected the giant to fight like a brute, especially after their bullets bounced off him with no effect, but instead of running at the men, he stopped short and glared with such unearthly ferocity, he bent the commander's mind.<br/><br/>Drawn forth from Naraka by a blend of science and mysticism, Itami is a hybrid of human and Oni, the denizens of the Realm of Suffering. While even the Shōgunate do not fully understand his abilities, they are astounding. His gaze can wrack others with pain and bend their very will. An unholy penumbra seeps out his every pore and drains the essences of those around him.<br/><br/>For now, Itami works to ensure the mutual benefits of the Shōgunate and the Inferior Worlds, swatting aside enemies with a kenabō wrapped in mystically imbued leather. The Shōgunate have placed him in Iroh Minamoto's 3rd Division to best make use of his abilities while they explore their tenuous alliance with the Reich.<br/><br/>Itami includes new rules for the Nippon Accord and a unique scenario that highlights Itami's mysterious powers.<br/><br/>",

As old as time itself, he slumbers in the Void, dreaming worlds into existence and crushing entire realities with his nightmares. On rare occasion, The Ancient One will stir in his timeless sleep, manifesting himself in a physical form that can hold shape in our world. Tearing a hole in time and space, he emerges from the Void, bringing Ancient Doom and despair to all those who lay eyes upon his hideous and twisting visage.<br/><br/>The Ancient One is a massive XXL Enemy that rivals Beli&rsquo;al, both in size and theme! He is a terrifying foe to behold that can alter reality out from under the Heroes - shifting time, re-writing history, and breaking open portals to other dimensions during the fight. Sweeping his monstrous Sword of Felg&rsquo;nar with every attack, The Ancient One can easily slash through entire groups of Heroes in one fell strike. He also comes with a deck of Ancient Doom cards that give him a motivation for why he has emerged from the Void to crush the Heroes. One of these cards is drawn whenever The Ancient One enters play, and gives a thematic reasoning for his attack, a special bonus to The Ancient One himself, and alters the &lsquo;End of Mission&rsquo; Failure and Rewards for the current Mission being played.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives counters of his own color, and play then loosely follows that of normal Bohnanza, with an important difference: Earned bean coins are not saved but are used to finance your conquests throughout the Bohnreich. In the end, the only thing that matters is who has the largest part of the Bohnreich under control. Battling is accomplished using the numbers on the bean cards, which gives new significance to the formerly &quot;weaker&quot; bean types. Designer Hanno Girke describes the expansion set as &quot;Bohnanza meets Risk&quot;.<br/><br/>High Bohn Plus contains new game variants and two new bean types, the Cognac bean and the Field bean. With High Bohn, the players may spend their thalers on buildings located in Virginia City. These building have attributes that give the players new tactics for winning. The Plus part of this expansion adds Field Beans (for 4-5 players) that can be harvested for a third field and Order cards (for 3-7 players) that allow players to earn extra thalers when they can fill very specific orders.<br/><br/>",

It also doesn't hurt that gold was just discovered in some nearby underground caverns.<br/><br/>In this age of new wealth, the Queen is more popular than ever. Queen Gertrude has even announced that non-royal versions of the recent Jubilee gifts may be made available to the public. An enthusiastic spirit of pride fills the realm, blinding citizens to a much darker element creeping into the kingdom...<br/><br/>King's Forge: Gold adds lustrous gold dice and luxurious new items to King's Forge. In addition to new golden items, all 30 of the original Queen's Jubilee expansion items have been re-balanced and ranked for the main deck. In total, the Gold mini-expansion adds 39 items to the main crafting deck (the most added by any expansion, even over the base game&mdash;which adds 33 items). Some of these items even have crafting requirements above 6+! Additionally, 9 new Gather locations represent the age across three themes; 3 gold-related (Fool, Gilder with an anvil icon, and a Gold Mine Docks card), 3 prosperity-related (Brewery, Warehouse, and Wishing Well), and 3 nefarious elements cards (Dark Forge, Rogue, and Sorcerer).<br/><br/>Modular rules and scenarios introduce new and different experiences that can soften the game for casual play (addressing loss aversion/wasted effort), speed up play (e.g. everyone starts with a Gold die), or modify decision space (e.g. new win conditions&mdash;crafting for a Guild, or racing to craft a Dragonfly Charm). This expansion is aimed squarely at fans of the base game and new players looking for an exciting entry point to King's Forge with a major boost of items and new ideas.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alone in the Storm (AITS) provides an exciting and new game experience for newbies and veteran players of War Storm Series games, because this expansion pack includes 2 game modes: solitaire game and semi-cooperative game mode.<br/><br/>This expansion pack keeps the main rules and game concepts of each game in the War Storm Series. Despite of rules to manage the non-player side, other new rules has been added as for example fog of war rules that are introduced at Set up stage. Fog of war in Alone in the Storm puts player as commanding officer on the planning mapboard of headquarter with the only information of several intelligence reports. Sometimes these reports may be right and player may found the expected enemy forces, but other times these reports may be wrong and player may find unpleasant surprises.<br/><br/>Game sequence is similar than remaining War Storm Series games, so it shall be so easy for veteran players learn the solo game system, because the management of player side is almost the same. A few changes has been made in order to add a new headquarter (HQ) phase needed for non-player side management.<br/><br/>Design of an artificial intelligence to manage non player forces has been a great challenge due to the War Storm Series games system based on formations of a few combatant units commanded by an officer. It makes us to define several management levels. All these circumstances make that the artificial intelligence simulates the command hierarchy.<br/><br/>Alone in the Storm is compatible with all War Storm Series games. You can play solitaire or in semi-cooperative mode all games of the series (even future titles) combining the base game with this expansion pack, without adding anything else. All scenarios included at the base games of the previously designed games may be played in solitaire or with a partner from both sides, and there are specific rules to play point based scenarios too even future games.<br/><br/>A lot of battlefields are ready!! They are waiting for you&hellip; and you are alone. Are you ready for the Storm is coming?<br/><br/>",

But watch out, any patients left in the city who have not been tended to, neglect in value and the player(s) who picked up the healthiest patients that round gain fatality tokens, if the worst happens to the patients! This expansion also includes a helicopter miniature (used to pickup patients from anywhere in the city grid for whoever is the first player that round) in the kickstarter edition.<br/><br/>The Maternity Expansion<br/>This expansion includes normal sized pink mother dice and smaller pink baby dice! This expansion also increases interaction by making players compete for objective cards set by the &quot;city&quot; to ensure a good amount of mother and baby dice are discharged (with often other colour combinations) by the end of the game. This also includes a new spatial element to the game in which mothers only neglect when untreated and in a ward with other dice. Players also roll the birthing die to see whether they receive single or twin babies!<br/><br/>The Improvements expansion<br/>This expansion allows for almost unlimited customisation! Players will be given a free to visit worker placement board where they can pick up room improvements specific to a colour of their choice. This expansion vastly increases the crunchiness of the game and is for players who have played the original game &quot;wanting more&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Because everyone knows, mobs with pitchforks and torches always get the job done.<br/><br/>This new expansion was initially only available at conventions where Flying Frog has a presence (it is now available through their web shop).  It includes new Events, Space Stuff, and Resistance as well as the new alien - The Red Menace.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion includes two survivors and their Zombivor counterparts both designed by Edouard Guiton.<br/><br/>Born in Chicago on March 30, 1977 to a French father and Franco-Belgian mother, Edouard Guiton grew up in the Paris suburbs. He became passionate about drawing very early, never imagining that sketching monsters, warriors, and other childish fantasies could be a job.<br/><br/>In 1997, he participated in the creation of the game production company Rackham, co-founded by his brother Rapha&euml;l Guiton. Edouard worked as Rackham&rsquo;s main character designer for many years, in addition to working on illustrations, covers, and concepts for different game and video game publishers.<br/><br/>Edouard&rsquo;s first comics, produced by Soleil, appeared in 2009. In that same year, Edouard began working with Ankama, an important, young French company, producing cartoons, video games, games, toys, and comics. Edouard lives and works in Paris.<br/><br/>The two survivors include:<br/><br/>DOUD the HOSPITAL BOY<br/>&ldquo;Hey Mr. Zombie, take these lead pills to ease your terminal pain!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Doud had a spectacular skateboard accident mere hours before the zombie invasion. He awoke in the turmoil, as infected people were turning into zombies and began to attack anyone in sight. His will to live, however, was stronger than the zombie tide. Doud took anything he could find and turned it into a weapon, until he found his first real weapons. He was the one to Molotov the Hospital Central and turn it into a funeral pyre. Despite his awesome feat, Doud still has to be taken care of. Finding medical supplies in a devastated town isn&rsquo;t easy. Hopefully, his new buddies will help him heal and once he&rsquo;s in the green again... Payback time.<br/><br/>TOMIKO the PSYCHOTIC BUNNY<br/>&ldquo;Choppity-chop-chop!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Little is known of Tomiko&rsquo;s life before the zombies came. There are whispers that she was an anime cosplayer, a video game fanatic, or even an employee at an amusement park. However, people are in total agreement that she is now crazy. Even zombies seem to avoid Tomiko when she walks down the middle of the street shouting the only words she ever speaks, &lsquo;Choppity-chop-chop!&rsquo; Tomiko is good in a fight, wielding her axe with psychotic vigor. Unfortunately, in the heat of battle she often doesn&rsquo;t distinguish between the living and the dead, and for this reason she never lasts long with any survivor group.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Napoleon's Later Campaigns&quot; is a retrofit rules system designed to increase the historical accuracy of the wargames in the related &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles&quot; (NLB) / &quot;Napoleon at Leipzig&quot; (NAL) / &quot;Library of Napoleonic Battles&quot; (LNB) family of 1-hour turn, brigade-level, grand tactical Napoleonic study wargames. It is designed to replace the rules of any game in that system, and where necessary, specific retrofit rules (e.g. for special scenario rules) are provided for most games in the series.<br/><br/>The rules are intended to form a new family of games, &quot;backward compatible&quot; with these games, and that is &quot;fast, low to moderate complexity ... combining a grand tactical perspective ... with a focus on a historically sound use of units.&quot;<br/><br/>Chitpulls and order rules also facilitate solo play.  The order system encourages players, like their historical counterparts, to come up with a plan, from then on the orders will guide and tell you what to do each turn. You just have to make the tactical decisions.<br/><br/>The games that have been explicitly refitted for the system include (showing publisher): <br/>Napoleon's Last Battles (SPI/TSR/DG)<br/>Napoleon at Leipzig (OSG/COA)<br/>The Battle for Dresden 1813 (NES)<br/>Napoleon on the Danube (NES)<br/>Clash of the Eagles: Borodino & Friedland (S&amp;T) <br/>Four Lost Battles (OSG)<br/>Wellington Vs Massena (3W)<br/>Napoleon and the Archduke Charles: The Battle of Abensberg (3W)<br/>Napoleon and the Archduke Charles: The Battle of Eckmuhl (3W) <br/>Caldiero 1796 (Web-published/No Turkeys)<br/>La Patrie en Danger 1814 (OSG)<br/><br/>TLNB (w/o published refit rules):<br/>The Coming Storm: Quadrigame of the Fourth Coalition October 1806 - June 1807<br/>The Last Success: Quadrigame of the War Against Austria, April - July 1809<br/>Intro Game: Battle of Eckmühl<br/>Napoleon at Leipzig (Fifth Edition)<br/>Intro Package: Hanau<br/>Napoleon Against Russia<br/>Napoleon's Last Gamble: Battles of the Hundred Days<br/>Fleurus 1794: The Battles of Fleurus and Mont St. Jean<br/>Napoleon's Quagmire<br/>Napoleon's Resurgence<br/>Napoleon Retreats: Campaign in France, Part II<br/>Note that other LNB games can be played with the rules from this refit except that their individual exclusive rules have to be taken from their respective rulebooks.<br/><br/>New games using the system:<br/>Salamanca: Marmont vs Wellington<br/><br/>",

Millenia after the collapse of the Federation, the greatest empire to ever rule the galaxy, a few species are taking up to the stars again to escape their dying worlds. They all have the same goal: to rebuild their civilizations and reclaim their former glory. But there can only be one ruler.<br/><br/>This Collector Edition of Fractal includes the core game and the first campaign, &ldquo;Beyond the Void&rdquo;, along with Kickstarter-exclusive acrylic colony tokens, metal first-player token, and the solo/cooperative Alliance expansion.<br/><br/>Beyond the Void is the first campaign of Fractal, using a custom legacy framework: the Aftermath. It offers a full narrative experience where every action has consequences, and where the fate of the universe will be decided by the victories and defeats and every player around the table. Amongst other components, factions themselves can be expanded by unlocking new governments and masteries, pushing always further their natural asymmetry. 5 new factions can also be discovered, all with unique mechanics and gameplay, and all freely usable in the core experience once encountered during the campaign.<br/><br/>",

Legislation has been introduced into the Brazilian parliament that would strip bioroids of those very rights and protections. This &ldquo;Automata Initiative&rdquo; would remove their legal personhood from the constitution and cement the status of bioroids as robots without soul or sentience. With tensions building between corporate meddlers, a protesting populace, and sympathetic Runners, the stage is set for a conflict that questions the very nature of what it means to be a person.&quot;<br/><br/>The first half of the Liberation cycle for Netrunner.

The Multimen become more powerful in numbers &mdash; total numbers &mdash; even if they are fighting against you!<br/><br/>Multimen come in two varieties &mdash; Avengers and Villains &mdash; and are all Level 2 Characters.

The player's tribe opposes the invaders advancing their tribe to win (scoring 15 points) before the Invaders summon all five of their warlords - their win.<br/><br/>The Vul&rsquo;Keth Invasion (solo mode) is designed to give a challenge to experienced players and capture the same feel as a multi-player game. The invaders take minimal and fast but impactful turns, giving the player tons of great decisions as they work to deny the invaders achieving goals.<br/><br/>If players thought it was enough for your tribe to master the lakes, forests and mountains they were sadly mistaken. Another mysterious tribe has appeared and these invaders - with their aggressive warlords - intend to drive the tribe players have choosen to be from this land. Players need to establish their tribe's dominance before it's too late!<br/><br/>The Vul&rsquo;Keth Invasion (solo mode) presents players with the challenge of racing to victory while holding back an invading tribe lead by warlords with unique powers that will disrupt and devastate your progress. Players will take their turns in the usual way using a unique board set up for two tribes. Don't expect the Vul'Keth invaders to be a usual opponent.<br/><br/>Each turn the invaders will determine their actions by drawing a card from one of three action decks. These cards also supply them with a goal. Players must stop the Vul'Keth from achieving their goals or the invaders will be rewarded with resources. Not worried about a few resources? At the end of their turn the invaders summon a warlord for every six resources they have, and if all five of the warlords are summoned to your land then the battle is over and your tribe must flee in defeat at the hand of the Vul'Keth!<br/><br/>The Vul'Keth Invasion is compatable with the Bronze expansion (see: Rise of Tribes: Beasts &amp; Bronze). When added in, the player may complete 3 Bronze Age Technologies for the win, or win by scoring 15 points, if traditional Stone Age resistance to the invasion is working the best.<br/><br/>Bonus: NEW 9th Tribe!<br/>The Vul&rsquo;Keth foe inspired us to create the 9th unique playable tribe in multiplayer games. Players gain either Seize or Pillage when they play with Leader powers!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Upon completing each mission, players may flash the included QR codes to uncover additional information regarding the ulterior motives lurking behind the antagonists of this campaign.<br/><br/>Because it&rsquo;s somewhat uncomfortable and disingenuous to call Squad members &ldquo;heroes&rdquo;, in this expansion they will be identified as &ldquo;Anti-Heroes&rdquo;&ndash; a replacement term for heroes.<br/><br/><br/>     10 new miniatures and 13 hero screens, including Season 1 characters such as Harley Quinn and Killer Croc. <br/>     11 tiles <br/>     15 equipment cards.<br/><br/><br/>All Suicide Squad characters are Versus mode compatible and have individual powers.<br/><br/>You can expand your anti-hero mission pool further by adding the following core box components. This component mash-up maximizes the thematic campaign experience. <br/><br/>     Katana, mini, hero screen and the katana equipment card.<br/>     Killer Croc mini.<br/>     Harley Quinn mini.<br/>     1 service gun equipment card, allocated to Rick Flag<br/>     1 service gun equipment card, allocated to Amanda Waller<br/>     Poison Ivy mini. *<br/>     2 Carnivorous Plant minis and their tile *<br/>     1 Fire Axe equipment card allocated to The Joker's Daughter (Duela Dent)<br/>     4 Guard minis to use in with the Belle-Reve's Guards tile included in this expansion.<br/><br/><br/>* If you own Poison Ivy (new 52) and the Carnivorous Plants Rex, you can substitute them for the corebox Poison Ivy and Carnivorous Plants.<br/><br/>Build your own Suicide Squad: select from a 14-character pool (13 in this expansion, plus Katana) and prepare to get your hands dirty.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each mission, when choosing heroes, you can decide to rebuild a new team or continue with the one you assembled for the previous mission.<br/><br/>Your choices are made from three types of anti-heroes: Leaders, members of Squad S and those of Squad X.<br/><br/>Each anti-hero enters play fully loaded with a preset selection of equipment cards.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, the Belle-Reve Guards tile adds to the game wide available henchmen/elite pool from Versus mode or Adventure mode if a hero has the command skill.<br/><br/>These upgraded veterans are capable of performing complex actions but cannot share a mission with &ldquo;Guards&rdquo; tile &ndash; so make your choice between the two carefully before each mission. Their hindering skill is a painful thorn in your opponents&rsquo; side when they are after your leader or lieutenant.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is AD60, and Governor of Britannia C. Suetonius Paulinus stands ready to deal his final blow against a vicious insurgency in Rome&rsquo;s new province. Inspired by Rome&rsquo;s implacable opponents, the Druids, the remaining fanatical warriors of a two-year insurgency hold out on the island of Anglesey. Having made an amphibious landing on the island&rsquo;s shores, Paulinus and his legionaries must cut their way through fierce opposition on the beach.<br/><br/>While his cohorts ravage the island, a messenger reaches Paulinus with news of a tribe that is rampaging the eastern fringes of his province. The Iceni, led by Queen Boudicca, are reported to have murdered local Roman officials and their guards. Other reports soon arrive that the Iceni&rsquo;s revolt is gathering both force and momentum as local tribes are responding to Boudicca&rsquo;s call for open revolt. A large warrior force is said to be devastating Roman villas and farmsteads as it heads south towards the first Roman colony in Britannia, Camulodunum.<br/><br/>Paulinus realizes that with all four of his legions posted in the north and west, this new menace has the potential to ravage Roman colonies and cut his lines of communication. He faces the very real prospect of being Governor of Britannia in name only.<br/><br/>Battles of the Warrior Queen covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero. Led by Queen Boudicca, the rebellion would be the greatest British threat to nearly four centuries of Roman domination of Britain.<br/><br/>Battle of Mona Insulis<br/><br/>Separated from mainland Britain by the treacherous waters of the Menai Straits, Paulinus faced the challenge of making an opposed beach landing on the Welsh island of Mona Insulis (today&rsquo;s Anglesey). The Britons, arrayed along the shore in a dense and heavily armed line of battle, awaited the assault. Helping whip them into a battle frenzy were the Druid priests, for whom the island was their last sanctuary.<br/><br/>Battle of Camulodunum<br/><br/>On learning that the Iceni tribe had risen in revolt and were heading towards the Roman colony of Camulodunum (modern-day Colchester), the IXth Legion (named as &ldquo;Hispana&rdquo;) set off from its base in Lindum (modern-day Lincoln), under the command of legate Petillius Cerialis. Cerialis was a mercurial individual who had escaped the brink of military disaster before. His luck would be tried once again in his encounter with the Britons.<br/><br/>Battle of Bannaventa<br/><br/>After arriving on the mainland, Paulinus rode east and south in great haste. Outside Londinium news of the defeat of Cerialis and his IXth Legion reached him. Ordering evacuation of the city, Paulinus withdrew hurriedly northwards to the midlands and urgently concentrated the XIVth Gemina and the XXth Legions.<br/><br/>As Boudicca&rsquo;s horde approached, Paulinus drew up his troops in close order in a defile, protected on his flanks and in his rear by dense forest. He new that the Queen of the Iceni would struggle to keep her disparate coalition in check for long, and would soon be compelled to attack. Whichever way it went, this would likely be the final, climatic battle of Boudicca&rsquo;s rebellion against Rome.<br/><br/>To play this module you will need the maps, counters and rules that come with this module and the rules and some counters from Caesar: Conquest of Gaul. Battles of the Warrior Queen can also be played with the Simple Great Battles of History (SGBoH) rules.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    One 32&rdquo; and 24&rdquo; back printed map sheet (one full and two half size game maps) <br/>    140 counters<br/><br/><br/>(from the GMT Website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deluxe Advanced Squad Leader contains eight full-color, geomorphic 11&quot; x 26&quot; mapboards depicting both urban and countryside terrain, eight sheets of overlays to modify the terrain, and 38 scenarios designed for play on the boards.<br/><br/>Deluxe ASL is simply ASL without stacking. It features an enlarged 2.2&quot; hex scale, making ASL more playable than ever. There is sufficient room in each hex to place over a dozen counters without stacking, making the game both easier and faster to play. Informational counters can often be laid alongside units to avoid obscuring them, and the need for some informational counters (like Covered Arc markers) is eliminated based on unit placement within a hex. Some players even use miniatures on these boards to increase their enjoyment.<br/><br/>Deluxe ASL includes all the boards and all the scenarios from the long out-of-print STREETS OF FIRE and HEDGEROW HELL. The eight original boards (a-h) have been repainted by Charlie Kibler and finished in the &quot;tri-fold&quot; style of Deluxe maps i-l from Winter Offensive Bonus Pack #9 (with which they are completely compatible). The original 18 Deluxe ASL scenarios are included, all updated and rebalanced as needed. Charlie has also repainted the original Deluxe ASL overlays (from the 1995 ANNUAL), four additional sheets of wooden and stone rubble overlays, and two sheets of new terrain overlays to provide maximum flexibility for future scenario designers. Twenty additional, out-of-print Deluxe ASL scenarios are also included, updated, and rebalanced as needed.<br/><br/>These features make this package attractive to all ASL players, whether they have been Deluxe fans for 30 years or never before got the chance to play on the bigger hexes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

Assuming the attack goes through (they can still call your bluff) the inquisitor player can look at one of their cards and either let them keep it or force them to discard it and get a new card. Both Ambassador and Inquisitor block the Captain.<br/><br/>",

When it is hit with a Dynamite or Damage 3 weapon, roll a die. On a 4+, it survives the attack! The only way to guarantee its defeat is to spend 2 Dynamite cards instead of 1 when throwing a Dynamite at it.<br/><br/>The Abominape vs Crocosaur Pack contains:<br/><br/><br/>     1 Abominape figure<br/>     1 Crocosaur Figure<br/>     2 Abomination Cards<br/><br/><br/>",

They may find support from the Russians, with whom they share the Orthodox Religion, and maybe the Austrians and the French after the Catholic-Protestant split. After all, they had already survived the Fall of Rome, the Persians, the Arabs, the Bulgarians, the Seijuk Turks, the Rus, the Vikings, and the Crusaders. They may even survive to the present day as a Greek state with traces of Roman influence.<br/><br/>All cards are intended to be used with the 1550 Map Variant (see C1c). Use Reformist Theocracies for the starting England and HRE states, and the 2 new mapcards for the starting Hungary and Ottoman medieval states. Trebizond starts busted instead of the Red Sea. Replace the original Empire cards for Ottoman and Hungary with the new promo Empire cards, and only use the new Empire card for Papal States if the Papal States turns into a Reformation or Muslim Theocracy. The new Victory Square should be used in addition to the original ones, for a total of five Victory Squares. The new Banker overlay cards should be placed on top of an existing Banker placard (any Banker placard may be replaced). The new market cards should be mixed in with their respective deck.<br/><br/>Promo pack for Pax Renaissance 2nd ed. includes:<br/><br/>3 new Empire cards<br/>9 new Market cards (5 west and 4 east)<br/>1 new Victory Squares<br/>2 new Map cards<br/>2 new Banker overlay cards (Alvaro Mendes &amp; Cornelius Berenberg)<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kickstarter Exclusive set of 6 original Survivors designed by Adrian Smith, including their figures and ID cards.<br/><br/>The Kabuki Gang is an actual performance troupe that was touring the base when the Xenos attacked. The members of this troupe, most of them with rather shady pasts, didn't hesitate to pick up arms and face the invaders. Assuming the identity of the characters they were playing in their performance of Yotsuya Kaidan (including traditional wardrobe and masks), these actors scrambled to find whatever they could to help them in their fight. This means this group of Survivors each starts the game with an extra Equipment card, randomly drawn from the pile. The show, as they say, must go on!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The ASLOK XXXII pack builds on the success of the ASL Oktoberfest XXX pack, and highlights the design and playtesting talents of Ohio&rsquo;s finest. Guided by veteran playtesters and tournament directors Bret Hildebran and Bill Hayward, the expert scenario designers Bill Sisler and Pete Shelling bring us eleven scenarios ranging from 1939 Poland to 1945 Hungary, with stops in Ukraine, Russia, New Guinea, Burma, Italy, France, and Belgium along the way. Place names like Vistula, Balta, Luga, Bougainville, Myitkyina, Elba, Caen, Falaise, and Bastogne will all ring a bell. These scenarios will stretch your tactical knowledge and skills, with many different situations (although no night actions&mdash;so sad). Some are infantry only, one is armor only (almost), but most feature combined arms. Assault engineers with all their toys are featured, and the King of Battle makes its appearance in the form of offboard artillery in several scenarios. Along with the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; Russian, German, and American battles, these scenarios also involve Poles (both 1939 and 1944 versions), British, Japanese, Chinese, the Free French, and the SS (of all different squad types).<br/><br/>The two new boards bring added flexibility to the system and are integral to most of the scenarios. Board 78 is a true wilderness board (no buildings) featuring a brush-covered ridge along its length. Board 79 provides a new river, three to five hexes wide, with a village strung out along both banks. Both highlight the steady skills of Charlie Kibler and are sure to see wide use in future scenario design. With great boards and great scenarios, Action Pack #13 is sure to be a big hit.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "New to the Adventures Universal Game System are &quot;Rogues Gallery&quot; class dice, which offer a whole new level of flexibility when playing as a hero! Normally, hero characters have one set of custom dice that is balanced for them to have a particular play style. However, villains are a bit more slippery than that. With class dice, you can change the way your character plays. Want to play The Joker as the traditional slick footed trickster? Then use the &quot;Wildcard&quot; dice! Want to switch it up and show how deadly he can be with a blunt object? Then swap in the &quot;Brawler&quot; dice (better watch out, Robin). Combining different Rogues Gallery class dice with your character's various hero skill cards generates even more ways to customize their play style.<br/><br/>In addition to the 12 new dice, the Villains Upgrade Pack comes with 10 Hero Sheets: The Joker, Mr. Freeze, Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Two-Face, Penguin, Scarecrow, Jervis Tetch, and The Riddler, a set of Hero Skill cards for those 10 characters, totaling 72 new Skill cards, 9 A.I. Villain sheets for Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Commissioner Gordon, Detective Montoya, Detective Bullock, Nightwing, Tim Drake, and the GCPD beat cops, and 25 initiative cards.<br/><br/>On top of all that, the Villain Upgrade Pack also contains a new mission book. Based on the episode Almost Got 'Im, this mission book delivers a new campaign type: a skirmish campaign. Skirmish campaigns have multiple hero players and multiple villains players using all characters on the board in their hero playstyle, rolling dice and strategizing with their teammates. In Almost Got 'Im a team of villains and a team of heroes will square off to settle the score once and for all. Players that want to keep things strictly cooperative can play this campaign in the cooperative A.I. mode.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But now that he&rsquo;s here, now that he has no option but to swing his sword around rather than swinging around bales of hay, well, he&rsquo;s going to be the best zombie-slayer there is. Maybe win himself a princess in the process, a small castle&hellip; There&rsquo;s something to be said for being a hero, Troy is discovering, especially when it comes with lovely wenches and pocketfuls of gold. Of course, he has to survive all the zombies first.<br/><br/>Evil Troy<br/>The necromancers have performed many experiments in their quest for the perfect evil, the perfect zombie. One of the worst things they managed was a simulacrum of a living being. This golem remembers everything the original human, Troy, knew; he has all of Troy&rsquo;s skills. But he is as undead as a zombie, as angry as a raging bull, and as absolutely evil as it is possible to be. Evil Troy is a nasty piece of work, to put it shortly, intent on killing anything &ndash; human, zombie, or necromancer &ndash; that gets in his way.<br/><br/>",

Pretty much nothing else is known of them. The design of the Voonith upon sirens and amphisboenas &ndash; these are existing amphibians &amp; reptiles who only have forelegs. So the back half of the Voonith is long &amp; eel-like, while the front part has claws and fangs. The model shows it rearing up, ready to strike. They cost 3 Power, and only have 1 Combat, which may at first seem puny, but wait, there&rsquo;s more!<br/><br/>The Voonith is a solitary hunter, and I wanted the in-game version to foster that concept. Therefore, its special ability is that if you roll NO kills in a battle involving your Voonith, add 1 kill to your total. Because of this, the Voonith&rsquo;s 1 combat die isn&rsquo;t actually a drawback. If you have 2 Vooniths and roll no kills, you&rsquo;d get 2 kills for free. And yes, if you have 2 Vooniths in Battle and roll only 1 kill, you get a free kill for your deficit. Basically, each Voonith you have provides a guaranteed kill!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The Hound of Tindalos, Wamp, and Voonith sculpts are credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.<br/><br/>",

These abilities &quot;break the rules&quot;, and give to his plane additional bonus and special capabilities - for example, ignoring certain jamming results, getting an aim bonus, getting away with risky maneuvers.<br/><br/>The Ace Cards included in the Promo Pack go even further, by presenting real WW1 pilots and giving to each of them a selection of Ace abilities based on actual historical documents of their fighting skills.  The pack includes 7 famous personalities: the &quot;Red Baron&quot; Manfred Von Richthofen, Max Immelmann, Willy Coppens, Silvio Scaroni, Lanoe George Hawker, Jean Navarre and Frank Luke.<br/><br/>Each Ace is represented by a card with his photo, indicating the period in his career which is represented by the card's abilities, as well as historical data about him (including the number of recorded victories), and his skills.<br/><br/>The skills are then presented in individual cards, each card including the description of the skill and how it modifies the Wings of Glory rules.<br/><br/>",

Play the role of a hero as your storm Icecrown Citadel with your friends against the evil that has plagued Northrend for too long. Or, play as that evil and conquer the world!<br/><br/>This four-player game has everything you and three friends need to play all in the box. Play as Highlord Tirion Fordring, Lady Jaina Proudmoore, or Queen Sylvanas Windrunner and battle against the Lich King! Each player takes a deck, and the three heroes of Azeroth team-up to free the land from the threats of Icecrown Citadel. If the 3-on-1 seems unfair, know that the Lich King raid deck has some of the most powerful cards you've ever seen. He's no mere mortal! Plus, each deck comes with the hero's legendary weapon: the Ashbringer, Staff of Antonidas, Frostmourne, and Deathwhisper. The decks also feature new art for Fire Blast, Frostbolt, Counterspell, Multi-Shot, Redemption, Hammer of Justice, and others!<br/><br/>Cryptozoic has streamlined the raid deck experience, making it far more friendly to new players. There are no new rules to learn; each player takes his or her turn just as they would in a normal game of World of Warcraft TCG. The included rulebook ensures that even completely green recruits can jump in the action.<br/><br/>The three raiding decks easily convert into tournament-legal Core decks as well. Just replace the hero card, remove the legendary weapon, and you can battle at your local Core Constructed or Battlegrounds event.<br/><br/>Each four-player game comes packaged with an Assault on Icecrown Citadel Treasure Pack, and the Treasure Packs are sold separately as well. There are 20 uncommons, 7 rares, and 3 epics in the set. Each pack contains 9 foil cards (8 uncommons and 1 rare or 1 epic) unleashing never-seen-before allies, abilities, quests, and equipment cards into the World of Warcraft TCG card pool. Find Muradin Bronzebeard, High Overlord Saurfang, and Highlord Tirion Fordring as new allies to join your party. Recruit the best of Northrend before you go back to the mainland. You also have the chance to open Loot cards from Worldbreaker: Mottled Drake, Grim Campfire, and Landro's Lil XT.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This map-focused expansion for BATMAN&trade;: GOTHAM CITY CHRONICLES offers a new double-sided game board representing two unique and iconic locations. Wage viscous battles amid the reeking waters of the Gotham City Sewers, and defend justice at the GCPD Police Headquarters. <br/>In the accompanying booklet you will find 10 new missions for Versus mode for use with these new maps as well as the expansion boards found in Season 1 (Arkham Asylum, The Joker&rsquo;s Funhouse and Wayne Manor). <br/>Additionally, for when the Dark Knight needs a little extra power, this set includes a new double-tile for Batman&rsquo;s Trasher Suit.<br/><br/>The Sewer<br/>The sewers spawn a game board with a tight almost claustrophobic environment, obstructed lines of sight, a warren of walls and snug quarters full of villainy.<br/>However, a section of the board is higher than the rest, which opens up lines of sight into many of these otherwise hidden zones, while providing the promontory bonus. But that aside, you are still going to have to sneak through the maze of abandoned quarters to look your opponent straight in the eye as you shoot.<br/>These flophouses are excellent hiding spaces but achieving mission objectives will require you to hunt down evil in its&rsquo; lair, then melt away before the tide of approaching goons overwhelm you.<br/>The board is separated into four large areas, the sluice clearly delineates 3 boundaries and the height difference between the zones adds another. Getting around the board requires a significant amount of movement, crossing the stinking sewers or jumping across takes a toll.<br/>If you want to move about this board, better keep some cubes in reserve. Smooth area movement is a strategic requisite, hindering can shut your mobility down hard, so maintaining control of area boundaries is essential.<br/>All this restriction is counterbalanced by highly mobile or parkour talented characters. They can easily navigate over the torrenting sluice and continue onwards, while highly mobile characters, like Killer Croc or King Shark can cross the board with ease as if the water wasn&rsquo;t there allowing them access to an impressive amount of the board. <br/>These characters are a valuable asset on this board, as the open up the possibility of sneaking behind enemy lines or quickly providing reinforcement to overrun areas, in other words, it&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg time.<br/><br/>Police Headquarters<br/>With this brand new game board we are presenting another important and exciting location in Gotham City. This building serves as a bastion of law and order and a shield against chaos. From this location, brave men and women organize and mobilize to ensure the innocent are protected and the wicked are brought to justice. Under the dedicated watch of Commissioner Gordon and his trusted officers, the GCPD prevails time and again against the looming threats of the criminal underworld. <br/> The Police Station allows you to play through new adventures, such as protecting (or destroying) compromising evidence or ensuring the safe release of significant prisoners.<br/> This board is organized into several sections, spanning several levels. On the ground floor, a long hallway allows characters to benefit from various lines of sight; but there are also intermittent columns which create advantageous cover. <br/> Some areas, however, are more confined. These are ideal for the placement of objectives, such as cells, interrogation rooms, and the medical examiner&rsquo;s facility. These areas are more difficult to access and well protected, so players will need to carefully consider the best routes to securing scenario objectives. <br/> Each level offers different gameplay opportunities. On the first level, there are chief inspectors. This office, completely surrounded by walls, offers a necessary refuge for when the police station is under siege. The second floor overlooks a large corridor offering many tempting lines of sight. The archives sector, however, is a more enclosed space, offering only limited lines of sight. Those who can breach walls will, of course, have the option to cross over into adjacent rooms. Finally, the statue and columns of the police station allow particularly agile characters to quickly and easily access different levels and to avoid opponents&mdash;should that be of strategic benefit. <br/> Because of its difficult terrain and the hidden paths created by columns, this board favors mobile characters. Centralized areas can be very dangerous due to the various lines of sight, and those attempting to cross should do so with caution.<br/><br/>10 Versus missions<br/> This new game boards pack comes with:<br/><br/>     A booklet with 10 new missions for the Versus mode expansion which allows to play new skirmishes on these two new game boards and on those of the expansions:<br/><br/><br/>&bull;2 missions on the police station game board.<br/>&bull;2 missions on the sewers game board.<br/>&bull;2 missions on the Wayne Manor game board (Wayne Manor expansion)<br/>&bull;2 missions on the Arkham Asylum game board (Arkham Asylum expansion)<br/>&bull;2 missions on the Joker&rsquo;s Funhouse game board (Arkham Asylum expansion)<br/><br/>     8 new tokens that represent new types of objectives and allow to play with hidden objectives.<br/>     Since many of you requested, one of these new missions for the Versus mode is to be played with double tiles. This is why you will find in this pack the double tile of Batman Trasher Suit (from the Wayne Manor expansion) as well as its life points marker.<br/>    All the new Leader powers for all the new miniatures from season 2 (expansions, picking zone...). Those powers allow the new characters to be selected as Leaders when playing the Versus mode expansion.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
