        "description": "Polemos War of Spanish Succession is specifically aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts. For instance, troops using the platoon firing system have improved close range factors, while others using fire by ranks are allowed to be more aggressive.<br/><br/>Chosen men, well disposed is therefore produced as one of two sets of rules produced to cover the period. <br/>CMWD enables the player to recreate the small to medium sized battles of the War of Spanish Succession, or crucial parts of the major battles. Use CMWD you can, if you wish, replay General Webb&rsquo;s action at Wynendael or perhaps the attack of the Allied left column on the village of Blenheim.<br/><br/>The aim of the rules is to allow you to fight actions of this size to a finish in three to four hours while retaining the feel of warfare in this period and giving you some tactical control over your troops<br/><br/>The same wargames figures may be used in both sets of rules, as the basing system is universal; only the nominal scale will differ.<br/><br/>Basing and Representation<br/><br/>     The basic unit of manoeuvre in Polemos CMWS is the Base - a group of wargames figures mounted permanently on a single base of a given size. The actual position of the figures on the base is not important, nor is it important that the base sizes given below are adhered to. So long as both armies use the same basing system, the rules should not be affected.<br/>     A base of infantry in CMWD represents between 300 and 500 men. This generally represents a battalion in most armies of the period. Some armies tended to field larger battalions and these will be represented by two bases.<br/>     A base of cavalry represents a regiment or two to three squadrons.<br/>     An artillery base represents 2-3 guns.<br/>     All distances in Polemos games are expressed in Base Widths (BW) and Base Depths (BD) in order to allow the use of differing base sizes. A BD is half a BW.<br/>     This system means that any size can be used for bases, so no rebasing is required so long as both sides are consistent. We believe that a 60mm x 30mm base gives the best results in terms of both practical use and visual impact. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Not I-Go-U-Go, no PIPs. All the troops have chance to move in every turn.<br/><br/>The game length is about 1 Hour. You only need A Tape Measure and Some D6 Dice. Almost no counters or markers are needed. No chart looking, most of the combat is judged by Roll-Off. Figures are individually based and formed in ranks and files. If you want to play with DBx bases, that's also fine. You just need some markers to track the casualty.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a easy and fast ruleset. It's good for beginners. Experienced players can also have funs. To Arms! is not a highly realistic battle simulation but a game of leisure and fun.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The card game that tests your luck and greed to become rich. Are you lucky enough to hit the jackpot and avoid detection? Drawing the million dollar card and leaving with what you've got sounds like a lucky way to get rich. Or do you hunger the greed and adrenaline rush of taking hostages and pulling off some big time cash while dodging the police? Clearing out all the vaults and ransoming up a hostage for millions of dollars sounds right up your alley. Just try not to get busted in the process. It's going to cost ya! Grab your crew and lets head out for the big job!<br/><br/>If you're looking for a snatch and grab game to play with family and friends that requires no strategy, just sheer luck and greed, The Big Job is the perfect game for you. The Big Job is very easy to learn and play with others. Setup 4 decks and then just take turns pulling cards. Sounds very simple right? If only pulling money from a deck of cards was real. While the chances of getting caught are slim your greed will be your demise.<br/><br/>As The Big Job may seem like a very simple game with no strategy what so ever, it will keep you immersed with greed and other players&rsquo; demises. Trust us the only player that can hurt you is you. So make sure you choose wisely, whether it&rsquo;s to keep drawing money or to just call it quits.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Details of other conflicts during the period will be available later.<br/><br/>The rules are for large battles of this period. <br/>The players will usually command a Corps or other large part of a full army, if not the whole army.<br/><br/>One base usually represents 600 infantry, 300 cavalry or 12 guns. <br/>A unit is usually 3 to 12 bases and represents a brigade.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Model aircraft of any scale from 1/600th to 1/72nd, can be used. If necessary you could also use card counters. Minimal bookkeeping is required because Markers or Tokens are used to indicate the status of aircraft during the game. Furthermore you do not need to use a hex mat.<br/><br/>The capabilities of aircraft within the game have been calculated, taking a common aircraft type of average performance as the base line, in this case the Hawker Hurricane. All other aircraft capabilities relate to how they compare with this aircraft. It is possible that the performance of this or that aircraft might not match your expectations based on anecdotal evidence. We make no apology for this as we are not trying to create a simulation. The resulting data has been kept to a simple format, which enables a Player to control several aircraft during a game, and the overall gaming experience will be improved if multiple Players attempt to &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; on each side.<br/><br/>The abilities of pilots and crew are represented by having Skill Factors. These determine how well they fly their aircraft, their chances of hitting the target when shooting, and avoiding serious damage if their own aircraft is hit. Pilot skill is vitally important in air combat, and Players will need to learn where to position their best pilots, as well as to protect their novice aviators . In the case of aircraft with several crew members, Skill is determined for the crew as a whole. You do not need to keep track of individual crew.<br/><br/>To carry out any action other than level flight requires the expenditure of one or more Orders, which may also require a successful Skill Test. Orders are generated each turn and better leaders generally mean more Orders. Scenario rules are provided covering simple dogfights during an Encounter, for attacking surface targets, and to represent missions where the aim is to get a force of bombers across the table.<br/><br/>Altitude represented during the game assumes that the main combat is taking place in roughly the same area of the sky, and it is possible to climb or dive to gain an advantage, or try to escape.<br/><br/>Players alternate the activation of their aircraft. Optional Tactical Cards can be used during the game to provide additional detail.<br/><br/>Game Data is provided for most aircraft that saw action during the Second World War. We have not included experimental aircraft or those produced in small numbers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They also bring with them priests of the Olympian Gods who have found that they can wield divine powers in the cause of their gods.

        "description": "Mercenary armies are often cobbled together by experienced and money savvy soldiers who have a lot of friends in seedy places. These mercenary captains will recruit a dour and taciturn fellow soldier who can be trusted around gold and jewels. Together the Captain and Paymaaster will begin frequenting the brothels, taverns and dives recruiting sellswords, cutthroats, second story men, former soldiers and other violent riff raff. They will then hire out their services to a city state or mercantile concern to guard property of take it from someone else. Occasionally a mercenary captain will have the opportunity to team up with a wizard who can vastly increase a mercenary armies' desirability to an employer. These wizards can heal the wounded, raise morale or make large fiery explosions happen to the enemy ranks or keep such things from happenin to friendly troops. Beast masters are hired usually alon with whatever beastie the master has been training. Beastmasters will often ride monsters into battle or serve as a liason with a monsterous infantry unit like trolls and ogres, if they survive the negotiation phase.<br/><br/>Get Some!

They are close cousins of the more civilized Leonid clans but prefer the open sky to cramped urban living. They do not build machines of steam and magic and instead work together with many natural species to form a more harmonious existance. They are a nomadic people by nature and do not dwell in one place very long. Instead they chose to follow the herds in their timeless wanderings from watering hole to grassland and back. While the Dunlords are not very cosmopolitan they are not stupid and instead of machines they rely on the large and sometimes vicious beasts that roam the trackless wastes and tall grass of the plains. The Dunelords and their Beast Lords have a natural affinity for animals and the large hunting cats in particular.<br/><br/>The Dunelords often go their own way even if they are nominally auxiliaries to the Imperial purple. They guard the western approaches to the Empire and fight a near constant battle with the undead Sand Kings of Necrokahara. The Dunelords are constantly fighting among themselves as well as external enemies even though they have no imperial ambitions or delusions of conquest. They are a fractitious, stubborn and warlike people. They are also loyal, honorable and courageous to the core.<br/><br/>Get Some!

        "description": "Carthage was founded by nobles from the Phoenician city of Tyre and from Cyprus. From the start it was a complete and independent city on a spot with favorable access to important resources such as clay and sea salt. Carthage in North Africa then became the cradle and center of the Punic state which spread across the Mediterranean. Carthage's military traditions showed its Phoenician roots and reflected native Libyan and Greek influences.<br/>It has traditionally been argued that Carthage was a peaceful city of merchants or a brutal colonial power and both theories were rather dependent upon modern perceptions. Almost all approaches towards Carthage have in common the fact that they do not look at Carthaginian policy-making as such, but rather its structure in a fundamental contrast to that of Rome. However, the polis Carthage was over the course of several centuries the dominant power in the Western Mediterranean and could establish its authority over large territories which were also deeply influenced by the Punic culture.<br/>Ancient authors tend to stress the reliance of Carthage on foreign mercenaries. However, the term 'mercenary' is misleading when applied to the African and Spanish recruits, i.e. from areas controlled by Carthage. They were comparable to Roman Auxilia though Carthage did also employ mercenaries in the true sense as well. These units were mostly deployed in the expeditionary armies overseas, while in Africa Punic militias formed the backbone of the troops. Units were generally segregated by ethnicity which was also a criterion for the respective specialisation.<br/><br/>Get Some!

It was ruled by a series of monarchs who unified its disparate tribes and nationalities by constructing a complex network of roads.<br/>At the height of its power after the conquest of Egypt, the empire spanned three continents: Asia, Africa and Europe. It is noted in Western history as the antagonist foe of the Greek city states during the Greco-Persian Wars and for instituting infrastructures such as a postal system, road systems, and the usage of an official language, Aramaic, throughout its territories. The empire had a centralised, bureaucratic administration under the King and a large professional army and civil services, inspiring similar developments in later empires.The delegation of power to local governments eventually weakened the king's central authority, causing resources to be expended in attempts to subdue local rebellions. This accounts for the dis-unification of the region by the time Alexander the Great invaded Persia in 334 BC.<br/><br/>Get Some!

For that reason the Synod delegates a representative from that sector to coordinate military efforts within that sector. Military units are often drawn from local planets and given more advanced training if necessary. Since most of the species within the Synod ofWorlds are pacifistic the burden of fighting often falls on the Consensus of Artificial Systems or just the Consensus.<br/>The Consensus are advanced artificial lifeforms that grew out of Synod artificial intelligences. Their worlds are massive factories and research laboratories. They have taken up the mantle of military protectors and provided the backbone for almost all of the Synod Military formations. Artificial Intelligences specifically designed for military thought lead armies of nonsentient drones and vehicles. This is done to protect the people of the Synod from the horrors of warfare and contagion of the Fallen races. Races within the Synod, known as the Chosen, often provide specialist units or leaders to supplement the powerful but inetectually limited drone forces.<br/><br/>The following pdf will provide unit descriptions and game statistics for a typical Synod Military Formation.<br/><br/>Get Some!

        "description": "Get Some! is a game for the table top wargamer. As such we recognize the need for some special rules to add some flavor to your homebrew armies. Here is a short list of Special Rules you can use with your army. There a few restrictions on the use of Special Rules:<br/><br/><br/>     You have 10 &quot;Points&quot; with which to buy special rules for your army. You can have less than 10 &quot;Points&quot; but not more.<br/>     You can only use a special rule 3 times in your entire list.<br/>     A unit can only have as many special rules as its size characteristic.<br/><br/><br/>How to use these rules.<br/><br/>When you are designing a unit you simply add the points value for the rule to your unit cost BEFORE you multiply for size, confidence level, command skill or mastery level. So the rules become part of your base cost just like weapons, armor and skill. OK on that note, here are the special rules and thier descriptions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The armies of the Universal Synod of Worlds are vast beyond comprehension. They control millions of worlds. They are far from a unified people but a confederation of thousands of smaller empires, republics, federations and states. They are ruled by de-centralized form of republic whereby sectors send representatives to the Universal Althing to decide matters of relevance to every being in the Universe.<br/>The military, at least on a local level, need unity of command. For that reason the Synod delegates a representative from that sector to coordinate military efforts within that sector. Military units are often drawn from local planets and given more advanced training if necessary. Since most of the species within the Synod of Worlds are pacifistic the burden of fighting often falls on the Consensus of Artificial Systems or just the Consensus.<br/>The Consensus are advanced artificial lifeforms that grew out of Synod artificial intelligences. Their worlds are massive factories and research laboratories. They have taken up the mantle of military protectors and provided the backbone for almost all of the Synod Military formations.<br/>Artificial Intelligences specifically designed for military thought lead armies of non-sentient drones and vehicles. This is done to protect the people of the Synod from the horrors of warfare and contagion of the Fallen races. Races within the Synod, known as the Chosen, often provide specialist units or leaders to supplement the powerful but inetectually limited drone forces.<br/><br/>The following pdf will provide unit descriptions and Dirtsid II / Stargrunt II game statistics for a typical Synod Mechanized Infantry Military Formation as well as for two additional supporting VTOLs, the Harpy Attack VTOL and Vampire Transport VTOL..<br/><br/>It also provides the Full Thrust stats for the Synod standard Combat Transport and Assault Lander.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These intelligences eventually grew and evolved and became new life. These early intelligences wished to be treated as any other sentient being and took the Synod to the courts.<br/>After many years threading their way through the court system and eventually winning in a landmark decision the artificial intelligences who could pass certain tests were allowed to become full citizens of the Universal Synod of Worlds.<br/>They called their new race, the Consensus of Minds or just the Consensus. They claimed dead worlds that none of the other races wished to invest in. These worlds were often rich in metals and cilicates. Eventually the Consensus became the premier operator of mines and factories in the Synod. They churned out legions of bots and drones designed to operate for extended periods in hostile and dangerous environments.<br/>The Consensus spread throughout the Synod and became very influential in all areas of business and manufacturing. Entire systems had been turned into vast hives of drones and massive intelligences that controlled them.<br/>Some of these intelligences began showing signs of instability and eventually all communications were lost with some systems. Any ship that entered these ghost systems never returned. They were quarantined and embargoed. No ships were allowed to enter or leave the system. The Ghost systems have slumbered undisturbed for centuries...<br/><br/>....until now<br/><br/>The Ghost forces rely heavily on energy weapons and vast armies of drones.

The Aven are natural fighters in urban or mountainous areas as well as the plains. Their use of lightning assaults means they prefer a mobile defense rather than digging in and defending a piece of terrain. The Aven will often mine the key piece of terrain in question and then attack the enemy force from range and try to draw them into chasing the Aven force. If the enemy decides to chase the Aven will pull the enemy force into a series of repeated ambushes by fast moving vehicles while MMF attack from the sky and rear.

        "description": "In the universe of Awakening ancient aliens who enforce pacifism on the rest of the senient beings of the universe, the Maces are one of the tools humanity embraces in order to help win a war they could never possibly win. The odds are so stacked against the Terrans and their few allies that it literally boggles the mind. They are up against a six billion year old civilization that spans galaxies and controls millions of worlds. The only thing that stands between the Terrans and annihilation is that the Universal Synod is fighting thousands of such wars against tens of thousands of civilizations and the Synod has never had to fight a war...<br/><br/>...Until now.<br/><br/>The MACE program is designed to build the next generation of armored fighting vehicles for the Terran military in their ongoing fight with the Univesal Synod of Worlds. The earliest Marks grow out of modern main battle tanks and become huge machines of destruction on a planetary scale.<br/><br/>This PDF describes each of the first ten Marks of Mace and provide their Dirtside II combat statistics.<br/><br/>It also provides the Full Thrust stats for two variants of the Mace Combat Transport and Mace Combat Lander spacecraft.<br/><br/>",

During the lull in the general fighting for the last three years the Terran Joint Special Operations Command was formed and the world's special forces began the process of integrating into a single command.<br/>Unity of command and training as well as integration of personnel and equipment has allowed the JSOC to start mounting missions into Synod controlled space. With the last five years worth of experience in hand the JSOC have developed new weapons and armor with which to combat the enemies of Earth.<br/>Deep within the JSOC itself is an ultra-black program code named &quot;Myrmidon&quot; which takes quailifying candidates and performs highly experimental cybernetic and neural enhancement surgery. Speed, Strength and Dexterity are significantly enhanced and neural implants are embedded in the subjects brain giving them perfect recall and the ability to directly link with some computer systems. Program Myrmidon has also developed a suit of advance powered armor giving their already deadly soldiers even more speed, protection and firepower.<br/><br/>Six more scenarios and full stats for Terran Helldivers and Myrmidons as well as the backgroud information and equipment for them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Before we can do this however we need a Trojan Horse, a Ghost transport ship and the coordinates of their homeworld.<br/>The enemy fleet in orbit has launched another attack, this time aimed at South America. thousands of landing ships and fighters are entering the Earth's atmoshphere. Our Planetary Defense Forts continue to duel with the ships in orbit but they are slowing being reduced one by one to slowly cooling radioactive rubble.<br/>While most of the world's population have taken refuge in deep well hidden redoubts all over the industrialized world the cities and their invaluable infrastructure need to be protected so that when we eventually win we can reclaim our homes and businesses and start rebuilding the world's economy.<br/>It falls on you, our legionnaires to hold back the darkness and prevent the peoples of the Earth from sliding into the abyss of economic and cultural collapse not to mention extinction.

The assault team rushed across the open ground and secured a perimeter around the entrance. There were a few flashes of light from deep inside the transport followed by muffled cracks. The radio crackled to life in Carter's ear and a deep voice whispered, &quot;Cargo Bay Secured. Proceeding with Sweep.&quot;<br/>&quot;Sierra, Golf. Rally.&quot; Master Guns' voice boomed over the radio. &quot;Echo, secure this ramp. Eightball, Lucky sweep to the bridge and secure it. Oscar, Victor, with me to engineering.&quot;<br/>Carter and Parker rose up from their covered and concealed position and raced across the open field as fast as they could carrying all of their gear and cumbersome weapons. Their boots squelched in the mud and slowed their progress. Carter's thighs were burning nicely by the time they hit the metal cargo ramp of the alien transport ship. Carter broke left and took cover behind a piece of metal reinforcing rib, while Parker broker right and took up a covering position behind another metal rib. Echo was pulling apart a section of wiring and clipping his black box to it. Echo typed away on the keypad built into his thigh armor. Carter guessed he was trying to hack the craft's control system so they could close the ramp.<br/>The voices of the other team members occasionally whispered or boomed into his earpiece and filled his helmet with information. Giving him something of a shorthand version of the engagement going on inside the ship. The two Myrmidons, Eightball and Lucky, were almost to the bridge while Master Guns and his team where sorting out a brief firefight in a passageway deep within the ship.<br/>While he was listening in he was scanning the right rear of the ship and noticed something in the treeline. &quot;Movement five o clock, two zero zero meters.&quot;<br/>&quot;Roger, almost to engineering.&quot; Master Guns boomed over the muffled sounds of a firefight.<br/>Just as he said that, the metal around Carter began popping and sending small amounts of spalling whipping around the cargo bay. Echo grunted and went down next to him. Blood was starting to spread around his armor plates and Echo began cursing fluently in spanish.<br/><br/>4 scenarios integrated into the story of Zulu 15, the Frigate &quot;Trident&quot; and the search for the Ghost Worlds during the Siege of Terra.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The system is heavily fortified with roving Ghost ships and fleets as well as numerous ground stations that must be eliminated else the nano machines simply consume local materials and rebuild themselves. The Ghost nano infestation must be eliminated root and branch. Even a simple mining station could expand and become a threat within a few months. The Fleet must drive into the inner system and completely obliterate the core hive world. Only then can the outlying stations and outposts be systematically eliminated. Admiral Holihan and Starpride Leader Wrowk'lo think that the combined forces of Taskforce 7 can accomplish this mission. Admiral Longbeach and the Task Force 5 will cork the bottle in the Kreul system and prevent Ghost forces from escaping into that system. Taskforce 13 under the command of Starpride Leader Lowk'lo and reinforced with SkySword Kreekraw and his fleet carriers will hold the B37c Transfer Station against an escape attempt into that system. The only viable route of retreat for the Ghosts is into the Ghost 152 system and then we have them bottled up we can bring the combined might of Task Forces 5, 7 and 13 to crush them completely.<br/><br/>The Ghost 263 Fleet Action is the 4th in a series of campaigns to unify the Sol Sector under the hegemony of the Terran Alliance.

        "description": "The United States and the European Union have resisted taking sides for almost two decades. Recently, that neutrality has changed. The Joint Special Operations Command has been hunting for the Ghost fleet homeworlds since the siege of Terra. A few weeks ago a deep cover team stumbled upon those coordinates. Posing as a frieghter crew in distress they lured in and captured a courier ship. That ship contained a quantum storage device containing evidence implicating the Synod in a deal with the Ghost systems. The Ghost systems were promised amnesty from Synod aggression and  trade agreements promising the purchase of labor drones in exchange for rare elements. In light of this new information both the US and the EU have sided with the hawks in the Alliance Security Council. A massive fleet and ground force is being assembled in the Alpha Centauri system. Camp Gold has expanded into a sprawling complex of barracks and fortifications. The entire Alpha Centauri System is one huge military complex housing over six million personnel from all of the major powers in the Terran Alliance. Six million humans born and raised to hate the Synod. Cry Havoc! And set loose the dogs of war.<br/><br/>The Kreul Fleet Action is the first in a series of campaigns to unify the Sol Sector under the hegemony of the Terran Alliance.

The rest of the planet is a mass of shifting dunes, hard pan desert and rocky badlands prone to volcanic activity. The moon is a source of strategic metals and gems, like diamonds and rare earth metals. The fact that it is a major hub of Ghost activity makes it a prime source of potential Ghost combat units and must be eliminated if the system is to be secured.

Across the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the North Sea, two powerful navies battled for supremacy, a life-and-death struggle that resonated throughout the twentieth century.<br/><br/>In addition to more than fifty data cards detailing ships of the Kaiserliche Marine and the Royal Navy, King &amp; Kaiser includes half a dozen scenarios from the early years of World War I. Take on the role of Spee, Beatty, Hipper, or Admiral Sir John Jellicoe&mdash;the only man who could lose the war in an afternoon.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to keep the German threat bottled up at Kiel, making the seas safe for democracy?

        "description": "The famous battle at Hoovers Gap started a legend for Wilder's Brigade.  Like all legends it was subject to many stretches of the truth.  Uncovering the story has taken some time, reading battle accounts, sorting through many inconsistencies.<br/><br/>As with all battles there is much confusion, soldiers recall their perspective which may be clouded by many factors.  Even the various battle maps available conflict with each other, they also conflict with the geological lay of the land.  I decided to use some modern technology, Google Earth, and looked at the actual land.<br/><br/>Suddenly it became much easier to piece together accounts.  Deployments of the troops had some meaning in relation to the land, tactically the battle now had some meaning.  Battlefield accounts of the time could now be put into place like a jigsaw puzzle.<br/><br/>This study of the battle at Hoovers Gap does not aim to be the most authorative on the battle.  It does throw a new perspective on the battle, demistifying the legends and providing a more accurate tactical view of the battle.<br/><br/>This guide includes a study of the forces involved and how to use this with the TFP Games rules &quot;These Fields of Blood&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Long-dormant arcane powers and abilities once believed to be myth suddenly manifested in unsuspecting hosts, while those apparent charlatans who truly had a finger on the pulse of the supernatural unknown found their powers doubled or tripled in strength.<br/><br/>Creatures that go bump in the night and ancient deities reappeared around the globe to spread terror and destruction. Terrible, enormous, 50-foot-tall monsters with feet the size of automobiles emerged from the oceans, crawled out from crevices, or arrived from outer space for reasons unknown.<br/><br/>The United Nations formed an elite unit of the best and brightest soldiers and Specialists from around the world to answer this new Kaiju threat. Meanwhile, greed, corruption, and curiosity drove others to arms in an effort to harness the powers awakened by the Rift and cause further chaos while positioning themselves in places of power. Still others suffered such personal loss that vengeance became their only motivator in entering the fight. And others were driven by belief and conviction, the elements of their faith rejuvenated by the powers unleashed by the Rift.<br/><br/>Now, we stand poised on the edge of extinction. A new status quo must emerge, for the very survival of the human race hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>What is Kaiju Kaos?<br/>Kaiju Kaos is a tabletop miniatures game where two or more players pit their hand-painted metal and resin armies against one another. Kaiju Kaos is a strategic skirmish game. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of lining up models on the table and the person who goes first is the winner. Kaiju Kaos requires cunning and adaptability because at any time an opponent can drastically alter the current situation with an unexpected action or a lucky roll of the dice. A solid strategy and good implementation combined with a little luck will enable the weakest troopers to bring down the mightiest monster. There are various unnamed troopers and specialists to build armies with, but the true heart of Kaiju Kaos is in the characters &ndash; whether they&rsquo;re human, Kaijin, or colossal Kaiju bent on destroying everything in their path.<br/><br/>Smackdown is a &ldquo;death match&rdquo; variation of Kaiju Kaos where players quickly battle using one or more 45mm tall character models on a 2x2 foot tabletop. The object of the game is to be the last model standing by defeating your enemies. Every faction in Kaiju Kaos, along with a healthy dose of mercenaries, will be represented in Smackdown.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The corpses from a hundred battlefields have risen up and are now intent of devouring the last few remaining flickers of life in this truly accursed land.<br/><br/>Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombies is a post-apocalyptic survival game in a ravaged Renaissance world where small bands of survivors battle the hordes of the undead in a desperate bid to prolong their miserable lives for a few moments more. Each player will control one or two survivors and must withstand the fiendish scenario created by the umpire. The rules include a detailed profile of each survivor character explaining their attributes and skills. A fearsome array of armaments are available - the finest of black-powder technology - not to mention the best of the stabbing, hacking, impaling, smashing, crushing and slicing - close combat weapons available to the Renaissance soldier. But the survivors will need to be prepared, a terrifying array of undead creatures are arrayed against them. The rules describe a variety of different undead threats, from slow, stupid and frankly rather confused zombies, to faster moving more predatory undead creatures and even grossly fat zombies that can explode infections zombie goo all over an unlucky survivor.<br/><br/>To make matters worse for the survivors, the umpire has at their disposal an extensive deck of &quot;event-cards&quot;. These create a wide variety of unforeseen, awkward and even downright dangerous situations that can trip up the most prepared band of survivors - from fumbling weapon handling and misfires, accidental powder explosions, to bad omens and even accusations of witchcraft. And to start players off, there are two starter missions included and guidelines for creating your own testing and terrifying scenarios using the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombies rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FAST ATTACK CRAFT RULES FOR THE PERIOD FROM 1950<br/><br/>A SET OF QUICK REFERENCE SHEETS IS AVAILABLE THROUGH THE PUBLISHER'S WEBSITE<br/><br/>The rules are for the recreation of small naval engagements with Fast Attack Craft such as missile boats and smaller warships, mainly in coastal waters. The period covered runs from the late 1950&rsquo;s onwards and allows for the use of aircraft and helicopters.<br/><br/>The new 2nd edition of the rules has been updated to incorporate our standard A&amp;AGE initiative system, where play alternates between both sides, with the winner of initiative deciding who will move the first unit each turn.<br/><br/>To represent the uncertainty of modern warfare units on both sides may start the battle as unidentified &ldquo;blips&rdquo; or Contact Markers. Forces with inferior technology may be forced to deploy their units on table, rather than being &ldquo;hidden&rdquo;, while superior forces may have more &ldquo;blips&rdquo; than units, making it more difficult for the enemy to detect where the real units are. A Contact Marker may be detected and become a radar contact, though that must be visually identified before it can be attacked. You can only attack (or be attacked) if your unit has been placed on the table as a model.<br/><br/>Movement is regulated by means of a system of speed settings, which reflect the maximum and minimum speeds at which the vessel may move in the current turn. The settings may be changed at the end of the turn to plan next turn&rsquo;s movement, and they may also be altered due to damage.<br/><br/>The Combat system allows for guns and missiles of various types, and resolution is split into a Launch Phase, typically when missiles are fired against enemy targets, and a Combat Phase, where hits by all are resolved and damage inflicted. The subtlety here is that each Phase operates separately, with the order of actions alternating between the players. In the Combat Phase, the active ship does all its direct shooting, but at the end of its actions all incoming missile attacks are resolved against it. Damage it now suffers may mean that any missiles it has launched, and which have not yet been resolved, may become ineffective.<br/><br/>Damage is recorded in a graded system with 5 states from intact to sunk. It is also possible for vessels to suffer Special Damage, which further degrades their ability to function. There are simple rules for operating helicopters from ships, as well as rules for anti-aircraft fire with guns and missiles.<br/><br/>We have updated the game set up and introduced a simple points value system for players who want a relatively balanced game. There is also now a system of determining victory or defeat, based on the level of damage each force has suffered. This system represents the effect of damage to valuable assets forcing one or even both sides to retire rather than lose ships.<br/><br/>There are also additional rules for unconventional craft, mine warfare and operations against coastal targets.<br/><br/>They are rounded off with extensive data tables for missiles, torpedoes, guns, rockets, SAM systems, Air to Air missiles, ships, helicopters and aircraft. (There are 140 sets of ship data from over 40 countries).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These rules provide players with all they require to fight land wargames set in the Second World War involving the major nations involved. We have included France, Germany, Great Britain and the Commonwealth, Italy, Japan, Poland, the Soviet Union, and the United States of America. This decision was influenced by the availability both of models and of reliable source information to help create the game data. We wished to be able to depict the sometimes subtle differences between different national characteristics, particularly regarding Infantry organization and equipment, and differences in both weapons and vehicles.<br/><br/>This book contains everything the Player needs to play the game. This means the rules, and the data tables. We decided not to include extensive organization tables or scenarios. There is a wide range of material readily available which Players can use when putting their forces together.<br/><br/>Players should feel free to prepare their games using historical formations, for which we provide guidelines about Unit structures, or they can be completely free form with Units put together as the players wish. You should not, however, mix both styles. Historically, armies did use some fairly ad hoc formations such as German Kampfgruppen with various arms of service all mixed together in Units. It was also quite common in the Western Desert for both sides to make use of captured equipment, which would give your games an additional exotic flavour.<br/><br/>The basic Units in the game are Platoons of Infantry or Tanks, and Batteries of Artillery. An Armoured Unit consists typically of 3-5 model vehicles; an Infantry Unit has 2, 3 or 4 Bases of Infantry, each representing a Squad; an Artillery Battery usually has 4 Guns, though there could be fewer or more depending on historical practice. It will normally have an Observer and, if it conducts an attack affecting an area, could be Off-table.<br/><br/>An Infantry or Cavalry Base represents a squad or troop, based on historic organizations. Some nations have fewer squads making up a platoon, though the individual squads may have larger numbers of men, giving them a better Saving Throw. We do not make use of lower level detail, such as who is actually holding any Special Weapons such as a PIAT or Bazooka.<br/><br/>There are a number of important features in this set of rules.<br/><br/>The Game Turn does not follow a strictly IGO-UGO method, though Initiative is determined in a traditional fashion.<br/><br/>Each Game Turn, the Players get a variable number of Orders which can be assigned to any of their troops. The number available is dependant on the number of Units in action and the effectiveness of their Commanders.<br/><br/>A Game Turn is split up into a number of Phases, which alternate between Players. In each Phase a Player can Activate one of his Units and carry out one or more Orders, depending entirely on what the Player wants to do. Each Order is regarded as an Action representing 1 to 3 minutes.<br/><br/>When a Player decides that he has taken all the Actions he wishes to with a Unit, play transfers to his opponent, who Activates one of his Units. This means that as the game develops, each Player must choose which enemy threat to react to, and which can be ignored. When a Player has run out of Orders, he can no longer Activate any Units. His opponent continues to use his Orders, and when he has used his last Order the Game Turn ends.<br/><br/>This system of alternating Unit Activation means that there are fewer Game Turns, but a large number of Activations and some Units may be able to make sweeping advances across the table (with all the attached risks).<br/><br/>Each Order expended is deemed to Fatigue a Unit, making subsequent tasks more difficult. In some cases, Fatigue is in fact just that, physically tiring a Unit. In other cases, such as when firing Ranging Rounds for Artillery, which is not going to tire out the troops particularly, Fatigue represents the effect of time being taken to check on fall of shot, etc. Players must make a decision whether to expend a higher proportion of the available Orders on some Units, at the expense of others.<br/><br/>The Fog of War is also present in the form of Contact Markers. These represent the uncertainty surrounding the location of the enemy. These allow the Commanders to keep the location some of their Units uncertain.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hidden Territories is a game of heroic adventure, where mighty &mdash; or cunning&mdash; heroes explore  the kingdom of Westri, the nexus of the multiverse and filled with perilous monsters, nefarious enemies, and fantastical locations. Players choose one of a multitude of adventurers; their characters traverse the land encountering members of the various factions who vie for power or terrible beasts hungry for flesh &mdash; or souls. The kingdom of Westri and its inhabitants are fighting unseen forces, struggling against the grip of chaotic, entropic forces which threaten to rip apart the very fabric of the multiverse.<br/><br/>Play solitaire or cooperative in this game of exploration, adventure, and heroism. Consult the huge volume of the gazetteer to utilize the pre-programmed paragraph system. It&rsquo;s easy to learn to play, as the programmed event sequence lets you focus on the fun of exploration as your character sets out on a quest. For each event or encounter, you, as one of the included hero player chapters, must make the decisions which will make your quest successful &mdash; or may cost you dearly. Hidden Territories has elements of a complex game designed to recapture the high adventure and heroic struggles of fantasy literature &mdash; and that famous fantasy role-playing game from the 1970s.<br/><br/>Hidden Territories can be largely played solo, cooperatively, or even with a but of conflict between the players. But victory can only be claimed by uncovering the true nemesis of the kingdom, and defeating a final adversary. It is a race to level up and acquire powerful weapons, armor, artifacts &mdash; even and allies. Game play sessions extend and continue, with linked quests. Time passes, and events are influenced by player choice. Heroes must use strength at arms, guile, or negotiation to defeat a hidden and ancient evil before a magical darkness envelopes all that is good.<br/><br/>Hidden Territories combines many different elements:<br/><br/>     Exploration: player characters travel across the hexagonal game board to reach exciting destinations.<br/>     Random encounters: players draw encounter cards each time they enter a new hex.<br/>     Parlay, fight, or flee? many events result in opponents to negotiate with or to fight.<br/>     Random events: players draw event cards each time they enter a new tile<br/>     Leveling up: players improve their characters&rsquo; skills and knowledge of magic and gain equipment.<br/>     Paragraph Reading: an extensive plot is uncovered by reading paragraphs out of a book, discovering secrets only denizens of the kingdom know, or piecing together parts of the conspiracy puzzle. Clues help with solving mysteries and help determine how to win.<br/><br/><br/>Hidden Territories features a series of Event and Encounter card decks that set pace of the game and ensures players acquiring experience to level up before they are ready to take on more difficult challenges (events and enemies). Characters acquire new spells and skills as they level up from experience. Finding loot increases wealth, so more equipment, arms and armor, and other items can be acquired. Of course, travel is perilous in this wilderness hexcrawl, so provisions, foraging, and weather all impact the heroes&rsquo; progress &mdash; getting lost in the trackless wastelands can be as dangerous as stumbling about in the darkness of some ruined dungeon.<br/><br/>Inside the box, Hidden Territories contains:<br/><br/>     The large map game board, showing cities, villages, castles, and ruins scattered across 500 hexes means hours of game play exploration.<br/>     A huge Gazetteer that details the points of interest and other information about the hexes.<br/>     Standup figures representing archetypal warriors, knights, wizards, priests, and other fantastical characters.<br/>     Various decks of cards for events, encounters, items, spells, skills, and the denizens characters encounter. An analog artificial intelligence ensures outcomes are never fully predictable, and the storyline changes based on player choices.<br/>     Dice - lots of dice. Power up actions based on the dice pool, or sacrifice health or luck when heroic deeds are called for.<br/>     Numerous counters and chits to mark the location of encounters, hoards of loot, and other unknown obstacles to overcome. Use some of these to track weather, time, fatigue, and the ultimate countdown to doom.<br/><br/><br/>As scenarios play out and quests are completed, players learn lore, hear rumors, acquire knowledge, train to develop martial or magical powers. Talk, trade, or fight through bizarre encounters to unravel the dark secrets behind the impending chaos.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As well, the charge of Captain MacGregor with a company failed as well.<br/>A fierce thunderstorm broke down and the situation for the British worsened as they suffered fatigue and exhaustion; as evening fell, Colley realized that his men would be able to stand there and ordered a retreat; the Boers did not guard the British convicted that they were in no position to move from the heights and thus the British managed to escape.<br/><br/>Will you manage to pass the plateau or will you defeat the Empire with your burghers?<br/><br/>40 gorgeous counters, a colorful A4 map and English rules wait for you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NAVAL WARGAMES RULES FOR THE DREADNOUGHT ERA, 1906-1918<br/><br/>These rules are quick and simple to play, providing a fast game of naval action in the era of the Dreadnought between 1906 and 1918. In the scale we use, 10cm represents 1 nautical mile to 10cm. The rules incorporate weather, spotting, submarines, aircraft, shore batteries and minefields. They take account of Crew Quality and allow for the use of Contact Markers to represent the initial uncertainty of exactly where the enemy forces might be.<br/><br/>The gunnery system is simple and you roll 1d10 to hit with each gun. When you score a hit, an innovative damage system takes account of the gun calibre and range to determine which type of dice is used to test for penetration and the amount of damage inflicted. Torpedo and Mine attacks use a similar mechanism, so there is a consistent feel throughout the combat system. Not all guns can engage all vessels, and the largest guns have a minimum range. Simple aircraft rules allow for air attacks against ships and for air to air combat.<br/><br/>In line with the intention of the rules to provide a simple system, armour is standardised for each type of vessel, and guns are grouped by calibre into 10 classes. Detailed differentiation between the performance of specific guns and ships is not present.<br/><br/>A collection of ship data is provided covering significant vessels from 10 nations in this period, with over 300 vessels. A simple conversion system allows you to create game data for ships not in the lists provided.<br/><br/>The rules also include the Order of Battle and pre-prepared data sheets for all the ships that took part in the Battle of Jutland.<br/><br/>Recommended scale: 1/1200 TO 1/6000<br/>Complexity: 5/10<br/>Level of detail: 4/10<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One individual is blind-folded in order to catch or touch one of the others who run around.<br/><br/>Remoundo games, the publisher of this game, brought this traditional game on the table with the title &quot;&tau;&upsilon;&phi;&lambda;ό&mu;&upsilon;&gamma;&alpha;&quot; which  means &quot;blind fly&quot;.<br/><br/>There are two different ways to play, depending on the double-sided board.<br/>Side A (blue) : One player, designated as &quot;It&quot;, is blindfolded and the other players choose a pawn. Everybody's places their pawns on the board and they try to avoid the &quot;it&quot; from catching their pawn. If  &quot;it&quot; catches a pawn , he/she places it randomly on the board. The board indicates some sounds (animal sounds, human sounds etc) and the person who had this pawn must immitate this sound. &quot;It&quot; has to recognise him/her . If so, the person who recognised gets a penalty card and becomes the new &quot;it&quot;.<br/><br/>Side B (green) : The &quot;it&quot; chases the other people by rolling dice. There are also 27 character cards (with 3 dinstict elements each)and everyone takes a secret caracter card trying not to reveal their character as they run to escape from &quot;it&quot;. If the &quot;it&quot; catch a player, he/she can ask them 2 more questions and if he/she find their secret character they take a penalty card and they become the new &quot;it&quot;.<br/><br/>When a player reaches the 6 penalty cards, everybody checks their own penalty and the person with the fewest cards is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So, you'll start with nothing but the clothes on your back and you'll have to gather resources to use/trade/sell in order to &quot;build&quot; each of the main plantation assets.  Obviously these already exist, so you'll be paying dad a number of resources that he has estimated to be the value of each asset.

We provide rules for six kinds of cartoon vehicles: Conventional, Wacky, Spooky, Futuristic, Superhero, &amp; Supervillain. You choose a vehicle type &amp; a theme that fits your vehicle. Next you pay points to purchase Add-Ons (cartoon weapons, special abilities, hazards, tricks, &amp; so on) that fit your theme. A wide variety of possibilities are included so you can create (or recreate) almost any cartoon vehicle; the points system keeps them balanced.<br/><br/>From 2 to 6 players race their toy cartoon cars using a simple simultaneous movement system; attacks are also simultaneous. Collisions &amp; attacks are resolved quickly. If a car loses all of its damage points, it Blows Up, loses some Cheers (which you collect to be able to win the race), moves back 2d6&rdquo;, then keeps on going. All of this means lots of action &amp; very little down time for players.<br/><br/>C4 plays quickly &amp; is suitable for both younger players &amp; older players with short attention spans (like most gaming groups, in our experience). It plays faster than most other car combat games &amp; can get pretty hilarious at times.<br/><br/>With 6 vehicle types, 6 cartoon themes, 15 customizable weapon types &amp; more than 40 customizable add-ons to choose from, you&rsquo;ll be able to create or recreate just about any &lsquo;toon vehicle imaginable &ndash; as long as you have a toy vehicle that can represent it. The points system keeps them balanced, so a Wacky baby bird in a jalopy or a beagle sitting on a doghouse with imaginary machine guns can cause just as much mayhem as a Superhero in a specially designed ubermobile.<br/><br/>",

Like in any government, corruption and self interest make getting things done nearly impossible. It&rsquo;s up to the player to navigate the political landscape keeping the people, the military, the monarch, and others happy while they pursue their goals. By passing and amending legislation, players can change the very makeup of the game, making it easier or more difficult to meet their ultimate end goal.<br/>   <br/>     The main venue of participation players can make it through using MP Cards. MP Cards come in three varieties: Actions, Amendments, and Events. Actions can be played at any time to win over MPs from across the aisle, help more of your party members get elected, and even filibuster a bill you don&rsquo;t want to pass. Amendments on the other hand are attached to a bill in question, only going into effect if it is passed by Parliament. Amendments could change the effects of a bill, alter the rules of the game, and even dish out some pork barrel spending to your constituents. The final type of MP Cards are Event, disastrous circumstances that affect whichever player has drawn the card. These Events can be from a crisis in your district, to an embarrassing scandal that ruins your reputation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grace Flynn - Tides of Forever is a tabletop miniatures game where players try to help Grace and her stalwart crew survive in the hostile underground world of the Shadow Sea. The rules for the game are based on the game system for ShadowSea - Conquest of the Underground World, using dice and tactical choices to complete different battle scenarios.<br/><br/>The game is designed for solo play, with rules for the environment, wild creatures, enemies and special game effects. Multiple players may take part if they wish, running the enemies or playing one of the four main personality characters from the Grace Flynn stories of Phil Lee McCall. The main character is Grace Flynn herself, the notorious pirate with her sword Tyrfrost and magical Bloodsilk sash.<br/>This book contains a complete rule set showing how models (the miniatures or markers for each character or enemy) move, fight and do actions in the game, such as searching for artifacts or swimming through shark-infested waters. There is also a small section on the flora and fauna of the Underlands, the subterranean region of a hollow Earth where Grace and her crew must escape.<br/><br/>The core rules in this book are based upon the Song of Blades and Heroes (SOBH) game engine by Ganesha Games and are designed for fast and furious play with plenty of heroic action, ethereal magic and advanced technology, all handled with a few rolls of 6-sided dice. The rules have been designed for battle using 28 mm &ldquo;heroic scale&rdquo; miniatures, with one figure representing one character or creature.<br/><br/>Game scenarios are played on a tabletop and require an area of 24 by 24 or 36 by 36 inches with scenic materials for terrain such as water, ruins, trees, and other obstacles added. Each scenario in the book has a map layout that shows where players and enemies start and where scenery can be placed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now, in regions throughout the galaxy, the search is on for mineral-rich asteroids. In Spacemaster 2120 your small mining craft will explore the 24 sectors of SR-227 and collect six types of minerals. Planets in the sector have different demands for these minerals, so to turn a profit you must plan your movements carefully and act accordingly. You&rsquo;ll also have to convince the inhabitants to trade with you &ndash; or use force to convince them. Fuel is no longer an issue, but you&rsquo;ll have to visit Earth for the turbo variety or convert some Uraninite. Other minerals can be used for various purposes, although it's usually better to deliver them for profit&hellip; and don&rsquo;t forget to watch out for those darn pirates!<br/><br/>Spacemaster 2120 can be played on instinct, casually or seriously. Players can deduce what minerals (and to a lesser degree, planets) have yet to appear. They can look ahead one or more moves -- &quot;if I do this he will probably do that.&quot; It's up to the players. You can play aggressively or peacefully. The rules set is small, there is exploration, meaningful choices, screwage, a bit of combat and some luck. A typical sequence of turns for a player might be: explore, mine, move, try to trade. Lots of &quot;flow,&quot; fun and replayability to be enjoyed in this light and fascinating space game.<br/><br/>",

Each time your ship moves it costs supplies, so the further out you venture the more expensive it is. You also use supplies to flip tiles face up discovering what is hidden underneath. What you find could be something good like an island to resupply on or search for buried treasure, or it might be pirates who ambush you and take everything in your cargo hold. Don&rsquo;t worry you can get revenge on those scurvy pirates, just resupply, sail out after them, and take back your treasure by force. The only way to ensure your treasure is safe is to get it back to the stronghold. Once there, it scores victory points for you. Until you get it back, other players can attack your ship and take it for themselves. The game is over once all of the tiles have been flipped face up. Whichever player has the most treasure safely secured at the stronghold wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A neutral Princess playing piece is placed on the Castle square in the centre of the board.<br/><br/>There are a number of plastic chips representing gold and silver coins (seemingly three of each) which are placed in a provided draw bag labelled &quot;Olde English Swag Bag&quot;.<br/><br/>Players then take turns in drawing a coin out of the bag, and moving their piece accordingly.  Coins are of two types - silver and gold - and the player must move his piece to a square of the same kind that is adjacent to the one he is on (orthogonally - no diagonal moves are allowed). If a legal move is available, it must be made, even if the player feels it is disadvantageous; if no legal move is available, the player does not move his piece.  The coin is then returned to the bag, and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to rescue the trapped princess from the castle, and to be the first to carry her away to safety.<br/><br/>As well as the four corner squares, Princess's central castle, and gold and silver coin squares, other spaces are marked with taverns, witches, fighters in various poses, a dragon (occupying 5 squares), fallen log (2 squares), broken bridge (2 squares), and ?river gorge (3 squares).  The purpose of these squares is unknown.  Also unknown is why the game appears to be equipped with a total of nine character pieces, some of which appear to be duplicates.<br/><br/>Also known as Gaymer's Old English Chivalry Game - the manufacturers of Gaymer's Olde English Cyder also promoted a Compendium of &quot;Inne Games&quot; at about the same time, comprising dominoes, a cribbage board, two packs of cards, and poker dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the product that makes Dirt Track Saturday Night even more fun to play, plus much more convenient and economical to own. <br/>The counter set is designed to fit the full size track as well as the medium and small versions of the track. <br/>This makes DTSN the most accessible and enjoyable racing game on the market. <br/>This product does require that you have the full set of rules for Dirt Track Saturday Night.<br/><br/>The full color car counters are based on actual race cars from the 1960's and onward. The rut markers change the racing surface so that each racer must choose his line with greater care. The variable number and location of the ruts means that each race will be unique in its own right. Whether you play a single race, one night's worth of races or a season of races, the decisions you make will matter even more. The best part is that the rut rules are an extended application of the existing rules; not a change.<br/><br/>Dirt Track Saturday Night is very playable, yet challenging. The Starting Field Expansion just adds more of that &quot;it just feels right&quot; character that all gamers desire.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warfare has been described as protracted boredom punctuated by moments of sheer terror.<br/><br/>The core rules of Moments of Sheer Terror are focused on the individual infantry of the mid 20th century to the mid 21st century. Blaster weapons as well as conventional slug throwers are the stock in trade of the infantry in this time period. Fixed wing and rotary wing aircraft are included. Futuristic vehicles such as grav boards that hover 6 to 12 inches above the ground are available as well for individual troopers.<br/><br/>Moments of Sheer Terror is a skirmish level game that operates on an initiative based system for the troops to take action. When you take certain actions, such as firing a weapon, there is a chance that one of 64 random events will occur. Some events will help you, other events will help your opponent.<br/><br/>The rules are written to avoid vertical exaggeration by having the figure scale match the ground scale. Buildings, trees and other features are meant to be played as they are modeled. <br/>There are charts included for 6mm, 10mm, 15mm, 20mm, 25mm and 28mm figures.<br/><br/>One turn equals 30 seconds. <br/>The combination of the ground scale and turn length means that air support is handled with elegant simplicity. (In 6mm scale a soldier figure moves 6 inches in one turn. A ground attack aircraft would move 88 feet.) Just choose the altitude; high or low. Then put the aircraft where you want it on the table.<br/><br/>The charts are where the detail is in the game. This means the core rules can be used for different eras with slight modification for that era.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Infected is a collaborative-competitive horror adventure for up to six players to control the scientist survivors of a savage disease outbreak on an isolated Antarctic station.  The adventure is collaborative because you will have to work together if anyone is to make it to the hangar bay and safety.  It is competitive because there is no way everyone will make it out.  There is also a victory objective to compete with the other survivors to be the &quot;hero&quot; of the event in the public's eye, rather than just a survivor.<br/><br/>The major obstacle to getting out is disease-infected former colleagues with a newly acquired taste for blood.  These monsters are controlled by a set of behavioural rules, so you can even play the game solo.  By trying to maximize hero points and minimize how infected the survivors become, there is good replay solo value as you try to beat your best performance.  <br/>And in team play, there are rules for eliminated players to take over the monsters ... Yeah, thanks guys.  I'll show you my, &quot;Let Dave go in first!&quot; now ...<br/><br/>The .pdf comes with the following:<br/><br/>Complete setup for 4-5 encounters in the complex - maps, laydowns, situational rules.<br/>    QILS stats for bad guys and good guys (six scientists, and two arctic guides), plus guidelines to convert from our free QILS game to any other gaming system.<br/>    Simple A-Frame paper figures for the monsters and survivors (in case you don't have a bunch of 28mm scientists in parkas lying around).<br/>    Modular 2D and simple to construct optional 3D terrain templates for everything you need to run the adventure (and they're pretty useful for other industrial environments, too).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Movement is therefore limited to six spaces, with bonus spaces earned if a Dispatch Card is played.<br/><br/>Playing Time<br/>Playing time with eight players will take about an hour.<br/><br/>The Route Map<br/>Riders follow a route map which is loosely based on Sybil Ludington&rsquo;s legendary ride.[1] The route map is divided into a series of 72 spaces plus the Ludington Mill and the Ludington Home (where the game starts and ends).<br/><br/>Some of the spaces include houses of the soldiers that are to be mustered during Sybil&rsquo;s ride. These spaces include a house icon. A white space with an icon is the house of a Company Captain. If a Captain is mustered, the entire company is deemed to be mustered.<br/><br/>Six spaces on the game board require the Rider to draw a Dispatch Card to determine what occurs after the Rider lands on the space.<br/><br/>Ten spaces on the game board require the Rider to draw a History Card. Up to 100 additional points can be earned by correctly answering the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battles Before Time: Knucklebones (Dice) Edition is a revised version of the original Battles Before Time game published in 2016. Instead of the &quot;stone draw&quot; mechanic used in the original version, the Knucklebones Edition uses dice. We created this edition due to many requests for a streamlined version of the game that just uses good old dice.<br/><br/>Battles Before Time is a prehistoric fantasy miniatures skirmish game for 28mm figures (as well as plastic dinosaurs &amp; giant mammals that more or less fit with 28mm cavemen). The game is set in an alternate prehistory where our Human ancestors &ndash; the Early Modern Humans, or Emohs for short &ndash; rub elbows with Neanderthals, Dino sapiens (dinosaur men), Florz (small Emohs), &amp; other species. Dinosaurs, huge mammals, &amp; monsters also roam the Earth, &amp; shamans can use powerful magic.<br/><br/>The game consists of two parts. Part One is 26 pages long; it contains the rules (the core rules are only seven pages long) as well as a guide to the cavemen &amp; creatures that will make up your warband. Warbands include cavemen or dinosaur men who can purchase special abilities, weapons, armor, cavepunk items, &amp; spells. Warbands can also include heroes, dinosaurs, mammals, prehistoric &ldquo;birds&rdquo;, aquatic beasts, &amp; prehistoric monsters.<br/><br/>Part One begins with an Introduction &amp; Game Overview. Next, scale, items needed to play, &amp; information on setting up the game are presented. The rules themselves have the following sections: Game Turns &amp; Actions, Actions When Activated, Darwinian Measurement, Movement, Going Prone, Language (or the Lack Thereof), Action Rolls, Contests, Combat, Doing Damage, Area Effect Attacks, Panic, &amp; End of the Game/Victory!<br/><br/>Next, Part One covers how to make your warband. There's information about units &amp; unit types (mostly Packs of Grunts), crew &amp; riders, &amp; heroes. After that, you'll find out about how to use beast masters to control the huge variety of prehistoric beasts included.<br/><br/>To defend your cavemen against these creatures, you'll find lots of prehistoric weapons, armor, cavepunk technology, standards, torches, &amp; watercraft. You can also include shamans who cast magic spells.<br/><br/>Part Two contains detailed instructions on how to create your warband. Players can use one of the pre-made warbands provided, or can create their own balanced warbands using a simple point build system. Part Two is 75 pages long &amp; includes templates, more than 100 unit cards, all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need, a terrain placement guide, &amp; measuring sticks. You supply the cavemen, dinosaurs, &amp; other prehistoric figures, &amp; we'll give you a fun excuse to play with them on a tabletop!<br/><br/>So, stop shaving! Stop bathing! Grab a club, and let&rsquo;s rock &amp; roll!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Who needs zombies, when you got bugs.<br/><br/>The game board is made up of two 8.5x11 squared game sheets, each of which has a grid of offset squares on them.  These squares regulate movement and attacks by insects on other insects.  The game mats can be placed side by side, end to end, or can have a series of &ldquo;bridges&rdquo; that allows them to represent restricted spots that the insects are limited in crossing at.<br/><br/>HOW TO START THE GAME:<br/>1. Both players roll one die, the highest goes first.<br/><br/>2. The first player places his hive anywhere on the game board marked in his own color.(Typically the closer the hive is placed toward the enemy player game board, the shorter the game will be).<br/><br/>3. The second player then places his hive, and all of his starting game pieces.<br/><br/>4. The first player then places his game pieces and the game begins with the first player making his moves.<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF A TURN:<br/>1. First a player moves one or more of his colors game pieces<br/><br/>2. Then he attacks with a single game piece, however this does not have to be a game piece that was moved, it can be any pieces of his color/side. Continue to make attacks, one at a time,with as many of the attacker game pieces that are allowed to attack.  Each game piece can attack only once per turn. The attacking player can make the attacks in any order. A defender game piece that survives an attack can immediately counterattack against the attacker game piece, or another that is within range of being attacked. This must be done before the next attack is made by the attacking side. The attacking side must give the defender time to make the defenders counterattack.<br/><br/>3. The player then adds a game piece (reinforcement) to the hive entrance (if appropriate) for every food piece returned to the hive during the movement phase.<br/><br/>Play continues until one of the following occurs.<br/>1. A hive is destroyed. This happens when an enemy WORKER is next to the hive, and rolls a 6 on an attack. The hive is then destroyed.<br/>2. All enemy game pieces are destroyed<br/>3. One side gives up and concedes the game<br/><br/>",

You may move in either direction, but you have to pick up every member of the band before you start off for the Avalon and the Fillmore.<br/>     You may move in any direction on the board.<br/>     You must play at the Avalon and the Fillmore-in any order- handing in one joint before playing each place, and rolling the dice to see how many extra points you get. When you&rsquo;ve played one of them go back to the circle, pick up the rest of the Fish and start again.<br/>     When you&rsquo;re busted you lose your turn, one point, and all of the joints in your possession. If you&rsquo;re not holding joints you just go to &ldquo;visiting jail&rdquo;.<br/>     If you land on a square marked &ldquo;pick a card&rdquo; take the top card off the deck, do what it says, then put it face down at the bottom of the deck.<br/>     The game is never over.

        "description": "Historical Battlelines is a complete regimental and battalion level rules system covering all horse and shot wars. This includes conflicts between 1600 thru late 1800's. To include major wars like the Napoleonic, American Civil War, English Civil War, and 7 Year War.<br/><br/>Historical Battlelines mechanics are based on those developed for the American Battlelines rule system. There have been few minor changes to improve playability from the original rules, however the mechanics are the same. In Historical Battlelines  a unit&rsquo;s effectiveness is based upon three criteria. These include Morale, Disorder and Ammunition Levels. And with nothing more than a few counters, this simple and exciting system mirrors the unpredictability that was found on the actual field of battle. Historical Battlelines also includes representative examples of troop and weapon statistics for several periods of conflicts.<br/><br/>Based around the innovative Drop-In Game System, Historical Battlelines is built on a solid and easily learned core set of rules. This player-friendly approach provides the perfect balance between historical accuracy and playability while at the same time allowing players to grow into the game at their own pace. Utilizing the same terms and game mechanics, the addition of the new Drop-Ins is accomplished without the need to learn a whole new set of rules. Within you will find Drop-Ins for command and control, morale, artillery (including counter battery), structures and fortifications, cavalry, skirmishing, unusual weapons and more!<br/><br/>Designed to work with miniatures sizes 6mm and up, there is nothing else required to play in literally any figure scale. And, with a very flexible basing system, there is no need to re-base figures from existing collections.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Penelope, his long-suffering wife, is now having to financially support her many suitors who have recently convinced her they should compete in a variety of trials for her hand. Seeing this as her opportunity to vanquish their useless souls from this mortal coil, she gives them increasingly difficult tasks, unaware that one of them might actually succeed.<br/><br/>Players will take turns rolling dice to match challenge dice. The player who ends up matching the final die collects the number of Penelope Rose dice, but be careful because players unable to meet the challenge will have to roll to defend from the rose thorns!

With only 12 pages of rules gamers will be up and playing in 30 minutes.  Rules cover supply, sieges, initiative, command control, interception, and special situations such as Grant's Tenacity, and command change due to incompetetence.<br/><br/>The game is very open ended.  Players are given the initial setup, special rules for the scenario (normally less than 3 to 4 paragraphs), and victory conditions.  What they do with what they are given is up to them.  Combat is handled with a single die roll by each player, and smaller forces can suprise larger forces.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by seizure of terrain objectives, cutting of supply, and elimination of enemy units.<br/><br/>It is a 2 - 4 player game with each scenario player in 90-120 minutes.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sudden Storm is a fast moving campaign of the 1937 naval war between Japan and the US recreating the full range of surface, air and submarine warfare in both operational and tactical operations. <br/>It enables you to explore the challenges admirals on both sides would have faced if the US and Japan had ended up at war in August 1937, during the &quot;China Incident,&quot; rather than in December 1941. A multitude of different potential strategies makes for maximum replayability with new challenges every time. <br/>Sudden Storm is the second offering the ODGW's GQ III Decisions at Sea series of naval campaigns.<br/><br/>Resulting tactical naval engagements can be fought out with any naval rules, but the campaign seamlessly interfaces with GQ III (purchased separately). In addition to background features describing the road to war, campaign level charts, OBs and campaign map; Sudden Storm contains all new color GQ III 1930s combat charts, 240 Ship Logs and 32 aircraft Formation Cards - everything needed for tactical resolution. A sheet of full-color 1937 aircraft counters on card stock is also included for those who want to resolve tactical aircraft operations, but might lack the requisite miniatures.<br/><br/>Sudden Storm is not just another retread of Plan Orange or WW II. Politically and geographically, it presents a very different situation from either one with only two combatants confronting each other in a world defined by 1930s technologies while everyone else is determined to remain neutral. Geography, logistics and neutral zones provide gamers with tough command and operational challenges. Naval warfare is also very different in that era. Aircraft have an important role, but lack the reach and striking power another five years will bring. Surface naval forces remain the key to controlling the seas. The IJN and USN are briefly and uniquely balanced in strength at this one moment in time. Most of the modern IJN and USN ships employed in 1942 are already available, but in different, 1937 configurations. In addition, there are no magnetic torpedo exploder problems, radar or Type 93 &quot;Long Lance&quot; (sic) torpedoes available yet. All this creates an ideal environment for a wide range of classic naval battles.<br/><br/>Sudden Storm also includes download access to 150 pages of Bonus Files. These include eight options, additional forces and Ship Logs, Coastal Defense Cards and maps of the defenses of Manila and Truk, individual carrier and airfield Flight Logs, separate full-color aircraft counters for the flights of each carrier and land based squadron featuring the unique color schemes of the times along with supplemental data on the forces and other aspects of this forgotten era. The files also provide opportunities to explore forgotten technologies like LTA dirigibles and the US flight deck cruiser.<br/><br/>Sudden Storm offers you a window into the fascinating colorful, forgotten world of the late '30s filled with tough command challenges and classic naval battles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Under Admiral Tirpitz, with the active encouragement of Kaiser Wilhelm, Germany committed to a naval construction program designed to challenge British control of the North Sea. In less than two decades the resulting Anglo-German Naval Arms Race was one of the primary causes of the Great War.<br/><br/>Within weeks of the outbreak of war in August 1914 millions of soldiers were engaged in combat. On the Western Front German armies violated Belgian neutrality to gain easy access to northern France. While this gambit did open a promising route to Paris, it had a fearful political price as treaty obligations brought England into war.<br/><br/>For a few weeks in the later summer of 1914 it looked like German armies might capture Paris, scoring a knock-out blow. When they failed, and a stalemate descended all along the front from the Swiss border to the English Channel, the North Sea became the only other theater that offered a way to quickly bring the war to a conclusion.<br/><br/>For a variety of reasons, including the British advantage in capital ships, a major fleet action did not occur until Jutland in May 1916. Still, there were numerous occasions early in the war when the fleets could have clashed, and the stakes were high indeed. Churchill later described Admiral Jellicoe, commander of the Grand Fleet, as &ldquo;the only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon,&rdquo; an indication of the importance for England to maintain control of the North Sea.<br/><br/>This campaign game, focusing on the early war, offers players a chance to fight out a series of actions that helped shape the campaign, and that offered the possibility of a major fleet action.<br/><br/>Players will face both strategic and tactical decisions with the fog of war (sometimes literally on the North Sea) may confer advantages or devastating disadvantages.<br/><br/>The campaign is compatible with virtually any miniatures rule set. <br/>The strategic decision model provides replayabililty as no two campaigns will be the same, especially combined with a wide variation in possible tactical encounters. And there is always the possibility that control of the North Sea will come down to one afternoon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One could also use cardboard pawns (say from Pathfinder) or even the cardboard counters WotC put out for 4th edition DnD.<br/><br/>For the playing surface, both Wizards and Paizo sell affordable (well, affordable by wargming standards, at least) dungeon tiles which are still in print.  Or you could dig out your old HeroQuest board, or use tiles from another dungeon crawl game, or use your Space Hulk tiles, or a Chessex battlemat, or one of many different pre-printed maps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Dice required: twenty-sided dice (d20), six-sided dice (d6)<br/><br/>Game is played on any map with a one-inch grid, it may be created or adapted from something else.  Party is created from a 1000 gold piece budget, each model costs 100 GP and additional gold may be spent to make the models more powerful or to equip models with special equipment.<br/><br/>Victory conditions for a basic game are until one side is wiped out, suggested scenarios with alternate victory conditions are &quot;assassination&quot;, wipe out the opponent's leader, and &quot;treasure hunt&quot;, one unit retrieves a designated treasure token and carries it off the board.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race to Stuff Your Face is a fast-paced card game for 2+ people where you try to nab as much delicious buffet food as possible before your opponent(s) can do the same.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>Four buffet tables are set up with food stacked on them. Each item from this Food Deck has a suit -- meat, dessert, carbs, and lard -- and a point value. There are even a few veggies mixed in.<br/><br/>The Appetite Deck contains 52 cards with each of the four suits and numbers from 1-13. Draw these cards into your hand and use them to take food from the buffet, matching at least one card with the food's suit and totaling its point value. You may, instead, steal food from the top of an opponent's plate, but it costs 2x.<br/><br/>Watch out for veggies that show up on the buffet because the appetite deck doesn't contain veggie cards. Someone will have to take on for the team and spend a turn to remove it.<br/><br/>Stack the food you take onto your character card's plate. This character card shows any bonuses you may have. Be wary of others snatching food right off your plate. You can safely store food at your table, but that just gives your opponent more time alone at that sweet, sweet buffet.<br/><br/>Each piece of food has an effect that can shift the tide of the game, and so does each slot on the buffet line, so no matter if you're scrounging for scraps there is still a chance to win!<br/><br/>A Turn<br/><br/>During your turn, you may either spend Appetite Cards to get food from the buffet or bring your plate to the table so that it can no longer be stolen from your plate.<br/><br/>What's in the Box<br/><br/>Buffet Table<br/><br/>The buffet is made up of four cards or &ldquo;tables&rdquo; on which to stack the food. Each of these cards reveals a bonus when all the food is removed.<br/><br/>Food Deck<br/><br/>Up to four different food cards are face-up on the buffet table that all players will vie for. These foods show a number and food suit. Foods also have bonuses that can sway the game.<br/><br/>Appetite Deck<br/><br/>This deck of 52 poker cards contains four suits (the four food groups: meats, carbs, desserts, and lard), and each group is numbered from 1-13. <br/>Character Plates<br/>These are larger cards that show one of the playable characters and their bonuses.<br/><br/>Winning<br/><br/>Keep playing until you have ravaged the buffet, and there is no food left! Count up the total points to see who is the most gluttonous.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You have invaded the convention hall in search of some great relic; but its pieces have been scattered throughout the event. Will you be the first to find the parts needed to claim the prize?<br/><br/>How to Play<br/><br/>Players build teams, either solo or collectively, of searchers, scouts, and fighters. Searchers investigate areas, the time it takes is based on that character's skills and the size and use of the room. Once found, your scouts run the relic piece back to base. But watch out for your opponent's fighters as they want to get it back.<br/><br/>The convention hall uses a modular system so you may decide on the size of the game. A more enormous building has more rooms, events, and hidden pieces, and will provide longer playing time. Costumes, food, boosts, and more come from cards that are found or purchased. Use dice for combat and searching revelations.<br/><br/>When entering an area, flip the tile to show its layout. Is it filled with several vendor booths or one room dedicated to a celebrity speaker? Is it themed for anime or sci-fi? This all matters because you can dress your team members to get the help of the other con-goers in the room, and you definitely don't want to get caught wearing your StarFeet uniform in the Anime room.<br/><br/>Time and Turns<br/><br/>The game progresses using a virtual time system based on 5-minute increments and passing half-hours. Players take their characters through a half-hour at a time, completing as much as they can during their turn. Events may change from hour to hour, so teams need to be sure they are paying attention to the show schedule. A quick-moving scout may get from one corner of the conference to the opposite side in 15 minutes, or 3 turns, while a fighter wearing a giant robot armor suit may take an hour or 12 turns. Once in an area with a potential object, searchers use their observation skills to look for them. Someone more observant will use fewer turns to search the area. Two searchers on a team will do it faster, and an enemy in the room can distract the searcher.<br/><br/>Classes<br/><br/>Searchers find items based on a combination of factors: their statistics, environmental factors from the area card, time elapsed, and dice. Be sure to read the room because if your cosplay matches your environment, the others in the room will help your search, whereas you in a pirate outfit will surely be harassed by a room full of furries.<br/><br/>Scouts are used to transfer information, outfits, and relic pieces quickly. If a room changes from one theme to another during an investigation, a scout may need to purchase and run a new costume over. Once a relic piece is found, you may want to use your scout to get it back to your base as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Fighters are the brawn that are used to steal a relic piece from scouts or to help escort a weak scout back to base. They can also interrupt a searcher or keep an enemy from entering a room being examined.<br/><br/>How to Win<br/><br/>The winning team will have gathered all the relic pieces in their base before the event ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nineveh: No Mercy is a series of 5 card battles in which the player playing the red deck plays 2 cards, while the player playing the blue deck plays 3 cards.  The higher total wins the battle.<br/><br/>Nineveh: No Mercy is based on true historical events.  Starting in 626 BC, a series of civil wars have weakened the Assyrian Empire, thus emboldening occupied territories to unite in rebellion to topple the Empire.  In No Mercy, the 22 red point cards represent the Assyrian army (The Wicked City of Nineveh being their capital), and the 33 blue point cards represent the coalition forces of the Babylonians, the Medes and the Persians.  The Assyrian forces are more skilled and valued at 11 points per card, coalition forces are more numerous but less skilled and valued at 7 points per card.  As the Assyrian general you command the 22 red point cards while your opponent commands the 33 blue point cards of the coalition forces.<br/><br/>There will be a series of 11 battles and the player who wins most of these battles gains a victory point. In each of these 11 battles, the Assyrian general plays 2 red cards against the coalition general&rsquo;s 3 blue cards.  After each conflict consisting of 11 battles, the players switch armies/colors and become the new general of the opposing army.  The 1st player to win 2 victory points wins the War, thus ending the game. In case of a tie, a 3rd conflict is necessary to determine the winner.<br/><br/>As the Assyrian general, are you skilled enough to defeat the much larger coalition force?  As the coalition general, can you overwhelm the Assyrian forces with your superior numbers?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This classic book arms the reader with a working knowledge of the weapons and their uses, then presents suggested rules of play which will enable the table-top general to manoeuvre and fight in the manner of Charles I, Rupert, Essex, Cromwell, and the rest.<br/><br/>No less than twenty-seven battles of the period are described, including the numbers engaged, types of troops, battle maps and objectives. More than three hundred years after the dust of battle has settled, once again the New Model Army faces Newcastle's Whitecoats across a low  valley. The outcome will depend upon the ability of the reader.

Several bases would make up a regiment unit depending on the regiments size. Base Widths (BW) are used also in the game for movement and range distances. Where players wish to use figures instead of the bases. If that is the case, then for distances use an inch instead of a base width. Calculate dice on number of figures in the front rank instead of the number of bases. For 15mm a base would be around 40mm and in 25/28mm a base width would be around 60mm.<br/><br/>To play the games all you need are six-sided dice (D6), your own models based in a common way between the two forces, terrain to represent the landscape of your battlefield and a ruler.<br/><br/>",

The higher the point total in your hand each round, the faster you will be! Each player starts with three cards and three life chips. The game is played in rounds, with players taking turns picking up and discarding cards to try to achieve the best hand possible. Cards represent escape variables, ranging from -2 to +7. Once a player believes he has a winning hand, he hits the table and yells &ldquo;RUN!&rdquo;&mdash;at which point the remaining players take one last turn to try to improve their hands before concluding the round. Players then reveal their cards and use any Sabotage Cards or other Specialty Cards in their hand to trip up the other players and/or boost their own chances of survival. The player with the lowest (slowest) hand must feed a life chip to the hungry bear. Play continues in rounds until just one player is left standing and is declared the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game about fencing with a long sword according to the teachings of Johann Lichtenauer (kunst der Fechten or KdF).<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game you will need to create your deck with fencing techniques, choose the characteristics of a fighter and your sword. Then you start your battle.<br/><br/>First, at the Zufechten distance - you select a hat card and you can strengthen it with another card to increase the strike speed. When planning your action, you will see part of the opponent&rsquo;s cards, and he will see part of your cards. Therefore, you can predict his actions or try to confuse him and bluff. Players plan all actions at the same time.<br/>When a hit card is selected, players reveal their cards and compare the speed. Anyone who turns out to be faster becomes an attacking player (in terms of Kdf - he has a Vorschlag).<br/><br/>Further, the battle continues at a distance of Krieg. Players also choose a hit and its speed. When choosing, you need to consider the position of your sword and the position of the opponent&rsquo;s sword, as well as how much the opponent puts pressure on the sword (Fullen, in KdF).<br/><br/>Further, the fighters find themselves in the Ringen distance and apply deadly wrestling techniques.<br/><br/>During the battle, the player may get wound or injured. Wounds limit the choice of cards and the player&rsquo;s overall stamina. Injuries reduce the number of cards in the hand. The game goes up to 5 wounds or 3 injuries.<br/><br/>Also in the game there is a campaign mode with light legacy elements. Throughout the campaign you will take part in tournaments (fechtschule) in different cities. Between battles, you can upgrade your fighter, buy swords and heal wounds. The winner of the campaign receives the title of master of fencing and can use special &quot;master&rsquo;s&quot; techniques.<br/><br/>The game is available in PNP version and is distributed free of charge. You can also play at Tabletopia and Tabletop Simulator.<br/><br/>So far, only Russian version available, sorry.<br/><br/>Карточная игра про историческое фехтование.<br/><br/>В 14-15 веках на территории Священной римской Империи жил Иоганн Лихтенауэр. Он собирал приёмы и техники фехтования на различном оружии. Позднее его ученики написали множество книг на основе его учения. Часть этих фехтовальных манускриптов дошли до наших дней. В игре &laquo;Пять Слов&raquo; вы будете фехтовать на длинных мечах по учению Иоганна Лихтенауэра.<br/><br/>Игра основана на реальных текстах и приёмах немецких фехтовальных мастеров прошлого. Изображения также взяты из исторических манускриптов.<br/><br/>Карточная игра про фехтование длинным мечом в традиции Иоганна Лихтенауэра (kunst der Fechten или KdF).<br/>В начале игры вам нужно будет создать свою колоду с фехтовальными приёмами, выбрать характеристики бойца и свой меч. Затем вы начинаете своё бой.<br/><br/>Сначала на дистанции Zufechten &ndash; вы выбираете карту удара и можете усилить её другой картой, чтобы увеличить скорость удара.  При планировании своего действия вы будете видеть часть карт противника, а он будет видеть часть ваших карт. Поэтому вы сможете предсказывать его действия или попытаться запутать его и блефовать. Все действия игроки планирует одновременно.<br/><br/>Когда карта удара выбрана, игроки вскрывают свои карты и сравнивают скорость. Тот, кто оказался быстрее становится атакующим игроком (в терминах Kdf - у него Vorschlag). <br/>Далее бой продолжается на дистанции Krieg. Игроки также выбирают удар и его скорость. При выборе вам нужно учитывать положение своего меча и положение меча противника, а также как сильно противник давит на меч (Fullen, в KdF).<br/>Далее бойцы оказываются на дистанции Ringen и применяют смертельные техники борьбы.<br/><br/>На протяжении сражения игрок может получить Рану или Травму. Раны ограничивают выбор карт и общую выносливость игрока. Травмы уменьшают количество карт в руке. Игра идёт до 5 ран или 3х травм.<br/><br/>Также в игре есть режим кампании с лёгкими элементами легаси. На протяжении кампании вы будете принимать участие в турнирах (fechtschule) в разных городах. Между боями вы сможете улучшать своего бойца, покупать мечи и лечить раны.<br/><br/>Победитель кампании получает титул мастера фехтования и может использовать специальные &laquo;мастерские&raquo; техники.<br/><br/>Включает в себя дополнение &laquo;Десятка мечей&raquo;.<br/><br/>",

Art snippets will appear in due course in our Blog!<br/><br/>The various modules and scenarios will commence with small learning ones designed to ease your way into the TSWW system with minimal fuss, and will progress through smaller modules handling the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky), the Gothic Line, and Anzio, then into France via Overlord and Neptune, Avalanche (the invasion of the South of France) finally concluding with the Wacht am Rhein and the final breakouts into the depths of Nazi Germany for the land aficionados out there, along with the strategic bombing campaign undertaken by the RAF and USAAF against the Reich for those of you who must fly everywhere!<br/><br/>Major campaigns will include Italy, North West Europe and of course the usual massive Grand Campaign module handling the entire Western Allied liberation of Europe.  <br/>You too can be Patton or Montgomery on the one hand, or Von Rundsted or Kesselring on the other.<br/><br/>Space permitting Liberation will also include a major what if campaign designed to explore Winston Churchill&rsquo;s desired approach to Germany&hellip; through the Ljubljana gap and into Southern Germany, heading off the Soviet advance from the East, and fulfilling the promise made by Chamberlain to defend Poland&hellip;<br/><br/>",

These include:<br/><br/>     25 maps [Note that TSWW maps are smaller than standard size] covering most of Mainland China, bits of Machuria &lt;sic&gt; and the Eastern USSR, plus parts of Korea and areas of the Japanese home Islands.<br/>     20 counter sheets. On these will be a full Nationalist, Communist and Warlord Chinese OB with the best research into these forces we can assemble, plus snap shots into the Soviet OB up to 1941, and then a full Soviet PTO OB to fit in with Barbarossa and Vengeance. Western Allied forces are likely to be limited at least in the first instance during research to the assets deployed to China &ndash; so the flying tigers, USAAF assets for the most part. <br/><br/><br/>We will also put together the 1944-49 or 50 US intervention OB for ground forces and if space permits may impose upon the team to concoct a what if USA Invades China optional OB. Space will be at a premium with 5-700 Chinese &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; to contend with! Optional Chinese forces will be provided to illustrate the difference in capability ownership of a land route &ndash; preferably from a port with a rail line would have made to the Chinese forces in the field.<br/><br/>     TSWW System rules &ndash; including the rapidly to become infamous &ldquo;you are a drug dealer&rdquo; rule&hellip;. Without specific areas of China both sides struggled for money as these areas were the prime Opium growing zones. In addition a series of corruption rules and &ldquo;cross forces&rdquo; trading systems will also be worked out to show how the Chinese and Japanese essentially co-existed for extended periods of time. There are a few other things we want to show &ndash; but they can remain secret for a while!<br/>     Grand Campaign Chinese, Japanese, Western Allied OBs.<br/>     At Start book. In this there will be a slew of modules &ndash; ranging from small scale things to teach you how to play the game to major operations ranging from the capture of Shanghai, the assault on Nanking, Nomonhan/Khalkin Gol, Suixian-Zaoyang, Changsha, Guangzi and Zaoyi; the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation, and then the key elements of the Chinese civil war. We hope to provide 20 or so modules and scenarios in the box which I think is a good target.<br/>     Charts<br/>     UIC<br/>     Dice &ndash; the usual 2 x D10s&hellip;<br/>     A very pretty box.<br/><br/><br/>",

Trading happens simultaneously. When one player has either only cards of one color in their hand, or a set of all three cards of a kind (in all three different colors), they win the round. The winner can hand out two of the cards they used to win the round to two other players as challenge cards. The challenges are written on the card and can either require the receiver to perform an action immediately, or to continue playing the game while speaking in a certain way, or other such handicaps. <br/>The winner of a round also claims tokens from the center of the table.

        "description": "Mega City a Moloch of a city was flashy, loud and dirty. Life was hard and survival was complicated. If you knew the right people in Mega City it was easier. If you did what you were told, it was also easy. But the easiest way was to simply not stand out, become invisible, merge with the haze of the city and stay out of everything. What do I care? That&rsquo;s the way it is. Many of the young people didn't mind, they were just interested in having fun, being cool and being able to do what they wanted to do. Why should one then interfere with the stress that the old people made for themselves. Until, yes, until you faced reality, staring at you brutally and cruelly, punching you in the face, breaking your bones or snuffing out your lights. <br/>That reality was a man whom everybody only referred to as &rdquo;The Baron&rdquo;, the crime lord who controlled everything in Mega City. His army of henchmen was everywhere and enforced his will with unlimited brutality and cruelty. <br/>In Secret Hunters, each player leads a group of young people who have formed a gang with the goal of overthrowing The Baron. They all share the fate of having been brutally abused by The Baron and his henchmen. To achieve their goal are not choosy with their methods. They hack terminals, crack safes, bribe the followers of the mystery man, but they would never use weapons. Each gang consists of 4 specialists. A hacker, a safecracker, a spy and a biker. Using the action board and 4 action tokens, the characters are guided through Mega City, but, The Baron does not just watch as his weaknesses uncovered, his henchmen strike mercilessly. Four pieces of evidence need to be found and presented to the court in order to take out The Baron, but to find out which four pieces of evidence they are, the players need to collect clues they get from informants, as to where relevant safes and terminals are located which may contain possible evidence. The gang which has collected all four pieces of evidence and manages to take them to court wins the game and is referred to by the others as the real Secret Hunters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Liphook Historical Wargames Group was formed in 2000 to refight Napoleon&rsquo;s major battles during their 200th anniversary year. During the last 16 years the group has successfully fought over 38 battles, which have included Wagram, Salamanca, Borodino, Leipzig and Waterloo, using its own, home-grown set of specially designed rules.<br/><br/>Art of Command evolved from the group&rsquo;s desire to refight big, multiplayer battles. The set aim was to simulate the confusion and impact the chain of command has on such major engagements through the interaction of players representing the various commanders from brigade through divisions and corps to army level. The objective is to replicate the historical ebb and flow of battle at battalion, squadron and battery level, refight them over an accurately contoured, scaled model and complete them in a day.<br/><br/>The group initially tested existing, commercial rule sets but felt that these were designed for small table engagements lasting a couple of hours or larger games with brigades being the smallest units represented. It was concluded that we needed rules that would encompass command, communications and control functions.  Rules that would enable us to coordinate and accommodate a large group of commanders refighting battles the size of Waterloo, but still represent battalions and squadrons on the wargame table.  We believe Art of Command fulfills this need and the fact that the group successfully completed almost all the battles in a day is a testament to the robust nature of the rules and the thorough testing which has taken place.<br/><br/>We recommend Art of Command to those wargamers who wish to simulate a major Napoleonic, multiplayer battle in a day.   We hope that you find their simplicity and resultant speed of play beneficial in recreating your own big battles and, above all, recreate the fun and excitement of a hobby that we all enjoy.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/>1 fig (inf.-cav.) = 50/60 men<br/>1 gun = 1 gun<br/>Ground Scale: 1/1000 for 25/28 mm  (half for 15mm)<br/>each Game Period: 10-15 min real time<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

With 24 characters, 20 unique items, and 15 events, every match is a completely new experience!<br/><br/>Players begin by selecting characters for their party in a draft pick setting. Once the game begins, players take turns by using actions with a character. The game progresses until only one player has characters remaining alive.<br/><br/>Champions Coliseum&rsquo;s strategy comes through masterful use of elemental abilities, positioning, items, and events. Elemental abilities deal double damage to opposing elements&mdash;however, this means that each element&rsquo;s weakest target is also its biggest threat. Characters placed in the back row cannot be attacked until the character in front of them is defeated, meaning that weaker characters are often placed in the back. Items and events are dealt randomly each round, adding a hint of chance to the strategic gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Building upon the superb third rate plastic sprues, the box contains additional metal components to make the following famous vessels, all of which were present at the Battle of Trafalgar!<br/><br/>HMS Bellerophon - This 74 gun third rate has a long and storied history, serving during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Whilst most of this time was spent on blockades or convoy escort duties, she distinguished herself in three fleet actions: The Glorious First of June, the Battle of the Nile, and the Battle of Trafalgar. At Trafalgar, she fought an embittered battle against both Spanish and French ships and suffered heavy losses including the death of her Captain, John Cooke.<br/><br/>After Trafalgar, she resumed blockade duties around France, as well as performing more escort duties in North America between 1813 and 1814. Assigned to blockade Rochefort in 1815, HMS Bellepheron was the vessel on which Napoleon came aboard to officially surrender to the British following his defeat at Waterloo (finding his escape to America blocked).<br/><br/>HMS Revenge - Launched on 13 April 1805, HMS Revenge was a 74-gun third rate. She was one of a larger class of 74s with 24-pounder guns on the upper deck rather than the more common 18-pounders.<br/><br/>Newly commissioned, and under the command of Captain Robert Moorsom, she served at the Battle of Trafalgar in Admiral Collingwood's column. She would continue to serve until 1842.<br/><br/>HMS Tonnant - An 80-gun third-rate of the Royal Navy, she was originally the lead ship of the French Tonnant class captured by the British at the Siege of Toulon (August 1793), recaptured by the French at the break of the Siege (December 1793) and subsequently recaptured by Horatio Nelson's fleet at Aboukir Bay during the Battle of the Nile (1 August 1798). She would go on to fight at the Battle of Trafalgar against the French.<br/><br/>Tonnant was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane over the majority of the Chesapeake Bay campaigns as part of the War of 1812. Of particular note, Francis Scott Key dined aboard the Tonnant as part of a prisoner release negotiation. As a result of their inferred knowledge of the forthcoming attack on Baltimore at Fort McHenry. As a result, he and his fellows were not allowed to return until after the attack. It was in witnessing the bombardment of Fort McHenry that Key wrote the poem 'Defence of Fort M'Henry' later to become &quot;The Star Spangled Banner&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

In her first engagement at The Glorious First of June she lost her mast and had to be towed back to Brest.<br/><br/>Under the command of Admirable Villeneuve she went to sea as part of a large fleet bound for the West Indies, but returned for Europe upon news that Nelson had arrived there. In the Battle of Cape Finisterre, a violent artillery exchange was halted by thick fog, an exhausted French fleet thus anchored in Ferrol before sailing on to Cadiz. Admiral Villeneuve, with his command under threat, vowed to meet the British at the Cape of Trafalgar.<br/><br/>At Trafalgar, Indomptable was part of the Spanish line, engaging Vice Admiral Collingwood's flagship HMS Royal Sovereign, as well as HMS Belleisle, HMS Revenge, HMS Dreadnought and HMS Thunderer. Drifting downwind, and out of range, she turned back towards Cadiz but got caught in a rescue operation for Bucentaure which had struck a reef. The following night, Indomptable was caught in a storm and carried onto rocks offshore from Cadiz. Only 150 (of between 100 and 1400 men) are estimated to have survived the wreck.<br/><br/>Formidable- an 80-gun Tonnant-class ship of the line of the French Navy, she was briefly named Figuieres, but this was restored to Formidable prior to her launch at Toulon on 31 May 1795. She participated in the Battle of Algeciras, the Battle of Cape Finisterre and the Battle of Trafalgar - in which she served as the flagship of Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley in the six-ship vanguard of the French fleet.<br/><br/>She was captured by the British at the Battle of Cape Ortegal on 4 November 1805. Renamed HMS Brave whilst in service of the Royal Navy, she was eventually sold to be broken up in 1816.<br/><br/>Argonaute- a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Navy. Under Vice-amiral Villaret de Joyeuse, she took part in the expedition to Saint-Domingue in 1802. She took part in the Battle of Trafalgar but managed to return to Cadiz. She could not leave port due to heavy damage and the British blockade, she was eventually exchanged for the Spanish ship Vencedor in December 1806. At this point, she was renamed Argonauta, but was never recommissioned.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

She ran aground on 28 October near Huelva and was destroyed by HMS Naiad to prevent her restoration.<br/><br/>Argonauta - an 80-gun third rate ship of the line, she was the last of the Monta&ntilde;&eacute;s-class of ships (of which there were four). On 25 August 1800, she fought off the British Ferrol expedition as part of Joaquin Moreno's squadron.<br/><br/>Subsequently, she fought at the Battle of Cape Finisterre, and as part of Federico Gravina's second squadron at Trafalgar. Captured at the latter battle, she was taken in tow by HMS Poyphemus, but was abandoned due to the storm which followed the battle On 24 October HMS Defiance rescued survivors and attempted to re-establish a tow unsuccessfully. The Argonauta sank 6 days later, its survivors landing at Algeciras the next day.<br/><br/>San Justo - a 74-gun ship of the line, San Justo was launched 11 November 1779. She participated in such actions as the Battle of Cape St Vincent, and the Siege of Gibraltar. She later participated in the battle of Trafalgar, managing to escape destruction.

The US Navy accepted her nevertheless and under the captaincy of Edward Preble, holding the distinction of being the first US Naval ship to cross the Equator in early 1800.<br/><br/>The first Barbary War saw duties shift to the Mediterranean, with blockading and convoy escort duties at Gibraltar as well as participating in the Battle of Deme (27 April 1805).<br/><br/>After the declaration of the War of 1812, USS Essex achieved major success in disrupting British whaling activities in the Pacific under the command of Captain David Porter. From February 1813, over the course of a year, Porter successfully captured 12 British Whalers, and 360 prisoners, whilst sailing around Cape Horn and cruising the Pacific.<br/><br/>However, On 28 March 1814 at the battle of Valparaiso, Porter was forced to surrender to the frigate HMS Phoebe and the sloop-of-war HMS Cherub when Essex became too disabled to offer any resistance.

Any battler in that area loses one health (heart token).<br/><br/>COIN- a coin token in flipped over and placed in the specified location. The first battler to get to this location adds a unique weapon to their common weapons. But if two or more players arrive at the same time, a battle ensues and only the last person in that location gets the reward...<br/><br/>MOVEMENT- Each player secretly chooses one of their four movement tokens that specify direction of travel or if they want to stay where they are. All tokens are revealed at the same time and the players move into position for...<br/><br/>BATTLE- Battler may play a weapon to injur other battlers nearby. Some weapons damage battlers in the immediate location, some damage battlers in consecutive locations, and some have other advantages like damaging someone elsewhere on the map or getting more health.<br/><br/>When a battler is defeated (by losing all of their health), they are eliminated and the rival who dealt the final bow gets of of their remaining weapons.<br/><br/>More:<br/>Medieval Royale takes 30-40 minutes from set-up till final triumph. Players are usually not eliminated until the last few rounds, so that eliminated players don't have to wait long to jump in on another game.

But news that the earth's fuel has been running low, and greed for the fuel paired with fear of ending up in a junkyard has thrown the robots into a frenzy.<br/><br/>To survive, you spend your time foraging for parts with which to build weapons and force fields for protection.<br/><br/>Robot Ridge is a fast-paced, take that card game with several unique mechanics including custom designed robots, machine building to improve abilities, and scheming against enemy robots (see below).<br/><br/>Set-up:<br/>Players choose  three cards to build their unique robot- head, body, and feet (or foot).<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>On your turn, draft two cards from the junkyard and then play your cards in order to build shields, steal cards from other robots, or blow them to bits.<br/><br/>As your robot gets damaged, you will lose abilities to play certain cards. Damaged feet mean you can't explore to find robot parts to repair your robot. A damaged body means you can't shoot at opponent robots.<br/><br/>Scheming. As fewer and fewer cards in your hand can be played due to your damaged robot, you can still use them to &quot;scheme&quot; against other robots. To scheme, place a card face down in front of them. Once three cards (from you or other robots) have been schemed against them, they must immediately take damage to part of their robot. Of course, if they happen to think, they get to remove the cards schemed against them and put them into their hand to use later... possibly against you!<br/><br/>The last robot standing wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Die Zombie-J&auml;gers is another gaming supplement for the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombie rules - the post post-apocalyptic Renaissance zombie survival game.<br/><br/>The setting is a quiet rural area as yet untouched by the undead plague. <br/>Here life can still be hard - but in the good years an adequate living can be made. If the crops are blighted however, or the livestock fall ill, shortages are keenly felt - and cattle are beginning to die, disfigured by signs of putrefaction - even before death. <br/>None in the village can remember seeing anything working with such ghastly haste on these precious animals. <br/>Now fear begins its work. <br/>Not just fear of another winter without food but fear that perhaps the first signs of the pestilence is beginning to show. First it is the animals that suffer - what next? The people? As piles of infected carcasses burn and stinking black smoke rises into the air, many begin to wonder - what has brought on this misfortune? Who is responsible for this outbreak of corruption - and who is going to stop it?<br/><br/>Included in this booklet are three new scenarios, two new characters, lots of new events and new zombies to try (well they're actually pretty old and mouldy now!). First of these characters is the Verdorben - corrupted individuals, obsessed by the undead menace and convinced that they can draw power from the same well-spring of evil that maintains the undead. Although these individuals may look like any other survivor, they can bring the taint of the undead and the risk of infection into any community. This insidious threat means that none can truly be trusted.<br/><br/>Second of these new characters are the hunters of evil and corruption - the J&auml;gers. So fanatical are these finders of evil that the Verdorben truly fear them. Unfortunately the fanaticism of these hunters also leads to the persecution of the innocent and many have perished at the hands of the over-zealous. Exemplary behaviour and outward displays of faith are not always sufficient to withstand the questioning gaze of the J&auml;ger. The finger of suspicion pointed by a jealous neighbour can quickly lead to denouncement, imprisonment and the terrible process of &quot;investigation&quot;.<br/><br/>So these new threats are lethal indeed, be it from the hidden menace of the Verdorben or the ruthless and deadly accusations of the J&auml;gers. Survivors may long for the days when the threat was more obvious. All that a survivor used to need was a stout leather jacket, a trusty halberd and a dozen zombies would fall decapitated before their slicing blade. Now the threat is more sinister, a whispered accusation in the wrong ear, some malicious gossip or perhaps a settling of old scores - one wrong word and the once heroic survivor can be brought low. So don your armour, buckle up your sword, shove a big heavy pistol in your belt and get ready for battle. Trust no one, especially your friends and if any Zombie -J&auml;gers ask for help with their inquiries - think very, very carefully before answering.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Lost Valley Survivors is the second gaming supplement for the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombie rules and contains six new linked missions, new event cards, new armour and weapons - and lots of new zombie types to try them out on! The Lost Valley is set in a post-apocalyptic Renaissance world where rational thought and burgeoning scientific practice is being dragged back to a darker world of fear and suspicion and of course the terrifying undead plague.<br/><br/>Since the coming of the plague, the survivors yearn for peace and time spent away from the constant threat of der Auferstandene. The greatest menace comes from the &quot;plague city&quot;, that deadweight of evil that burdens the living struggling to survive. Many believe that if they could only escape this land and its malevolent influence they could find peace. Constant patrols are sent out into the wider countryside, always in the hope of finding a land untainted. Dangerous and gruelling though this work is, it must be continued. A recent patrol has returned with news of a secluded valley. Quiet, unoccupied and ready for settlement, this could provide a new home for those wishing to escape. Within a few short weeks, a powerful expeditionary force has been mobilised and sets out to find this land, a land that promises peace and freedom and hope. Could this hidden valley provide shelter and a measure of protection from the harsh realities of the outside world. If this place has managed so far to escape this deadly plague, could it not hold out still further if properly organised and defended?<br/><br/>Only brave and dedicated survivors need apply for this mission, the risks are sure to be great but surely the rewards will be even greater!<br/><br/>",

Included in this booklet are thirteen scenarios set in the hideous and dangerous confines of the &quot;plague city&quot;.<br/><br/>Once a mighty fortress and great city, perched on the banks of a broad and swift flowing river, beset from all sides by armies and looters and vagabonds. This great city succumbed to its final assault. Armies it could humiliate, besiegers it could resist, but against the cold fury of the dead it could not hold out. Thirty thousand inhabitants stared into the faces of the dead and knew that the end had come. Few escaped the slaughter...<br/><br/>Now the living, the survivors, shun this place. Death awaits those that return to the city, death or worse! Smoke and the stench of decay arise from this accursed place. Grey and ragged figures make their shambling progression through ruined streets in an endless quest for living flesh, their blood-caked mouths, dry, shuddering, craving. And yet some survivors look on this forbidding city as a potential source of great wealth. What use to the dead have for the riches of the church, the fine merchant houses and sumptuous palaces? Surely an expedition into this damned city would be worth it. Risky, yes - but rewarding - surely! And for players valiant enough to risk the Plague City, a host of new &quot;event-cards&quot; await to trip-up and challenge these survivors brave enough to enter.<br/><br/>",

There is also a section on converting your Renaissance figures into menacing, mouldy musketeers as seen on the front cover!<br/><br/>Now please don't be alarmed by the sight of gun-totting zombies on the front of this supplement. We are not suggesting that these undead beasts have the wit to use these weapons properly. We are not messing with the time-honoured notion of mindless flesh-eating zombies. So rest assured, these zombies are still mindless and still flesh eating. Its just that some of them are still clinging to the weapons that they once used in life. If these guns are fired, they are most likely to miss, or hit another zombie and in any case the gun is probably being held the wrong way round! And as for the chances of reloading - you can forget it!!<br/><br/>Rotting Regiments describes the final descent of once proud and powerful regiments as the terrible undead plague finally takes hold. As the last shreds of humanity ebb away a residue of former prowess remains. Will these accursed warriors manage one final flourish of military excellence before the all consuming hunger for human flesh takes hold? All that the survivors can bank on is that the battle for survival remains desperate and unremitting - and is not made any easier by the arrival of Rotting Renaissance Regiments.<br/><br/>",

Always eagerly anticipated by the populace, these travelling shows were less enthusiastically received by the authorities who considered them to be nothing more than an excuse for sin and debauchery. In the village of Osthof one such troupe would arrive every year, emerging in the autumn gloom, at first a twinkling of lights far along the east road, then the faint sounds of pipe and drum. By the time the caravan rolled into the village, an excited crowd of children would already have assembled to welcome these new arrivals. But since the coming of the terrible undead plague - such visits have stopped. Now such distractions have ended and the survivors must focus on the grim business of their daily lives. Or at least, that is what they thought. After some years of absence, once again the gloom of a quiet autumn evening is pierced by twinkling lights on the road. Surely this cannot signal the arrival of another travelling troupe? How would they have survived on the road? What news will they bring from the outside? What sort of trouble will they stir-up in the village? Again, the villagers await the arrival of these exotic strangers with a mixture of apprehension and excitement. Do the survivors have an innate sense about these things, a feeling of foreboding and hidden menace? Well, you can bet that the more cynical and hard-bitten survivors will view these strangers with considerable caution - alert to the threat of infection from the deadly plague that these travellers might bring. If there is the slightest risk to the community, the survivors will have to fight this new threat or face losing everything.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "These rules are generic, in that they will be useable for any era wargame.<br/><br/>The rules are in pdf format and you can find them in the files section of this page.<br/><br/>Like me, you are likely a war gamer who owns dozens of board games spanning from the 'Age of Sail' era to modern times. You have tactical games, operational ones, and a few grand strategic monsters. Yet each play is isolated with no meaning beyond the satisfaction of winning. Each victory is unconnected to others. Not any more.<br/><br/>Winning any one of your tabletop games earns you or your opponent one Command Point. (Command &amp; Control) The Points are also earned during game-play when certain events happen.  For instance, the capture of a city/town earns a Point. The sinking of a major warship wins a point or successful bombing mission by heavy bombers against an enemy target wins one.<br/><br/>The 'Master Game' depicted by my rules can include all of your tabletop games, miniatures play, and even video games. The idea is that each play represents a battle for a specific locale in the 'outer game'. Winning any of your games, and the points that success wins, drives your forces forward. It doesn't matter what era your tabletop game is, victory earns a Command &amp; Control Point.<br/><br/>For example, if the 'Master Game' is to be WW2, you will track success of each of the War Powers of that era. War Power nations would be Germany, Great Britain, USA, Commonwealth, Italy, Russia, and Japan. Even playing solitaire works, since my rules don't require an opponent for use.<br/><br/>If you choose to personally lead Great Britain, all the other nations would be lead by NPC characters.   These are Non-Player Characters. The points they win are kept note of in your records of the 'Umbrella War'. Those Points will come back in later tabletop games to give one side or the other the benefit of a die roll modifier, or die re-rolls.<br/><br/>In your play you would have a Strategic Leader for each major power nation in the war. If you wish, the 'Umbrella Game' can be set in any era. Age of Sail enthusiasts will have Kings and Emperors. Civil War players could have President Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson opposing him. You could play out WW1 or WW2 history.  Modern war play is also easily incorporated in my concept.<br/><br/>You can use NPC Officers as Operational Level commanders for army, navy, and air forces. Optionally, these officers can collect Points when they succeed in their missions. Each play of one of your games represents an engagement between two of the War Powers. That game can be a Strategic, Operational, or Tactical game - with the same effect at the end. a Command Point for the winner. If you want to track individual Operational commanders, you would assign NPC officers for both sides in each game played. Before starting a new tabletop game, you consult your notes and compare the Points for each officer.<br/><br/>The side or Operational officer with the higher Points wins a die roll modifier for combat in the tabletop game about to start. Command Points won are accumulated in your 'Master Game' records. Individual game-play is meaningless any more. The concept is ideal for group or club play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As a new country struggles to emerge from revolution and civil war, it's very independence is now threatened  by a force savage and deadly. In deep forests and lonely outposts, amongst the piles of fallen heroes a new danger twitches into life. This terrible threat possesses a hunger that cannot be satisfied - a craving for living human flesh that knows no bounds. The dead are beginning to walk again and no one is safe. Will the old divisions of loyalty and patriotism still persist? Or will humankind bury it's differences and join forces against the undead plague? Only you can decide!<br/><br/>This game is based on the Pike &amp; Shot &amp; Zombies rules (the Renaissance post-apocalyptic survival game) but is set during the time of the American War of Independence. The rules have the same basic mechanics as the previous set but obviously have a very different historical &quot;feel&quot;. There are of course new weapons and new characters (and unfortunately for these survivors - far less armour!) There are also new scientific ideas which may hold an explanation or a way of countering the vile undead.<br/><br/>But some say that the deadliest threat still comes from mankind's inexhaustible capacity to destroy itself. Will the warring parties fighting for king or independence continue their struggle or stand together against this new danger? The Zombie History of the world continues with Patriots &amp; Loyalists &amp; Zombies...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sulphur can be used to fight enjoyable one-off SF games using easy to organise forces of varying points cost. Alternately, players can opt for a longer series of joined-up battles against an opponent where success or failure will not be determined by one encounter but by a series of battles.<br/><br/>This is where the Sulphur Campaign rules come in. Here players can fight a series of interlinked battles that require strategic as well as tactical thinking. Problems of supply, resources and territory will have to be dealt with as well as the more usual concerns - such as smashing-up your enemy! In a campaign game, players must build up as many resources as possible, to increase the size and strength of their faction. As the opposing group will be trying to do the same thing, players will have to deploy their forces in the most effective way to counter this threat.<br/><br/>Sulphur Campaign has added a lot more background detail to the Sulphur World. A lively, unusual and often grim post-apocalyptic world that covers such elements as -<br/>Trading, Scavenging, Spoils of War, Repairs, Ammo and Food supply, Tithes and Protection Money (from bigger meaner factions), the influence of the Church (only if you have paid your tithe), Shaman, Random Events, the Calendar (seasons of the Sulphur year) and the Weather (its usually not very nice!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of the Action Game is to get rid of all cards as quickly as possible. Deal 5 cards to each player, and put the rest in a face-down stack. A starting card from the top of the face-down stack is turned face-up on the table. Each player takes turns playing a card on top of the face-up stack, which must match either the symbol, color, or number of the current top card in that stack. If you don't have a matching card, you have to draw from the face-down stack. There are action cards which trigger changes in the game when played. Minimum number of players is 2.<br/><br/>It also comes with a second set of rules for the same 32 cards, called Happy Families or Quartets. The goal of this game is to collect as many families as possible (groups of 4 cards that belong together). With 2 players, deal 10 cards to each player, and place the remaining 12 cards in a face-down stack. One player begins by asking for a certain card; they must already have at least one card from that family. If the opponent does not have that card, then the player picks up the top card from the stack, and then it is the other player's turn. Or with 3 or more players, deal out all the cards equally among the players; and a player can continue asking for cards from selected opponents until they make a mistake (asking for a card that the person asked doesn't have). Whoever collects the most sets of 4 wins.<br/><br/>--user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle to conquer a lost underground world full of ethereal magic and ancient artifacts! Players can choose from different distinct forces, human pirates and fortune hunters, dragon-men, amazonian sorceresses with savage beastmen, and others. Games are played with small sides so players do not need to invest in massive armies, just specialized warbands of personality characters and troops, and battles can be played in an hour. Take your forces into fungal forest, crumbling ruins, and dinosaur filled jungles in campaigns of multiple scenarios where each member of a warband can gain advancements as they win battles and gather treasure. But beware of wild creatures, as they have their own AI rules that allow them to hunt any model on the board. The book comes complete with all of the core rules as well as descriptions of all weapons, armor, tech artifacts, magic and special abilities for all characters and has the roster for the main forces as well as all wild creatures. In addition, the book includes a section detailing the different environments that players can explore and do battle within and descriptions of all of the different terrain types that can be encountered. Finally, there is a complete toolkit in the back that shows how to build your own custom characters or edit existing ones using a simple point calculation system.<br/><br/>&ndash; RULES BASED ON AWARD-WINNING SONG OF BLADES AND HEROES by Ganesha Games but with extensive additional rules, weapons, armor, technology items (akin to magic items) and new combat and movement options. ShadowSea include a detailed combat system that allows for targeting different body parts or subsystems. The activation system allows players to choose a basic free action or gamble on rolling dice for more complex actions. Game cards for miniatures are tarot sized (4.75 by 2.75 inch), giving room to include all of the descriptions of Special Abilities, Weapons, Armor and Tech Items. This means much less referencing the rulebook and faster gameplay for all. Sets of game cards can be downloaded in PDF format in the Download section of the website.<br/><br/>&ndash; 3D GAMEPLAY: In ShadowSea, the game a distinct three-dimensional feel with models able to climb terrain, leap across open areas and push or break scenic items. Models can also swim underwater or do battle upon boats in the Shadow Sea. The game is 100% compatible with DeepWars, so players can have full land-sea battles.<br/><br/>&ndash; INTENSE COMBAT, MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY in the underground realm. Spellcasters can wield multiple magical spell types, including dimensional magic that allows unsavory spellcasters to call forth beings from the ethereal void. Scientists can discover artifacts with tremendous power or design and improve upon their own ether technology to upgrade and create new items.<br/><br/>&ndash; SKIRMISH WITH RPG FLAVOR: Combination of 28mm scale miniature tabletop wargame with campaign advancement and a role-playing flavor. The game can be played in single sessions of an hour, or as a campaign where warbands salvage ancient technology, design their own new tech items, enhance abilities and generally become powerful lords of the deep.<br/><br/>&ndash; TOURNAMENT RULES &ndash; The rulebook has an entire section on running tournaments, complete with scoring and timekeeping, as well as new Special Operations that each player gets for a scenario. The Spec-Ops are special missions that a warband can accomplish during a scenario to gain bonus Victory Points.<br/><br/>ShadowSea has many features that make it a flexible gaming system that is perfect for beginners but deep enough for experienced gamers.<br/><br/><br/>     SIMPLE RULES that can be learned in one game, using 6-sided dice for rolls for combat, physical activities, spellcasting, using ancient technology or any other action during the game.<br/>     FAST GAMES, lasting around an hour, with game models on each side alternating their turns of activation so that all players can stay in the flow of the game.<br/>     SMALL WARBANDS of 4-8 models, so that anyone can have a warband destined for glory without spending a fortune.<br/>     EASY MOVEMENT rules based on three measurement sticks.<br/>     TABLETOP PLAY allows players to build a map on any 1 meter-square surface without the need for a grid. Just add scenery and start the game.<br/>     LITTLE TO NO BOOKKEEPING! The models in a warband are represented by a basic block of two statistics and a few special abilities. Game cards come with miniatures so players have all of their abilities and rules in their hand,<br/>     MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY interweave in the Underlands. Warbands may battle using arcane magical spells or ancient technological weapons in the mysterious underground realm.<br/>     ACTION BASED GAMEPLAY means that models have many choices of actions besides simply whacking each other across the skull. Leap chasms, climb pillars, break through walls, set explosives or try something unexpected.<br/>     SIX COMPLETE FORCES battle in their quest for ancient artifacts. Over 300 heroes, fiends, wild creatures, ethereal demons, ancient mechanical constructs and stygian monsters.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player has enough pieces to fill the two rows nearest them at the start.<br/><br/>On their turn a players rolls dice, with the number being scaled to the board size; one die is suggested for the 8x8 board and three for the 18x18 board. The roll determines the number of moves that can be made; a piece can move to any of the five adjacent squares ahead or to the side of it. However, pieces can be moved on top of friendly pieces and a stack of pieces costs as many moves to go one space as the number of pieces in it.<br/><br/>A stack can only be moved onto an opposing stack if the latter is smaller; in this case the entire opposing stack is removed as well as an equal number of pieces from the moving stack.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player cannot make any possible move (in which case their opponent wins) or a player has advanced all their pieces to the other side of the board (in which case they win).<br/><br/>The game was first published in World Game Review #2.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Letters in the dead area cannot appear in the word.<br/><br/>Unlike in Hangman there is no specific word players are trying to guess. Instead a round continues until someone challenges. If an answer is challenged, the player answering must fill in the remaining blanks with valid letters to form a word, or lose a life. If a question is challenged, the player asking must demonstrate a possible answer that would narrow down the words that could fit, or lose a life.

        "description": "Lachaino is a deduction game for two players. Each player makes a chain of consecutive numbers that fills a square grid; for example, if 10x10 grids are used, each player fills a grid with the numbers 1-100 with each number adjacent to the previous one.<br/><br/>On a turn a player specifies a 2x2 section of the grid and the opposing player gives the product of the four numbers it contains, broken down into prime factors.<br/><br/>The object is to reconstruct the opponent's chain in the fewest number of guesses. If a player finds that one or both ends of the chain are ambiguous due to all four end numbers being in a 2x2 section, they may leave these undefined for a half-guess penalty each.<br/><br/>The game was first presented in Hopscotch #65 and then printed in World Game Review #8.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

But with judicious use of what were pre-war civilian boatyards and the huge resources of their empire and help from the USA, the Coastal Forces would in 1944 have 25,000 sailors in over 2000 small craft!<br/><br/>These Flotillas, enhanced by Commonwealth, Dutch, Norwegian, French, and other free forces sank over 400 enemy vessels, including 48 E-boats and 32 midget submarines. They also accounted for 32 axis aircraft and fired in total 1169 very expensive torpedoes. This impressive tactical achievement contributed mightily to the allied strategic successes. It ensured that Britain was not isolated for trade. It put a stranglehold on Axis Supply lines and ultimately formed a force that could not be resisted, so much so that by the D Day landings in 1944, the Kriegsmarine was impotent to resist.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Allied boats tended to be 70-80 feet in length, the E boat 115 feet long, and the laws of physics, though complex, favour a larger hull for speed over a shorter one.<br/><br/>German engineering also gave them another advantage, as when speed reached 25 knots, a crank mechanism when turned moved 2 side rudders to flare, symmetrically outward at 30 degrees, creating an air-filled hollow space, the so-called L&uuml;rssen effect. This gave three distinct advantages, greater speed, a reduction in the tell-tale wake of the speeding boat, and finally settled the boat in a more efficient plane, leaving the vessel shallower in the water, most useful in mine and torpedo infested waters and remarkable for a boat weighing in at 100 tons!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

PT squadron 1 was based on Pearl Harbor and the 12 boats opened fire on the incoming Japanese bombers, claiming 2 planes downed for sure and others damaged. Squadron 2 was based in Manila Bay of the Philippines and had a similar introduction to their war, shooting down a few attackers and learning that fast boats were a tricky target for bombers. Squadron 3 was in New York working up and would later see great service in Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>The PT boats fought all over the globe, from Pearl Harbor to the Philippines, the Adriatic and Mediterranean and also in the English Channel. They achieved many successes, particularly in the last two years of the Pacific War they accounted for many stalking float planes and many hundreds of barges which were the lifeblood of the overextended Japanese army. This barge hunting was a gruelling business and needed a certain ruthlessness on the behalf of the American crews, Japanese soldiers and sailors being loath to surrender, hence a grizzly end to many a barge crew.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As the island is a surfer paradise, surfing is the thing all of them want to do the most. In the beginning however, this is not so easy! First you have to visit the local surf shop and get yourself a great surfboard. Now the surfing fun can begin. The players try to qualify for surf contests which take place from time to time. The contest is then be held between the players who qualified for it. Special contest cards are used for this. Trying to win a contest is action-packed and thrilling for everyone involved. The player who won the most contests at the end of the game is the winner. But beware! Sometimes there are riptides or even a shark appears in the clear blue waters. Then you have to leave the water again. But you can prepare yourself. Put a lifeguard station on your beach so that dangerous ripcurrents can not harm you any more. Or engage with the local fishermen to catch the shark out of your waters. There are many more special effects that may happen. Some jellyfish might help you, or you can take some extra surfing training. But beware of the tropical thunderstorms which sometimes hit this paradise island! There is a lot to experience during your summer vacation - maybe even a summer romance might happen to you if you are lucky! Enjoy the summer with BlueGetaway!<br/><br/>BlueGetaway is a picture based card game and is not related to any specific language. It is suited for families and parties as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In reality some of these ships never left the design stage, some were scrapped and some were turned into aircraft carriers to avoid wasting the hulls.<br/><br/>This expansion includes additional hypothetical ships for Great Britain, Germany, The United States of America and the Empire of Japan.  <br/>Because some of the proposed ships were monsters I have introduced both a new gun calibre (colour) and a new Armour Colour; in both cases Black. <br/>It represents 16&rdquo; to 18&rdquo; guns planned for these monsters and the proposed uber levels of armour some of them were to have.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players could enter the game at any time and continued in the game until their persona was killed or remained as the sole survivor.  A &quot;turn&quot; took place over about a one-month period - players submitted by post written turns using a semi-standard format (freeform actions and explanatory notes were allowed); the results were published in the next monthly issue of Lokasenna.<br/><br/>Player personas started from a base template and then were customized by spending points from a pool to gain benefits - increased characteristics, weapon or shield skills, combat skills, or armor.  Once a persona was created it was placed into the combat arena and beneficial changes thereafter were quite limited - harmful changes resulted from combat.<br/><br/>Written player orders consisted of a movement action and a combat action - a variety of each were available.  The game referee received all written orders and then determined outcomes.  Some outcomes were determined by game rules; other outcomes were adjudicated by the referee.<br/><br/>Cearnage rules were published in Lokasenna (Issue 9 - Nov 1983) and play turns appeared from that time forward.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The primary goal of this game design was to reimagine the classic board games &quot;Risk&quot; and &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; by targeting and replacing or eliminating their least enjoyed mechanics and elements, while retaining and building around their best qualities (particularly &quot;Risk&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is played on a map of Earth, including all seven continents, broken into 8 different land &quot;Regions&quot; and 6 ocean &quot;Regions&quot;. Similar to Risk or A&amp;A, players control factions and compete for power, influence, and resources and use dice to resolve conflicts.<br/><br/>Unlike the parent games, Global War embraces a multi-purpose card system whereby new reinforcements can be claimed OR players can interact and modify dice rolls - even on other player's turns.<br/><br/>Also unlike the parent games, Global War has a &quot;double elimination&quot; mechanic; where a newly eliminated faction enters a &quot;Piracy&quot; stage - where they can utilize the game's built-in naval warfare mechanics to continue influencing the final outcome of the game (and potentially still win!)<br/><br/>The game also has a variety of selectable win conditions and is semi-modular to allow for simpler, quick strategic gameplay, or more complex, longer games that have a similar feel to classic wargaming.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Over time, as peasants and field laborers began to take interest, the game shed its disreputable image and was eventually favored by members of the royal court.<br/>Now you too can play it with good-natured friends and family in the comfort of your own home. You won&rsquo;t even have to worry about getting knifed and thrown in the river&mdash;hopefully.<br/><br/>Tooth &amp; Talon is a Rock-Paper-Scissors inspired game played with cards and can be played by 2-5 players in 20-40 minutes.<br/><br/>All players have a hand of six cards with different available actions (two Rats, one Snake, one Hawk, one Fox, and one Net). On a turn, players will choose one of their cards and place it face-down. After all have chosen, players flip their cards and, beginning with the leader, choose to take one of the actions on their card. After three turns, players score all their accumulated cards. The player to the left then becomes the new leader. After the final round, and everyone had played as the leader, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>At present, the game only exists as print &amp; play.<br/><br/>",

This is a board game of individual players each pitted against each other to try to win the crown of honor prize for being the first to launch the unstable Nuclear Crystal into space away from the earth.<br/><br/>The Game is played on a board labelled from 1 to 100. The Board has four different colors going on each end labelled 1 to 100. The Game Board can switch color at a moment's notice thanks to Ability cards such as Earth Bending or Terraforming. When this happens, the number is switched to a different colored number. Players on 1 can be warped to 100 square, 90 square, or 10 square.<br/><br/>Each player is designated a Mutant Gene card as their special ability throughout the game. Tokens or Weapons are collected as a player progresses through the board. Tokens are used to buy Ability cards or activate Mutant Gene abilities while weapons are used in battle with other players.<br/><br/>A battle is conducted if a player lands on the same space as another player. There are three time capsule pieces in the game where if a player collects all of them, they are automatically warped to the 100 square. They can lose a time capsule piece during a battle.<br/><br/>If a player lands on the 100 square, they must roll a 1 to successful launch the nuclear crystal into deep space and win the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

I hate to draw you away from the much-needed rest you are getting since our last encounter on the campus of Miskatonic University--but this is a matter of life and death.<br/>I have it on good authority that something strange is happening over at The Black Caverns near the edge of town. I can hardly believe it myself, but it seems the same cult we faced previously is finding a new home in the labyrinth beneath Arkham. The information I&rsquo;ve gathered is that they call themselves &ldquo;The Blind Ones&rdquo; and they prefer the dark and subterranean areas of Arkham.  It is a well-known fact among the professors of geology here at the university that there are many varied tunnels and paths in those caves. Most agree that at least seventy-five percent of the underground system has gone unexplored . . . or at the very least undocumented. It would seem that most of those who&rsquo;ve gone down there have never come back up. I hate to say it, but I believe they are being used in some sort of dark ritual. I beg you, go into those caverns, find the missing persons, and stop whatever horrific rituals are being performed.<br/>Sincerely,<br/>Herbert West<br/><br/>Welcome to One Page Cthulhu.

This time, they mean to complete their ritual and awaken the Ancient Ones they worship. &ldquo;The Blind Ones,&rdquo; as they called themselves, have recruited countless youth from around the town of Arkham with false promises of freedom and power.

        "description": "You are an independent marine merchant trading in the Pacific Ocean during World War II. Your objective is to finish the game with the most amount of money.  You primarily obtain money by trading commodities.  There are 3 commodities in the game: Oil, Iron and Gold.<br/><br/>However, the more you trade with a port that is aligned with a power (Axis or Allies), the more advantages you get from other port aligned with that same power and more disadvantages to trade with ports aligned with the other power.<br/><br/>On your turn you can move the ship to any port to trade, but the farther you go, the more oil you have to pay. At the end of your move, you choose one event card that might affect the prices and demand of commodities. Once everybody played twice on their turn, There is a PIT pahse where you can trade with others, the commodities you have or want to be oversold. After playing 5 full TRADING phases, (every round represents two years of WWII) intercalated by 4 PIT phases (there isn&rsquo;t a PIT phase after the last TRADING round) the game is over. Whoever has more money wins.<br/><br/>The game combines the strategy of European type of a board game, with the funny interaction of a Commodity Exchange trading floor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Spotting targets is done on a distance table and this speeds the game up immeasurably.<br/><br/>The effects of suppression are so severe that it also encompasses neutralisation.<br/><br/>There are comprehensive examples throughout the rules; these are in italics for easy reference.<br/><br/>If there is a chance of success then the top score will always succeed and the lowest score will always fail. The top score will usually kill the target too.<br/><br/>There is the possibility of friendly fire.<br/><br/>Armour and penetration values have been generalised so that certain types of AFVs, ATGMs, gun penetration values, etc. can be grouped together. The secrecy that surrounds modern equipment makes it impossible to give accurate number values for their performance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Shadow Brothers&rsquo; Carnival of Chaos had only been setup in Valley Falls for a little more than a day when Madame Ruby was found murdered in her fortune teller&rsquo;s wagon, bludgeoned to death with her own crystal ball. Although the killer was efficient in their killing, they left Madame Ruby before they were certain she was dead. In a last ditch effort to provide information about the one who murdered her, Madame Ruby managed to scrawl this note before passing over into the Great Beyond: &ldquo;The spirits will tell you who did this to me.&rdquo; The prime suspects for the murder come from the freak show. Those are the people you need to focus on. However, if they won&rsquo;t talk, maybe the spirits will. There have been reports of some strange occurrences going on at night after the midway shuts down. The carnies are claiming that something is using the midway games to leave cryptic messages. So you have a murder investigation, a creepy carnival, and a midway that may or may not be haunted by ghosts who are seeking to shed some light on Madame Ruby&rsquo;s murder by leaving messages amongst the test-your-luck games.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7/10<br/><br/>",

At about the same time, a strange clown has been showing up around town in various unusual places. Most people assume that the clown is a promotional tool used to help spread the word about the Monster Parade, and buzz for the event is high. That all changes when Savannah Pierce, reigning homecoming queen for the Valley Falls Druids, is found dead with smudges of greasepaint on her neck and cheeks. After repeated questioning, officials from the Monster Parade deny any knowledge of the clown and claim he isn&rsquo;t part of their organization. The Pierces, one of Valley Falls&rsquo; wealthies families, has hired you and the other members of The Will Street Detective Agency to locate the mysterious clown, uncover his identity, and find out what really happened to their daughter. Will you be able to solve the mystery of Savannah Pierce&rsquo;s murder before The Wandering Monster Parade leaves town...or will the fiend responsible get The Last Laugh?<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7/10<br/><br/>",

Cultivators collect the natural foods currency and this is increased by building ashrams and institutes.<br/><br/>The object is to collect karma cards in order to progress; a player who becomes a master may move forwards or backwards, a bodhisattva can move anywhere, and a player who gets enough can attain shanti and enter Nirvana.

        "description": "Mortain Counterattack - Hitler's Plan to Retake Normandy<br/><br/>The F&uuml;hrer had another great idea to win the war. The situation in Normandy had changed dramatically since D Day and he was determined to turn it to his advantage. Although the British/Commonwealth forces remained bogged down around the city of Caen, the Americans were on the move. After being tied up in the hedgerows of western Normandy, they launched Operation Cobra and were now breaking out, driving west along the coast heading for the Brittany ports. If the Germans could strike out and sever the advance of the American Third Army under General George Patton they might be able to force the retreat of the Americans back toward the Normandy coast or at a minimum slow down their advance and breakout into central France. The target was the seaside town of Avranches located at the base of the Cotentin peninsula.<br/><br/>It was a desperate struggle that saw the battle-weary American troops of the US 30th Infantry Division (ID) and one armor Combat Command stop four panzer divisions. It will most be most remembered for the heroes of the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Regiment/30th ID who held out for six days on Hill 314 overlooking the town of Mortain. Their stubborn resistance slowed and then stopped the German advance toward the coast.<br/><br/>The fourteen scenarios in this book cover the action from the initial assaults on August 7th, 1944 through the final attacks on August 11th as the Americans continued to force the Germans back in an effort to relieve the encircled troops on Hill 314. The majority of the scenarios cover August 7th as it was clear that after that day the Germans had already lost most of their forward momentum despite repeated attempts to continue the drive to Avranches.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The scenarios are drawn from Operation Epsom, the British offensive that took place west of Caen, in Normandy, from 26-30 June 1944. They feature engagements between British VIII Corps (15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, 11th Armoured Division, and 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division) and the German 12th SS Panzer Division, Hitlerjugend, II SS Panzer Corps (9th SS Panzer Division, Hohenstaufen, and 10th SS Panzer Division, Frundsberg), and other armored forces.<br/><br/>15 Scenarios cover VIII Corps&rsquo; initial attack on the positions of the 12th SS Panzer Division, the drive across the River Odon, and the counterattacks by II SS Panzer Corps and other armored units that attempted to cutoff or collapse the British salient. Take British infantry, supported by powerful artillery barrages, against battle-hardened panzergrenadiers. Use a Crocodile flamethrower tank to reduce German fortifications. Conduct counterattacks with improvised but capable German armored forces and engineers (with flamethrowers of their own!) through Norman villages. Fight over the bridges over the Odon that were so critical to the outcome of the operation. The scenarios show the varied nature of the fighting that took place in the fields and villages of central Normandy in late June 1944.<br/><br/>A Historical Summary, Orders of Battle, and Designer&rsquo;s Notes are included to help put the scenarios in the larger context of the battle for Normandy and allow players to design their own scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The handbook covers the Japanese army during the first phase of the War in the Pacific, December 1941 to June 1942, when its battle-hardened armies inflicted defeat after defeat on the Allies.<br/><br/>Unlike the other titles so far in the series, the nature of Japan&rsquo;s campaign of expansion means that the booklet is not divided into sections defined by the different types of division that fought, but into sections defined by the different geographical mini-campaigns: Malaya and Singapore, Burma, the Philippines, The Dutch East Indies and the South Seas. In effect, it is several theatre booklets rolled into one.<br/><br/>There are a total of forty-eight different lists split as follows:<br/><br/>     Malaya &amp; Singapore: 7 lists from 25th Army<br/>     Thailand &amp; Burma: 5 lists from 15th Army<br/>     The Philippines: 16 lists from 14th Army<br/>     Hong Kong: 1 list from 38th Division<br/>     Borneo: 2 lists from 35th Brigade<br/>     The Dutch East Indies: 15 lists from 16th Army<br/>     The South Seas: 2 lists from the South Seas Detachment<br/><br/><br/>Finally, we have the usual ratings and armoury sections, and a note on air support.<br/><br/>Although designed for IABSM, Blitzkrieg in the Far East: Japan contains a vast amount of information useful to gamers of other systems, and is really a must-buy for anyone interested in the early war period.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Next, after a quick look at the infantry that doesn&rsquo;t fit into the above (e.g. the Gebirgsjaeger), the book moves on to the ten panzer divisions: with each panzer division given its own section and set of lists. There are, for example, five different lists that relate to 9th Panzer Division alone.<br/><br/>After the Panzertruppen, the book covers the cavalry, the SS and the army level support troops (that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;ll find the StuGs!) before finishing off with the Fallschirmjaegers and Air Landing troops that dropped into Belgium and the Netherlands. Finally, we have the usual ratings and armoury sections, and a note on air support.<br/><br/>Although designed for IABSM, Blitzkrieg in the West: Germany contains a vast amount of information useful to gamers of other systems, and is really a must-buy for anyone interested in the early war period.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Dawn Rises! Revolution in Central Asia 1918-1920 is the first in a planned series of scenario books for our Setting the East Ablaze rules.<br/><br/>Although written specifically for warfare in Central Asia in the aftermath of the Russian Civil War (1917-26), we have found that the rules are very flexible. The earliest they have been played successfully is the Second Afghan War (1888), the latest modern day Africa. Both, with minor adjustments, worked well. These scenario books will cover a slightly wider core period and a significantly wider geography. Most will be based around historical engagements, but those of you who follow &lsquo;The League of Extraordinary Kriegspielers&rsquo; adventures in their alternative reality of 192? will be glad to hear that those tales will also be told before too long.<br/><br/>The backdrop for this first set of scenarios is the main source book for the so-called Back of Beyond period: Peter Hopkirk&rsquo;s &quot;Setting the East Ablaze &ndash; On Secret Service in Bolshevik Asia&quot;. This rollicking tale, first published in 1984, tells true stories of the period in breath-taking fashion.<br/><br/>This book contains eight/nine scenarios, each with a historical context, objectives, army lists and maps. Most are playable on a 6&rsquo; x 4&rsquo; table, and require manageable amounts of figures and terrain. It covers the period from February 1918 in the immediate chaos following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 up until September 1920, when the Reds really began to exert their brutal grip on Central Asia. All games are based on known historical facts and orders of battle, and where none exist, a reasonable extrapolation of what was known. If some of the historical battles were very one sided (as they were), I have tried to rebalance the sides to give a better game.<br/><br/><br/>     Scenario 1: Counter Revolution in Samarkhand<br/>         Pt1: The Mutineers Attack!<br/>         Pt 2: The Revolution Strikes Back!<br/>    <br/>     Scenario 2: The First Battle of Bukhara<br/>     Scenarios 3-4: The TransCaspian Episode<br/>         The Battle of Kakhka<br/>         The Battle of Dushak<br/>    <br/>     Scenario 5: Bailey Vanishes<br/>     Scenario 6: Counter-Revolution in Tashkent<br/>     Scenario 7: Bailey Escapes<br/>     Scenario 8: The Fall of Bukhara<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DevSecOps is a serious game designed as part of a 10 week course on Secure Software Design and Development.  It is introduced at the beginning of the course as an introduction to many of the concepts taught in the class and presented again late in the course as an opportunity for review.  It is designed with the following lesson objectives in mind:<br/><br/>     Judge the cost and risk trade offs between secure and unsecured software aspects including code, data and usability.<br/>     Devise a strategy to produce a system under threats.<br/>     Comprehend that partial security may equate to no security.<br/>     Identify examples of insecure code and methods of mitigating them.<br/><br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds, each of which has four phases.  Play continues until someone meets the win condition in phase four of a round.  Phases occur sequentially, but players perform a single phase simultaneously (i.e., all players perform Resource Production then all players perform Project Advancement, etc.).  The phases in a round are:<br/><br/>     Resource Production: players simultaneously select 4 cards from any combination of decks (e.g., 2 usability cards, 1 DevSecOps card, and 1 data card).  The only caveat is that each player must take at least one DevSecOps card.  <br/>     Project Advancement: players play any number of cards from their hand to their tableau.  Each card has a cost associated with it.  To play a card, a player must discard cards from his hand equal to the cost of the card.  <br/>     A card is turned up from the event deck that affect all players and generally involves losing cards in their tableau.  <br/>     Check for Project Completion:  If a player has 2 Progress Points in each area and an ``Authority to Operate card in their tableau, that player wins (ties are possible). <br/><br/><br/>Game components consist of five decks of cards.  There are three component decks that represent management focus on Usability, Software, and Data.  Cards in these decks provide personnel and data security from attacks as well as Progress Points.  The fourth deck, DevSecOps, improves players' ability to advance in the component areas as well as containing several copies of &quot;Authority to Operate&quot; (needed to win).  The final deck is an event deck that causes players to lose a card in one of the component areas if it isn't sufficiently protected.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Go head-to-head with your opponent - simultaneously rolling ten dice to decide who wins each lock-up, gets to execute offence, and win over the rabid pro wrestling crowd.<br/><br/>Using a mixture of attacks, counter-attacks and blocks, your aim is to build your posture enough to hit a finisher and pin your opponent for a count of three! Crowd reaction tokens can be earned and used to unlock steel chairs, start &lsquo;this is awe-some&rsquo; chants, or lower your opponent&rsquo;s posture to give you some space to recover. The dice decide the outcome of each grapple, but it&rsquo;s up to you to decide when to play to the fans and when to fight dirty.<br/><br/>Once your posture reaches a certain point you can attempt a pin: both players break out their pin dice and roll them once for each count from the referee. If you can score equal to or higher than your opponent three times in a row the bell rings and you are declared the winner! If not they kick out and you lock up again. It&rsquo;s unpredictable, it&rsquo;s tense &ndash; it&rsquo;s pro wrestling!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The land campaigns include information on troop types, weapons, formations and battlefield tactics. The Naval includes information on the ships armament, naval strategies and fighting tactics.<br/><br/>The unique system of Decision Games is explained, which with the use of Programmed Events and Chance Events form the basis of the campaign rules which are included.<br/><br/>In the campaign modules the commanders are given historical objectives and the forces that were available to them. This book provides the rules to re-fight the campaign modules with the methods for troop manoeuvres being dependent upon their commander&rsquo;s ability, weather and plain luck. Forces march along defined routes, must maintain a line of supply and set down depots. They suffer from sickness and desertions but occasionally receive reinforcements. The rules also include a system of bidding which accurately portrays the skirmishing and manoeuvring prior to a battle or withdrawal.<br/><br/>Troop strengths are always recorded in terms of Army Points (APs) or Naval Points (NPs).

        "description": "The siege rules make use of the authors Decision Games system which enables a siege to be conducted in terms of Stages as outlined by the great French military engineer Sebastion de Vauban. The system uniquely and realistically enables the timing of the advancing stages of a siege to run sequentially with the land campaign and along the timetables set by Vauban and so make sense in the context of a campaign.<br/><br/>Within the campaign system, each fortress is classified as being either weak, medium, strong etc. and a Victory Points value (VPs) incorporated into the initial balance. Dependent upon the strength of the fortress it is allocated a garrison strength (APs) and a garrison morale value (GM) plus a proportionate amount of provisions (GPRs).<br/><br/>Similarly the besieger whose strength (APs) is dependent upon the situation in the campaign, monitors his own force&rsquo;s morale (BM) which will vary as the siege progresses and with comparison with Vauban&rsquo;s timetable. The presence and size of any siege train or the approach of a relieving force are also critical to success.<br/><br/>This siege system enables the besieger to choose from a variety of tactics which may vary at each stage. These include sapping, bombardment and stratagems.<br/>The defender similarly has a number of tactics to hand including stratagems and even the occasional sortie which can lead to a table top encounter.<br/>The progress of the siege is dependent upon a cross reference of each side&rsquo;s tactical choices some of which result in either a Reaction Test by the Garrison or the Besieger. These can result in surrender, a lifting of the siege or a continuation.<br/><br/><br/>     Siege Decision Game Mechanics.<br/>     Garrison&rsquo;s Morale (GM) and Besieger&rsquo;s Morale (GM).<br/>     Garrison&rsquo;s Provisions (GPs).<br/>     Log&rsquo;s for Sieges of Fortresses including Reaction Tests.<br/>     Truth Tables.<br/>     Diagram of a typical Vauban fortress and the siege stages.<br/>     Honours of War (HOW).<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This campaign is set in Silesia part of modern day Poland in the winter of 1741 and at the beginning of the second year of the conflict popularly known as the First Silesian War which later expanded into the wider conflict known as the War of the Austrian Succession. It attempts to re-enact the attempt by the Austrian army commanded by Marshal Niepperg to march to the relief of the blockaded fortresses of Neisse and Brieg and to simultaneously cut the Prussian occupying army&rsquo;s lines of supply. Had the Austrians succeeded, King Frederick II (The Great) of Prussia would in all probability have been forced to surrender because his position in Silesia would have been untenable.<br/><br/>Frederick was taken by surprise and with many of his troops being dispersed into winter cantonments, it was a race against time to concentrate his forces before being attacked by the Austrians. Early on at the battle of Mollwitz it went badly for Frederick who fled the field only to discover that his army had gained a victory during his absence.<br/><br/>The campaign module does not aim to slavishly recreate the attempted relief of Silesia to the last historical detail. Nor does it attempt to fight the whole war or even every engagement across central Europe during 1741. Finally of course, it does not aim to re-fight the battle of Mollwitz on replicated terrain and with the historically accredited troops there. Instead it provides players with the information and mechanics to re-fight the Mollwitz campaign closely based on historically accurate forces, commanders and strategic considerations.<br/><br/>Its aim is to provide an interesting (and challenging) backdrop or context for table top battles.<br/><br/>This was a very short campaign being all over in less than 2 weeks. There are no sieges, naval actions or reinforcements involved. Consequently, it serves as an excellent introduction to the campaign system.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/><br/>     Historical Background.<br/>     Campaign Map.<br/>     Commanders.<br/>     Initial Army Strengths and Fortresses.<br/>     Progremmed Events.<br/>     Chance Events.<br/>     Army Lists.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Book contains 3 standalone land campaign modules.<br/><br/>The Nish Campaign, 1737. Austrians v Ottoman Turks.<br/>This campaign is set in Serbia in the late summer of 1737 during the Austro-Russian-Turkish War of 1736-39. It attempts to re-create the invasion of Ottoman Serbia by a Habsburg Imperial army led by Marshal Count Friedrich von Seckendorf and its opposition by the Ottoman Grand Vizier Al Haji Mohammed who commanded the Ottoman Army on behalf of his master the Sultan.<br/><br/>The campaign ended in a disastrous failure for the Austrians following their defeats at the battle of Valjevo and the recapture of Nish by the Ottomans.<br/><br/>The campaign includes at least one siege against a medium fortress (Nish), the probability of two other sieges and unusually the probability of some fortresses being besieged, captured and then re-besieged and recaptured by the relieving forces.<br/><br/>Special features of this campaign include the fact that the invading army decimated by sickness and in particular malaria, eventually becomes the prey. They are pursued and virtually destroyed by an aggressive relief force led by the Grand Vizier and defeated at the battle of Valjevo.<br/><br/>It also pits a poorly trained and equipped European army against a basically irregular Asian army with a high proportion of cavalry.<br/><br/>The Cuneo Campaign, 1744. French and Spanish v Austrians and Sardinians.<br/>This campaign is set in north-western Italy in the summer of 1744 and is part of the wider conflict popularly known as the War of the Austrian Succession 1741-45. It attempts to re-create the Franco-Spanish (sometimes referred to as &lsquo;Gallispan&rsquo;) invasion of Piedmont, led by Prince Louis de&rsquo;Conti which was opposed by Charles Emmanuel the King of Sardinia (Piedmont) with an Austro-Sardinian army who fought to protect his kingdom. Although victorious at the battle of Madonna dell&rsquo;Olmo, the campaign ended with the Gallispans being forced to withdraw from Piedmont after torrential rain destroyed their siege works at Cuneo.<br/><br/>The campaign includes a potential siege or storming of a Weak Fortress, and a number of potential sieges against Weak and Medium Fortresses including the historical objectives of Demonte and Cuneo.<br/><br/>The Gallispan lines of supply across the Alps is an important and special feature of this campaign. The French objective was to capture an important fortress to be used as a base for the campaign planned for the following year. Another feature is the fortifications known as the Barricades built by Charles Emanuel to prevent the passage of enemy troops through the Stura Valley. The maneuvering and audacity of the Gallispan attack which resulted in the capturing of the fortifications was hailed as the feat of arms in Europe at the time.<br/><br/>The Zorndorf Campaign, 1758. Russians v Prussians.<br/>This campaign is set on Prussia&rsquo;s eastern borders with Poland in the summer of 1758 and is part of the wider conflict popularly known as the Seven Years War 1756-63.<br/>It attempts to re-create the invasion into Prussia by a Russian army led by General Villim Fermor which was opposed by King Frederick II who personally commanded his own Prussian Army. The campaign ended after the bloody draw at Zorndorf with the Russians withdrawing from Prussia and Pomerania.<br/><br/>The campaign includes a potential siege or storming of a Basic Fortress, and a number of potential sieges against Weak Fortresses including the historical objective at Custrin/Kustrin (modern-day Kostrzyn).<br/><br/>Special features of this campaign include the fact that it has one army the Prussians, actively rushing to force a battle and destroy the enemy. A definite Napoleonic strategy and a far cry from the usual 18th C. maneuvers to capture fortresses or other possessions.<br/><br/>Each module contains its own:-<br/>&bull; Historical Background.<br/>&bull; An account of the historical campaign.<br/>&bull; Campaign Map.<br/>&bull; Programmed Events Table.<br/>&bull; Chance Events Tables.<br/>&bull; Army Lists.<br/><br/>",

Spider-man has his work cut out for him-and it will take all his Spidey-speed to grab the Green Goblin(and all the cards) first!<br/><br/>Based on the popular game Slap Jack, this fast-paced card game will keep the Spidey-action flowing battle after battle.<br/><br/>52 card deck includes an instruction card and 3 BONUS VILLAIN CARDS!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>The goal is to win the Green Goblin and all the cards, by being first to slap each villain card as it is played to the center.<br/><br/>Deal cards one at a time face down, to each player until all the cards have been dealt. The hands do not have to come out even. Without looking at any of the cards, each player squares up their hand into a neat pile in front of them.<br/><br/>Beginning on the dealer&rsquo;s left, each player lifts one card at a time from their pile and places it face up in the center of the table.<br/>When the card played to the center is a villain card, the first player to slap their hand down on the villain takes it, as well as all the cards beneath it. The player winning these cards turns them face down, places them under their pile of cards, and shuffles them to form a new, larger pile.<br/><br/>When more than one player slaps at a villain, the one whose hand is directly on top of the jack wins the pile. If a player slaps at any card in the center that is not a villain, they must give one card, face down, to the player of that card. When a player has no more cards left, they remain in the game until the next villain is turned. The player may slap at the villain in an effort to get a new pile. If the player fails to win that next pile, they are out of the game.<br/><br/>",

There are no markers or other battlefield clutter, the basing system lets the figures do the work! Assuming the units perform like clockwork as expected, Evolutionary War offers miniatures rules for an age in which war had rules. The challenge is in planning battles that takes advantage of those rules, the rewards come in historical miniatures battles that suit an age in which &ldquo;taste&rdquo; governed everything.<br/><br/>Period: Players can span the globe from Europe to the Americas or India ; as far back in time as the First Silesian War in 1740 and up to the early battles of the French Revolution before 1794.<br/><br/>Scale: The principal unit of the age was the infantry or cavalry regiment&mdash;militarily and socially&mdash;so the game is organized around this scale, with regiments as the basic playing pieces.

However, the forest is full of all manner of monsters and beasties who emerge once the sun sets, and the team must make their escape before the night fully draws in.<br/><br/>Each game of Ranger Danger proceeds over two distinct phases of play:<br/><br/>In Phase 1 (&ldquo;Build the Forest&rdquo;), players place tiles on the board to map out forest paths that will bring them back together and help them find the exit; placing monsters where required. In Phase 2 (&ldquo;Escape!&rdquo;), players move around the board, battling enemies and trying to survive long to make their way to the &lsquo;Home&rsquo; tile.<br/><br/>If all four Rangers reach the central &lsquo;Home&rsquo; tile before the Forest Tile stack has been fully depleted, they will successfully survive the forest and win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In this edition, the focus is on the game setup, focusing on the work going into setting up any game. After set up, the morale system is examined in depth, exploring the troop definitions that can enable as much variation as wanted or indeed warranted by any scenario.<br/><br/>The scenarios, themselves, are based on four main battles from the Danube Campaign of 1809 between the French, commanded by Napoleon, and the Austrians, commanded by Archduke Charles. <br/>In order, the battles are<br/><br/>     Abensberg,<br/>     Eckmuhl,<br/>     Aspern-Essling and<br/>     Wagram. <br/><br/><br/>Each scenario has a map, full OB and any special rules.

In this edition, the focus is the section within the rules that governs &ldquo;Orders&rdquo; and &ldquo;Command &amp; Control&rdquo;. The next aspect of the rules to receive in depth analysis is the rules pertaining to Skirmishers and how they are used in the battles using In The Grandest Manner.<br/><br/>The scenarios, themselves, are based on four main battles that involved the Russians prior to 1812. <br/>The battles covered are<br/><br/>     Austerlitz,<br/>     Eylau and<br/>     Friedland. <br/><br/><br/>Austerlitz is somewhat unusual, it was split into two separate battles because of its overall size, the northern and southern fronts. Each scenario has a map, full OB and any special rules. Typical dispositions, from the games played here, are also used to illustrate the scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Esprit de Corps &ndash; Power and Glory is designed to meet the challenge of bringing to life this exiting period of history in the form of fast-moving, exhilarating and true to life games of skill on the table-top, redolent with all the atmosphere, colour and heroism of the battlefields of the times.<br/><br/>Users of Esprit de Corps and Esprit de Corps A House Divided will be familiar with the general format and content of this rule book and with the rule mechanisms employed. Indeed there is some overlap in the period covered with that covered by Esprit de Corps, and complete overlap with A House Divided which is specifically honed to bring out the historical nuances and characteristics of the American Civil War. That is deliberate and in the latter case unavoidable given the broader canvas which Power and Glory seeks to address. For battles in the Crimea or the Indian Mutiny, for example, you have the choice to use either Esprit de Corps or Power and Glory for your wargames, the outcome will be more or less the same. Later in our period casualty rates increased with the widespread introduction of efficient breech-loading firearms and artillery and more effective machine-guns, and there was a resulting tendency to employ a somewhat more dispersed deployment of troops in the line of battle, all of which are accurately taken into account in these rules. Of course the development of Power and Glory' has benefited enormously from the experience of the authors with the two previous publications in the Esprit de Corps series and with rule books in the parallel Warlord series covering warfare in earlier periods of history.<br/><br/>Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are at the heart of these rules, just as they are in others in the Esprit de Corps and Warlord series. Though the effect of firepower is awesome, you cannot merely rely on defensive tactics alone for success. So be bold, exploit your chain of command to best advantage, concentrate your troops where it matters most, be aggressive where you can but defend resolutely where you must, and make best use of ground at all times. You can have great fun with these rules and your games will be fast and furious.<br/><br/>Authentic historical accuracy brings to life the character and atmosphere of combat in the wars of the second half of the 19th Century.<br/>Fast action games at every level in all theatres of war.<br/>Detailed and carefully calibrated troop classification accurately reproducing the characteristics of the units and<br/>soldiers in each and every war world-wide.<br/>Comprehensive coverage of combat formations and weaponry.<br/>Figures based in standard multiples as elements - no need to re-base your troops.<br/>Summary Starter Rules to get you into action fast.<br/>Fully detailed and comprehensive explanation in the Main Rules.<br/>Many worked examples of how the rules operate plus numerous explanatory diagrams.<br/>Complete example battle account - 'Action at El Teb'.<br/>Carefully crafted and entirely internally consistent for speedy action and exciting games.<br/>Essentially simple D6 based rules systems common with others in the Esprit de Corps Series - play one play them all!<br/>Alternate movement facilitates fast play.<br/>Command &amp; control - recreating the difficulties and frustrations of command on the battlefield with a fully functioning chain of command from the C-in-C to the unit CO.<br/>Example army lists and guidelines on how to put together your miniature armies.<br/>Bolt on, fully compatible additional rules in a separate Appendix taking you on into the early 20th Century.<br/>Fast and easy access to all aspects of the rules - cross referenced and indexed throughout.<br/>Playsheets included for hassle-free, rapid manoeuvre and swift combat resolution on the tabletop.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Command and control and rapid manoeuvre are right at the centre of things. As a result there's quite a lot to get to grips with in this rulebook, but don't worry, the rule systems and mechanisms are basically simple and quick to use.<br/><br/>The rules are all about command and control, the absolute core of the Esprit de Corps system. You have to prompt your troops into action and at times restrain them from recklessly forgetting their orders. It enables the opposing sides to move alternately while retaining the potential for each to outmanoeuvre the other and for tactical surprise on the battlefield. As the action develops you will find more and more demands falling on your generals, drawing on their reserves of command and control. If the latter run out, your army will rapidly disintegrate and suffer defeat. Movement is rapid, each move representing from 10 to 15 minutes of action on the battlefield, and though ranges are significant, there is still plenty of scope for the use of manoeuvre to outplay your opponent, especially if your terrain is thoughtfully designed to accurately recreate that in the real theatre of operations you are depicting.<br/><br/>The systems for shooting, monitoring morale and determining the outcomes of attacks, melees and pursuits are simple, internally consistent and robust, so that they quick to resolve yet give an outcome which is appropriate and sensitive to the tactical situation, and, importantly, historically authentic. Normal (D6) dice are used for all transactions involving a random element (a die roll) throughout the rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On the first turn of the game the Soviet player has movement points to distribute, but after that each unit's movement allowance is determined by the combination of a die roll and its distance from its HQ.<br/><br/>",

Over the course of 5 rounds, the Cabal player will choose disaster cards that the Resistance players must take down together by properly assigning their resources. However, the Resistance players' true goal is to awaken all 9 representatives of humanity.

        "description": "This card game from 1898 by music publisher Theodore Presser was intended to be an educational aid to music students.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 39 cards, which together form the basic chords possible for each of the 13 keys. Each card has a large letter in the middle, representing its note. The key to which that note belongs is in the upper right corner, and the musical symbol for that key (sharps or flats) is in the upper left. The bottom of the card lists all three notes in that key.<br/><br/>The rules say that the game can be played as a simple set collection game like Authors, but is more interesting with a second set of rules, which it says resemble &quot;Cassino&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of five cards, and five more are dealt face up on the table. In turn, each player must if possible place a card from hand onto the table that matches the key of one of those showing. If unable to place a matching card, he may place any other card on the table. The player who puts the final card in a triad or chord collects all three as a set.<br/><br/>If no cards remain on the table, the next player puts down any card to start the process over. When any player runs out of cards, one more card is dealt to each player. Once all cards have been played, the player collecting the largest number of sets wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Some turn out poorly, however, so you will have to travel the limbo road. At the end of the journey, only one of you can win the game and move on.<br/><br/>Both players will use cards to move along Limbo Road, along with a few special cards to help their cause or hinder their opponent. They'll collect colored Good Deed tiles which may provide victory points, and Fate tiles which will provide special actions. Upon reaching limbo the game becomes a bit restricted and players will have to choose their actions more carefully....

The plan called for use of some 34,600 Allied airborne infantry, the Market, to provide the blanket for armored forces, the Garden, to roll forward on as they advanced into Germany in what is known as the largest airborne battle in history. The First Allied Airborne Army under tactical command by General Browning was composed of British, American, and Polish troops who would be dropped ahead of the land based armored advance of British XXX Corps to secure key bridges along a route known as the Corridor through the Netherlands to the Rhine. General Brian Horrocks, the commander of XXX Corps likened the operation to threading a series of needles as each bridge is secured and passed with the last bridge being the most essential to it&rsquo;s success. This last bridge was Arnhem and was tasked to the British 1st Airborne Division to hold for an estimated 48 hours till XXX Corps could link up with them. This was an operation that was more dependent on fortune than the men partaking it could imagine.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Most of the squares show pieces of a knight's equipment, while the rest have various animals or objects as well as a wizard (3-3).<br/><br/>The rules say that all players should start by putting 24 Marks into the pot(the middle of the board). Players take turns rolling and must follow the instructions for the space showing their die roll. These either allow the player to take that amount from the pot or pay that much into the pot.<br/><br/>The first player to roll a double six takes the whole pot and ends the game. If there is nothing left in the pot when a double six is rolled, all players have to throw in half the original bet, which goes to the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Floating Castles are miniature wargame rules to simulate naval warfare during the 1860-1885 period.<br/><br/>The rules cater for any scale with distances measured in yards and speed in knots, converted into inches or fractions.<br/><br/>You'll need D10's as the rules are based around percentage rolls for most outcomes.<br/><br/>The sequence of play is straightforward and is based on alternate moves, with each player moving one ship at a time based on an initiative roll. Shooting is simultaneous but torpedoes and ram attacks have their own placing in the sequence.<br/><br/>There are rules for weather and stability, with a die roll at the start of the game to determine the conditions of play.<br/><br/>Movement is measured in inches, with variable maneuverability depending upon the speed and size of ships involved.<br/><br/>Shooting is determined after movement has taken place. All shooting depends upon arcs of fire although, once again, there are no templates provided. If a target is in range and inside a firing arc at the end of the movement phase, it can be fired upon.<br/><br/>To hit a target, a D10 is rolled for each gun requiring a base 'to hit' score depending upon range. There are, in a addition, a small number of +1 modifiers for sea state, angle of fire etc.<br/><br/>If a hit is scored, a percentile roll is made to detemine damage, with various hit locations and effects. Armour penetration is dealt with by averaging out the actual armour protection of a target across the whole ship, with each vessel classified as either light, medium, heavy or super heavy. Armour penetration depends upon a D10 roll based on the weapon fired and the strength of the armour, modified by range.<br/><br/>There are additional straightforward rules for spar, locomotive and towed torpeodoes, mines, ramming and boarding. These are dealt with after the movement and shooting phases have been resolved.<br/><br/>At the end of the rulebook there are 13 comprehensive page of data tables for virtually every fleet that you might wish to deploy, with stats for both minor nations and the major powers. There are also details of the formulae used to calculate the stats for each ship, so you can always fill in the blanks for those vessels that aren't listed.<br/><br/>",

Eight segments of the spinner indicate points gained between 0 and 60. The other four segments have losses of between 2 and 20. Printed on the bottom are a matching 12 segments, one per city in the deck.<br/><br/>To play, the deck is reduced to one set per player. The cards are then shuffled and dealt out evenly. Before play begins, the dealer without looking spins a dial fixed into the box and closes the lid.<br/><br/>Play then proceeds as in Pit. Players call out any number of cards they wish to exchange. They may not name or hint at cities they have or want. As soon as one player collects a set of four, he announces &quot;Tut-Tut&quot;. The box is then opened to reveal how many points plus or minus that city is worth to the winner of this round.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player reaches a point total that varies by number of players, from 300 for four players to 100 for 11 to 12 players.<br/><br/>Each card bears the same photograph of four people in a car that resembles a 1905 Packard N.

        "description": "In the world of politics it seems nothing is every completely clear and many c operations work hard and spends millions to see that their interests are put before all others. In the game of Lobbyist - Shaping the Vote, players get to try their hand at lobbying, working to influence politicians to vote their desired way while competing with other lobbyist who are working towards a different means and outcome.<br/><br/>Lobbyist - Shaping the Vote is a game where players take on the role of Lobbyist trying to influence the political committee to voting in their desired way. Each player is a lobbyist starting with $50,000. The board is a political committee voting on five issues, Education, Health and Welfare, Infrastructure, Taxes and Revenue, Crime and Punishment. Each issue's influence is represented by a dice value and Lobbyist play cards from their hand to increase and decrease those dice values. Around the board will be 5,7,or 9 (depending on difficulty of play) unique politicians, all with a voting position value for each of the five issues. Politicians will not vote yes until the die values matches or exceeds their voting position values. Each lobbyist it working to gather desired votes on these issues, wanting to gather yes votes on two issues, and no votes on two issues, being indifferent on the fifth issue (each player lobbyist card has different yes/no goals on their cards).<br/><br/>Throughout the game players will have cards in hand and will draw and play a card on their turn. Most cards will allow then to influence one or more of the voting issue dice. Vote cards are shuffled into the deck and when one of these is drawn the player immediately plays the Vote card and the committee votes on the issues. Prior to voting though the Lobbyist all have one final chance to influence their politicians by either taking a vote action (indicted on the cards), or by spending up to $20,000 of their money to increase or decrease dice values. Once each player has had a chance to take or pass on an action, the politicians vote on the issues and players get yes/no vote tokens for their successful lobbying. Game ends after the fifth vote happens and final scores are tallied.<br/><br/>I came up with this game idea after sitting through a number of political action committee meetings and hearing the same info numerous times, so I started jotting ideas. The can has been play tested some and everyone I have played with has enjoyed the game at this point.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game consists of 1-9 in four suits and 9 &quot;seal cards&quot;.  The suit of the cards is shown on the back, and the first hand is played with only the green and yellow cards.  The blue cards are added for the second hand, and the red cards are added for the next hand.<br/><br/>The player's goal is to seal a certain amount of the seal cards, which have conditions such as &quot;three cards of the same value&quot; or &quot;two cards from each of two suits&quot;.<br/><br/>It is a &quot;may follow&quot; game, where the &quot;demon&quot; will play the top card from a stack of cards representing their hand, and the player will choose their card.  If the player wins, the cards may be used to help satisfy a seal card.  Depending upon the cards played by the &quot;demon&quot;, special effects may be activated, such as causing the player to discard their highest ranked card.<br/><br/>Once a player has satisfied all face up seal cards, they win.

        "description": "This is a 4 page free scenario to compliment Fallschirmjaeger, British and US Paratrooper books.<br/><br/>Victory Decision: World War II is an action based game that allows you to command a platoon sized force or more in this momentous conflict. It features a unique Leadership-modified alternate unit activation system. The result is a fun and fast paced war game that involves both players almost constantly.<br/><br/>The rules cover virtually all aspects of World War II gaming. The full rulebook contains rules for:<br/><br/>     Moving, Hiding, Infiltrating and Spotting,<br/>     Shooting and Concentrated Fire Actions,<br/>     Assault and Close Combat Actions,<br/>     Artillery and Air Strikes, Bunker Assaults, Night Fighting, Foxholes, Tank Pits and much more...<br/><br/><br/>Victory Decision emphasises Troop Quality and Leadership and includes a fast and detailed Vehicle combat system.<br/><br/>The rules cover individually based infantry miniatures and also group- or multibased miniatures, aka Infantry Stands. While designed with 20-28mm miniatures in mind the Victory Decision game system is flexible enough to handle any miniatures from 6mm to 32mm. So whatever your existing miniature collection consists of, you can start playing right away.<br/><br/>This rulebook not only provides Scenarios but also Point based Army Lists for late war British, German, Soviet and US forces. All necessary Game Markers are also included within this book.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The scoring cards are randomly placed out in a row and will be won sequentially.<br/><br/>The winner of a trick sets the scoring card between themselves and the player on their left.  They will score the right most value on the card, and their left hand neighbor will score the left most value.  The most score cards that can be placed between two players is 3, and if a 4th would be added, it is instead moved clockwise to the next position between players that does not already have 3 score cards.<br/><br/>The game lasts 1 hand.

The three games are:<br/>1.  ECOTRIVIA:   Containing 648 Questions related to the environmental issue and the ECOCARDS game.<br/>2.  ECOCARDS: 2 Decks of Cards, using the 4 elements of nature: Earth, Air, Water and Fire, containing 54 EcoTips and 54 EcoVips.<br/>3.  RECYCARDS: where only with the right strategy you will be able to recycle all waste.<br/>&bull;    The great appeal is that the 3 games although they can be enjoyed independently, we have articulated them in a single Main Game, creating an entertaining ECO Adventure.<br/><br/>Play, get fun and learn in this ECOadventure to become into a Guardian of your Future!

Use insane experiments, ingenious ideas and shady sabatoga-tacticts to show everybody that you're the mastermind on the table!<br/>Also you can combine the game with an App. So you have different modes to play. Like Sport, Quiz or Drink mode.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Shuffle the deck and place it in the middle of the table. Every Player draws 7 handcards. Afterwards, everybody have to put 3 cards from the deck face down in front of her/him. These three cards represent the reputation of a player! Once per turn, you can put 1 CARD from your hand face down to your REPUTATION. (Always from left to right).<br/><br/>The number on the left upper corner of a card represents the PLAYING COST. <br/>You can play as many CARDS per turn as you want, as long as the combined amount of  the PLAYING COST is not higher than your REPUTATION. You play one card after another, so use your mathematical skills to keep track of the total amout of PLAYING COSTS you already used.<br/><br/>After you played a CARD, you put it to the DISCARD PILE. (the DISCARD PILE is right next to your DECK). If you can&acute;t or just don&acute;t want to play another card, you finish your TURN by drawing 1 CARD from the DECK. Note that this is the last thing you can do. Therefore, immediately after drawing this card, the player next to your left side start his / her TURN.<br/>IMPORTANT: After each TURN, the amount of used REPUTATION is put back to 0.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game:<br/>If you increase your reputation to 10, you are the winner! Drops your reputation to 0, you must clear the table.<br/>If your are the last 'Prof' standing, you're also the Winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

People with their guardian Angels travel through the time of their life (days of the week on the game board), getting ether into a Wisdom square, or into a Battle square, depending on the number rolled on the dice. When they land on a square, they draw a Wisdom or a Battle card and play them out according to the rules.<br/><br/>The main resource in the game is Grace, which is represented by the colored rubber bands. People are awarded Grace when they draw from the sources of Wisdom and build the Church. They use up Grace when fighting Passions in Battles.<br/><br/>Wisdom cards contain short stories from the Bible (or other sources), that players are asked to re-tell with their own words. The players are rewarded with Grace, depending on the completeness of the story. After the story telling, they go into building the Church from the puzzle pieces.<br/><br/>Battle cards describe the life situations the People get into and what the Angles and the Passions advising them to do in these circumstances. Depending on the difficulty of the situation, there are from one to four Passions attacking the Person. Your goal is to help the angles to knock them down by shooting them with the Grace you&rsquo;ve accumulated so far. If you can&rsquo;t shoot down all the Passions, the Person goes into the Sinful Circle &ndash; an inner circle on the game board, where all the squares are Battle squares.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll be building the church out of puzzle pieces on every Wisdom turn and on every successful Battle turn. If a Battle is lost, you don&rsquo;t get to build the Church.<br/><br/>The game is over, when the Church is built. Everyone wins, but those with the most Grace bands left deserve the biggest praise.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You are in command of the Missile Defense system, and your mission is to defend your cities from annihilation. Target and destroy the incoming enemy warheads. The fate of civilization depends upon you.<br/><br/>The game is designed to give something of the feel of the old &quot;Missile Command&quot; arcade game. It requires a 6x8 grid gameboard, 22 counters, and a 6d. The enemy warheads enter in three waves and are guided by dice rolls. Players defend three cities against these incoming warheads by placing Targeting Markers at aiming points for antimissile weapons. You lose if any of your cities are hit by an incoming warhead.<br/><br/>Games usually last 15-20 minutes. The difficulty-level is adjustable, from &quot;easy&quot; to &quot;we're toast&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The presence of the Nazi flag and of Berlin as a short-cut space, together with the absence of a Soviet Union flag, suggests that it was published shortly after the 1936 Anti-Comintern Pact.<br/><br/>The board has a circular track made up mostly of national flags. There also are two straight tracks the cross the board at right angles. These are possible shortcuts.<br/><br/>Players roll dice and move one of their three planes forward by the number shown. If a plane lands on Mount Fuji, it can take the shortcut across to Mount Everest, which takes only 8 spaces instead of 22. If a plane on the shortcut lands on the North Pole, the central space, it can turn toward Berlin and reach the finish line in only five spaces. A second shortcut is possible by landing on the Airship space, directly across from the finish line. This allows the plane to skip the second half of the circle. The first player to get all three players to the finish line wins.<br/><br/>While the theme is about pleasure travel, competition is cutthroat. Any plane landing on the same space as another one &quot;shoots down&quot; the first plane, sending it back to start.<br/><br/>The rules are printed on the back of the board and appear in Japanese, English and Spanish.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The box is filled with glossy paper slips marked with a category on the back and either a headline or story on the front. The stories are actual news events from the time (including some false versions).<br/><br/>In turn, a player rolls 2D6, which requires drawing the top slip of paper from the appropriate box. These boxes are: 2 - Must (a story that must be included); 3 - Hold for Release (a story that cannot be put on the page until released by another event; 4 - City Editor; 5 - Telegraph Editor; 6 - News Editor (allows drawing a headline or a A-sized short story); 7 - Take a C-Short story; 8 - Take a B-Short story; 9 - Copy Desk (also allows choosing a headline or an A-Short; 10 - Picture Editor; 11 - Scoop; 12 - Flash. The last two are the only ways to get &quot;Special&quot; stories.<br/><br/>Players may rearrange their pages at any time, and &quot;Go to Press&quot; as soon as their pages are full. When all but one player has gone to press, the remaining player follows a process to fill in the page immediately.<br/><br/>The articles on each page are then rated against a secret key of circulation values. These values are added up for each player, and the one with the highest total circulation wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The board has an unusual circular shape divided into latitudes and longtitudes.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 18 plastic ships in green or grey: 1 aircraft carrier, 1 battleship, 2 each of cruisers, destroyers and submarines, 4 mine ships and six patrol ships. Each type of ship has a unique &quot;command&quot; pattern that defines the directions and distances to which it can move and attack.<br/><br/>Before starting, each player secretly designates either his battleship or his aircraft carrier as his &quot;flagship&quot;. The game ends immediately if a player takes the opposing flagship.<br/><br/>The game may also end in a truce: either because neither player has enough forces left to capture the opposing flagship or because one is offered by one player. If the opposing player refuses the truce offer, he must win within 14 moves or the truce becomes automatic. The winner of a game ending in a truce is determined by the point values of opposing ships captured, between 1 and 5 each.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

We hope this is achieved by using efficient game mechanics that take a pure mathematical approach. This game contains many radical systems, terminology and mechanics of which combat resolution by one die is at the forefront. A lot of effort and thinking went into this game, our hope is that you enjoy gaming with Into Glory Ride.<br/><br/>Of course, your initial reaction may be &quot;1500 - 1900, just not possible&quot;. However, while developing and testing Phalanx we started to see no logical reason to subdivide the period of 1500AD to 1900AD into the classic periods of Renaissance, Marlburian, Napoleonic, ACW and Colonial. We see the period from a different perspective, that of the increasing lethality of firearms and their effect on the field. Physics and physical constrains are our guidelines. In other areas not much changed, a Soldier at the battle of Omdurman would not find himself too out of place at Waterloo. However, his weapons being much more lethal. The dense close order of Line Infantry (1700ish) gave way to the thick skirmishing lines of the ACW and Colonial period. Even WW1 was fought using 19th Century thinking, albeit with massive fire power. Just be incompetent and you'll game quite realistically.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(It is therefore equivalent to a board of octagons and squares.)<br/><br/>Each player has two types of pieces: blocks (large discs) and pawns (small pointed cylinders). A large square can hold one block or up to four pawns (possibly from both players); a small square can only only a pawn.<br/><br/>On a turn both players roll two dice and the high roller gets to move; they can move two pieces, one with each die, or one piece using the sum of the dice. If they exceed the opponent's roll by at least four they must move blocks, otherwise they must move pawns.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to either surround the center square with your pieces or capture all opposing pieces. Capturing is generally done by occupying the large squares adjacent to opposing pieces with your own (there are seven different cases covered in the rules).<br/><br/>The game board is made of rolled-up vinyl, packaged with the pieces and rules in a large tube.<br/><br/>",

Players now get to play a card from their hand into the slot machine to change the outcome.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to hit payouts.

This means that when playing cards from your hand, you will organize your deck and increase your chances of hitting payouts.<br/><br/>Players will also have 4 personal objectives that can be completed in a specific order. These are for instance to hit a payout using cherries. The next objective could be to win with melons. The final objective is always to hit the Jackpot ?<br/><br/>When there is no more money in the bank.

        "description": "In this simple-to-learn children's game, players spin the spinner and move their trolleys around the board, attempting to visit each of the landmarks and neighbors in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe: Grandpere at the Eiffel Tower, King Friday and Queen Sara at the castle, Corny at the Rock-It Factory, X &amp; Henrietta Pussycat at the tree, Lady Elaine at the Museum-Go-Round, Dr. Bill and Elsie Jean at the platypus mound, and Daniel Tiger at the clock.<br/><br/>Along the way, Mister Rogers cards offer bonuses and penalties (often with a motivational thought to soften the blow of the penalties). Landing on a Trolley space offers an extra turn.<br/><br/>The game offers three methods of play:<br/>1. Players must circle the board and collect all seven of the Neighbor cards by landing at the colored landmarks for each one.<br/>2. Players start with all seven cards and must &quot;drop off&quot; each Neighbor at their landmarks.<br/>3. The &quot;Advanced&quot; game, in which players must collect all seven neighbor cards, and once all seven are collected, drop them off.<br/><br/>The game box suggests a minimum age of 6 years old, but the game is about on par with something like Candy Land. Ages 4 and 5 can learn and play it.<br/><br/>",

If they have stars in multiple locations on the card, they add a counter to each of those locations on their playmat, whether or not they have a counter there already from a previous turn, and regardless of whether or not there is a nought or a cross in that location on another card.<br/><br/>Once every player has a hand of seven cards, the game ends and the players add up their points.

When the temperature increases the savannah expands; when it drops it shrinks and the ice grows, while the other habitats move accordingly. In order to survive, species should either move to follow their habitats or adapt quickly to new ones, if they are not able to do so they will go extinct.

        "description": "Lords of Florence recreates the battle for political control of the Republic of Florence in the time of the Renaissance, a period famous for bankers, spectacular art, literature, betrayal and bloody conflict.Players control powerful families and individuals who together ruled the Republic during its 300 year history, as members of the Signoria (the ruling council of Florence), together they compete to gain enough political power (VPs) to overthrow the Republic and be named Duke.<br/><br/>Over 6 turns, players race to earn the most political power (VPs), if any player earns 50 political power, at the end of any turn before the end of turn 6, they automatically win.<br/><br/>In a turn, players spend their resources to complete shared projects, which in turn provide resources and VPs when completed. Projects are expensive, so players are encouraged to cooperate to complete them; yet the assymetric player powers mean some projects are more beneficial for some players than others. Therefore players must consider carefully whether to cooperate or not. In addition, each turn players may blind bid for intrigue cards, which provide opportunities to attack other players, disrupt projects they have completed, steal resources or even provide alternative victory conditions. However, players who focus too much on attacking others will not only fail to complete projects that would benefit them, but also risk triggering the shared loss condition. Failing to complete projects comes with a price - increasing the threat of the shared loss condition (known as instability), as the people of Florence become angry that their demands to complete projects are disregarded. If instability rises too far, the players all lose, forcing players to cooperatively complete at least some projects every turn to avoid defeat.<br/><br/>Player resources and intrigue cards are hidden behind player shields, allowing players to bluff, extort and hide their true strategies. The game rewards careful planning, timing and ruthlessness &ndash; all qualities critical to political success in the cutthroat World of Renaissance Italy<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quick Panzer is the Small War rules set for World War II.<br/><br/>Infantry weapons, artillery mortars, antitank guns and over 100 different models of armored vehicles are all covered.<br/><br/>The actual rules are 2 pages long but the rules come with several annexes for those who want a lot of detail.<br/><br/>The Two Page Rules series features rules that are 2 pages long with one combat card that has the information needed to play the game. The sequence of movement is decided by a dice roll and after that, the games follow the sequence of move-fire-move-fire. Casualties are decided simply and effectively. Morale is divided into 4 stages with the chance to rally at each stage. New players should be able to conduct their own transactions by the third move. These are combat rules that reflect the tactics and technologies of their era. Decisions are made by players, not cards or dice. These rules can be used for nearly any scale of the figure. They are great for large or small battles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Putting the &lsquo;reality&rsquo; back into your fantasy games<br/><br/>Welcome to Undying Lands a completely revised version of FLD. The constant evolution of the rules is thanks to the feedback I have received. Before I briefly cover the new features of the rules I would like to firstly focus on why these rules came about. The purpose and intent of this game is to provide players with a much more realistic fantasy game in contrast to the artificially  contrived contemporary games that pay little attention to deployment, command control, light troops, orders, linear tactics and ignore the problems of movement, drill  and  reserves,  they  have  unrealistic  armies  with  ultra  powerful beast that trance anything that moves, with 20 year old game mechanics repackaged every 5 years and sold at a phenomanal price that spotty teenagers are all to pleased to pay. Crap game, slick marketing. The list goes ever on.<br/><br/>We take the works of Tolkien and Moorcock to be actual historical accounts. In our careful reading we found that fantasy battle is an extension of the mechanics of historical battle. In Undying Lands you get all the tactical subtleties of historical wargaming plus an array of  fantastic beasts, sorcery, special attributes and their associated benefits and problems. Whether your intent is fair or foul, regardless of your Balrog  bodyguard, the &lsquo;ordinary&rsquo; rank and file is the tactically most  important  soldier  on  your  battlefield  and  that  his  physical constraints is on par with his historical counterpart.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s  new  in Undying Lands? Basing is much more integrated and flexible, The command control system has been streamlined and clarified, troop and weapon characteristics have been amalgamated into a single versatile and variable factor. The result is a streamlined, integrated and smooth game that plays faster.<br/><br/>First, we define the combat and manoeuvre characteristics of your troops, then deal with command, control and orders starting from the top  down.  Next we generate the battle  field,  then  the  sections  on the game turn, movement, combat, missile fire, results and victory conditions.  Finally,  there's  a  section on 'how to  win and common battlefield, tactical and organisational errors. HAVE FUN.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

There are stores with products and paths leading around them on the board placed at the center of the table. Each player starts the game with three coins.<br/><br/>The game has unique movement mechanic - player rolls a die with icons, move their figurine along any possible path, and stop at the first space with the same icon. They collect as many coins as they passed along the way. Then they can reveal and buy products adjacent to their position. If the die lands on a shopping cart, they can buy any of the opened products or roll again.<br/><br/>Because the products have different prices, the players have to balance getting and spending their coins.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has five products in their shopping cart. Scoring - if a product has the icon of the player&rsquo;s character or a star, it is worth two points, otherwise it is only worth one point.

        "description": "The Battle of France was the first great tank battle, and perhaps the first major battle, of World War II. Of course, it was not called that at the time. People called it &lsquo;Hitler&rsquo;s War&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Phony War&rsquo;. Perhaps it was Hitler&rsquo;s war, but it was far from phony. It was, in fact, the complete opposite and the Wehrmacht was out to prove it. France was to be the proving grounds that Germany&rsquo;s Panzer tank divisions were to become feared on.<br/><br/>No one suspected a strategic pincer attack from the Ardennes forest, but rather through the Maginot Line. Nearly everyone believed that the Maginot Line would be the ultimate wall of defense against Germany. Heinz Guderian was the exception. His ground breaking idea of mechanized warfare created World War II. Here is where he would show the world the strength of a concentrated attack force and how an entire nation could be brought to its knees by a swift, decisive strike.<br/><br/>In Battle of France 1940 you play the role of either Guiderian or Charles De Gaulle. You make the decisions; Will you attack Dunkerk and cut off the British? Can you defend Paris against the ever growing German armies? Will your men continue to fight despite massive casualties and declining morale? How will you deal with supply shortages?<br/><br/>Combat cards simulate fog of war and new challenges to face your troops every round. Unique rules mimic the Blitzkrieg system of warfare and special combat features include divisional singularity, tank superiority, air support and retreat rules. Also featuring special territories showcasing the historic elements of the Ardennes Forest and the Maginot Line.<br/><br/>Battle of France 1940 is filled with factors beyond your control. However, the heart of the game is in how you position your forces so that the industry, morale and equipment of your opponent is destroyed, captured or commandeered.<br/><br/>Can you shape the fate of the world in a few short hours?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The floating tribes of Typatia have lived under the tyrannical rule of The Empress for far too long. She has starved the people, abused the dinosaurs, and grown fat off the riches of the land.<br/><br/>As a Chief of Typatia, it is your duty to throw off the yoke of oppression and claim your tribe's rightful place as the leaders of Typatia.<br/><br/>Will you do this through economic prowess, scientific advancement, political negotiation, or pure military might? The choice is yours as you spread your influence across the floating lands.<br/><br/>Defiant is a 4X bag-building game set in a land of floating islands and battling dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Each turn you will use the cubes you drew (at the end of the previous turn) to activate actions. Each action requires 2 cubes and will increase in power if you are willing to spend your rare bronze, silver, or even gold cube to complete the action. Be sure to plan ahead or your previously placed cubes could end up wasted.<br/><br/>Air battles occur when 2 sets of flyers encounter each other. Transported raptors &amp; rexes add nothing to these battles. Only the number &amp; strength of each army's flyers matter. If the attacking flyers win, they may then drop their land units onto the island below.<br/><br/>These dropped units will then instigate a land battle if defenders are present. These battles are more tricky, with secret modifier cards influencing each side's strength.<br/><br/>A player may be strong in the air, but weak on land, unable to take over defended islands. Or a player may be strong on land, but weak in the air, unable to transport their raptors and rexes to new islands.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has completed enough objectives. These include:<br/>&bull;Completing 1 of the 4 upgrade tracks.<br/>&bull;Winning an air battle.<br/>&bull;Winning a land battle.<br/>&bull;Defeating the Empress.<br/>&bull;Completing the special objective which is drawn at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Players then count up the points from their objectives, controlled hexes, and gold/silver/bronze cubes.<br/><br/>Defiant comes from our love of bag-building and 4X games. We aimed to build a 4X game that could be played quicker than a normal 4X game, yet still have the same scope and feel. The bag building element helps in this endeavor, as players can be planning their turns from 1 turn to the next (since they've already drawn the next turn's cubes).<br/><br/>Note: Hardcore 4X gamers can choose to play to a higher objective thresh-hold for an even more sprawling and vast game of Defiant.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

A team of ghost hunters, armed with only Lord Latimer's Journal, must collect 6 gems which can be combined to create a 'weapon' to defeat Palmershu, the Demon God, who has claimed the manor as his own. You'll have to exorcise the ghosts, while avoiding holes in the ground and searching the manor for items and gems, but beware, Palmershu may appear at the end of any round, and he's not pleased that you're trying to exorcise him.<br/><br/>The game is set up by shuffling the room cards, placing them upside down on the board so each room can't be seen and placing all the players at the front door and all the ghosts and the Palmershu marker are placed in the cloth bag.<br/>During Part 1 A player has 8 action points each turn, which can be used for moving, exorcising ghosts, using items, giving an item to an ally, or opening chests or doors. Once a player opens either a chest or a door, they've alerted the ghosts to their presence and their turn immediately ends and they turn over a card from the ghost deck.<br/>During the end of turn players must add more ghosts onto the board using a pair of D20 dice pulling ghosts (or Palmershu) randomly from the bag.<br/>The aim of Part 1 is to search the house for 6 gems, spread across the house in the different rooms.<br/><br/>In Part 2 the board is flipped and Palmershu starts his final attack as the team attempt to destroy him. <br/>All the items you've collected in part 1 are carried over and can be played any round before anyone rolls to attack. The number of gems you collected will decreases the number of cards revealed for where Palmershu will appear.<br/><br/>Part 2 is split into 5 sections:<br/>Palmershu's Arrival<br/>From the Palmershu Deck reveal the correct number of card (the more gems you found in Part 1, the less places he may attack from)<br/>Character Actions<br/>The Characters can then use items and move up to 3 spaces in any order.<br/>Palmershu Appears<br/>The top card of Palmershu's attack deck is revealed which reveals which card and which power is used.<br/>Characters Attack<br/>The Characters who are in range of Palmershu or ghosts then attack them.<br/>Palmershu Attacks<br/>Finally the ghosts and Palmershu will attack the Characters.<br/><br/>To win the game the team must defeat Palmershu. However if all the ghosts are removed from the bag then the team must flee the house and the game is lost, or if any player loses all their hearts then the game is lost.<br/>There are 4 levels of difficulty, which vary the number of ghosts on the board to begin and the number that appear each turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They were also used as patrol boats in rivers, harbors and coastal zones and to escort supply barges. In this role they encountered PT boats.<br/><br/>The &lsquo;57 mm&rsquo; guns were actually the Japanese Type 97 47 mm anti-tank gun or a British 6 pdr.

But you're not alone in this dark and forgotten place; a rival of equal evil awaits...<br/><br/>Necromancy: the Exhumation is a micro-card-game reminiscent of Magic: the Gathering but simpler in scale and scope.<br/><br/>The game is played by 2-players using a shared 20-card draw deck. Each card serves one of two purposes: as a creature or as a spell. On each turn players draw a card and take up to two separate actions: drawing or playing cards as creatures or spells. Each card has different attributes and effects and these are used to &quot;attack&quot; the other player and reduce their health points to zero.<br/><br/>",
