The expansions can all be combined. Each of them is identified with a specific icon, making it easy to create the combinations you want to play, when you want to play them.<br/>Carcassonne Big Box, a universe to discover!<br/><br/>Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>Also contains Carcassonne: Expansion 2 – Traders & Builders, Carcassonne: The Flying Machines, Carcassonne: The Messengers, Carcassonne: The Ferries, Carcassonne: The Gold Mines, Carcassonne: Mage &amp; Witch, and Carcassonne: The Robbers; these six each include one of the six tiles for the Carcassonne: The Corn Circles II/Crop Circles II mini expansion.<br/><br/>Note: The goods tokens in Big Box 4 are larger than those in the stand-alone Traders and Builders expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates is the fourth major expansion for The Settlers of Catan (following Seafarers, Cities &amp; Knights and Traders &amp; Barbarians) and it includes five scenarios and three missions; some of the scenarios make use of the missions while others do not.<br/><br/>Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates differs from the Catan base game in three main ways. First, instead of having only a single island in the game on which players build and compete for resources, three islands are present &ndash; but the landscape of only one of these islands is known at the start of the game. Players start on this island, then build ships and bring settlers into play so that they can then travel to new lands. When a ship ends its movement on unexplored territory, that hex is revealed and a randomly-drawn number chip placed on it, with the player earning one resource as a reward &ndash; assuming the hex produces resources, that is. (The number of unknown tiles varies from 16 to 32, depending on the scenario.) A settler and ship can be transformed into a port settlement, from which roads and new ships can be built to enable further exploration.<br/><br/>Second, instead of using cities, Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates allows players to build port settlements for two corn and two ore, with a port settlement supplying one resource when the adjacent number is rolled at the start of a turn. Like cities, port settlements are worth two victory points (VPs), and the number of VPs required to win depends on the scenario.<br/><br/>Third, if a player receives no resources during the production roll (other than on a roll of 7), she receives one gold in compensation. Two gold can be traded with the bank for a resource of the player's choice. Gold has other uses as well, such as helping you escape from pirates.<br/><br/>The five scenarios included in Catan: Explorers &amp; Pirates are:<br/><br/>&bull; Land Ho! Explore the seas of Catan and discover two new islands to expand your settlements. Once you've discovered an island, you must use ships to ferry settlers from one island to another and colonize distant lands. (Introductory scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Pirate Lairs! In this scenario, pirates prowl the seas along with your trading vessels. Pay tribute to the pirates or drive them off, then find and capture their lairs to earn gold and VPs! (One mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Fish for Catan! The people of Catan are short of food, so it's time to take to the ocean to fish for meals. These are deep water fish, though, so first you must find their shoals before you can catch them! The Council of Catan will reward players with VPs for returning fish to the island, as well as for capturing pirate lairs. Just watch out for roaming pirates, as not only will they demand gold for tribute, they might also get to the fish before you do! (Two mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Spices for Catan! In this scenario, the Council of Catan wants you to find fish and spices for the people of Catan! As before, they reward the most industrious merchant captains with VPs. Obtaining spice will require you to become friends with the mysterious inhabitants of the Spice Islands, but in return they will not only trade you spices but teach you their knowledge of sailing or even pirate fighting techniques! (Two mission scenario)<br/><br/>&bull; Explorers and Pirates! This lengthy and challenging scenario brings everything from the previous scenarios together! Explore new lands, capture pirate lairs, find fish, and befriend the inhabitants of the spice isles! (Three mission scenario)<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll find yourself behind locked doors, wracked by Doubt, and surrounded by Lunatics. And, still, you'll catch hints of deeper and darker secrets.<br/><br/>And while its scenario continues and deepens the game's exploration of the mystical realms between the traditional roleplaying and card game experiences, its twenty-four player cards (two copies each of twelve different cards) provide you access to a number of wealthy Patrons and allow you to &quot;learn&quot; from your mistakes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player&rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.<br/><br/>By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.<br/><br/>Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards, special actions, and terrain sectors to build the map!<br/><br/>Kingdom Builder: Big Box includes the first two expansions Kingdom Builder: Nomads, Kingdom Builder: Crossroads as well as two out of three Queenies (Kingdom Builder: Capitol and Kingdom Builder: Caves).<br/><br/>",

Immediate and strong climate changes brought unexpected consequences. <br/>The citizens of Aquatica were surprised to learn that the polar seas were also full of life - unusual and unfamiliar. They had no idea that several Northern nations had also discovered the wealth and prosperity of Aquatica. And they are ready to fight for resources.<br/>The Royal City is reduced in ashes after the volcanic eruptions, and panic is everywhere. Unfortunately the four brave Sea-Kings who started the fight for the Crown of Aquatica didn&rsquo;t pay attention to reports about weird creatures in the outskirts of the Empire... And so The Polar Invasion begins!<br/>The Aquatica: Cold Waters expansion adds several modules including a new location type, new Ocean&rsquo;s creatures cards, and an alternative mechanic that replaces the goal track in the base game.

On industrialized planets, the inhabitants may be forced to work in brutal conditions, slaves to the construction of the Imperial war machine. Other worlds may be torn by war as legions of Stormtroopers and massive assault walkers squelch any dissension against the Empire&rsquo;s rule.<br/><br/>On other planets, however, the war is fought in secret, in the shadows of dark alleys, disused conference rooms, and secret meetings. Information is exchanged between faceless Rebel spies, even as the terrifying Imperial Security Bureau searches for their undercover foes. Now, The Bespin Gambit brings this shadow war to your games of Imperial Assault.<br/><br/>In The Bespin Gambit, you&rsquo;ll find a wealth of new content to take your campaigns and skirmishes into the ritzy hotels and industrial underworks of Cloud City. Iconic characters like Bossk and Lando Calrissian join the game for the first time, gorgeous new map tiles portray some of the most memorable Cloud City locations, while new companions and a new condition change the flow every game. With two new Rebel heroes, one new Imperial class, new items, a new mini-campaign, and a new focus on your Spy characters, The Bespin Gambit offers an indispensable bonus to every Imperial Assault player.<br/><br/>",

Instead, it was the slow realization that as devotion to one god waxed, power to the others waned.<br/><br/>Some thought themselves above the fray, thought themselves wiser, learned, or immune to the whim of mortal man. They were wrong. The gods do not exist without followers, and devotion is their lifeblood, whether they wish it so or not. The tide of cosmic balance had shifted towards mankind, and the gods who once enjoyed their unquestioning deference now have to contend for prominence.<br/><br/>Thus it was that the last holdouts who sought to distance themselves from the fray took to the battlefield in their own bids for dominance. What had begun as jostling in a minor power struggle had drawn in all the mightiest deities across the Egyptian pantheon.<br/><br/>In the end, there could be only one.<br/><br/>The Pantheon expansion introduces a whole new set of five Egyptian gods, each bringing their own abilities and warriors to the fight against oblivion. The introduction of each new god into the game not only gives new options to the player who controls them, but also changes the landscape for everyone on the table. New strategies and dynamics arise as different mixes of gods are pitted against each other, and the Pantheon expansion increases these combinations exponentially!<br/><br/>The Pantheon expansion comes with:<br/><br/>5 God figures and 30 Warrior figures:<br/>       -  1 Horus God figure and 6 Horus Warrior figures<br/>       -  1 Hathor God figure and 6 Hathor Warrior figures<br/>       -  1 Set God figure and 6 Set Warrior figures<br/>       -  1 Thoth God figure and 6 Thoth Warrior figures<br/>       -  1 Bastet God figure and 6 Bastet Warrior figures<br/>5 God dashboards<br/>5 Joined God dashboards<br/>30 Battle cards (6 for each God)<br/>20 Color bases (4 for each God)<br/>80 Ankh tokens (16 for each God)<br/><br/>Additionally, acquired in the Kickstarter campaign, you also get 5 Kickstarter Exclusive bonus plastic components: 3 sculpted Bastet Cat tokens and 2 engraved Eye of Horus tokens.<br/><br/>",

If the tower is 1 piece high, they can capture Meeples that are within 1 tile of the tower; if the tower is 2 pieces high, they can capture Meeples within 2 tiles of the tower; etc.  Not only do players lose whatever they may have scored with that Meeple, but they also have to pay 3 victory points if they want to free their Meeple.<br/><br/>Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imperial Rome and The Barbarians is the second expansion to Commands & Colors: Ancients. In this second expansion you will find historical battles that focus on Rome and the early Gallic invasion, invasion of the Northmen, the Servile War (Spartacus), Caesar's conquest of Gaul, the Roman Civil Wars and much more.<br/><br/>Showcased in the second expansion, are over 20 scenarios that range from 390 BC (Allia River) to 9 AD (Teutoburger Wald), and all the blocks and labels you need to field the Roman and Barbarian forces to fight out these battles. By now, you know we can do this, because Commands & Colors: Ancients by design is a unique historical game system that allows players to effectively portray stylized Ancient battles that play to a conclusion in less than an hour.<br/><br/>Imperial Rome and The Barbarians will feature at least one new unit type as well as several &quot;specialty&quot; units and leaders (Briton Chariots, Legionaries using the pilum, and Caesar, for example). Each of these operates within the confines of the original system rules, with only slight modifications to reflect their historical abilities and importance. So, rules-wise, if you've played Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble at all learning the few special rules for these new types of units.<br/><br/>The battle dice resolve combat quickly and the Command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory. Yet the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Ancient units, their weapons, terrain and the history.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients<br/><br/><br/>",

Trace Amount is a perfect Data Pack for fans of bluffing as its many events and operations open new surprises and synergies, and prove in more than one way that a card in the hand is worth two or more actions on the table.

An additional game board, more and different ship cards, laws, buildings, new character cards to be used with the other characters, and a whole new phenomenon: Cuba - the Arrival of the President!<br/>In their turn, players may take and play a character from the 'El Presidente' board: the worker, dancer, attorney, warden, revolutionary or musician. They all have different effects.<br/>The worker puts your goods into the warehouse; all your goods are safe this turn. The revolutionary gives you one victory point, the musician two money. The player with the dancer card becomes immediately the new start player; the old rule for determining the new start player is no longer in effect.   <br/>                                                  <br/>With the attorney a player may use a building even when his supervisor is not on the row or column of this building, paying one money. The warden may change two adjacent ships in position. There are two mule cards being used when playing with less than five players; these cards cannot be chosen. When all players have chosen a card, the car of the president moves to the position of the remaining card; remember, there are six cards that each turn are shuffled and randomly placed.  <br/>                                                 <br/>Under each card on the board are symbols that come into effect when the car of the president stops there. The first makes all law proposals go into effect; the second makes it possible to move the supervisor anywhere on a player board in the next round. The next symbol also is in effect for the next round: it allows you to pay one money and overbuild a building with another; the difference in resources must be paid as well. One symbol makes the leading player to go back two points on the score track; another allows players to purchase market wares at discount prices. Players must now not only consider which role they would like to take, but also which position they likely want to be visited by the president.  <br/>                                                  <br/>There are 2 additional laws in each of the four categories, so that the game can now last up to 8 rounds instead of just 6. <br/><br/><br/>",

Purchasing bonds can provide a steady stream of interest payments every round. However, it comes at a price. The original money used to purchase bonds cannot be recovered until the end of the game. Be careful not to overspend or you might lose out on valuable stockpiles.<br/><br/>Module 3: Commodities &amp; Taxes &mdash; Commodities &amp; Taxes create much more tension during the game. Each round, players add Commodity or Tax Cards face-up to the stockpiles. Collect different types of commodities and dodge taxes to earn substantial end-game bonuses.<br/><br/>Module 4: More Investors &mdash; Stockpile: Continuing Corruption adds six new investors from around the world who have heard about massive profits being made, and they want in on the action.

They hurry to investigate, only to find a great eagle, suffering from wounds that appear to have come from goblin weapons. They only have short time to get the eagle assistance before it perishes.<br/><br/>A Journey To Rhosgobel is the third Adventure Pack in the Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game! After facing a fearsome group of trolls, the heroes have pressed further into the Anduin Valley to continue their search for Gollum. However, when they stumble across a dying eagle wounded in a fight with goblins, they are compelled to offer their assistance.<br/><br/>During their search for Gollum, the heroes must take a detour in order to save a valuable ally. Since the Eagles play such an important role in the Shadows of Mirkwood Adventure Packs, players will want to retain the trust of their winged allies by saving one of their kin. In order to do so, they must bring the bird to Rhosgobel and seek out the wizard Radagast, who knows many secrets of the wild.<br/><br/>A Journey to Rhosgobel contains 60 fixed cards from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. In this exciting expansion, even more Eagles join the Tactics sphere, while Leadership players are given a D&uacute;nedain Quest that will inspire confidence in their cause. The heroes&rsquo; trek through Mirkwood leads them to Haldir of L&oacute;rien, whose unnatural agility will aid the party in their task. However, the sky grows dark with foul minions of the Shadow, and every step toward Rhosgobel causes the heroes&rsquo; avian ally more pain. There is no time to lose!<br/><br/>",

Then, at the end of the game, each player receives different rewards depending on whether they won or lost and according to their own choices during the game (depending on the scenario).<br/><br/>Thus, each one builds their Heritage over the 5 scenarios. The winner of the campaign is the one who wins the last scenario.<br/><br/>The campaign offers 6 scenarios in all because there is a branch, depending on the choice of players in scenario 4.<br/><br/>During the campaign and after the campaign, the players will unlock cards which can come to enrich the basic game definitively. The Heritage campaigns therefore offer players to live a story and gradually unlock a mini-extension to the base game offering a new mechanic, a bit like a Legacy, but totally replayable because there is no alteration of equipment.<br/><br/>The campaign is also playable solo.<br/><br/>Included in the Kickstarter Heritage edition of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Vanuatu, you are a Vanuatuan who wants to prosper during the eight turns of the game. In order to prosper, you have to manage with natural resources, rare items, vatus (local currency) and tourists. To earn money or prosperity points, you may also draw on the sand*, carry tourists all over Vanuatu islands, or trade cargo with foreign countries.<br/><br/>On each turn, the archipelago expands and you have to program your actions with five tokens. You put one or more of them on the chosen action spaces, and on your turn, you will only be able to play an action if you have the majority on its space. Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action. A good strategy lets you block other players; for example, they won't be able to sell fishes if they haven't caught them first &ndash; order matters! Islands and sea resources are rare, so be quick and take them first!<br/><br/>There is no such thing as a rich Vanuatuan. When you reach ten Vatus, they automatically transform into 5 prosperity points and again, you are poor. Life is hard, but you may encounter ten men to help you; on each turn you choose one of them to increase your benefits from an action. As always, being the first player lets you choose before the others.<br/><br/>In short, Vanuatu is a strategy game of programming and majorities that features development, blocking, and a lot of interaction between players.<br/><br/>This Quined Master Print edition brings you the wonderful original game, as well as the Rising Waters expansion and the extra character of the Governor, with completely new artwork by Konstantin Vohwinkel. The Rising Waters expansion adds a whole new level of tension to the game: Global warming threatens Vanuatu. Many islands are in danger of disappearing under the sea due to rising waters. Players will therefore have to unite to protect the islands by building dikes. However, the interests of one are not necessarily the interests of others.<br/><br/>(*) Sand Drawing in Vanuatu belongs to the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity of the UNESCO.<br/><br/>",

Though these campaigns took you to every corner of the Star Wars galaxy, there was still a common thread. In every campaign, up to four players took on the roles of Rebel heroes, battling a single Imperial player who commanded the forces of the Empire arrayed against you.<br/><br/>Now, with the Legends of the Alliance companion app, you have the chance to unite with all of your friends in a cooperative campaign. The Legends of the Alliance app takes over all of the functions once performed by the Imperial player, freeing you to experience entirely new campaigns in a fully cooperative environment with your friends as you fight side by side against the Galactic Empire!<br/><br/>",

Now your species can swoop on unsuspecting prey from above, fly away from predators, or soar to a new location when food is scarce. Will the ability to fly propel you to new heights?  Or will it bring your downfall? Explore the expanding Evolution world and find out!<br/><br/>With this expansion, you may now choose between creating a normal species and creating a flying species. Flying species have special costs and advantages:<br/><br/>Costs<br/><br/>1. You must discard 2 cards instead of 1 to create a flying species.<br/>2. Flying species have a maximum body size of 3 instead of 6.<br/>3. Flying species have an upkeep cost of food equal to their Body Size. The upkeep cost simulates the amount of food needed to maintain wings.<br/><br/>Advantages<br/><br/>1. Some of the new expansion traits, like Dive-Bomb and Brood Parasite, only work for flying creatures.<br/>2. A species with Flight may take food from the Cliff, giving it an extra source of food. <br/>3. A species with Flight cannot be attacked unless the attacking Carnivore also has the Flight trait. <br/>4. If a species with Flight also has the Carnivore trait, you may discard from your hand to negate Symbiosis, Warning Call, or Climbing for when it attacks.<br/><br/>The expansion changes tactics and strategy dramatically, but it doesn't change the base game's core mechanics, so it's a snap to learn.<br/><br/>",

Players want to fill their tombs with food, canopic jars, statues, amulets and other treasures, and to do so they acquire cards that are laid out in the shape of a pyramid; purchase cards at the base of the pyramid, and it &quot;crumbles&quot; to bring cards higher in the pyramid to the base where they can be bought. The pyramid resets each round with new offerings.<br/><br/>You score only for cards that you remove from your deck and stash in your tomb, so if you keep using valuable cards for their effects and don't entomb them before the game ends, you could lose out on big points! Whoever collects the most valuable artifacts in their tomb wins.<br/><br/>Valley of the Kings: Premium Edition includes all the cards from the three previously released games (Valley of the Kings, Valley of the Kings: Afterlife, Valley of the Kings: Last Rites), plus the components needed to play with a fifth and sixth player. It also includes rules for solo play, dividers for all the cards, and new pharaoh cards that give their holder unique abilities. The components are upgraded to 300+ tarot-sized cards.<br/><br/>",

She also favors the Water school, using it to heal, restore, and grow her plants, as well as fight her enemies with geyser like blasts of water or downpours of acid rain. She does not use traditional spawnpoints; instead, her plants can spontaneously grow quickly across the arena. She has a theme of slow, steady growth, that accelerates her power quickly. She is the perfect Mage to use against a turtler because you cannot leave her alone to grow unchecked for too long.<br/><br/>The Necromancer is a dark, sinister Mage who dabbles in the darkest of the black arts. His primary strengths lie in the summoning of the undead. His Graveyard spawnpoint summons armies of skeletons, zombies, and ghouls to do his bidding. His theme is a relentless assault. His skeletons are fragile, but keep reassembling themselves from a pile of bones to attack again! Zombies are slow, but very difficult to &quot;kill&quot;. Both of these creatures just keep coming! Additionally, the Necromancer summons and controls evil spirits: ghosts and wraiths. He has an affinity with death and disease, and can quickly spread plagues across the arena.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>This big box includes the basic game, Inns &amp; Cathedrals, Traders &amp; Builders, Princess &amp; Dragon and The Tower. The English version also has The River.<br/><br/>",

Most of them perished in the ice, a few got rich, and some awoke terrible, ancient evils. Now, down in usually temperate Arkham, the winds are blowing harder and colder than ever before. The Miskatonic has frozen over. Some people complain of insatiable hunger and sometimes the newspapers even report cannibalism. You know all too well that the Ancient Ones are causing the weather and hunger, but this time you cannot fight them from within the Arkham Museum, or even out on Arkham&rsquo;s streets. You must brave the brutal conditions that killed thousands of prospectors, and fight ferocious creatures from this world and others, or else the cold, hunger, and ice will devastate humanity.<br/><br/>Omens of Ice takes you and your fellow investigators on a treacherous journey into the Alaskan wildernesses, where you must solve the mysteries of three terrible new Ancient Ones. Whether you choose to travel in summer or are forced to go in winter&rsquo;s dark, at every step you&rsquo;ll face terrible perils, from the port of Anchorage to the forest paths and mountain passes of the interior. You must constantly fight not only wild animals and ravenous monsters, but frostbite, starvation, and the madness that befalls many who enter this frozen, isolated, white world.<br/><br/>",

But the streets, the language, and the eerie, dark tunnels aren't the only foreign elements at play. There's something distinctly otherworldly in the Parisian catacombs&hellip;<br/><br/>In The Pallid Mask scenario, you and your fellow investigators will enter these tunnels in search of a stranger whom you believe must be connected to the events surrounding the performance of The King in Yellow at the Ward Theatre in Arkham. But with each new strange twist and turn, you'll find yourselves only stepping deeper into mystery. Perhaps you can follow the tunnels all the way to the pulsing heart of the play's mysteries, but there's a chance, too, you'll simply find yourselves lost amid the shifting landscape. What begins as a trek through moist and clammy tunnels of stone may become a journey that leads you under the earth, through The Gate to Hell, and straight to your demise at the Well of Souls or some other forgotten chamber.<br/><br/>Destined to be a fan-favorite, the scenario from The Pallid Mask utilizes the game's locations in a novel way, bringing them into play only as you travel through them, and arranging them in a constantly shifting and unpredictable fashion. Each new step through these labyrinths could be your last.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Under the wise guidance of Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Heir, the city has once again become a bustling, flourishing center of magic and illusion, with a new generation of aspiring young Magicians on the rise.<br/><br/>But now, without the power of the Trickerion Stone, the Great Dahlgaard is dying. In his last will, he entrusted his Heir with a grandiose task: he donated his old manor to be restored as the Academy of Magoria, a center of the education and perfection of magic tricks and illusion.<br/><br/>The Heir issues a public call for contributors among Magoria&rsquo;s aspiring Magicians: the Academy shall be restored as a common effort, but the most successful contributor&rsquo;s name will be remembered forever as the Patron of Magoria.<br/><br/>Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Academy expands the magical world and gameplay of Trickerion with a slew of exciting new features:<br/><br/>A new Location - the Academy: Join the common effort to renovate the Academy! Each Renovation action awards Fame proportionately to the Coins spent on it, and opens up new Classrooms and Practice Rooms, where Academy markers can be placed. Academy markers in Practice Rooms give the performed Tricks increased Yield or other special placement abilities, while the Tricks taught in the Classrooms will be passed on to the new generations - they can no longer be performed, but grant a useful passive yield each turn. The Academy is also a place to train your Proteg&eacute;, a new member of your team.<br/><br/>A new Specialist - the Proteg&eacute;: Each Magician will now start with the Proteg&eacute;, a new type of specialist. The Proteg&eacute; is more than just a worker - they will accompany your Magician on their path to greatness, constantly developing in the process. By Visiting the Academy, Proteg&eacute;s can acquire powerful new abilities that also increase their Action Points - and their salary as well! A fully developed Proteg&eacute; will have 3 Actions points, just like the Magician, with some very powerful abilities to boot!<br/><br/>A new quartet of Magicians: Magoria&rsquo;s new Golden Age attracts aspiring young Magicians from all over the world, eager to prove themselves, and maybe one day become the Patron of Magoria. Each school of illusion (Mechanical, Optical, Escape, Spiritual) will receive a new, charismatic Magician, with their own personal backstory, powerful special ability.<br/><br/>Solo Mode: Dalhgaard's Heir: This expansion will also feature a solo mode, with an elaborate story setting. Take a journey to a possible future of Magoria, where Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Heir couldn&rsquo;t resist the immense power of the Trickerion Stone, and dabbing into the supernatural has eclipsed their sanity. Magoria&rsquo;s Golden Age is over - now the Heir controls it with an iron grip, and it falls to you to prove your superiority and remove him from power the only way the city knows - through magic and illusion. This solo mode features Dahlgaard&rsquo;s Heir as a fully automated, intricate opponent with variable difficulty levels - a worthy foe to even the most seasoned Trickerion veterans!<br/><br/>",

Atop the tallest peaks, the magical waters are at their most pure and potent, and the banks are littered with precious gems. But one must beware, for within the Highland dwells the feared Eagle King, guardian of the source of magic. Intruders and fortune-seekers will receive no mercy, for he has not forgotten that jewels stolen from him now adorn the Crown of Command itself!<br/><br/>Talisman: The Highland adds a new Region to the game for heroes to explore. A custom-fitted map board and over 100 new cards bring this mountainous realm vividly to life, while six brand-new characters, each represented with a superbly detailed plastic miniature, offer fantastic new playing experiences. Climb as high as you dare, and lay claim to the unimaginable wealth that awaits atop the tallest peak in the world of Talisman!<br/><br/>",

To provide a good proportion of new Xeno worlds, keyword, and powers, XI is not compatible with the other expansion story arcs.<br/><br/>Xeno Invasion is aimed at intermediate RFTG players, altering Explore to be mix-with-hand. It adds 51 game cards to the base set and includes a bonus Invasion Game, with Produce: Repair and invasion cards, a repulse track, bunkers, and various counters.<br/><br/>The Invasion game adds two new ways the game can end: by either repulsing or falling to the Xenos. In Produce, players can repair damaged worlds and donate goods to the war effort (earning VPs). Players can also earn VP awards by defeating their share of the Xeno attackers and having the highest military vs Xenos, while they lose the use of damaged worlds that they fail to defend (until they are repaired). The Xeno attacks take place at the end of each round, starting with round 3, and typically take less than 30 seconds to resolve so that players can immediately return to selecting their actions for the next round.<br/><br/>",

For your second purchase, you can buy a tile from the dolmen board. These &quot;druid&quot; tiles are normal landscape tiles, except that they will often bear a stone tablet or a scroll. Stone tablets grant special powers that you can use until the end of the game, while scrolls are subject to the usual rules of the base game.<br/><br/>New scoring tiles offer further variability.<br/><br/>",

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etc. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>This new Big Box contains the base game, plus the most popular of the expansions: Inns &amp; Cathedrals, Traders and Builders, Princess &amp; Dragon, Abbey &amp; Mayor, and Bridges, Castles, &amp; Bazaars.<br/><br/>",

The set also includes cards that can be used by any player, but when matched with the player's designated faction leader, the card receives an additional effect!<br/><br/>In addition, this set includes three new ways to play the game. A three player mode known as &quot;Bloodbath&quot;: any damage dealt goes to both opponents rather than just one. In 2v2 Team Attack mode, players pair up to take on an opponent's team.

At the start of the activation step of the Zombies' Phase, set the Abominotaur's target Zone before moving it, ignoring closed doors and walls (but not Vault doors and ramparts). If an Abominotaur has to go through a closed door or wall, first put a &ldquo;broken wall&rdquo; token to link its starting and destination Zones, and remove any closed door token that might be in the way. The broken wall is considered as an open door, and thus can generate a Zombie spawn in a previously closed building. Actors can now cross the Zones. After that, proceed with moving all the other Zombies (as the Zombies&rsquo; route can be redefined by the wall&rsquo;s destruction).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Abominatroll. Is big, very big, but also incredibly stupid. It will roam around aimlessly until it spots a Survivor. But when it does see you, it will go mental and rush to tear you apart! The Abominatroll normally has only 1 Action per activation. However, if it activates with Line of Sight to any Survivors, it will then get 3 Actions for that activation! Hide away from this freak, and you may evade it. Get caught in the open and you will be well and truly trolled!<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Ablobination. Is massive and very tough to kill, but what really sets it apart is its freakishly huge and powerful arm, and the surprising ferocity with which it flails it about, creating a swath of destruction around it! Whenever the Ablobination activates with Line Of Sight to any Survivors at Range 0-1. It will perform an Attack against ALL Zones at Range 0-1 to which it has Line of Sight. That means its own Zone, and any open Zones connected to it! Obstacles preventing Movement between Zones (such as tower ramparts) do manage to block the Ablobination's attack.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "No one really knows where John came from. He just showed up one day in the Everglades on his houseboat. The gators didn't seem to pay him much attention. Once in awhile, one would crawl up on his boat, and John would come out and talk to it in hushed tones until it wandered off.<br/><br/>Folks found John strange, but it was clear he wasn't trouble. Just a kindly old coot who kept to himself. All sorts of stories were made up about the strange, swamp-dweller, but none came close to the truth. John Rhodes was, in fact, the world&rsquo;s most talented alchemist, and wielder of the Philosopher&rsquo;s Stone.<br/><br/>John had always had an affinity for altering the very threads of existence. He could feel them as they stretched around him, connecting everything to everything else. So, when those lines drew him to a mysterious, glowing stone, he knew it was right and proper to take it with him. The stone allows him to twist the lines, rather than just perceive them, and he can now easily transmute objects into other materials.<br/><br/>John, The Scholar, mostly keeps to himself, though he&rsquo;s always willing to share a bit of wisdom and a bite to eat with anyone who passes by. However, now and again, he feels the ley-lines pull and twang sharply, which shouldn't happen. He&rsquo;ll travel from one place to another, easing the tension on the lines by stopping the odd, extra-planar entity from entering this dimension, or keeping the crazed scientist from pulling the moon into the earth, or halting the nightmarish legions of a comatose little girl. Sometimes, he&rsquo;ll work with other gentle souls to accomplish his goal - he doesn't mind a little company now and then.<br/><br/>Mainly he just wants to keep things copacetic.<br/><br/>",

Antique trinkets and artifacts lie within its ever-changing walls, but the ravens that watch the manor are insufficient to discourage treasure hunters and bandits. A new guardian has awoken, and dark forces gather to his aid. Left unchecked, the power and size of this creature will never stop expanding. Its potential is limitless, and it must be stopped.<br/><br/>Manor of Ravens, an expansion for Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition), invites you to travel to a haunted manor house and battle the guardian that waits within. The overlord gains a host of new material in this expansion, including two new classes of Overlord cards, new monsters, and deadly new relics that can be wielded by monsters. The overlord even gains his first servant: a creature that can be summoned into play, similar to the heroes' familiar. The heroes also receive powerful new assets in Manor of Ravens, gaining access to two new heroes as well as new hero classes for Warriors and Scouts.<br/><br/>A new lieutenant also enters the scene as the heroes attempt to investigate the manor house. Skarn is a magical construct, composed of pieces of the manor house and possessed of limitless potential. If Skarn is not stopped, he could continue to grow and eventually overwhelm the world. Only your heroes stand between this magical creature and the demise of Terrinoth.<br/><br/>",

But this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me.&quot;  &ndash;Frodo Baggins, The Fellowship of the Ring<br/><br/>Step into the beloved fantasy world of J.R.R. Tolkien, journey out of Bag End, and avoid the fearsome Nazg&ucirc;l as you accompany Frodo on a desperate journey while the fate of all Middle-earth hangs in the balance! The Black Riders Saga Expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game introduces three new scenarios that allow you and your friends to directly relive Frodo's travels and challenges from the early chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring. Meanwhile, five hero cards and thirty-three player cards (three copies each of eleven individual cards) offer players a wealth of deck-building options for strategies built around Hobbits. New Boon and Burden cards ensure your actions have consequences, while a new Easy Mode allows you to tailor the game to your individual play style and skill level.<br/><br/>",

Using the ramps lets you pass other cars and move more efficiently, so managing your hand of speed cards to take advantage of them is crucial.<br/><br/>&bull; Savanna Stretch features wild animals that traverse the track, blocking the way. They move ahead after a car passes them, making the track more difficult to navigate for the lead car, and opening up for the trailing cars, so it can pay to hang back a bit before making your move.<br/><br/>These new tracks add a little more strategy to the game, offering Downforce veterans a whole new play experience.<br/><br/>",

It has enough cards to play with 5 players.<br/><br/>The artwork on the cards is entirely 100% drawn by the original Agricola/Le Havre artist.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Every spaceship has a voice; a melody of machinery and subsystems its crew learns intimately during long travels. The problem is, ever since the last mission our ship sounds WRONG. There&rsquo;s something foul in the way it&rsquo;s speaking to us. Barely audible murmurs. Strange whispers no machine could make. The dark corridors and vast halls almost seem to SING.<br/><br/>Some of us have tried to locate sources of this interferences, but they always seemed two steps ahead. Stalked by their never-ending presence, we soon started cracking. Our engineer has cut some words on his flesh. When we asked why, he replied:&lsquo;Incandescent secrets need to be written in blood&rsquo;. Then, our navigator took a spacewalk without her suit. When we pulled her in, her entire face frozen and cracked, she grinned in a way I will never forget.<br/><br/>Now, it got even worse. Noises turned into voices, sharing tales of slaughter and terror. They do not run from us anymore. They encircle us and herd us through the ship to some dark purpose. I need to UNDERSTAND them before it&rsquo;s too late. I put my hand on the pistol grip, looking at the backs of my last two crewmembers. I see dark mysteries swirling under their skulls. It would only take two bullet holes to release them...&quot;<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRules:\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOverlookVoidseeders are a race that can interact with the minds of crew members. They will have few nests instead of one, but only one strong fighting presence at given moment. Once killed, new one will be awakened from the most developed nest.<br/><br/>This race will focus on whispering and controlling minds - people who will be near them will start to hear voices commanding them to do different destructive things.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNestsOn the board, there is normally 1 Nest as a room token, but there are additionally 2-3 smaller nests. Those are places where new Voidseeders will born. At the moment of discovering main Nest, you should put a Stalker miniature in it (this is the model that is on the ship from the beginning. He is very dangerous, especially when faced by people with a high Insanity level).<br/><br/>Other Nests will start showing up on the board together with discovering certain Exploration tokens. Those nests will be especially dangerous. They will not move, but if a crew member will happen to end the turn at the tile with a nest, he will get a serious wound.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVoidlurkersThey will spawn in nests, and their objective will be to spread insanity and try to move players to Nests.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWhispersersThey will work very similar to Voidlurkers, but with the difference that they will have the main goal of defending the main nest.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tStalkerHe is a main guardian. He takes advantage from fear / insanity of the crew members and will focus on them.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDespoilerEquivalent of the Queen. Actually, it is hard to say if she is real or if it is a mass hallucination. One way or the other, she will only emerge when all Insanity tokens are on players (number of tokens will be specific for different numbers of players). She is extremely strong.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tContamination cardHere it will change a little bit - players will normally get a contamination card every time they will get an insanity token. They will be easier to discard (you don't need to check if it was infected or not). Effect of the card will only take place at the very end of the game, and it will be the same as in the normal version - if it will turn out it was indeed &quot;infected,&quot; it will mean that your character, even if escaped, went mad and lost the game either way.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWhispers mechanicThis mechanism will change the noise mechanic. Whenever you move (or an event card will tell you to), you will need to roll for whispers. If you would get a corridor with an whisper token already in it (you hear something more) - you need to draw a Card from the Insanity deck. Those cards will apply to you or not based on the numbers of insanity tokens your character has. Effects might be very different - from one-time action to permanent disabilities.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCombatIn combat, Voidlurkers will only try to add insanity tokens to you and then run away to the closes nest. Whisperers will be harder to kill, as well as present some portion of actual physical danger, but their main weapon will still be giving you insanity tokens.<br/><br/>Things will change with Stalker and Despoiler - those two will be huge opponents who will give you real wounds, so you will not want to be near them.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEvent phaseIn the event phase, one additional step that will be added is checking your insanity tokens and numbers of Voidlurkers and Whisperers in all rooms next to yours. If the number of them is higher than the number of insanity tokens, you add one insanity token and draw one contamination card.<br/><br/>But whenever you will be in a room with other people, this effect will be less harmful. (they can help you calm down)<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOverall feelOverall feel we will be going for will be way different from what you will have in the base Core Box. We have a lot of cool ideas how to get Insanity cards in a way, that it will be an additional layer of you not trusting your friends - not only because of their objective but perhaps because of the Insanity cards.<br/><br/>Additionally, interaction with Voidseeders will be way different, you will need to think very carefully where to move or place your hero to not go insane.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "New expansion from the Spiel fair in 2012<br/><br/>This expansion consists of 4 new hexes (Park, Goats, Sequential Order, Worker tiles) that are mixed into the corresponding supplies (black and yellow).<br/><br/>Park (Building/Beige): When a player adds the park to their estate, it can function as any building.  For example, sell some goods (warehouse), or take 2 silverlings (bank), etc.<br/>At the end of the game, the park may be additionally used per the corresponding knowledge tiles (16-23), as any single building (even if different than originally declared) for scoring purposes.<br/><br/>Goats (Animal/Light Green): A player adding the goats to their estate counts them as any animal (swine, for example.)  If other animal tiles are later added to that pasture, the goats will always count as 2 additional Victory Points, even if as a different animal type than originally scored. <br/>At the end of the game, the goats also count as an additional animal type for knowledge tile 24.<br/><br/>Sequential Order (Yellow): The player who adds this yellow tile to their estate is now always at the top in the sequential order lineup with their playing piece.  This is the case whether actively or passively (even if another playing piece would get there and normally be on top.)<br/><br/>Worker Tiles (Yellow): When a player adds this yellow tile to their estate, they can now purchase worker tiles from the general supply at any time.  The cost is 1 silverling for 2 tiles.<br/><br/>NOTE: You must have the base game The Castles of Burgundy to enjoy this expansion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Suddenly there was a tremendous explosion and I was instantly drenched in a cascade of cold water. Paralyzed for what seemed an eternity, I watched dark figures of men darting wildly about...our own accompanying infantry diving for cover. What was happening? Then realization hit me like a slap in the face...the water tins on the back of the Mk III had been hit. As I grabbed for the hatch, I was already giving the order to the gunner to traverse the turret. &ldquo;Schnell.&rdquo; One comprehensive glance had taken it all in and fear all but overwhelmed me. Not 50 yards away, a slowly-rising wisp of white smoke gave away the position of the 45mm anti-tank gun pointed straight at the panzer, pointed...so it seemed anyway, straight between my eyes. &ldquo;Hard Right!&rdquo; Beyond it were supporting Russian infantry&mdash;all too visible now behind their chattering small arms fire and the louder, staccato hammering of a supporting heavy machine gun. &ldquo;CLANG&rdquo; The tank shuddered with the reverberation of a direct hit against the front of the revolving turret. The added 30mm of frontal armour had saved them this time. Now quickly before they can reload...&rdquo;Fire.&rdquo; <br/><br/>This is CROSS OF IRON...a gripping game of tactical combat on the Russian Front. Following in the footsteps of its amazingly successful predecessor, CROSS OF IRON comes replete with an entirely restructured armour and artillery system, which does for armour combat what its predecessor, SQUAD LEADER, did for infantry actions. In fact, the first thing the game instructs you to do is throw away your old artillery and armour counters to make way for their expanded revised counterparts. Each AFV now has three separate MG factors, turret position differentiation, &ldquo;button up&rdquo; penalties, and advantages, target size differentiation, varying amour modifiers and much more. CROSS OF IRON again utilizes programmed instruction to guide you through 8 scenarios of increasing realism and complexity. The 36-page rulebook starts in where the SQUAD LEADER rules left off...at section 63 and continues on to section 103. An expanded Campaign Game enables players to simulate virtually any action of their choosing with a vastly enlarged counter mix encompassing virtually every AFV which saw action WWII...from the diminutive BT5 to the mammoth King Tiger.<br/><br/>CROSS OF IRON is more than just a game. When combined with SQUAD LEADER, it provides a system which can be used to portray any Eastern Front action. Be forewarned! CROSS OF IRON is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered SQUAD LEADER.<br/><br/><br/>In each game you get:<br/><br/>     520 double-printed &frac12;&quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that made up the combatants of the Eastern Front.<br/>     576 double-printed ⅝&quot; vehicular and artillery counters encompassing the entire OB of the war in Russia.<br/>     An additional 8&quot; &times; 22&quot; geomorphic mapboard section increasing the possible terrain configurations and adding several new terrain types.<br/>     Comprehensive, illustrated 36-page rule booklet.<br/>     Scenario Cards for game situations 13-20.<br/>     Two expanded Quick Reference Data Cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>New features include:<br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        Rockets<br/><br/>        Infantry Guns<br/><br/>        Range Effects on Penetration<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Paratroop Drops<br/><br/>        Burning AFVs<br/><br/>        Reverse Movement<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Armour Leaders<br/><br/>        Ammo Depletion<br/><br/>        Rumanians<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Target Acquisition<br/><br/>        Intensive Fire<br/><br/>        Height Advantage<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Molotov Cocktails<br/><br/>        Stukas<br/><br/>        Anti-Tank Magnetic Mines<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        SS<br/><br/>        Marsh, Gullies &amp; Forest-Roads<br/><br/>        Prisoners<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Bore Sighting<br/><br/>        AT Rifles<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Armoured Cars<br/><br/>        Volksgrenadiers &amp; Conscripts<br/><br/>        &hellip; and much, much more<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Cavalry<br/><br/>        Snipers<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Partisans<br/><br/>        Fire &amp; Weather Effects<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Anti-Aircraft Guns<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Critical Hits<br/><br/>        <br/><br/>        <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Ownership of SQUAD LEADER is necessary to play this game.<br/><br/>",

Unlike its predecessor, it not only includes a campaign (titled &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot;) in which you follow great explorer Lieutenant Colonel Percy Fawcett, but also a full set of rules and components that can be played with the base game of Robinson Crusoe, along with two standalone scenarios.<br/><br/>Robinson Crusoe: Mystery Tales introduces ten new characters, the new deck of event cards, three new decks of adventure cards, new beast cards, new mystery cards, and the new mechanism of sanity that you can use in the base game of Robinson Crusoe to change it into a game of dreadful stories! Additionally, the expansion includes five missions that form a long and epic campaign: &quot;The Lost City of Z&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These proud factions each bring their own unique style of play to Rune Age. With their penchant for mining and love of wealth, the dwarves are able to quickly amass large sums of gold, then parlay it into devastating attacks against their foes. Meanwhile, the orcs display a single-minded lust for combat, proving that there's no orcish phrase for &quot;half measure&quot;. Their all-or-nothing approach to battle rewards players who empty their hands to win.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone, the four existing factions have rallied formidable new units to their cause. Cunning Novice Wizards and massive Roc Warriors bolster the Daqan Lords' emphasis on hand control, while swift Leonx Riders and lumbering Forest Guardians capitalize on the Latari Elves' mastery of influence. The forces of evil are likewise emboldened; foul Vampires and fearsome Barrow Wyrms add their strength to the armies of Waiqar the Undying, while depraved Blood Sisters and corpulent Obscenes engage in ritual mutilation for the glory of the Uthuk!<br/><br/>New scenarios challenge your deck-building prowess and new Mercenary cards provide even more strategic options. Unite the tribes, fire the forges, and experience Rune Age like never before!<br/><br/>",

A separate dungeon booklet contains all of the descriptions, encounters, and puzzles that you'll experience as you explore.<br/><br/>You can access these dungeons at specific locations in the atlas of the Sleeping Gods base game. When you reach a location that contains a dungeon, you can choose to read from the standard storybook, or instead explore the dungeon that is located there. The specified location number is listed in the top left corner of the dungeon map.<br/><br/>Each dungeon holds dangerous traps, vicious monsters, and treasure that you can find. Because dungeons take longer to explore than a standard location, there are a few small changes to game play when you enter one. While in the dungeon, players take turns taking two actions each, which include moving to new rooms, examining your surroundings, and more.<br/><br/>",

Well, around here we call that vagrancy, and it&rsquo;s illegal. So I&rsquo;m sorry sir, but I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m going to have to write you a ticket.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The galaxy of Cosmic Encounter, like most galaxies, is constantly changing. Just when you think you&rsquo;ve explored every corner of it and met most of its aliens, you turn around to find that a new star system has just materialized, full of new species with astonishing, wildly unique customs. You&rsquo;ve learned that when interacting with a strange alien for the first time, its best not to reveal all of your hand at once. If you want to establish colonies in these recently-formed parts of the galaxy, you&rsquo;ll have to be conceal your true intentions, negotiate with cunning, and be careful not to put your foot into cross-cultural quicksand&mdash;or into your mouth.<br/><br/>Cosmic Eons, an expansion for Cosmic Encounter, introduces new aliens with abilities unlike any you&rsquo;ve dealt with so far, but it doesn&rsquo;t stop there. This expansion features the Hidden Alliances variant, which enables you and your opponents to reveal simultaneously whose side you&rsquo;re on. With this simple mechanical twist, Cosmic Eons promises not just to open up a new part of the galaxy, but to change how you play the game.<br/><br/>",

The four ship cards feature three unique pilots who can each provide powerful benefits to their squad mates; for example, Captain Kagi can divert enemy target locks from your other ships and force your opponent to fire against his shuttle and its five shields.<br/><br/>The Lambda-class Shuttle is highly customizable, too, as each one can carry up to two crew members, one cannon, and a system upgrade.

To inherit your uncle's fortune, you must also lose your job!  After all, your uncle's heritage can't go to someone who's employed!<br/><br/>With this expansion added to Last Will, each player begins the game with a job card that provides him with a regular income each turn and details a number of things the player must do in order to get fired. Unlike in real life, it can be difficult to persuade your employer to give you the old heave-ho. When you miss work, he's inclined to be charitable because he liked your uncle and he's sorry for your loss. To make him angry, you need to get caught living it up when you should be working. He won't sack you straight away, but he will at least dock your salary.<br/><br/>Once per round, you are able to reduce your income by completing one of the things listed on the job card, earning you a demotion. Even your kindly old boss has his limits, though; when you earn enough demotions to cancel out every line of income, you can discard your employment card. Congratulations: You have been sacked and are one step closer to winning the game!<br/><br/>You will also have a chance to find yourself a good, demanding wife. A wedding is such a romantic way to spend piles of money in a hurry, right? The expansion has six nuptial cards, so get down on one knee and ask the question!<br/><br/>Also, with this expansion, each game can have a different planning board to bring additional variety to the game.

The Villagers don't know who the Werewolves are, and the Werewolves are trying to remain undiscovered while they slowly eliminate the Villagers one at a time. A Moderator (who isn't on a team) runs the game.<br/><br/>Ultimate Werewolf takes place over a series of game days and nights. Each day, the players discuss who among them is a Werewolf and vote out a player. Each night, the Werewolves choose a player to eliminate, while the Seer learns whether one player is a Werewolf or not. The game is over when either all the Villagers or all the Werewolves are eliminated.<br/><br/>Ultimate Werewolf: Deluxe Edition features all new artwork, a great new design, totally rewritten and more comprehensive rules, and an even better moderator scorepad. What's more, it supports more players than ever: 75 of your closest friends can converge on one or more villages using the components in this box.<br/><br/>",

The fourth Data Pack in the &quot;Genesis Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner, A Study in Static focuses on developing each faction's traditional strengths even as it opens up new strategies for players to explore; each of the four Corporations receives a new piece of ice, and all three Runners receive a new icebreaker. New resources and agendas permit players to pursue tightly focused deck builds centered around an increasing number of tricks and traps. Meanwhile, A Study in Static also allows players to reevaluate their existing decks and reconfigure them for greater efficiency.<br/><br/>With their advancements in ice, icebreakers, and hardware, the sixty new cards from A Study in Static (three copies each of twenty individual cards) escalate the game's cyberstruggles to a new form of art. No longer do the factions content themselves to building and breaking snares and subroutines; they turn their attentions to the flow of time itself. So much as time is a matter of perception and of movement, A Study in Static is a study in the ability to accelerate and impede the passage of time.<br/><br/>",

To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.<br/><br/>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends because someone has passed a particular point threshold. When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!<br/><br/>X nimmt! starts with the same premise as 6 nimmt!, but changes these rules a few ways. Each player starts with eight cards in hand and a personal X row. Played cards will be placed into three rows, with those rows being able to hold three, four or five cards. Whenever someone takes cards from a row, those cards go into the player's hand, then the player must play one card into their personal X row.<br/><br/>All cards in this X row must also be played in ascending order! If you can't do this, then you place all of those X cards aside in order to start a new X row, with the value of those set-aside cards now being doubled.<br/><br/>A round ends after someone plays the final card in their hand, and whoever has the fewest negative points after two rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Empires: Close Encounters is the first expansion to Space Empires: 4X. Alien races meet up close as they encounter each other for the first time in ship boarding engagements and planetary invasions with different types of ground troops. The strengths and weaknesses of each alien empire are brought out with roughly 20 unique racial abilities. The expansion takes advantage of the streamlined nature of the game system to add more technology and cool sci-fi things in very simple ways. While it is designed to be used as a whole, the expansion is modular and players can choose to use only the parts that they like.<br/><br/>Also included in the expansion is an experience system so that your ship groups become more proficient over time. There is a big benefit if you can keep ships alive! The game gives more counters of each ship type to accommodate groups at different experience levels. Military academies in your empire can give your new groups a head start in accumulating experience.<br/><br/>Titans, super large ships beyond dreadnaught, make their appearance and can both carry fighters and destroy planets, but have liabilities too. As requested, fleet counters and a fleet display are in the box. In addition to racial advantages, there are also unique Alien Technologies that can be gained by conquering the non-player Alien planets. There are more technologies and some more money is added into the game because of the larger tech tree.<br/><br/>New scenarios are added for both 3 and 4 players. A new alien empire solitaire scenario is included as well as another solitaire scenario where a player can attempt to fight off an invading mass of Space Amoebas.<br/><br/>Space Empires: Close Encounters includes thicker counters for itself as well as a complete set of thicker counters (4.5 counter sheets) from the base game.<br/><br/>",

This monolith engraved with Viking runes was designed by Adrian Smith to represent the telling of your Viking saga!<br/>     Sculpted Doom Token: This is used to mark the province that will be destroyed next by Ragnar&ouml;k, something that bloodthirsty Vikings can forget in the heat of battle. Designed by Adrian Smith, this token depicts the Triple Horn of Odin.<br/>     Sculpted (Golden) First Player Token: With this token, you'll never forget who's supposed to start the round. It is a hand holding an axe up high.<br/><br/><br/>The 2nd Edition came with some more upgraded components:<br/><br/>     Pillage Tokens: Engraved flat reward tokens and separate 3D pillaged provinces that fit on top of the reward token.<br/>     Golden Gods of Asgard Miniatures: Resculpted, oversized, golden figure and card (same Gods as in &quot;Gods of Asgard&quot; expansion).<br/><br/><br/>Further, an extra variant set of miniatures, the Wild Boar Clan (or Stag Clan), was included, allowing an expanded choice of clans. This was not, however, a fifth player expansion, as it lacked the needed cards (Stag Clan did include the 5th player cards). Included with the standard game components were the sculpted clan tokens and Mystic figures, making this forward compatible with the Mystics of Asgard expansion.<br/><br/>Those who also purchased 5th Player Expansion during the campaign additionally received extra exclusives.<br/><br/>",

Players may choose two specialist cards during set-up. Benefits range from upgrading all archers to long bows, increasing unit size based on your Warrior's Level, and additional movements, to name a few.<br/><br/>Starting with BattleLore: Horrific Horde, additional Deployment cards are included in some supplements.<br/><br/>Set-up now includes the following actions:<br/><br/>     Ready your deployment deck and draw deployment cards<br/>     Set-up your units based on the cards drawn<br/>     Determine initiative<br/>     Deploy your Reserve units<br/>     Establish your War Council<br/>     Select and play 2 Specialist cards<br/><br/><br/>The expansion also includes new terrain hexes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After more than three years of development, Conflict of Heroes: Eastern Front - Solo Expansion is a solitaire expansion for Conflict of Heroes: Awakening the Bear. Instead of AI units being individually programmed as in some past games, AI units utilize a unique emergent behavior and agent-based logic. Each situation is evaluated and the AI implements the best course of action using available resources and unit assets. Even veteran CoH players will be challenged to hone and adapt their playing styles in order to overcome the AI!<br/><br/>In the Conflict of Heroes Solo System, players no longer track APs, but must make a Unit Spent Check after every action. The higher the cost in APs an action was, the higher the probability that the unit will be spent. Now a player must decide if he will augment his action with APs or increase his chance of keeping the unit fresh!<br/><br/>Each Firefight has its own Mission Track. A Mission Track is a series of events that are triggered if the Mission Marker lands on an event's space. Certain orders advance the Mission Marker 1, 2 or 3 spaces, so the game is different each time you play. The firefight ends immediately when the Mission Marker lands on or passes the last space of the Mission Track.<br/><br/>Note: This is an expansion for Awakening the Bear specifically, not for other Conflict of Heroes games. It was originally released for 2nd edition Awakening the Bear.<br/><br/>     With a bit of adapting, this expansion can be used with 1st Edition Awakening the Bear.<br/>     And with a different bit of adapting, this expansion can be used with 3rd Edition Awakening the Bear.<br/><br/><br/>Note: The base game 2-player scenarios are NOT playable with solitaire rules &quot;out of the box&quot;; solitaire scenarios need additional elements (mission track etc). So additional homebrew tinkering is needed to adapt an existing 2-player scenario for use with the solitaire system. But the solitaire expansion comes with many (new) scenarios, and the Firefight Generator expansion permits creating solitaire scenarios.<br/><br/>",

The game board features the twelfth-highest mountain in the world, formerly known as &quot;K3&quot; and now typically called &quot;Broad Peak&quot; due to the length of its summit.<br/>Broad Peak&nbsp;gives you two very different challenges to undertake, which are based on the historical achievements of Polish mountaineers on Broad Peak in 1984. Both challenges have their own game boards and rule changes to make them individual game experiences.<br/>The first challenge is &quot;Race to the Top&quot;, a quick and thrilling game in which the game lasts three fewer days than normal, players have no tents, and the deck contains fewer acclimatization cards. Also, the board just has fewer places to climb, so watch your step!<br/>The second challenge is &quot;Traverse of Broad Peaks&quot;, which is more strategic and a little longer than the base game. The board shows three tops of Broad Peak and mountaineers can earn additional victory points for traversing all of the mountain and for reaching the top of each of the three peaks &ndash; which is very difficult to do, especially since the mountaineers have only one tent with them.<br/>You need a copy of&nbsp;K2&nbsp;in order to play&nbsp;K2: Broad Peak.<br/><br/>",

Aminia felt blind panic, like shadowed hands squeezing her desperately thudding heart up again her ribs and then-- nothing. Darkness. Silence. And one thought: &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t save me.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Suddenly, the light hit her eyelids with searing brightness as she snapped into life with a jolt. She gasped for air. &ldquo;Ms. Twain? Are you alright?&rdquo; Dr. Stinson asked quickly. &ldquo;Hiccups?&rdquo; Mr. Parsons asked in his usual, genial manner. She felt her stomach churn - how did she ever find that phony charisma so charming? She smiled weakly and nodded, feigning another hiccup, before excusing herself from the meeting for a cup of water. Shutting the door behind her, she melted, stunned, on the other side of the wall. The meeting continued on within the room behind her - they didn&rsquo;t even notice her absence.<br/><br/>What happened? Her eyes darted around the familiar headquarters of the Freedom Five, but not everything seemed like how she&rsquo;d left it. Things were different. She was different. She had died. The darkness had lifted to unveil a changed world. Or perhaps, perhaps only she had changed? She went to the sink to fill the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Finest Assistant&quot; mug Dr. Stinson gave her three years before they let her die. The handle had yet to crack.<br/><br/>This world was most definitely different than the one she left, but no difference cast such a stark contrast as the difference she felt inside. No longer was she the devoted, sheepish secretary who alerted the Freedom Five to where trouble emerged, who placed orders for Tachyon&rsquo;s many pairs of new footwear, who copied memos from the president, who washed sweaty spandex uniforms. Now, she was awake.<br/><br/>Aminia straightened up her jacket and opened the door to return to the job she perfected in her previous life. No longer would she skip date night to remove every fleck of red dust from their precious equipment. Nor would she lose sleep worrying about the calls she would make to loved ones with bad news after a battle. For never again would she shed a tear for the Freedom Five. No. For now, all she heard amid the cheer of the grateful crowds and the praise of the adoring public was that one final thought. They had a choice - me, their devoted servant, who gave EVERYTHING . . . or five total strangers.<br/><br/>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t save me.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Can they save themselves?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Sentinels of the Multiverse: Miss Information Villain Character is a new villain character, with his own unique villain deck of 25 cards, a rules card, and a character card.<br/><br/>Note: First announced as The Assistant but changed to Miss Information before going to print.<br/><br/>",

Given enough time to flourish and multiply, they finally broke out of their hiding in darkness and obscurity, hellbent on revenge! They slaughtered their way through the human population of the world, destroying all they touched. The human race rallied, but ultimately, the monsters from their greatest nightmares were too strong and too numerous.<br/><br/>Decades turned into centuries, and centuries became millenia - the world, now overrun entirely by monsters of all sorts is a terrible wasteland. The few points of light in the darkness have long been extinguished. This could be the most terrible era for heroes, lost in time, to end up.<br/><br/>Hope that you never do.<br/><br/>The Final Wasteland is the true end to all time. Do not think that you can overcome its dangers - pray that you might survive it.<br/><br/>",

During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player&rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.<br/><br/>By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.<br/><br/>Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards, special actions, and terrain sectors to build the map!  Kingdom Builder: Big Box ramps up this variability by including all expansions to date, ensuring you'll never play the same game twice!<br/><br/>Kingdom Builder: Big Box includes the four expansions Nomads, Crossroads, Marshlands and Harvest as well as three Queenies (Capitol, Caves and Island).<br/><br/>(The first edition Big Box has only the first 2 expansions and queenies.)<br/><br/>Note: At least the first printing of Kingdom Builder: Big Box (Second Edition) had misprinted Task cards for the Crossroads Expansion. The back of the cards are printed with the same back as regular Kingdom Builder Cards. During setup, sort them out before drawing Kingdom Builder Cards and the game works fine.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The main mode of Nemesis: Aftermath is the Epilogue Mode, a short (45-60 min.) 5-turn game, which is played after a regular game. At the start of this Epilogue, an unspecified amount of time has passed since the events that occurred in the Nemesis base game. The players use Characters (which haven't took part in base game) who enter the Nemesis to investigate. The ship bears many scars of its past tribulations, so any leftovers from your previous game will have effects on your Epilogue game.<br/>An Epilogue game is much shorter than a regular Nemesis game, but it is more difficult and offers a very dynamic playthrough. Instead of Objectives, players have to deal with seemingly simple Personal Requirements, while trying to cooperate in order to cope with various Alerts. In addition, players pursuing more selfish interests might accept the Lucrative Offer. The players also use the additional Shuttle board, which represents a new small ship (docked to the Nemesis) consisting of additional 4 Room slots. The Nemesis: Aftermath expansion also adds 4 new Rooms &quot;2&quot;.<br/>You can play the Epilogue game with less players than the number that actually participated in the regular game.<br/><br/>TRAITS<br/>Nemesis: Aftermath adds a Trait card for each Character (both from the base game and the expansion). Trait cards gives specific advantages and disadvantages during the game. The Trait card is placed face up next to the Character board, and its rule is in effect for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>NEW CHARACTERS<br/>Nemesis: Aftermath adds 5 new Characters to the game. When the players choose their Character, the Character draft card they select allows them to pick either the base game or the Aftermath character of a chosen color. For example, the red Aftermath Character (the Convict) can replace the red base game Character (the Soldier). After choosing their Character, each player keeps their selected draft card, preventing any other player to choose the other Character of the same color. The two red Characters (the Convict and the Soldier) can never be in the same game together. The Aftermath Characters are very different from the base game Characters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The custom components in the deluxe edition replace the standard components from the retail edition.]<br/><br/>Setting:<br/>Coloma is the town where an unexpected event happened that shaped history of the Western Frontier. In the winter of 1848 a man building a sawmill on the South Fork of the American River spotted some bright nuggets in the tailrace waters below. Sure enough, it was gold! Though he tried to keep his discovery a secret, word spread quickly and it triggered the California Gold Rush of &lsquo;49.<br/><br/>Thousands of people arrived from far and wide, making Coloma one of the fastest growing boomtowns in the country. Claims were staked, camps and makeshift homes were built, and hotels and saloons sprung up almost overnight. Everyone wanted their cut of the land&rsquo;s wealth. For many it was Coloma or Bust!<br/><br/>In the game of Coloma, you are a pioneer who has recently travelled out West to strike it rich and make a name for yourself. You will prospect for gold and use your windfalls to recruit workers, rustle up horses, and establish businesses. You will also get opportunities to explore the surrounding riverways and frontier lands. But alas! You are not alone&mdash;every other pioneer seems to have gotten the same idea! Therefore, it will take extra cunning tactics on your part to not go Bust with the rest of them...<br/><br/>Overview of Play:<br/>At the beginning of each chapter, you and the other players will simultaneously select an action to perform on the board. Once your selections are revealed, you must check if a majority of players chose the same action. If so, it is a Bust&mdash;which disables the Boom bonus that would be included otherwise. Then the players take turns performing actions, such as gaining resources, moving wagons on the map, building bridges and businesses, and placing camps and gunmen. After that, a section of the board is rotated&mdash;slightly changing the layout of the actions for the upcoming chapter.<br/><br/>When the rotating section hits high noon, the round ends with a bang: a shootout against an ever-growing number of outlaws! If you and the other players can outnumber the outlaws with your combined gunmen, you will get your fair share of the rewards. But if not, the rewards drop, and some of the gunmen will go to the graveyard... The game ends after the third shootout, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Coloma is a fast moving game with many paths to victory. It offers unique twists on simultaneous action selection, resource management, and engine-building. The town cards in your tableau allow you to play more efficiently, gain extra actions, and bend the rules to your advantage. With these cards and the bridge tiles (which add points based on what you achieve), you can create the perfect combination for your strategy and play style.<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Goodies Expansion contains:<br/><br/><br/>     Agricola: X-Deck -- 24 cards with alien encounters all over the farm. Every time a player visits a stone quarry, a card is drawn from the pile. And then? Resistance is futile!<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Agricola: Ö-Deck -- 12 new Occupations and 12 new Minor Improvements including a wunderkind, the guy with the couch, the singing family from the Alps, and of course that one specific Governor.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Agricola CZ-Deck -- 12 Occupations and 12 Improvements.  Based on famous people, places, and historic events from the Czech Republic. Illustrated in the spirit of the artist Josef Lada, this expansion was initiated by the Czech Publisher of Agricola-Mindok.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Agricola: L-Deck -- Nobody knows exactly what the L stands for.

In terms of Commands and Colors performance, the medium infantry units (representing less experienced legions) and heavy infantry units (representing the veteran legions) will now be able to move two hexes without engaging in close combat, or still move one hex and have close combat (as well as throwing their pilum - a capability acquired in Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #2 – Rome vs the Barbarians). You will be able to fight battles with medium and heavy infantry as you have never fought them before!<br/><br/>Rules-wise, if you've played Commands & Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble at all learning the few special rules for these legionary infantry units, for the basic mechanics remain unchanged. The battle dice resolve combat quickly and the Command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory. Yet the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Ancient units, their weapons, terrain and the history.<br/><br/>But that's not all... GMT is also going to include another mounted mapboard in Expansion #3, configured to be mated to the mounted board from Commands & Colors: Ancients Expansion Pack #2 – Rome vs the Barbarians. In addition the Commands &amp; Colors: Epic Ancients new Command rules for fighting large-scale historical battles will provide those of you interested in fighting truly large-scale, multi-player, ancient battles the perfect and unique opportunity to do so with a number of your friends.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients<br/><br/><br/>",

Who knows what strange, abyssal trinkets you might find, among the skeletons of fish and rotting seaweed?<br/><br/>The Innsmouth Conspiracy, the sixth deluxe expansion for Arkham Horror: The Card Game, invites you to take your first steps in a twisting, time-jumping tale, starting with the campaign&rsquo;s first two scenarios included in this expansion. From the heart of Innsmouth itself to the torturous coastline and beyond, these scenarios tee up an adventure that will continue to unfold across the subsequent six Mythos Packs. Far from including just two new scenarios, however, The Innsmouth Conspiracy brings five new investigators to the table with an undersea trove of player cards to support new types of decks&mdash;along with new mechanics for players to sink their teeth into, including keys, flood tokens, bless tokens, and curse tokens!<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A set of Promo cards for Troyes was released at the International Games Festival in Cannes. For a time, these were available for purchase from the BGG store.<br/><br/>There are 4 included cards are as follows:<br/><br/>I Activity Card - Yellow - Baker<br/><br/>Sells his bread to every civilian still present in town.  Earn 1 denier per yellow die present on all districts of the city square.<br/><br/>II Activity Card - White - Prior<br/><br/>Optimizes the work of the monks.  Use one white die as if it were two white dice of the same value.  It is not possible to use more than one white die for this action.<br/><br/>III Activity Card - Red - The Banquet<br/><br/>Each red die in the district with the most red dice participates in the banquet.  Gain 1 VP per red die present in the district with the most red dice in it (this district may belong to another player, even the neutral player).<br/><br/>Event Card - Red - Resistance<br/><br/>When this card comes into play, it calls for a second red event.  Take this second red card from those set aside at the beginning of the game. The second red card calls for a third yellow or white one.  When resolving Resistance, it removes the last cube placed on each Event card (including Marauding, but excluding Resistance itself).<br/><br/>These bonus cards are also included in all base game editions starting from 2016<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeon Lords: Festival Season is a big expansion that includes lots of Dungeon Lording goodness.<br/><br/>The game is still played over two years, but now each year has five rounds instead of four: winter, spring, summer, autumn and festival season. More time to build your dungeon, but also more time for adventurers to gather a larger party. There are new monsters, rooms, and traps to prepare your dungeon for the battle, but also new nasty spells for the adventurers and sneaky bards who encourage them to perform so-called &quot;heroic&quot; deeds &ndash; not to mention two paladins for each year, now ready to punish up to two evil players.<br/><br/>Would you like to push other players toward evil instead of moving yourself toward good when visiting the city? What about making an investment instead of traditional gold digging? Or what about repairing conquered tunnels or rooms instead of digging new ones? Only eight actions are still available to you, but each season one of those actions is replaced by an alternate set of spaces that offer new and intriquing options.<br/><br/>And did we mention that it has recently become fashionable for Dungeon Lords to have their own personal pets?<br/><br/>Dungeon Lords: Festival Season includes the mini expansion Dungeon Lords: The New Paladins.<br/><br/>",

Based on the popular The Call of Cthulhu expansion for the Elder Sign: Omens app, players can now venture forth from the confines of the museum and board The Ultima Thule to combat the Ancient Ones that have begun to stir in the depths of the Pacific.<br/><br/>The new R&rsquo;lyeh Rising mode of gameplay features two stages as you first navigate the Dark Waters track and then assemble the Amulet of R&rsquo;lyeh to stop one of three dangerous new Ancient Ones from waking and devouring the world. Engage the newly introduced mission tokens for hard-won rewards and fend off the dogged Deep One Legion as your investigators move to unknown dangers on the Pacific Adventure cards. The depths of the Pacific are filled with fresh terrors that only the bravest can attempt to seal with the power of the Elder Signs in the Omens of the Deep expansion for Elder Sign!<br/><br/>",

We are very excited to now make that available - the Assassin module of Hidden Agenda contains all the Avalon roles, rethemed and renamed to fit into The Resistance Universe.<br/><br/>Defector Module: Two variants in one, the Defectors were included as part of the Avalon promos.  In one variant, the Defectors can switch allegiance during the game - ensuring that players are never quite certain who to trust.  In the second variant version the two Defectors know each other - ensuring that the accusations of deceit begin from the very opening of the game.<br/><br/>Trapper Module: Every proposed Mission Team includes an extra person that won't go on the mission.  The leader will isolate a team member and watch their every move - making sure they can't make the mission fail. If you are a spy on the Mission Team, you&rsquo;ll never know if you will cause a mission to fail or simply be giving your identity away. But resistance members will have to approve some missions knowing that a spy is on them and trust that the leader chooses to isolate the spy.<br/><br/>The first printing of Hidden Agenda omitted the rules for optional character powers.  Those rules can be found here elsewhere on this site.<br/><br/>Includes 25 new cards (89mm x 64mm) and 1 team token.<br/><br/>",

The Red Cathedral stands out among recent games for its original rondel mechanism, winning the hearts of thousands of gamers around the world.<br/><br/>The expansion comes in a box that contains almost as much content as the original game and takes the experience into another dimension.  In Contractors we find 10 new guilds that can be combined with those from the basic game, 6 additional blueprint cards, and a new card for the solo mode.  Many of these new guilds use the Contractors module, which among other things, adds a new board containing a map of Russia.  We Will send our contractors throughout Russia to recruit the talent of the best specialists and artisans of the country to aid in the construction of the cathedral.<br/><br/>As in the original game, each of these guilds contains 3 different cards, of which one per guild can be included into the game, meaning that Contractors offers 30 new different ways to play The Red Cathedral.  And among other highlights are a black die that can be used alongside the 5 existing dice used to obtain resources, diamonds which serve as a wild-card form of resource, and the contractors, which are Cossack meeples that incorporate a worker placement element into the game.<br/><br/>",

The primary module is &quot;The Vizier's Favor&quot;, which allows players to buy a building out of turn but has to be paid with exact amount.<br/><br/>2. &quot;The Builders Huts&quot; (Die Bauh&uuml;tte) introduces a number of new tiles that only count in the scoring when other tiles of the same color are built next to them. Hut tiles are free, but their number is limited to three per player.<br/><br/>3. With the &quot;The Currency Exchange&quot; (Wechselstube), players can buy building tiles by mixing different currencies.<br/><br/>4. The fourth module is a set of bonus cards that are dealt to the players. Each of the tiles shows a particular building. If the matching building is part of your Alhambra, then the bonus card can be revealed and will count as another building of that category.<br/><br/>Owners of the first edition of the game (titled only &quot;Alhambra&quot;) will notice that the color scheme of the &quot;Currency Exchange&quot;  does not agree with their currency cards: later editions of the game had differently colored currency cards that can be more easily distinguished from each other.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Alhambra<br/><br/><br/>",

Play as the survivors or the Zombies. Plus ITEMeeples!<br/><br/>WIN: Survivors must complete 3 objectives - Zombies must kill all the Survivors or gain control of the Mall's Courtyard.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: In Tiny Epic Zombies, survivors are always on the run, collecting weapons, killing Zombies and working toward completing objectives. Completing 3 objectives can win you the game but if you're too focused on the objectives, the Zombies will overrun the mall and that will be the end of you.<br/><br/>Based on the mode of play, you will either play as one of the Survivors or as the Zombies.<br/><br/>As a Survivor, your turn will consist of moving 3 times. Then based on where you move, you'll be able to do additional things. For instance, if you move into a room with a Zombie, you'll have to fight it by rolling the Zombie die. Or if you move into a room adjacent to a Zombie, you can spend ammo to shoot it. Killing a Zombie is actually pretty easy... but they just keep coming. Keeping them from overrunning the entire mall, while trying to accomplish your objectives, that is hard!<br/><br/>After you've taken your 3 moves, you'll search the room. This is done by revealing the Search Card you are holding. Most of the time, you find something useful, like awesome items you can later pickup and equip to your ITEMeeples. Sometimes though, you may find a Zombie lurking in the corner. So be prepared.<br/>After you search the room, more Zombies flood into the Mall. Then it's the next player's turn. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Note: If your ammo and wound tokens ever meet, you're dead meat! So, keep your wounds low and your ammo high.<br/><br/>If you die, that character will turn into a Zombie and you'll have to draw a new character to play. If that happens too many times, you lose the game.<br/><br/>As a Zombie player, not only will you control unique Zombies with special abilities, you will control ALL the Zombies! With your help, the Zombies will have a brain in addition to eating brains. Your game will be to overwhelm the players with clever placement and movement of the Zombies. Smother them with your Zombie horde and prevent them from completing their objectives. If you kill enough players or overrun the mall courtyard, you win.<br/><br/>",

While you were away, the Icarites descended from their lofty perch among the clouds, imposing a new way of life upon the Euphorians, Wastelanders, and Subterrans. Is this a fresh start for the dystopian citizens, or will history repeat itself?<br/><br/>Ignorance Is Bliss is a &quot;more stuff&quot; expansion. Or perhaps a better way of putting it is &quot;alternative stuff.&quot; For example, there are a bunch of new recruit cards and market tiles that you can use as an alternative to the recruits and markets in the original game (they aren't designed to be mixed together with the original recruits and markets). There's also a new type of recruit card (not a new faction, just a new type).<br/><br/>Ignorance Is Bliss is also a &quot;player count&quot; expansion. The original game of Euphoria was for 2-6 players, but the expansion adds an Automa mode (an intelligent AI system) that expands the game to 1-6 players. The Automa system is also designed for optional use in 2-player games so they feel more like 4-player games.<br/><br/>Ignorance Is Bliss is also an &quot;improve the rules&quot; expansion. Euphoria itself still stands on its own, but given that it was released 5 years ago, we've listened to a lot of feedback about certain frustrations and perceived imbalances, and we've addressed them with some new rules, a &quot;New Antiques Bazaar&quot; board, and some new components.<br/><br/>Euphoria: Ignorance Is Bliss is an expansion to Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Of course, the huge difference comes when they attack with their fearsome bows!<br/><br/>Deadeye Walkers Attack whenever they activate while having a Line Of Sight on a Survivor (or more) at Range 0-3. Then, they perform a standard Zombie Attack on the designated Zone. If several Zones are eligible, they choose their target according to these priorities:<br/><br/>1- The Zone with the most Survivors.<br/>    2- The noisiest Zone.<br/>    3- If all eligible Zones have the same amount of Survivors and Noise, the players choose.<br/><br/>Walking the streets will never be safe while Deadeye Walkers roam about.

Plotted over a former military training camp turned into an airfield, this track has been a staple in North America since the 1930&rsquo;s. Each year, the 12 hours of Sebring take place there: an endurance race whose slightly uneven course gives drivers the chance to test the resilience of their vehicle in the hot and dry (when is it not humid?) Florida weather.<br/><br/>The second track of this expansion offers street racing fans the chance to drive wildly in the streets of Chicago - in the East Park area, to be precise. This track offers an urban terrain which alternates between curves and straight lines. This mad race in the heart of city traffic will give drivers a chance to drive along the impressive Aon Center, one of the tallest skyscrapers of the city, to cross the Lake Shore East Park and its three tightly woven lanes (be careful about collisions!), and then rush along the inner port before finally crossing two vertigo-inducing bridges.<br/><br/>",

The partnership of these upgrades permit some interesting, new combinations, and the E-wing may open some wildly creative squad builds. For example, by partnering R7-T1 with Advanced Sensors on a ship piloted by someone like Etahn A'baht, who is capable of using &quot;Push the Limit&quot; (included in the A-Wing Expansion Pack and Imperial Aces), you could perform three actions before you reveal your maneuver. And if that maneuver is green, Etahn A'baht would even end his Activation phase without a stress token!<br/><br/>With its E-wing miniature, four ship cards, five upgrade cards, maneuver dial, and tokens, the E-Wing Expansion Pack comes with everything you need to pursue entirely new tactics in your X-Wing battles!<br/><br/>",

This treacherous faction seeks to enslave the other races of the Warhammer world. The High Elves are a proud, powerful race who rely on card denial, cancellation, healing, and ranged attacks. They work to heal damage to the world and unlock the ancient mysteries of the arcane. Both will raise mighty kingdoms and venture out on perilous quests as they seek the power to stand victorious. Can either faction rise to dominance over the other, or will they both succumb to another foe altogether?<br/><br/>Assault on Ulthuan contains two core starter decks of forty cards, as well as two capital boards for the Dark Elves and High Elves. Players of the existing factions will find plenty to aid them as well; new cards for the other four factions, plus a handful of neutrals, bring a host of new strategies, tactics, and deck-building options for each of the six races in the game.<br/><br/>The war for supremacy over the Old World has already seen bloodshed and suffering beyond imagination... but this was only the beginning.

Class 1C and 2C come on the same game board with color denoting spaces that can be used in 2C but not in 1C. Asteroids that approach the spaceship from the front or from behind sometimes swoop around to hit the ship on the side, and asteroids that approach from the side sometimes split in half and hit the ship twice! A structural rift down the center of the spaceship requires universal connectors to connect only with other universal connectors when bridging this rift. So much for their universality!<br/><br/>Class 3C is a toroidal spaceship with the top of the 6x6 tile grid wrapping around to the bottom and the left side wrapping around to the right. Since lasers require an empty space in front of them &ndash; and engines an empty space behind them &ndash; your ship must have holes in it to accomodate those building requirements, and the larger and more numerous the holes, the more you must pay in insurance costs prior to launching your spaceship.<br/><br/>Class 4C has space to build four separate spaceships, but when the sand timer is flipped the first time, someone rolls a die and players can now build in additional areas of the game board in order to connect some of the ships. When the sand timer is flipped a second time, the die is rolled once more, possibly providing additional building sites.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Teotihuacan is expanding into an empire! The city is growing beyond its old borders, military expeditions project its influence all the way to the Yucatan Peninsula. Fighting men become settlers, new resources are discovered, and the wealth brought by obsidian draws in new discoveries.<br/><br/>Teotihuacan: Expansion Period is a modular expansion for Teotihuacan: City of Gods. It introduces several new options to enrich and expand the game experience.<br/><br/>Obsidian &mdash; a new, &quot;wild&quot; resource in the game, more powerful than others, used for special actions in other modules, as well as for faster gameplay, added onto the new resource collection action boards.<br/><br/>Mansion &mdash; a new action board is added to the game to replace the Palace board, providing new options to climb temples and power up your workers.<br/><br/>Altars and Shamans &mdash; this module adds a whole new dimension to the game. Previously empty spaces between Action Boards are now dedicated to Altars, home to Shamans &mdash; new game pieces which move counter-clockwise and perform their own set of powerful actions.<br/><br/>Expanding the Empire &mdash; the new Empire board comes with a wealth of opportunities, while integrating perfectly with the base game. The new Conquest board, compatible with previous expansions, allows players to use warriors to reach new lands and then turn them into settlers to advance on the Avenue of the Dead.<br/><br/>Advanced Teotibot &mdash; new functionalities for Teotibot, your solo opponent, make it compatible with all new content.<br/><br/>... and more! Major Discoveries are added to the game, more powerful than regular Discovery tiles, but more difficult to come by. Special mask tiles which enable collecting sets consisting of up to 11 masks! More Priests and Priestesses, a new Season tile, new Technology tiles, Starting tiles, and Royal tiles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Not only that, but the magnetically attached box covers are removable, with the reverse of each functioning as the Killer and Location boards respectively.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Evermore have they walked the world of Iwari. Evermore have they embodied its spirit and shaped its lands. They are stewards of the earth. Five Titans that make the cosmos breath. On Iwari, there are no teeming masses, no continent-wide civilizations. Humanity is in its infancy, living in scattered tribes in forest, tundra, and desert.<br/><br/>Now we have left our ancestral homelands to explore the vast uncharted regions, encountering other fellow tribes and exchanging knowledge, culture and wisdom. In our journey, we all live in harmony with the Titans, and though distant to us, they decide our fate. And yet only we don't know if they created us, or we created them.<br/><br/>Iwari is an abstract-like Eurogame in which players represent different tribes looking for their identity by traveling around far lands and expanding their settlements into five different regions on the board. In the game, players use cards for two different actions:<br/><br/>1) Place tents and expand their settlements into five different regions on the board in a majority game that scores on each territory.<br/>2) Construct nature totems to bond with the Titans by placing them on regions and score points based on the totem majorities in adjacent territories.<br/><br/>During the game, players can complete missions that grant small perks and score points by having the majority of tents in each territory after the end of the first card cycle. At game end, the majority of tents will be scored again, along with the majorities of nature totems in two adjacent regions and settlements that players have created (i.e., four or more tents in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board).<br/><br/>Iwari reimagines the award-winning game Web of Power by Michael Schacht by adding new layers of strategy, tribe player boards, different maps with their own set of rules, modules that can be added to the game, and unique co-operative and solo modes.<br/><br/><br/>Additional content in Deluxe Edition:<br/><br/>     1 Double-sided game board: &quot;The Forgotten Islands&quot; and &quot;The Void&quot;<br/>     2 New maps: &quot;The Uncharted Paths&quot; and &quot;The Long Road&quot;<br/>     8 Plastic void totems<br/>     21 Silkscreen printing wooden void ruins<br/>     12 Void cards<br/>     Solo mode rules (separate rulebook)<br/>     10 Double-sided solo mode tokens<br/>     4 Mountains<br/>     Co-op Rules<br/>     16 Expedition cards<br/>     1 Feat: Courage<br/>     The Eagle pawn to use for the Feats: &quot;Complacency&quot; and &quot;Worship&quot;<br/>     2 Icebergs<br/><br/><br/>",

This edition will include the &amp;Cetera expansion, so the game can be played with up to six players and you will get all the additional modules of &amp;Cetera included in the game. There are no other changes to the game.<br/><br/>In Roads & Boats, each player builds a civilization over a long period of time, as in many other games. Unlike most games, however, the emphasis is not on warfare, population growth, city or statebuilding, but on logistics, or rather on transport. Each player starts the game with three donkeys, a pile of wooden boards, a number of stones, and two geese. With these few resources, you try to build such diverse things as woodcutters, roads, boats, mines, a stock exchange... but beware! There is no concept of territory in this game! You cannot own land, nor buildings, so the things you build can be used by any other player...<br/><br/>The original game can be played by two to four players, but it can also be used as a one-person puzzle.<br/><br/>&amp;Cetera adds new buildings, new goods, new land types, new transporters, new ways to win, and new strategies. It also includes 24 new scenarios and material to play with five or six players. &amp; Cetera contains all the rules and material previously published as Planes &amp; Trains, plus a lot more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Pulsar is a rotating neutron star, born from a collapsing Supernova. Its regular pulse can help with your tactical timing.<br/><br/>The expansion contains two Pulsar sector hexes and one Nova Burst Discovery Tile.<br/><br/>The two Pulsar hexes are shuffled with the other Outer Sector hexes before building the Outer Sector stack. The Discovery Tile is Shuffled with the other Discovery Tiles.<br/><br/>When you place your Influence Disc on the hex (when Exploring or later on with the Influence action), place the disc on the Move action space on the hex. Once per round, you may activate the Pulsar instead of taking a normal Action. When activating the Pulsar, move the Influence Disc to either of the two free action spaces (for example, from the Move action to the Build or Upgrade action) and take that action. The actions are weaker versions of the regular actions (one Move, one Build, one Upgrade), same as the normal Reactions. The Pulsar may not be used after you have passed. You may not place more than one Influence Disc on the Pulsar.<br/><br/>When you collect the Nova Burst tile, place it next to your Player Board. The Nova Burst may be activated by removing the tile from the game before the battle begins or at any time during a battle when it is your turn in Initiative order. This causes 1 damage to every opposing Ship in the battle. The tile is worth 1VP if still held at the end of the game. The Magellan do not receive their species bonus for the Nova Burst if it is removed from the game.<br/><br/>",

Once an ecological power plant has been added to the power plant market, it will not be put on the bottom of the deck even if it is the highest plant - the highest non-green plant is put on the bottom instead. The two cities of Montreal and Qu&eacute;bec City offer several cheap connections, making this map challenging with several layers of decisions for building the best networks.<br/><br/>In Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, the clocks move differently: The main change focuses on the order of phases of a game round. First, you buy power plants, then you rearrange the player order. Furthermore, as this province is small, several transregional locations may only be connected once Phase 2 begins.<br/><br/>Only a single printing of Power Grid: Qu&eacute;bec &amp; Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg will be produced, although the Qu&eacute;bec map will remain available in M&eacute;gawatts.<br/><br/>Incorporates maps from:<br/><br/>    Mégawatts<br/>    Funkenschlag: EnBW<br/><br/><br/>",

The mystique, incredible courage, and tragic flaws of the Japanese soldier are vividly portrayed in the tense, exciting games of simulated man-to-man combat which only Up Front presents in such panoramic splendor.<br/><br/>Owners of Up Front will find the game system extensions included herein to be the ultimate of simplicity and convenience; while adding rich detail to the portrayal of the Japanese and British nationalities, as well as accounting for American marines. Twelve new scenarios depict not only typical SW Pacific encounters, but allow more variations for Up Front's existing European scenarios as the British take on the Germans, or the Russians test the Japanese in Manchuria. Several new scenario types list European variations, thus expanding the scope of Up Front's possible encounters. And of course, the complicated T. O. &amp; E. and capabilities of the new nationalities have been distilled into the eminently playable Personnel cards of the Up Front game system.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Rule Book (Contains 12 Scenarios)<br/>63 Counters<br/>60 Personel Cards<br/>20 AFV Cards<br/><br/>",

Now the peace of a century has turned to conflict as the forces of Westlock carve out their own territories for the good of the crown and the glory of Asyra.<br/><br/>In the Mage Wars: Conquest of Kumanjaro - Spell Tome Expansion, players can wage their own matches as a Priest of the Order of Malakai or as a Beastmaster of the Johktari, using new ability cards for each, and a trove of new spells from all the spell schools.<br/><br/>The Johktari Beastmaster is a fierce and proud hunter, defending her people's lands against invaders. She is a skilled archer and has the Ranged +1 trait for all of her non-spell ranged attacks. She can also sprint quickly across the vast savannahs running swift as a Cheetah using her Sprinting ability which gives this Mage the Fast trait. If these abilities weren't deadly enough, the Johktari Beastmaster can use her Wounded Prey ability to mark and relentlessly pursue wounded prey, working with her animals to finish it off.<br/><br/>The Priest of Malakai is a crusader against non-believers. He seeks justice and relentlessly pursues enemies with Holy retribution. The Priest is blessed with the burning light of Malakai, and his basic melee attack deals light damage. In addition, once per round, if the Priest attacks and damages an enemy creature with any attack which deals light damage, the creature may burst into flame via Malakai's Fire. To round out the divine might of this Mage is his Holy Avenger ability.<br/><br/>A few of the creatures in this expansion, such as the Guardian Angel, are ready to defend their Mage at any cost and thus introduce the Intercept ability which allows them to jump in the way of ranged attacks if they are on guard. The set also introduces three new conditions: Bleed, Stuck, and Tainted.<br/><br/>",

This king was anointed as prophet, priest, and ruler by the gods themselves, and charged with maintaining Ma&rsquo;at, cosmic balance and order, over the land of Egypt and its people. The right of law, the right of rule, the right of war, and of judgment were granted to the Pharaoh, and in his wisdom and with the gods&rsquo; guidance, Egypt prospered.<br/><br/>When the war of the gods began, each deity sought the Pharaoh&rsquo;s support. Who better to champion their cause than the very mortal they had endowed with such powers? Yet, such a decision would upend Ma&rsquo;at and throw the cosmic order into chaos. With the very sagacity granted to him by the gods, the Pharaoh declared that one man alone, however exalted, could not decide the war by fiat alone. The Pharaoh would watch, protect the people against the war&rsquo;s worst depredations, and maintain Ma&rsquo;at through the transition to monotheism while honoring all gods equally.<br/><br/>Thus, the Pharaoh balances the needs of the gods with the political and social needs of mortalkind. The battle in heaven shall not overflow into a civil war on earth, not so long as the Pharaoh still draws breath.<br/><br/>The Pharaoh expansion introduces a whole new dimension to Ankh: Gods of Egypt. This expansion brings the divine struggle closer to the world of men, and one man in particular: the Pharaoh of all Egypt! The gods will do well to send their priests into the royal palace in order to influence the affairs of the kingdom, manipulating the different offices in order to gain political advantage and steer the Pharaoh towards recognizing the ultimate divinity of the one true god. Your struggle may be divine, but if you fail to enforce your dominance over the human sphere of affairs, all that awaits you is oblivion.<br/><br/>The Pharaoh expansion comes with:<br/><br/>31 figures:<br/>- 1 Golden Pharaoh figure<br/>- 3 Ra Priest figures<br/>- 3 Isis Priest figures<br/>- 3 Amun Priest figures<br/>- 3 Osiris Priest figures<br/>- 3 Anubis Priest figures<br/>- 3 Horus Priest figures<br/>- 3 Hathor Priest figures<br/>- 3 Set Priest figures<br/>- 3 Thoth Priest figures<br/>- 3 Bastet Priest figures<br/>1 Palace dashboard<br/>5 Sphinx tokens<br/>4 Sphinx cards<br/>40 Political cards<br/>1 Rules Booklet<br/>Additionally, Kickstarter backers also get 5 Kickstarter Exclusive 3D sculpted plastic Sphinx pieces, as well as a Kickstarter Exclusive deluxe Palace Board printed on thick cardboard.<br/><br/>",

Such was the nature of a divine existence.<br/><br/>For the patron deities that grant them succor, these Guardians ply their talents in their patrons&rsquo; names, adding to their grandeur and protecting their devoted followers as their own. Serving the mighty was their truest path to enduring this war to end all wars.<br/><br/>The Guardians Set introduces a new set of Guardians ready to join the gods in their quest. Most of the Guardians contained in this set are terrible demons with vicious abilities the gods would much rather have at their side than used against them. The introduction of new Guardians into the game gives new options to select from, increasing the possibilities for different combinations and interactions for each game. The presence or absence of each Guardian can have a profound impact on the gameplay dynamics.<br/><br/>The Guardians Set comes with:<br/><br/>11 Guardian figures:<br/>-3 Mafdet figures<br/>-2 Am-Heh figures<br/>-2 Pazuzu figures<br/>-2 Ammit figures<br/>-2 Shezmu figures<br/>5 Guardian cards<br/><br/>",

In the DC Comics Deck-Building Game: Crisis Expansion, you will face some of the most epic challenges, events, and destructive forces in the history of comic-dom &mdash; but this time, you won't be going in alone! The Crisis Expansion introduces co-operative gameplay and &quot;Impossible Mode&quot; for fans of either DC Comics Deck-Building Game. If you thought things were rough before, you ain't seen nothing yet!<br/><br/>The Crisis cards are for co-operative play only. Players must team up to overcome these challenging events. The gameplay you thought you knew will never be the same when these ongoing terrors hit the table. Work together to defeat all of the Super-Villains before time runs out! The eight original Super Heroes and 12 original Super-Villains from the first set have been reimagined for the ultimate co-operative showdown. Crisis mode uses eight team-themed Super Heroes, Impossible Super-Villains, and a set of 15 Crisis cards, though not all of them are used every game, so you never know what might come up next.<br/><br/>However, if you prefer to keep your deck-building competitive, the Crisis Expansion includes a set of six new Super Heroes and a slew of new main deck cards to keep your games as hard-fought as ever! Play Impossible Mode to make competitive play even more hardcore. Impossible Mode Super-Villains are much tougher than their lesser counterparts. You'll beg for mercy when you are subjected to their new First Appearance Attacks, and marvel at the rewards you reap for defeating them...which is not easy!<br/><br/>",

Also, the 8 new rooms can now be chosen secretly by the players so that you know only 4 of the 8 rooms that you will encounter in the dungeon. You&acute;ll have to build a fully polyvalent team to be able to survive the new surprises your opponent has in store for you.<br/><br/>New characters include: <br/>The paladin : Can transport 2 items. Can use also the Dragon Slayer sword and the fire protection shield.<br/>The Red Dragon : a strength 6 terror that just make ashes of you ! But he's too heavy to move and will bring 2 VP to the hero that kills him.<br/>The Ghost : He cannot transport anything but can go through all terrain elements.<br/>The Illusionist : He can create illusions of traps or boulder collapse to block his opponent or protect himself.<br/>The Weapon Master : He's a high level fighter very competent with all weapons. He has such experience that most of the time, he can predict the movements and attacks of his opponents.<br/>The golem : He's as slow as the troll, as strong as the troll but he cannot regenerate. However, he can smash down 3 walls during the game.<br/>The Elf Scout : He's the fastest character with his movement of 7 and his ability to jump over pits. His strength 1 is a real weakness though.<br/>The Pickpocket : He's specialized in stealing items from his opponent.<br/><br/>New Items include: The teleportation ring, the charm scroll, the fire protection shield,the key, the rope, the dragon slayer sword, etc.<br/><br/>New rooms include: The Fountain of Youth, the cliffs, the pentacle room, etc.<br/><br/>Expands<br/><br/>    Dungeon Twister<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shogun Big Box includes the base game of Shogun and its expansion Shogun: Tenno's Court, as well as three small modules: Samurai, Military Leaders and Chambers, with the latter two unique to this release.<br/><br/>With Samurai, each player receives a stack of cards showing progressively better bonuses. At the beginning of each round, if a player controls provinces in at least four regions, they reveal the next card in their stack and select one of the bonuses depicted on it. These bonuses include war chests, armies placed directly into the tower tray, rice and victory points.<br/><br/>With Military Leaders, every player is given one military leader figure to place on one of their controlled provinces. A player's leader provides extra benefits for performing actions in their province, such as reducing the cost for buildings or providing extra resources when collecting rice or taxes. At the end of a player's turn, they move their leader to an adjacent province they control and leave a marker at the old location - if they don't control any provinces adjacent to where their leader is, they move their leader to any of their controlled provinces without leaving a marker behind. The more markers a player has on the board at the end of the game, the more points will be awarded!<br/><br/>For Chambers, many offices have to be taken in order to rule the land. At the beginning of each round, six chamber markers are revealed and placed on the corresponding spaces on the chamber tableau, representing available offices that can be filled by the players. Whoever controls the most provinces in each region can fill the position by exchanging the chamber marker on the tableau with one of their own player markers. At the end of the game, players are awarded extra points for majorities in horizontal and vertical lines on the chamber tableau.<br/><br/>",

This sheet lists 9 special conditions that trigger 9 unique Memories &ndash; if you fulfill any condition during the game, you can mark it off and read an appropriate Memory from the &ldquo;Echoes of the Past&rdquo; brochure.<br/><br/>These memories have a small gameplay effect (sometimes positive, sometimes negative). But as you progress through the game, and your Character progresses in their story of self-discovery or reconciliation, you will also gain some interesting rewards.<br/><br/>Every time you complete a block of three achievements, you receive a Legendary Action card that you keep by your Character Board &ndash; you can use it once to perform a single action so epic that bards will sing stories about you in the years to come. Then, the Legendary Action card is discarded from the game.<br/><br/>If you manage to trigger ALL basic memories, you progress to the final, tenth entry in the brochure that contains a personal side-quest where your hero will confront their worst fears, weaknesses, or a personal nemesis. Should they emerge victoriously, they receive a special golden Legendary Action card that gives your character permanently a second gameplay action!<br/><br/>The sheets can be used as a legacy element, allowing your hero to start a new game with a part of their story and some Heroic Feats cards already unlocked.<br/><br/>Effectively, this add-on introduces interesting personal objectives for each of the characters, and a small legacy element, at the same time reinforcing the character backstories and providing a deeper look into the world of Tainted Grail.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>52 Legendary Action cards (4 for each of 13 Characters) <br/>52 Achievement Sheets (4 for each of 13 Characters) <br/>Echoes of the Past booklet (24 pages)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A true victory is to make your enemy see they were wrong to oppose you in the first place. To force them to acknowledge your greatness.&quot;<br/>-- Gul Dukat<br/><br/>In Star Trek: Ascendancy &ndash; Cardassian Union, the first player expansion for Star Trek: Ascendancy, your disciplined hand will guide the Cardassian civilization to galactic dominance. As the head of Central Command, conquer and occupy other worlds that hold the precious resources required to expand your rule; planting the flag of Cardassia Prime on the rubble of vanquished empires. Or demonstrate to your rivals that your ordered society is superior and set the Cultural example for the Galaxy.<br/><br/>Conquest and occupation drive the great engine of the Cardassian Union. This relentless hunger affects the Cardassian player&rsquo;s game in the form of two Special Rules displayed on the player&rsquo;s Control Console.<br/><br/>1) OCCUPATION<br/>Occupied worlds may not recognize the superiority of Cardassian rule however, but Cardassia knows that a firm hand must always be present to ensure compliance, represented by their Occupation rule. Cardassian Controlled Systems only generate production if there are Cardassian ships in orbit.<br/><br/>2) ANNEXATION<br/>Unrelenting war and invasion add to the glory of Cardassia under their Annexation rule. Take 1 Culture each time you successfully invade a planet.<br/><br/>The Cardassian player earns one Culture Token each time they successfully invade a planet.<br/><br/>The cards found in the Cardassian Advancement Deck reinforce their commitment to military might and the subversion of their enemies. The efficiency of Cardassian rule is immediately apparent with their Starting Advancement; Totalitarian Regime allows the Cardassian player to start the game with Six Command Tokens. Cardassian Labor Camps work in conjunction with their Occupation rule, allowing Cardassia to mine Production Tokens from their Culture Nodes to fuel their war machine. While crude by the standards of other civilizations, the Cardassians clever use of Gravitic-based technology allows them to scan their space using a Gravitic Sensor Net countering the advantage of rivals who employ Romulan Cloaking Technology.<br/><br/>Large formations of Cardassian Starships are ideal for conquest, but Cardassia also makes strategic use of smaller formations to attack their foes. Hunter Killer Fleets are designed to exploit a target&rsquo;s weakness; in the first round of a Space Battle, each ship in the Fleet automatically Scores a Hit. This small formation will likely be broken up in the first round of the battle, but its impact can be devastating, especially if used in conjunction with a larger formation.<br/><br/>The addition of the Cardassian Union to the game puts the Federation, Klingons and Romulans on notice that their worlds and territories are no longer safe.<br/><br/>",

The new Tyranid deck contains a variety of enemies to challenge even the most seasoned Space Marines, while the Hive Lord Location cards introduce the Tyranid&rsquo;s epic and deadly overlords!<br/><br/>Not only is the new enemy deck chocked full of Tyranid baddies, but many of them are Elite Tyranids, equipped with deadly special abilities that trigger at different points within the turn sequence. The unpredictable nature of these enemies makes it even harder to coordinate your strategies, creating tenser moments as you make your way to the final location.<br/><br/>Speaking of final locations, the new Hive Lord cards in the Tyranid Enemy Pack offer an even greater challenge for the bravest combat teams.

Originally, It is available only in the 5/2005 issue of spielbox (this is the Essen SPIEL edition, as the magazine is (nearly) bimonthly). In 2006, the Dutch company 999 Games gave it away as an extra to those people who bought all scenarios in 999 Games' Six Scenarios series.<br/><br/>Also given as an insert in Games Quarterly magazine, Spring 2007, Issue 12.  This edition is published by Mayfair Games, Inc. and is the only one printed fully in English.<br/><br/>The June 2006, No28 issue of the French game magazine Jeux sur un Plateau includes an insert of this expansion, printed on a thick paper.<br/><br/>Lastest publishing was in 2007 as inclusion in Catan: Traders and Barbarians (with slightly expanded rules in comparison to spielbox edition).<br/><br/>The expansion is about fishermen. Some of the sea tiles of the base game are transformed into Fishing Grounds. These Fishing Grounds produce resources in a way similar to regular tiles.<br/><br/>Instead of Resource Cards, Fishing Grounds provide Fish Tiles. Fish Tiles can be worth one, two or three fish.<br/><br/>During his turn, a player can spend fish to get a special benefit:<br/>2 fish: The player may move the robber back into the desert (he/she may not steal a card from another player who owns a settlement / town at the desert).<br/>3 fish: The player may steal a raw material card from another player.<br/>4 fish: The player may take any one raw material from the bank.<br/>5 fish: The player may build a street immediately.<br/>7 fish: The player receives a development card for free.<br/><br/>In addition to fish, a player can also catch an old shoe. As long as a player has the old shoe in his possession, he needs one more point to win the game than usual. He can get rid of the old shoe by giving it to someone with the same number of points or more points than himself.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    CATAN<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forgotten Souls is a new cooperative adventure, allowing up to four heroes to play a fully cooperative variant of Descent: Journeys in the Dark. In a normal game of Descent, one player takes the role of overlord, commanding monsters and the forces of evil in the game. Up to four players combat the power of the overlord by playing heroes who gain experience and new items over the course of a campaign.<br/><br/>Forgotten Souls changes the normal structure of Descent by emulating a mini campaign in a completely cooperative atmosphere. Although this expansion does not replace the normal game of Descent, it offers a variant for you and your friends to explore an expanding dungeon, passing tests and battling fierce monsters. Encounters and monsters are controlled by decks of cards, rather than the overlord in Forgotten Souls. You&rsquo;ll also grab loot and experience as you face down a series of encounters, culminating in a battle in the heart of the dragon&rsquo;s lair. Enter the darkness within Forgotten Souls!<br/><br/>In the cooperative variant of Descent, the overlord&rsquo;s objective is replaced by the overlord track. A doom token and a fate token are placed at opposite ends of the overlord track, and you lose if the doom and fate tokens ever meet on the overlord track. Doom is an inescapable force that slowly progresses when the heroes fail encounters and in other ways. Fate, on the other hand, is a fluctuating force that the heroes affect both positively and negatively based on their progress. For example, whenever a hero is knocked out, fate advances by one, but by successfully completing a main encounter, you may be able to reset fate to its starting point.<br/><br/>Note: Forgotten Souls was originally released as part of the 2014 Season One Game Night Kit with various accessories, including a poster, play mats, acrylic tokens, and translucent dice.<br/><br/>The Game Night Kit came with a paper rulebook, whereas players must reference or print an online PDF with the retail edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Star Trek: Ascendancy &ndash; Ferengi Alliance is an expansion for Star Trek: Ascendancy.<br/><br/>In the second player expansion for Star Trek: Ascendancy your financial acumen guides the growth of the Ferengi Alliance from the Tower of Commerce. As the leading business authority it&rsquo;s your duty to seek out opportunity, exploit new customers and grow the bottom line until your economy dwarfs the so-called &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of other civilizations. Beyond that, a flotilla of Marauders, commanded by profit-hungry DaiMons, stand ready to enforce your mergers and acquisitions across the quadrant.<br/><br/>To a Ferengi, profit is everything and the special rules for the Ferengi player reinforce that.<br/><br/>1) PROFIT OVER PROFUNDITY<br/>The Ferengi may never build Culture Nodes. Ferengi never add their Ascendancy level to Hegemony attempts.<br/><br/>2) ONLY LATINUM LASTS<br/>During your Build Phase, the Ferengi may buy Culture for 5 Production each. The Ferengi may build Production Nodes on any available spot regardless of Capacity type.<br/><br/>Other Civilizations devote tremendous resources to scientific and cultural advancements whereas the Ferengi add to the wisdom that has guided their civilization for centuries, the venerated Rules of Acquisition. The very first Grand Nagus set down these guiding principals over ten thousand years ago and each Nagus in succession has been adding to these rules to guide each Ferengi transaction to maximum profitability. The Starting Advancement establishes the Ferengi Commerce Authority, whose agents and liquidators enforce Ferengi Trade Bi-Laws, uphold the Ferengi Bill of Opportunities and ensure that all transactions within the Alliance are true to the Rules of Acquisition. In the game, the FCA allows the Ferengi player to earn 1 Production for each rival Controlled System that has a Ferengi Ship in Orbit. Rule #45 Expand or Die permits the Ferengi to pay the Culture costs of Hegemony and Colonization by paying 2 Production per Culture required. Rule #34 War Is Good For Business allows you to profit from the combative nature of rival species by generating one Production for the Ferengi each time some aggressive ally let their trigger finger do their negotiating instead of their diplomats.<br/><br/>Ferengi DaiMons generally strike out on their own for individual profit, but at the behest of their Nagus, they will group their Marauders into larger formations to seek profit and enforce Ferengi trade laws. One such formation is the Commerce Enforcement Squadron, an elite group of Liquidators and Auditors whose authority allow them to enter Systems containing rival Starships in order to ensure that best trade practices are being observed. Of course, opportunity can pop up at any moment, so the authority of an Enforcement Squadron allows them to enter Warp during the Ferengi turn without exhausting a Command to do so.<br/><br/>The arrival of the Ferengi Alliance finally shifts the balance of the game away from the foolish ideals of Cultural Advancement or the barbaric need for military conquest and puts the focus squarely on the most important issue facing the Galaxy, personal financial gain.<br/><br/>",

A ghastly green mist soon shrouded the island, wrapping it in a ghostly silence pierced only by a maniacal laughter and some intermittent curses. Then, one moonlit night, an impossibly crooked tower emerged high above the mist, casting a long and dark shadow on the surrounding land... The Necromancer had arrived!<br/><br/>In Necromancer Island, one of the players assumes the role of a dreaded Necromancer who inhabits an island in the center of Small World's central Lake region. He captures the souls of all Race tokens lost to conquests, using them to progressively spawn Ghosts who invade the surrounding Regions. To make matters worse, his Powers grow as his reach across the land increases. If the Necromancer succeeds in bringing all of his Ghosts into play, anytime before the game's end, he wins!<br/><br/>",

Erik Killmonger&rsquo;s oath of vengeance against the Wakandan king&rsquo;s bloodline has fallen on T&rsquo;Challa, the current Black Panther. Not content to simply eliminate the Black Panther and his allies, Killmonger wishes to seize Wakanda for himself.

Shuri&rsquo;s weapons and gadgets can turn the tide in any battle, and no one knows more about fighting a subversive campaign than the Winter Soldier. Yet, even this formidable trio will be hard-pressed to prevent Killmonger&rsquo;s master plan.<br/><br/>As the war for the heart of Wakanda unfolds, only the most skilled and most daring will rise in defense of the throne!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>A strange curse taints everything. It clings to the flesh and lingers within the lungs, a poison that destroys the soul while leaving the body to shamble on. A small settlement of the damned has formed near the border, a collection of unfortunate trespassers now unable to leave the accursed land. You have joined their number, but not their despair. Ready your gear and bolster your courage; your journey into the Mistlands is about to begin.<br/><br/>Venture into the Mistlands of Terrinoth in Mists of Bilehall, a new expansion for Descent: Journeys in the Dark! A full, one-act campaign is included in this expansion, chronicling the heroes&rsquo; adventures and the dark deeds perpetrated in this misty realm. What&rsquo;s more, no new heroes or hero classes are included in this Descent expansion: instead, Mists of Bilehall has been configured to enhance the power of the overlord. To that end, your army swells with twelve sculpted plastic figures &ndash; six reanimates, three broodwalkers, and three bone horrors. The very ground may give way beneath the heroes with the introduction of old walls and crumbling terrain, while the evil of Bilehall influences the heroes through the introduction of tainted cards. Even the doughtiest heroes will be hard-pressed to survive in this land of mist and half-truths. Enter Waiqar's domain in Mists of Bilehall!<br/><br/>",

There is no capital city to start from. Land colonists are built only later in the game, but can switch their position between the islands.<br/><br/>As an extra, Concordia: Balearica comes with a fishmarket. The fish market may be combined not only with the new BALEARICA map, but also used as a variant together with the base game or any other CONCORDIA map.<br/><br/>As a new commodity, fish replace the ordinary bonus units you usually collect when playing your Prefect. The bonus is doubled up to 2 fish in provinces that have failed to produce in the last round. Sell your fish on a separate fishmarket, where you can get either goods, cash, or special actions in return. This way the fishmarket offers an extra layer of planning ahead and new challenges for the experienced CONCORDIA player.<br/><br/>The opposite side of this board has the CYPRUS map for all who have missed it when buying Concordia: Venus (Expansion).<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The other players will select a white answer card from the 10 in their hand that they think best or most humorously fits the question/statement.  The Card Czar will then shuffle the answers and choose the one they like best, with that answer's owner receiving the black card as his &quot;awesome point&quot; for winning the round.<br/><br/>Once a player has at least one awesome point, they can wager an awesome point when giving a white answer card in order to throw in a second answer card, giving that player a better chance to be chosen.  The winner of the round will receive the original black card as well as any that are wagered in that round.<br/><br/>Play continues until a pre-determined score is reached, or until everyone is tired from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>This expansion adds 20 black question/statement cards and 80 white answer cards to the deck as well as 12 blank cards for players to come up with their own card ideas.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Baseball Highlights: 2045 is like watching TV highlights of early 21st-century baseball games, with the gameplay being full of theme with no outs or innings and without bogging down in a play-by-play baseball simulation. In this quick and interactive game, two players build their teams as they play, combining both strategy (building your team) and tactics (playing the game) without any of the downtime. During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both? Players buy new free agents after each mini-game to improve their roster, and the team who wins the most mini-games in the series is the champ!<br/><br/>The deluxe edition of Baseball Highlights: 2045 comes with all five initial expansions (Coaches, Rally Cap, Hitters, Pitchers, Magna Glove) already included.<br/><br/>",

Though the Z-95 was later outclassed by the X-wing in most respects, it could perform a tighter turn and was cheap, durable, and reliable enough that the Rebel Alliance continued to make use of it throughout the Galactic Civil War, most commonly in close air support roles.<br/><br/>The Z-95 Headhunter enters the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game as the Rebel starfighter with the lowest squad point cost. None of the four ship cards in the Z-95 Headhunter Expansion Pack weigh in at more than nineteen squad points, and at just twelve points, the Bandit Squadron Pilot ties the Imperial's Academy Pilot as the starfighter with the game's lowest point cost value. However, the Z-95 Headhunter isn't designed to fly like a TIE fighter; it comes, instead, with the focus and target lock actions, as well as the ability to load and fire a missile. Accordingly, the Z-95 Headhunter Expansion Pack comes with two missile upgrades, the Assault Missiles and the deadly Ion Pulse Missiles.<br/><br/>Altogether, the Z-95 Headhunter Expansion Pack includes one Z-95 miniature, four ship cards, five upgrade cards, one maneuver dial, and all the tokens necessary to bring your Z-95 Headhunter to battle!<br/><br/>",

This new board provides new challenges and requires new ways of thinking. The new gameboard is arranged portrait-style rather than the landscape orientation of the original, and the five roads have been replaced by a network of intersecting and overlapping roads, so you can continue on a different color or even choose which way to go. The point values also change during your way, not simply increasing.<br/>Also  you have 5 cairns on the board, with each cairn having a stack of five stones in a particular color. When you reach a spot on that track, you claim the top stone. Stones of all five colors are awarded 10 points; collecting three stones of the same color is also worth 10 points, too.<br/><br/>This expansion is included in the 2012 edition of Keltis.<br/><br/>",

However, some of them have seen the value of cooperating towards a common goal, and those villains have joined forces, even at cross purposes, to defeat the heroes who have harried them for so long.<br/><br/>Some of these villains, such as Plague Rat or Biomancer, are more hesitant to work with other villains, whereas others, such as Citizens Hammer &amp; Anvil or Sergeant Steel, are more than happy to join forces with other like-minded combatants.<br/><br/>Villains of the Multiverse is a collection of ten super-powered villains for Sentinels of the Multiverse, and rather than being standalone villains, they work as part of a team of villains in the play style introduced in Sentinels of the Multiverse: Vengeance to group villains together as a team fighting against the hero team.

Jack Weyland wants to take us to the stars, but what will be the human cost of his efforts? Order and Chaos, the third deluxe expansion for Android: Netrunner, pits three new subversive Anarchs against the bleeding edge ice and operations with which the Weyland Consortium intends to safeguard its most far-sighted and futuristic ambitions.<br/> Its 165 new cards (three copies each of fifty-five individual cards) amplify the high-stakes cyberstruggles between the developers at Weyland Consortium and those destructive Anarchs who would rather see the corporation&rsquo;s utopian ambitions reduced to ashes than raised to the heavens upon the backs of the downtrodden. Accordingly, you'll find a slate of new identities, tech, and tools that enhance these factions' core strengths, even as they permit the exploration of new themes and decks. The Weyland Consortium gains a host of new, advanceable ice, as well as new strategies for protecting their agendas and assets while raking in bundles of quick credits. Anarchs, on the other hand, unleash a plethora of destructive new programs and resources that can tear apart anything a Corp can put together, whether they use them to further their humanitarian efforts or simply vent the pent-up rage of a disenfranchised youth.<br/><br/>Finally, Order and Chaos presents fans of every faction with six different neutral cards that they can use to safeguard their servers, evade tags, and advance their economies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The sorceress Ariad once more schemes to conquer Terrinoth with the Caught in a Web Scenario Pack. Now, she commands her arachnid minions to spread insidiously throughout the realm, spinning webs, injecting venom, and preparing for their mistress to cover the world in darkness.<br/><br/>As we mentioned above, Caught in a Web is a Scenario Pack that introduces an entirely new scenario to Runebound. Throughout the course of this scenario , story cards and adventure cards will cause webs to be placed across the map. These webs restrict the heroes&rsquo; movement, but they can be destroyed if you&rsquo;re willing to expend the effort. At the end of the first act, the sorceress Ariad transforms into her spider form and begins to move around the realm. If she places a web in each of the four major cities, all of the heroes lose the game. The only way you can win is by tracking down Ariad and defeating her in battle before another hero can reach her!<br/><br/>Along the way, you&rsquo;ll find yourself face-to-face with new and hideous monsters or terrifying perils. You may encounter an Arachyura , a spider-like creature that can trap you in its webs and deal lingering damage even after it&rsquo;s defeated. You may track a nest of spiders to the Smokeblue Hills, or delve deep into tunnels that riddle the ground beneath Terrinoth. Fortunately, a new hero also arrives to save Terrinoth with this expansion: Jonas the Kind. Jonas possesses many unexpected skills learned in a life of crime, but now he uses those same skills to defend the innocent from monsters.<br/><br/>",

One day, while walking to the gas station to buy a lottery ticket working with his favorite charity &quot;Toupees for Bald Eagles&quot;, Joe heard a shout. He looked up in time to see the underside of a piano growing closer at an alarming rate a radical fighter jet sky-writing his name. &quot;This is going to hurt...&quot; was the last thing Joe thought. Unbeknownst to either Joe or the people moving the piano, the hero team known as the Freedom Five and the cosmic entity known as the Wager Master had recently fought on the very sidewalk Joe was now splattered across. Joe's organic matter was now mixed with particles of improbability, which bonded and reformed into BLAH BLAH BLAH, could this be any more boring?! Just think of a badass training montage and put me in there.<br/><br/>Hey there, faithful reader! Yeah, you. The one reading this right now. I'm Guise, and I'm talking to you. What's so hard to understand about this? Anyway, now that you know my totally sweet backstory, let's talk about what we're going to do. We're going to fight EEEEEEEVIL! You get your friends together, and you pick your heroes, and BE SURE TO PICK ME! I can't help if I don't get cards on the table, but &mdash; and you can trust me on this one &mdash; I am awesome.<br/><br/>Yeah, that sure slowed him down. Heh, these villains aren't going to know what hit them. That is, as long as you do YOUR part and PLAY MY CARDS! I mean, how could you not?

This expansion adds seven heroes, thirteen village cards, five monster groups, one treasure set, three settings, three guardians and one thunderstone.<br/><br/>No new rules or mechanisms are added in Thunderstone: Heart of Doom, but the many unique card abilities add and change typical deck-building strategies. Notable additions include cards that enable the obtaining of heroes and items while in the dungeon (including the Village Cutpurse, Gem Treasures and Highland Captain), monsters that add additional ranks to the dungeon (Dryads) and the Doppleganger monsters, which imitate villagers and mercenaries, with potentially deadly results!<br/><br/>Additionally, players can fight the final battle to seal the rift and save the world, with the &quot;Rite of Banishing&quot; setting that pits them against the incredibly powerful &quot;Heart of Doom&quot; guardian.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCard Types<br/><br/><br/>    <br/>        Thunderstone<br/><br/>        Village<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Stone of Fate<br/><br/>        Bag of Holding<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/><br/>        Belzur's Blessing<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Monsters<br/><br/>        Chalice Mace<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Abyssal - Darkspawn<br/><br/>        Dredging Net<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Basilisk - Animal<br/><br/>        Grognard<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Doppelganger - Humanoid<br/><br/>        Jondul Bow<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Dryad<br/><br/>        Magma Hammer<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Lizardfolk - Humanoid<br/><br/>        Ritual of Cleansing<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Spider - Animal<br/><br/>        Short Spear<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Undead - Spectral<br/><br/>        Soulfire<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/><br/>        Swamp Provisions<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Heroes<br/><br/>        Village Thief<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Bluefire<br/><br/>        War Hero<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Canon<br/><br/>        <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Dark<br/><br/>        Settings<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Highland<br/><br/>        Last Refuge<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Isri<br/><br/>        Mournwater Swamp<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Jondul<br/><br/>        Rite of Banishing<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Nyth<br/><br/>        <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/><br/>        Guardians<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Special<br/><br/>        Heart of Doom<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        Sorcerer's Treasures<br/><br/>        The Last Doomknight<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>        <br/><br/>        Mournwater Witch<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

But peace, like almost all things of this world, has its price, a high but a measurable one. We in Poland do not know the concept of peace at any price. There is only one thing in the lives of men, nations and countries that is without price. That thing is honour.&rdquo; - Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs J&oacute;zef Beck, 5th of May, 1939<br/><br/>September 1st, 1939. Germany invades Poland in the early morning hours. The Germans employ highly mobile massed tank formations, closely supported by mobile artillery and their airforce - the Luftwaffe. The world would come to know this warfare as the &ldquo;Blitzkrieg&rdquo;. As the Polish forces are being driven back, they are ordered to mass together near the Romanian border, where they will try to hold out until the Allies invade Germany from the West. But then the Soviets surprise attack the Poles from the East, cutting through their weakly defended border and fullfilling their secret pact with Germany to split Poland between their two nations.<br/><br/>Price of Honour, is an expansion game which requires either of the award winning games - Awakening the Bear! and/or Storms of Steel!<br/>Players are presented with the same tactical dilemmas and decisions that commanders faced during some of the most ferocious engagements of WWII.<br/>Conflict of Heroes (CoH) follows the evolution of modern tactics, from WWII to the present.

Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek their luck in distant lands.<br/><br/>In Village, each player takes the reins of a family and attempts to help them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone, and given enough time people will vanish. Those who find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.<br/><br/>In more detail, each turn you take a cube from an area on the game board, then take the action of that area. The board has zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house, and each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors as well as black cubes that serve as curses. Many of these areas offer multiple actions, so if for example you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, or a scroll, or you can convert wheat to gold. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only endgame scoring. The round ends when no cubes remain at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.<br/><br/>Village: Big Box contains the Village base game, the Inn and Port expansions, every promo previously released, and a new &quot;Marriage&quot; expansion, with all of the materials being integrable with one another and with the game now containing a solo mode as well as revised gameplay, dual-layered player boards, and a larger, double-sided main board that eliminates the need for the overlays used in the original expansions.<br/><br/>",

Historical figures tend to be somewhat fickle.<br/><br/>Figures includes 105 figure cards, with the cards being similar to Innovation cards in that they're divided into ten ages with five colors of cards in each age. Instead of including a dogma power that players can use on their turn, each card in Figures has a karma that changes the game in some way. Karmas might take effect when you meld a card, when you're counting icons to determine whether you can share an action, or when you take some other action in the game. Instead of melding a card, for example, you might score it, or instead of giving cards to opponents who demand from you, you might return cards to the age decks.<br/><br/>Innovation: Figures in the Sand includes five Decree cards, one for each color. Decrees are a special type of achievement, but unlike all other achievements Decrees are not safe and can be stolen.<br/><br/>A player can have only one Figure in play after any action in the game; any additional Figures Fade from play, moving to your score pile.<br/><br/>Innovation: Figures in the Sand can be played with just the base game or combined with the Innovation: Echoes of the Past expansion.<br/><br/>",

The booze is flowing and the party has begun. Then comes a knock at the door. A quick glance around the room tells you everyone who's supposed to be here already is... You approach the door and slowly open it, peeking around the edge of the door. No one is there. But someone was... the question is, who?<br/><br/>What horror game would be complete without a home invasion? The Intruders are here. Face not one, not two, but THREE killers. You thought one was hard, but you&rsquo;re really going to have to stay on your toes against these murderous menaces.<br/><br/>Wingard Cottage offers a new challenge with unique events and a new crafting mechanism that lets you take ordinary items and turn them into epic weapons. Stick with that knife or scrounge up some wood and nails to craft The Obliterator? It will be up to you, just make the call before it is too late!<br/><br/>The Core Box, when combined with one of our Feature Film Boxes, has everything you need to play the game. Each Feature Film Box features a unique Killer and and iconic Location, and the more Feature Films you have, the more killer/location combinations you can experience!<br/><br/>Each Feature Film Box is double-sided, with amazingly illustrated covers on the front AND back. Not only that, but the magnetically attached box covers are removable, with the reverse of each functioning as the Killer and Location boards respectively.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Due to this alarming observation, Management has installed new security systems to dissuade any further dishonest deeds.<br/><br/>The Maximum Security expansion not only brings the mall guards of Magic Maze to life, but provides a number of other modules to allow you to customize your experience. There are two different types of modules: helpers and challenges, which decrease or increase the difficulty. You will be guided step by step through all of the modules, and each of them comes with a tutorial that will help you practise the new rules before adding it to your &quot;real&quot; games of Magic Maze.<br/><br/>Helpers:<br/>- Ventilation shafts: the dwarf can open ventilation shafts for all the heroes to move quickly from one end of it to the other.<br/>- Wall breaches: the barbarian can breach the walls of the mall for all the heroes to move through it.<br/>- Spells: the mage can cast 2 spells among 10 available, with instant or temporary effects.<br/>- Telekinesis: the elf can move Mall tiles around<br/>- Anti-stress tokens: you can use them at anytime to allow a discussion, swap Action tiles or flip the sand timer.<br/>- Maps &amp; Auto-explore spaces: explore the mall much quicker!<br/>- Control room: use that special space to send the guards to Vortex spaces.<br/><br/>Challenges:<br/>- Guard: a Hero and a Guard cannot stand or pass through a Mall tile where the other type of pawn is standing. You move the guards just like heroes.<br/>- Reinforcement guards: these extra guards are added when the theft is commited.<br/>- Guard room: if a Hero an a Guard are (by mistake) on the same tile, the hero gets caught and must be freed.<br/>- Beholder: a Hero and the Beholder cannot stand or pass through a Mall tile where the other type of pawn is standing. A hero must be standing on a Command space to move the Beholder.<br/>- Sensor: a Hero cannot stand on a space covered by the sensor. A hero must be standing on a Control space to rotate the sensor.<br/>- Locked escape: a Hero must be standing on a Code space for the dwarf to be able to escape.<br/><br/>All of these modules bring in more options to make Magic Maze a more intense and puzzling experience.<br/><br/>",

In addition to connecting cities and completing tickets in the usual way of other Ticket to Ride games, your routes can reach border crossings and thus connect neighboring countries. If you manage to create such a connection on your turn, say, building a track so that you have a connected line from Ukraine to Germany, you draw the top point card from the stack for each of these two countries. Their point value is arranged in descending order, which means that the players who are the first to draw cards receive more points. If you later connect this network to the Czech Republic, then you'd draw the top card from each of the three countries' card stacks &mdash; assuming that a country's cards haven't all been claimed, of course.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Russian Army is a Coalition expansion for Commands &amp; Colors Napoleonics.<br/><br/>Russia, was ruled until 1796 by Catherine the Great. It would then suffer under &quot;Mad&quot; Tsar Paul I, until his assassination in 1801, which brought his son Alexander I to the throne. Alexander, in command of a Russian army that was as vast as the territory from which it was drawn, did his best by various treaties and alliances to counter the increasing power of France under Napoleon without going to war.<br/><br/>The Russian army at the time of Napoleonic wars still had many characteristics of Peter the Great&rsquo;s regime; senior officers were largely recruited from aristocratic circles, and the Russian soldier was regularly beaten and punished to instill discipline. Furthermore, many lower-level officers were poorly trained. Yet the Russians involved in hostilities with its neighbors - Sweden, Poland, Turkey and Austria - were capable of astonishing feats and total, blind obedience to orders.<br/><br/>In 1805 Britain and Russia signed an alliance against France. In 1806, Prussia joined the Coalition and Prussia and Russia mobilized for a fresh campaign. After Napoleon&rsquo;s humiliation of Prussia at Jena, the French Emperor turned his attention to subduing his Russian foe and marched into Poland. After a series of sanguinary battles, the French drove Russian forces out of Poland back to Mother Russia and created a new Duchy of Warsaw, but made a solid treaty between the two nations at Tilsit.<br/><br/>In 1812, the Russo-French treaty gradually became strained, as the requirement of joining France's Continental Blockade against Great Britain was a serious disruption of Russian commerce. Bonaparte decided to bring the Russians back into line in June, and invaded Russia hoping to inflict a major defeat on the Russians and force Alexander to sue for peace. The invasion of Russia and the retreat of the French army, as many historians point out, proved to be the turning point in the Napoleonic Wars.<br/><br/>In 1813 Russia opened the campaign against Napoleon joined by Prussia and Austria, and during the three-day battle of Leipzig, Bonaparte's fate was sealed.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will find 18 historical scenarios that focus on the Russian Army battles from 1806 to 1814 against Napoleon, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.<br/><br/>- Richard Borg<br/><br/>",

They can be played individually or combined with any or all other expansions for the game. These expansions are:<br/><br/><br/>    4. The Wishing Well &ndash; Throw a coin into the wishing well and you will receive an extra benefit. You might find a purse in the theatre and receive a reward for its return, or a friendly marketer will present you an extra paint.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    5. The Gold Leaf &ndash; At some market booths you can receive gold leaf to intensify the shine of your paint. The bishop will be thrilled!<br/><br/><br/><br/>    6. The Glaziers &ndash; As an additional action, you can buy glass in different colors and build windows in the Cathedral. Even the plain-looking parts of the fresco will appear now in a dazzling light.<br/><br/><br/>",

Designed by Richard Launius (Arkham Horror, Elder Sign), Season of the Witch is a single-scenario expansion that sends players on a tense and terrifying race against the clock.<br/><br/>There are no new mechanics added in this expansion; it is purely an additional scenario for the base game that will use the modular board setup from Mansions of Madness.  The setup of this scenario will be dictated by the included event cards and reference sheets.<br/><br/>In this macabre game of horror, insanity, and mystery for two to five players, each game takes place within a pre-designed story that provides players with a unique map and several combinations of plot threads. These threads affect the monsters that investigators may encounter, the clues they need to find, and which climactic story ending they will ultimately experience. One player takes on the role of the keeper, controlling the monsters and other malicious powers within the story. The other players take on the role of investigators, searching for answers while struggling to survive with their minds intact.<br/> (Note: variations in printing mean that cards from Print on Demand expansions will be subtly different in appearance and texture from base game cards. Therefore, any necessary base game cards (such as the &ldquo;nothing of interest&rdquo; Exploration cards) will be reprinted in each expansion, to retain a consistent appearance when shuffled.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imperial Rome is the fourth expansion for Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients.<br/> By now, all of you that own this game have already discovered that Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients is an expandable game system. A game system that allows players to effectively portray stylized Ancient historical battles that play to a conclusion in less than an hour.<br/><br/>In this expansion we have taken the opportunity to present a number of battles that we just did not have room to include in prior expansions. The Romans fight in Britain at Medway 43AD, against Boudica at Watling Street 61 AD, and later at Mons Graupius 84AD. Antony and Octavian of the Second Triumvirate battle it out twice with Cassius and Brutus at Philippi 42BC. But the main focus of this expansion is Rome's conflicts against the Parthian Empire, Teutonic Barbarians and internal turmoil of civil wars until Constantine becomes the undisputed Roman Emperor around 325AD.<br/><br/>Imperial Rome is packed full of unique and interesting play concepts and new units: cataphracted cavalry, wagon laager forts, massed units of horse archers, light infantry tossing caltrops and more. Each of these concepts operates within the confines of the original system rules, with only slight modifications to reflect historical abilities and importance. So, rules-wise, if you own Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble learning the few new special rules.<br/><br/>Important: In order to play the scenarios in the Imperial Rome expansion, you will need a copy of the basic Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients game and copies of Expansion Nr. 1 Greek vs The Eastern Kingdoms and Expansion Nr. 2 Rome vs The Barbarians.  You can substitute &quot;other&quot; armies for some of the scenarios, but others have specific force requirements (like lots of horse archers) which may make that hard to do.<br/><br/>",

The number of points scored depends on when you build it:<br/><br/>First quarter of the game- 40 points.<br/>Second quarter- 31 points.<br/>Third quarter- 22 points.<br/>Fourth quarter- 13 points.<br/><br/>As depicted on the tile, each Food Day is counted as the last day of its quarter.  For example, if you build this monument on the first Food Day, you get 40 points.<br/><br/>If a Food Day occurs one day late (because a player used the time-speeding privilege of the Starting Player Space) it still counts as the last day of its quarter for the purposes of this monument.<br/><br/>Bonus Starting Wealth Tile<br/><br/>If you take this as your Starting Wealth Tile, you get 6 corn and 4 wood, but you also move down one step on the brown temple.<br/><br/>In a 2- or 3-player game, this tile might be drawn when you are placing dummy workers.  If so, this tile indicates that you must place one extra dummy worker (7 in a 3-player game, or 13 in a 2-player game).<br/><br/>Instead of using worker figures, you can represent dummy workers with the round, flat markers in the non-player colors.  Otherwise you won't have enough.  Also, this makes it easier to distinguish players' workers from dummy workers, so we recommend using the markers even when you aren't playing with this tile.<br/><br/>",

Two new 8&quot; X 22&quot; mapboards, and over 1224 counters(the back of the box totals 520+804 counters, the actual amount 520+704).<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 10<br/><br/>Mapboards: 6, 7<br/>Scenarios: 21 to 32<br/><br/><br/>(From the back of the box:)<br/><br/>From the Nazi invasion of Poland, through the heroic defense of tiny Finland against the Russian behemoth, the blitzkrieg conquests of Norway and the Low Countries, the Battle of France, and the seizure of Greece the player is struck by the despair of men and nations alike as seen by the soldiers who vainly sacrificed their lives against a more powerful aggressor. This is Crescendo of Doom... a gripping game of tactical combat set against the seemingly invincible juggernauts of war-torn Europe. Setting the scene for the colossal struggle of the titans which will follow, Crescendo is, nonetheless, far more than a simple prelude to Barbarossa. While fur&shy;ther refining the innovations brought forth in its highly successful predecessors Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette, Crescendo breaks yet even more ground in the realm of realistic tactical combat without disturbing the underlying basic simplicity of a universally acclaimed game system. Crescendo is a welcome extension for the Squad Leader enthusiast even before he contemplates a single new counter.<br/><br/>But Crescendo of Doom offers far more than that. Complete armor, ordnance, and infantry units are provided for Poland, Belgium, Finland. and a host of other minor neutrals including Elite, Line, and Reservist formations for all nationalities. In graphic detail far superior to any narrative account, you will see for yourself how the outnumbered German panzers defeated the superior armor of the French tanks. Experience personally the French frustrations brought on by radioless AFVs and one man turrets. There are no Panthers or T-34s... here it is the Mk III vs. the Char B, Somua, or Matilda.<br/><br/>And Crescendo of Doom need not end in 1942 with our 32nd scenario, The entire British Order of Battle is presented for the whole of WWII enabling fans of the Western Desert, Italian, or Normandy campaigns to design their own scenarios for those periods. Crescendo of Doom is more than just a game. When combined with Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette, it provides the ultimate in a tactical gaming system which can be used to portray any company or battalion level action. Be forewarned! Crescendo is not an easy game. Do not attempt it unless you have first mastered Squad Leader and Cross of Iron: A Squad Leader Gamette.<br/><br/>In each game you get: <br/><br/>     520 double-printed 1/2&quot; die-cut counters representing the men and weapons that comprised the combatants of the Western Front; 1939&middot;1942. <br/>     704 double-printed 5/8&quot; die-cut counters representing the complete vehicular and ordnance Order of Battle for the British. French. Polish, and Belgian Armies. <br/>     Two additional 8&quot; x 22&quot; geomorphic map board sections Increasing the possible terrain configurations and adding several new terrain types (maps 6 &amp; 7)<br/>     Comprehensive, Illustrated 36 page Programmed instruction rule book. <br/>     Illustrated scenario cards for situations 21-32. <br/>     Two expanded Quick Reference Data Cards. <br/><br/><br/>",

Most of their faction cards are useful, and produces valuable resources only when built, while usually having only the foundation as their cost. That minor change is in fact huge for how we treat our faction buildings. Amazons are a unique faction that will not discard their faction foundation when used to build another card, and will put back in their faction deck instead.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s more, you will also gain the ability to discard cards from the hand, which will help you control your next moves. Now you can focus on the few cards, that will grant you the most victory points!<br/><br/>The expansion was created by Joanna Kijanka, based on the faction idea of Ignacy Trzewiczek, with great artworks by Roman Kucharski and Anastasia Meylus.<br/><br/>Amazons use elements of the deck-building mechanism so that they can discard reconstructed faction cards from their deck, allowing them to modify the deck during play. They also get a lot of bonuses for building their cheap faction cards. How will you help them secure their place among others?<br/><br/>As you may have realized by now, all new Imperial Settlers factions begin with the letter &quot;A&quot; &mdash; and this is no exception!

        "description": "Barricades Mode, an expansion for Thunderstone Quest, lets you play a solo or co-operative adventure against the toughest Guardians in the game.<br/><br/>Thunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.<br/><br/>Each player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.<br/><br/>On each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!<br/><br/>In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.<br/><br/>Depending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!<br/><br/>The competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people (up to 6 people with To The Barricades content!) to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.<br/><br/>",

Each turn that a Crisis card is not completely dealt with, it will lower one or more of the terraforming metrics that keep Mars habitable.<br/><br/>Handle all the crises as they arise.

With his ability of the Million Favored Ones, his units are able to promote for free after combat. Cultists promote to Mutants, Mutants become Abominations, and Abominations become Children of Yog-Sothoth. (Children of Yog-Sothoth can fragment into as many Mutants as are in your unit pool.) He also has the Dragon Rising and Dragon Descending spellbooks, which can only be used once per game (they are flipped upside-down after use). These give him potent one-time boosts which are real game-changers. Other spellbooks let him rain death from the sky; summon monsters from enemy-held gates; and channel raw Power into a Battle. And of course, Yog-Sothoth gives you the ability to move from Gate to Gate without passing through intervening Areas.<br/><br/>In our playtests, Yog-Sothoth has proven to be an extremely powerful faction, as befits the status of the One-in-All. Other players have learned to keep one eye cocked at the Opener of the Way, because he has powers that produce sudden upsets and reversals of fortune.<br/><br/>",

This renovation is going to bring high-end jobs, as well as highly skilled workers, and it's going to improve our quality of life in this city.&quot;<br/>       &ndash;Elizabeth Mills<br/><br/>Second Thoughts is the second Data Pack in the &quot;Spin Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner - The Card Game. The time has come for both corps and runners to take a second look at how they want to wage their burgeoning cyberwars. Are the flash and the sparkle of the newest encryption and decryption technologies luring corps and runners away from basic efficiencies? Are basic efficiencies too blunt to counter their opponents' increasingly nuanced strategies?<br/><br/>The time has come to explore new angles, inventive new uses for programs, and the importance of public perception. It's time for runners to become more creative and less obvious with their program design. It's time for the corps to run a two-pronged assault on the whole runner culture, employing lethal new ice and Black Ops teams, even as they bolster their public images with new PR campaigns. Control the message. Control the game. If you can't shatter your opponent's economy, perhaps you can change the nature of the contest. It's time for Second Thoughts.<br/><br/>",

The difference is players are working together to keep Mars habitable after a natural disaster has landed the planet in crisis. Every round, a new Crisis card will be drawn that will require the players to achieve a certain goal to remove that crisis from play. Each turn that a Crisis card is not completely dealt with, it will lower one or more of the terraforming metrics that keep Mars habitable.<br/><br/>Handle all the crises as they arise. Eventually, a Crisis card will be drawn that allows the players to win the game once they have completed re-terraforming Mars.<br/><br/>Terraforming Mars Ares Expedition: Discovery adds four new mechanics to base Ares Expedition: awards, milestones, upgraded phase cards, and wild tags.<br/><br/>Awards are end of game scoring that are granted to the player with the most of something. Three awards are draw at the beginning of the game so that players know what they will be rewarded for at the end of the game. The player with the most of that item earns 5VP, second place earns 2VP.<br/><br/>Milestones are VP that are awarded during the game. They are granted to the player to first achieve the milestone. Milestones are worth 3 VP at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Some new project and corporation cards allow players to upgrade their phase cards. Each phase card has two different version that players choose from when they upgrade them. The upgrade gives the player a better bonus when they choose that phase.<br/>Some new project cards have a wild tag. Whenever a player reveals this card either from the deck (due to an effect) or from their hand because they are going to play it, that player chooses what tag they want it to be. Tokens are used to keep track of what tag was chosen for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Ares Expedition: Foundations contains additional player boards, cubes, and phase cards so that Ares Expedition can be played with up to six players. This expansion also includes two additional game boards. One is a larger score track. The other adds a fourth terraforming metric: infrastructure.<br/>Additionally, there are new project cards that involve the new terraforming metric and a new phase card.<br/><br/>",

Just mix the 55 transparent cards included in this set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family -- the artistes of Le Canard Noir, whose creative endeavors always end in disaster.<br/><br/>When art lets you down, the Black Duck is there for you. This dingy cafe is home to a motley assortment of washed-up bohemians. Here the tormented painter Rosseau buys drinks for neurotic models and destitute poets, while a troubled actress and sickly courtesan compare notes across the way.<br/><br/>Also included are five Residences with a light blue background behind their central illustration. These are each placed next to their related family at the start of the game. New cards called Mysteries, which have a dark blue effects bar at the bottom, are also shuffled into the deck before play. A Mystery is the only card that can be placed on a Residence (and only a Residence), and can be placed on any Residence as either of your two plays. It gives that Residence's player a special effect and Pathos points that count toward his final Family Value. A Mystery remains even if the requirements for playing it are lost. You may discard a Mystery from your hand as a free play.<br/><br/>",

His faction is most powerful in the late game, when his mighty army, fueled by his Sweeping Winds, Howl, and Ice Age spellbooks and abilities, dominates play. He also features the dread Gnoph-Kehs, strong monsters whose cost lessens the more numerous they become, setting up a feedback loop that forces other players to take note.<br/><br/>In our playtests, Great Cthulhu is traditionally the most powerful faction in Battle. But a late-game Ithaqua has proven equal or greater than Cthulhu's wrecking squad. Players, knowing this, sometimes try to weaken Windwalker in the early game, but he has proven extremely resilient. His cultists are immune to capture, his Wendigos appear for free anywhere a unit is killed in battle, and his lesser Great Old One, Rhan-Tegoth is Eternal, and almost impossible to kill.<br/><br/>Ithaqua himself is usually the last Great One One to be awakened, but before that time, Rhan-Tegoth's proves a useful and durable ally.

Take care with what you add, though, for a pinch too much of this or that will spoil the whole mixture!<br/><br/>Each player has their own bag of ingredient chips. During each round, they simultaneously draw chips and add them to their pot. The higher the face value of the drawn chip, the further it is placed in the swirling pattern, increasing how much your potion is worth. Push your luck as far as you can, but if you add too many cherry bombs, your pot explodes!<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players gain victory points and coins to spend on new ingredients to add to their bags, depending on the strength of the ingredients in their pots. But players with exploded pots must choose points or coins &mdash; not both! The player with the most victory points at the end of nine rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Included in this box are:<br/><br/><br/>     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: the base game<br/>     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: The Herb Witches: the first expansion, adding Witches that grant powers once per game as well as more ingredient books.<br/>     The Quacks of Quedlinburg: Wolfgang's Exchange Office: a mini-expansion adding new conditions for end-game scoring.<br/><br/><br/>",

The other advantages are noticeable resistance to attacks and ability to bypass the enemy's defense. The army's disadvantages are low number of Warriors, low mobility, low toughness, as well as a complete lack of armor.<br/><br/>",

In this land of shifting mists, uncertain footing, and terrifying undead, you are certain of little. The heroes that you&rsquo;ve fought alongside for years seem suddenly alien and unknowable. Spirits loom up out of the fog and vanish moments before they touch you. Even the air you breathe seems to be worming its way inside you, tainting your blood and binding you to the Mistlands with indelible bonds. More and more, you are sure of only one thing: you must find a way to escape.<br/><br/>The heroes' adventures through the Mistlands continue with The Chains That Rust, a new Descent expansion that pits your might against ever more deadly dangers. Within this expansion, you&rsquo;ll discover an entirely new one-act campaign that can be played on its own or as a sequel to the campaign included in Mists of Bilehall. New Tainted cards and a new Overlord class give the overlord player new tools, even as eight plastic figures swell his armies with new monsters. Finally, you can stretch beyond your hero&rsquo;s traditional Class decks for the first time with the addition of hybrid classes!<br/><br/>",

The alternate sides allow players to face familiar terrain along a path that requires all new tactics, or to venture into the Dragon Tower, where a hero's every step meets opposition by the Dragon King's minions and leads him ever closer to an ultimate confrontation with the Dragon King, himself.<br/><br/>The Dragon brings to life six new characters to confront the draconic challenges that lie ahead. Over 300 new tokens and cards expand the Draconic Lords' influence over the land of Talisman and weave each Draconic Lord's story. New rules pace the increase of the draconic threat, and the heroes' quests become more and more dangerous as the dragons grow stronger. Now, for those brave adventurers who seek the Crown of Command, the quest means more than power and influence. It is a race to save the land from the Dragon King's tyrannical rule. Any hero who dares confront the Dragon King must be prepared for an epic battle!<br/><br/>",

Eagerly anticipated for years, the Japanese finally make their debut in wargaming's premier system of WWII tactical ground combat.<br/><br/>Inside you will find the complete ASL order of battle for the Japanese:  all the significant vehicles, guns and troop types they employed from the 1930s through 1945.  Eight scenarios, whose settings range from the barren plains of Manchuria to the steaming jungles of New Guinea, pit the Japanese against a wide variety of Allied nationalities.   <br/>Also included are four new mapboards (#s 34-37), fully compatible with the other SL/ASL boards, which depict the dense vegetation so common in tropical areas.  Four sheets of overlays (village, stream, wooded hill, rice paddies, etc.) provide the means to create an almost endless variety of new terrain configurations.  <br/>Chapter G of the ASL rules covers the many unique characteristics of the Japanese as well as new terrain types like jungle, bamboo, huts, swamp and kunai grass, among others.<br/><br/>Fanatical soldiers who will die rather than break and run - unwavering, seemingly unstoppable banzai charges - individual tank-hunter infantrymen willing to blow themselves up along with an enemy AFV - these are but a hint of what is offered in this most unique addition to the ASL system.  Your first CODE OF BUSHIDO scenario will be an ASL experience like none before - and one you'll likely never forget.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    Boards 34, 35, 36, 37<br/>    PTO Terrain Overlays (4 pages) [1-5, B1-B5, G1-G5, M1-M5, O1-O5, OG1-OG5, RP1-RP5, Wd1-Wd5, X6]<br/>    Chapter G (1-16)<br/>    Chapter G Divider 1st Edition (PTO Terrain)<br/>    Chapter H Japanese (H89-H100)<br/>    Chapter N N17-N18<br/>    Scenarios 59 - 66<br/>    3 Counter Sheets<br/><br/><br/>Scenario List:<br/><br/>ASL Scenario 59     Smertniki<br/>ASL Scenario 60     On the Kokoda Trail<br/>ASL Scenario 61     Shoestring Ridge<br/>ASL Scenario 62     Bungle in the Jungle<br/>ASL Scenario 63     Eastern Gate<br/>ASL Scenario 64     Hazardous Occupation<br/>ASL Scenario 65     Red Star, Red Sun<br/>ASL Scenario 66     The Bushmasters<br/><br/>(from MMP website)<br/><br/><br/>(more info :)<br/><br/>Requires ASL, Beyond Valor, Yanks, and West of Alamein to play.<br/><br/>",

So far it has become a capital of the small state of the same name and has start a crusade to restore the human world. At the same time it has usurped the role of guiding the nation and removed its opponents wherever it can. Again and again, the new troops set off on expeditions to the wilderness in search of new resources and prewar technologies, recruiting useful people along the way. The city itself has become a fortified police state, one of the few safe places in the ruined world, where you pay for peace with your obedience.<br/><br/>Neuroshima Hex! New York is a single army expansion for Neuroshima Hex! The advantage of this army is the diversity of its units, including a lot of shooting units. A great strength is the Headquarters, which gives additional endurance points, and the presence of spies, which can use enemy modules.<br/><br/>The army's disadvantage is a smaller possibility of creating strong offensive coalitions, and the fact that the HQ's special ability is rather defensive.<br/><br/>Neuroshima Hex! New York was originally released as part of the two-army expansion Neuroshima Hex! Babel13.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Air supremacy was a constant challenge during World War II. In the Battle of France, the Luftwaffe's powerful Stukas were a key component to the German's blitzkrieg strategy that led them to victory. Over the English Channel, the heroism of RAF pilots saved their country from an invasion. In the skies of Kursk, Smolensk and Stalingrad, many Soviet pilots defended their land against German bombs. And when the Allied forces landed in Europe, it was under a constant aerial cover of fighters, fighter-bombers, and bombers. At that time, Allied air supremacy was at its pinnacle.<br/><br/>In the Memoir '44: New Flight Plan expansion, players can deploy air units such as fighters, fighter-bombers and even bombers to support their troops on the battlefield. This is not the first time airplanes will make an appearance in the Memoir '44 system, but with its all new set of streamlined rules, Memoir '44: New Flight Plan grants many new tactical options and is compatible with all existing scenarios in all theaters of operation. The expansion also comes with 21 new scenarios and 16 finely-crafted, legendary planes, in impressive sizes, such as the B-17 that measures 72mm by 101mm.<br/><br/>",

This material is compatible with Ambition, but that expansion is not required to play Rivalry. If you are familiar with the dice from Ambition, then you can add this content and start playing immediately. (If not, you'll need to read about the new dice.)<br/><br/>Rivalry also contains two optional game modules &mdash; the Deal Game and the Orb Game &mdash; which can be played separately or combined. These modules can also be combined with the goals in Ambition, although the publisher suggests not combining them all at once for new players!<br/><br/>&bull; The Deal Game has a new deal phase in which players assign $ dice to a new deal board in order to swap assets they don't want for those they do &mdash; and pretty much everything is fair game in terms of possible trades. Not using all your credit track? Why not trade in the top part of it to get a useful die? Or, if you're running a large economy and need a credit track that goes to 11 (or even 16), why not trade away a couple of white dice to get a larger track?<br/><br/>Have a bunch of extra tiles clogging up your construction zones from previous Explores? Why not trade them in for new dice? Or, a chance to draw from the bag until you find a 6 cost development? Or a pair of VP chips? Or a talent counter? Or some credits? Or, another Leader die? Or, a chance to draw a world of a desired color from the bag? Or, to turn some Citizenry dice directly into Developers or Settlers? Or...<br/><br/>Seven deal dice are rolled each turn before players assign their workers to determine what asset types can be potentially gained or traded in that round. After you swap assets, your deal will start to mature over several rounds. If you (or someone else) calls &quot;Deal&quot; again before your deal expires, then you might want to send another dealer in to reverse your trade, trading back for what you originally spent and making some credits and talent counters along the way. Of course, while your deal is maturing, some other player might swoop in and reverse it before you wanted to, taking their cut and converting your attempted temporary loan into a permanent exchange. These things happen...<br/><br/>&bull; The Orb Game gives one yellow &quot;Alien Orb&quot; die to each player, and the faces of these dice can be popped out and upgraded to various &quot;lines&quot; of faces that allow you to customize what you can do in the game. (Think of the lines as being akin to a tech tree.)<br/><br/>You can assign dice to become researchers in the Research phase, and for each assigned researcher, when someone calls Research, you get two &quot;dots&quot; of upgrades to your dice. The first dot gets you a 1-dot face in any line; extra dots get you better faces in that line. (If you want to switch lines for a given face after entering a line, pay 1 dot more.) These upgraded dice affect your play. For example, if you roll the 2-dot beige -1 develop face, you receive a -1 die discount on all developments you build that turn.<br/><br/>Orb dice are rolled in front of player screens at the start of a round. If, for example, you roll a face that grants virtual workers, then everyone knows that you will benefit if Explore occurs and can plan accordingly as they assign their dice and decide which phase to call.<br/><br/>To allow improved Orb dice more opportunities to affect play, the Orb game ends at 15+ tiles or when the initial VP chip pool is exhausted, which is increased to 15 VPs per player. At game end, each 2-dot and 4-dot face on your Orb die is worth 1 and 2 VPs, respectively.<br/><br/>&bull; Replacement player screens including a summary of the optional games (in different colored type faces) and all three added dice types are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Spartan Army expansion features over 20 scenarios, which focus on a period of time from 669 BC to 338 BC. In the early battles of Sparta against Argive, we see the development of Hoplite armies. We then move onto the war with the Persian Empire and take a closer look at the battle of Thermopylae, 480 BC. During the Peloponnesian Wars, Sparta takes a leader position among the Peloponnesian states, which would last for almost two centuries. Finally there is a shift in power away from Sparta during the battles of the Theban Era and the rise of Macedon.<br/><br/>The Spartan Army expansion also provides all the blocks and stickers needed to field a Spartan Army and its allies to oppose the armies from Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients - Expansion #1 - Greek vs Eastern Kingdoms. As well as one sheet of 15 new double sided Terrain Tiles.<br/><br/>Rules-wise, if you are familiar with Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients, you'll have no trouble at all learning the special rules for Hoplite infantry, for the basic game mechanics remain unchanged. Battle dice still resolve combat quickly and the Command cards provide an element of luck that creates a fog of war and presents players with both challenges and opportunities for victory.<br/> As with all Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients expansions to date, the tactics you will need to execute with these Hoplite armies will conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to these historical units, their weapons, the terrain and history. <br/> - Publisher Page<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>* Rule/Scenario Booklet that features 26 historical scenarios<br/>    * 1 Reference Card<br/>    * 228 Blocks<br/>    * Block Label sheets<br/>    * 2 Terrain Tile Sheets: each contains 15 double-sided Terrain Tiles<br/><br/>Per back of box:  You need the base game of C&amp;C:A and you need C&amp;C Ancients Expansion Number 1 (Greece and Eastern Kingdoms).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is WEST OF ALAMEIN the long-awaited British addition to the ASL system. As the title implies, it focuses on battles between the British 8th Army and Deutsches Afrika Korps in the North African desert in 1941-43.<br/><br/>WEST OF ALAMEIN contains the entire British order of battle, including all U.S. Lend-Lease vehicles, ordnance and support weapons, thus enabling you to command every major vehicle, gun and troop type used by British and/or Commonwealth forces in every theater throughout the war.<br/><br/>Also contained herein is Chapter F of the ASL rules, which covers the terrain types encountered in the desert and other arid regions: scrub, wadis, hillocks, escarpments, soft sand, dunes, deirs and hammada. Chapter F also provides rules for the special climatic conditions that were so much a part of desert combat, such as dust, heat haze and sun blindness.<br/><br/>Of the five mounted mapboards in WEST OF ALAMEIN, four (#s 26-29) depict flat open desert, with the dominant terrain features on separate, moveable overlays so as to maximize flexibility. The fifth board (#25) represents a rugged hill mass as is found in Tunisia, and can be converted to a large escarpment by means of an overlay specially designed for this purpose.<br/><br/>A Design-Your-Own system for the random selection and placement of overlays is also provided, which in combination with the vehicle and weapon point values, historical notes and DYO charts, will provide an endless variety of situations for those who enjoy creating their own scenarios. And as if all this weren&rsquo;t enough, simple rules have been included to enable the desert boards and overlays to represent the steppes of the Ukraine, providing added flexibility for these components. Of the eight scenarios enclosed, four can be played using the ASL rules and BEYOND VALOR; the other four also require rules, counters and/or a board from YANKS. No other boards or modules are needed.<br/><br/>WEST OF ALAMEIN is not a complete game. Ownership of ASL and BEYOND VALOR is required as is YANKS for four scenarios.<br/>  <br/>CONTENTS:<br/><br/>    5 8&quot; x 22 &quot; mounted Mapboards [25-29]<br/>    520 1/2 &quot; Counters laminated on both sides [the back of the box wrote 560 by mistake]<br/>    704 5/8&quot; Counters laminated on both sides<br/>    8 ASL Scenarios [35-42]<br/>    1 Pad of Terrain Overlays [D1-D6, H1-H6, S1-S8, SD1-SD8, W1-W4, X1-X5]<br/>    1 7&quot; x 22&quot; Escarpment Overlay (Numbered E1)<br/>    1 ASL Chapter F<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Scenario List:<br/><br/>    ASL 35 Blazin' Chariots<br/>    ASL 36 Rachi Ridge<br/>    ASL 37 Khamsin<br/>    ASL 38 Escape from Derna<br/>    ASL 39 Turning the Tables<br/>    ASL 40 Fort McGregor<br/>    ASL 41 A Bridgehead too Wet<br/>    ASL 42 Point of No Return<br/><br/><br/>(from the back of the box and BGG user)<br/><br/>",

Will you be able to plug its upgrades into your deck and find success? Or are you the one who will fall behind?<br/><br/>Whatever the outcome, it won't be dull. The runners and corporate executives who direct the struggles of Android: Netrunner lead frantic lives full of fantastic highs and staggering lows, and the pace doesn&rsquo;t slow a beat in Mala Tempora. Many of its sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) encourage daring gambles, staking health and fortunes against opportunities to rapidly accelerate wealth and success. Of course, in an age of technological one-upmanship, why play fair? Mala Tempora also introduces a number of programs and ice that allow runners and corps to &quot;cheat&quot; these wagers by stealing information about their opponents&rsquo; cards.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, leave it to the Anarchs to do their own thing; while the other factions bid for greater efficiencies and more devious tricks, a new Anarch runner arrives to play the game by another entirely different set of rules!<br/><br/>",

Lurking drowners, ghouls marching near cemeteries, or harpies dipping from the air is just a small part of the threats awaiting travelers!<br/><br/>It brings another level of depth into different elements of the game: trailing and fighting monsters, building your deck and combos, using bombs, taking advantage of mutagens, and adding special cards to your starting decks.<br/><br/>Contains a playable School of the Manticore Witcher, advanced action cards for your witcher, and 17 large monster cards, one for each of the Old World beasts. These cards contain a new, advanced special ability of the Monster and descriptions of four special attacks. These attacks are directly related to the characteristics of the Monster in the Witcher's world.<br/><br/>When a Monster appears on the board, players place an additional large card next to the board - it is visible to everyone and is associated with one specific Monster.<br/><br/>In addition to the 17 large cards, this expansion introduces 4 Special Combat Cards. Before fighting a monster, shuffle 2,3, or 4 randomly into its Life Pool (depending on the Monster level). Thanks to this, fighting a powerful, massive Werewolf will be a completely different experience than facing Foglet hiding between mists and illusions. Additionally, each fight with the same Monster will be unique because it is not sure which special attacks will appear and in what order.<br/><br/>Special Combat Cards will allow you to diversify the fights and introduce a completely new mechanic - Passive Attacks. When a Monster discards a Special Combat Card due to its damage, the passive attack is automatically activated.<br/><br/>Various special and passive attacks of monsters mean that the decisions made by the player while trailing the Monster and in combat must be even more carefully considered.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The third expansion to Cards Against Humanity features 100 new cards &ndash; 25 black question/statement cards and 75 white answer cards &ndash; to be used with the base game, in addition to 12 blank cards.<br/><br/>In this card game, players take turns being the Card Czar, which means they read a black question card or a fill-in-the-blank statement card. The other players then select a white answer card from the ten in hand that they think best or most humorously fits the question/statement. The Card Czar then shuffles the answers and chooses the one he likes best, with that answer's owner receiving the black card as his &quot;awesome point&quot; for winning the round.<br/><br/>Once a player has at least one awesome point, he can wager an awesome point when giving a white answer card in order to throw in a second answer card, theoretically giving him a better chance to be chosen. The winner of the round receives the original black card as well as any that are wagered in that round.<br/><br/>Play continues until a pre-determined score is reached, or until everyone is tired from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>",

It is particularly frightening when one of the residents cackles or a group of them cheer during a game of bingo in the common room. Those noises are nothing, however, compared to the blood-curdling shrieks of terror generated by the evil brand of medical &quot;care&quot; the Ratchet Lady is giving the asylum's residents and staff. What do you do when the maniacs come?<br/><br/>The Ratchet Lady is in a mood. She&rsquo;s performing her own brand of therapy on the victims, turning them into bloodthirsty maniacs. You&rsquo;ll have to decide if you want to try to calm them down or kill them before they can kill you. But the only way to really stop them will be to put down the Ratchet Lady herself.<br/><br/>Wolfe Asylum seems harmless and like a typical mental institution to outsiders. Inside lies something very different. There&rsquo;s medicine and other drugs inside that can, shall we say, amplify your abilities. But at what cost? When the choice is death or a potential side effect, it really isn&rsquo;t a choice at all. Down the hatch!<br/><br/>Each Feature Film Box is double-sided, with amazingly illustrated covers on the front AND back. Not only that, but the magnetically attached box covers are removable, with the reverse of each functioning as the Killer and Location boards respectively.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They must scramble their way from star to star, helping where they can, and thwarting Ronan&rsquo;s minions wherever possible.<br/><br/>No place is safe for the Guardians so long as Ronan hounds their tracks.

Next, place access points to the Sky Islands &mdash; the beanstalk and the stairway &mdash; on different regions on the game board. Whenever a race stands on one of these access points, they can try to conquer the space on the sky islands that shows the matching symbol.<br/><br/>Races can't start their conquests in the Sky Islands unless their power specifically allows them to do so. At the end of a turn, if you control all of the regions on a Sky Island, you gain one additional coin.<br/><br/>",

Its Position in the center of Europe, however, made it the perfect target for revolutionary France and in April 1792, France declared war on Austria. The first war lasted for 5 years. Austria renewed the war against France in 1799 and again in 1805, but in both cases was swiftly defeated. In April 1809, judging that Napoleon&rsquo;s army<br/>was bogged down with the fighting in Spain, Austria invaded Bavaria, but Napoleon recovered quickly and Austria&rsquo;s defeat at Wagram led to another humiliating peace treaty.<br/><br/>Even though the Austrian army was the third largest in the world, the Austrians lost many more battles than they won. At the time of the Napoleonic Wars, the Austrian army was a large multi-national army, made up of Austrians, Swedes, Hungarians, Englishmen, Scots, Irishmen, Walloons, Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Germans, Croats, Serbs, and even French royalists.<br/>The infantry regiments were large and somewhat reliable, but the tactical formations and drill were still entrenched in the past. The cavalry, although well mounted, still applied the practice of scattering their formations in small bodies, which greatly reduced their combat effectiveness. In general, the Austrian army did enjoy many successes on a regimental level, but at the brigade, divisional and corps levels its commanders were often<br/>woefully inadequate.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will find 20 historical scenarios that focus on the Austrian Army battles from 1805 to 1809 against Napoleon, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From GMT Games:<br/><br/>At the time of the Napoleonic Wars, Spain was only a shadow of its former power. Spanish troops and leaders, as many Napoleonic historians point out, performed badly on a large number of occasions. Yet there are a number of battles, Bailen, Tamames, Alcaniz and San Marcial where the Spaniards fought valiantly and gained victory. Ironically, the point most historians overlook is the fact that the Spanish armies constituted a threat that the French simply could not ignore. As good as Wellington&rsquo;s Anglo-Portuguese field army was, that army faced multiple French armies. They could only defeat one French army at a time. The Spanish Armies and the accompanying guerrilla warfare against French troops tied down the remainder, allowing the Anglo-Portuguese army to ultimately emerge victorious.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will find 18 historical scenarios that focus on Peninsular battles fought by the Spanish army from 1808 to 1813, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.=<br/><br/>",

When you Explore and place the Nebula, place one Discovery tile in each subsector with an Discovery symbol and one Ancient Ship in the subsector with the Ancient symbol. You cannot place an Influence Disc on the hex. The Discovery Tiles can only be claimed by having a Ship in the subsector at the end of the Combat Phase. If you place a Discovery Tile benefit in the Nebula, you must place it in the subsector where it was found.<br/><br/>When you collect the Ancient Monolith tile, place it in the hex where you found it.

This puts serious strain on the space-time continuum, increasing the risk of Paradoxes, but often the risk is worth the reward and the flexibility. This module is supported for 1-4 players (Fractures of Time expansion required for solo play.)<br/><br/>With the Quantum Loops module, you are no longer limited to warping from your own timeline: the module opens up parallel universes where resources are more plentiful, the locals are eager to join your cause, or their technology allows you to shortcut your own travels through time... The possibilities multiply through a new Warp tile that grants access to the powerful Quantum Effect cards, but beware - to close a loop to a parallel universe, you will need a real Breakthrough... This module is supported for 1-4 players (Fractures of Time expansion required for solo play.)<br/><br/>The Intrigues of the Council module simulates the World Council's political machinations, bringing two new aspects to the game: another layer of player interaction and customizable endgame scoring objectives, influenced by the players. By sending Exosuits to the right place at the right time, players can receive bonus resources and compete to build a tableau of Agenda tiles, which replaces the base game's Endgame Condition scoring.

The expansion is based on an idea of Michael Ormesher in a Days of Wonder &quot;Race design contest&quot;.<br/><br/>The expansion consists of 24 leader tokens (the second edition has 48) that are neither a race nor a power. When you pick a new race, you can opt to take its leader. The leader acts as an additional race token. The leader, however, disappears as soon as the race goes into decline. Also, the leader is brave, which means that he can only be staying at regions that are not immune.<br/><br/>Leaders can be held hostage for ransom. If the ransom is not paid, the leader counts as two victory points at the end of the game for the player that captured the leader.<br/><br/>",

The most talented craftsmen and the slickest charlatans alike operate under the sign of the Gilded Blade. As new wonders are unveiled and pickpockets work the crowds, even a noble hero can find much to interest him at this gathering.<br/><br/>The Gilded Blade Adventure Pack expands the world of Terrinoth in every game of Runebound with new sets of skill cards and asset cards that can increase your options for any scenario. New goods like Contraband vary in their return based on how good you are at exploring. Meanwhile, you could claim a skill card like Superiority Complex , which grants you a free trophy whenever another hero is defeated! These assets and skills can be swapped for other sets in your asset or skill decks, giving you the chance to customize your hero more than ever before.<br/><br/>Along with skill and asset cards, this Adventure Pack offers a variety of new adventure cards that can be added to any scenario. You may face off against a Highway Gang that attempts to surround and rob you, but thankfully for the heroes, a new hero also joins the game of Runebound in this expansion. Red Scorpion is a solitary wanderer, and her unnatural agility helps her easily outmaneuver her foes. Whether you take on the sorceress Ariad or battle Dragonlord Margath with Red Scorpion, her flurry of blades spells doom for any enemy of Terrinoth.<br/><br/>",

Such knowledge is difficult to come by, even in a place like Arkham, but you do know of one witch whose story has been passed down for nearly two hundred years: Keziah, who escaped from the Salem Gaol back in the late 1600s and whose ghost still supposedly haunts the condemned Witch House in French Hill. With many questions and few leads, you have no choice but to chase the ghosts of Arkham&rsquo;s past.<br/><br/>As a new cycle begins, you will need new tools to help you battle these unholy forces. To help you with this task, some of the new player cards in The Secret Name belong to more than one class. These cards, which can be identified by their golden hue and dual class icons in the upper right corner of the card, can be added to your investigator&rsquo;s deck if you have access to either of the classes detailed on the card. If, however, an investigator has limited access to one of the classes on a multiclass card, that card will occupy one of the investigator&rsquo;s limited slots, even if they have unlimited access to the other class detailed on the card. But with diverse uses and powerful effects, they make a worthy addition to any investigator&rsquo;s arsenal.<br/><br/>",

With Ghost Stories: Black Secret, the players will face an even more powerful dilemma: Wu-Feng himself.<br/><br/>Yes, the player count for Black Secret is 2-5 (instead of 1-4) as one player will take on the role of Wu-Feng and harass the monks in a more direct manner than they've experienced previously. Wu-Feng now chooses where the incoming ghosts will be placed on the individual monk boards. Instead of placing the ghost on the board, Wu-Feng can use that ghost to power colored spells matching the color of the ghost (while casting the spells bring Wu-Feng access to stronger spells) or to bring new demon miniatures in play that scour the catacombs underneath the village; these figures are searching for the remains of Wu-Feng by digging in the dirt located there, and should they find the three icons required, the shadow of Wu-Feng descends on the village to fight directly with the monks.<br/><br/>To aid the monks in their fight against this more devious incarnation of Wu-Feng, they have access to blood mantras, special abilities that come in different levels to adjust for the difficulty of play. When a monk loses a life, the Qi token is placed on the mantra. When two tokens are on one of the level-2-mantras, one monk of the players' choice gains a Qi. When 4 Qi are collected on one of the level-4-mantras, all village tiles are dehaunted.<br/><br/>",

Contraptions can be assembled as a Workshop Action, for the cost of 1 Coin per Contraption already in place. They can be used any time during a player's turn by turning them to their inactive side, and receiving a bonus based on the player's Magic school - in the above example, the Mechanical Contraption, the Generator, supplies the city with electricity, netting its owner a steady income of Coins.<br/><br/>Each Contraption has a more powerful effect than the one below it. At the end of a round, each Contraption with enough Shards next to it can be reactivated and used again next turn - this follows the similar principle as the Magician Powers module (which is playable with Contraptions). The highest-level Contraptions are so breathtaking that simply reactivating them will earn you some Fame!<br/><br/>The Contraptions module includes 16 Contraptions with 4 unique illustrations, printed on 3mm blackcore cardboard, and 4 board extensions.<br/><br/>When you learn a Trick from your own school, you may choose to learn your Signature Trick instead (if you meet its Fame threshold). Each Signature Trick &ldquo;upgrades&rdquo; a Trick from the original set: for example, Professor Bernard can learn his Legendary Shark Tank signature trick instead of the &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; Water Tank Escape. If a Signature Trick is learned, the standard version is removed from the deck. And if an opponent already learned its standard version, your Signature Trick no longer has a Fame Threshold!<br/><br/>Signature Tricks have the same component requirements as their standard version, but they also require Contraptions to function: the higher their Fame threshold, the more Contraptions you have to use when you prepare them. However, in return, not only do these Tricks have better numbers (higher Yield, more Trick Markers, etc.), but they also have a special power: for example, The Legendary Shark Tank&rsquo;s Trick markers can be aligned freely in the Theater, meaning that you&rsquo;ll always be able to create Links with it.<br/><br/>This expansion is contained in the Collector's edition and will also be available by itself, at least from the publisher's website.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

But not any witcher can accomplish such a daring task!<br/><br/>This expansion includes 7 huge miniatures, 7 monster Cards with other special tokens, and Cards. With that expansion there is a big monster moving through the Continent, sowing terror and destruction. Witchers train, hunt monsters, and strive to prepare for a final enemy. Killing a Legendary Monster is the only way to win the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay and components overview:<br/><br/>- Each of these Monsters is a huge miniature with a special, Large Monster Card that explains its unique abilities and attacks. <br/>- There is also a set of 20 new Combat Cards, used only in the fight against a Legendary Monster. <br/>- This Expansion contains a set of Legendary Hunt Cards that will move it around the map and give players the opportunity to gather information while preparing for the fight.<br/>- Legendary Monster appears on the map from the beginning of the game, will move around the map, and leave destruction behind, represented by special Tokens. Witchers will be able to prepare for the final fight from the very beginning, but they also need to train and hunt other monsters.<br/><br/>Expansion compatibility:<br/><br/>- It works with standard game and basic solo mode.<br/>- It doesn&rsquo;t work with Wild Hunt, which already has boss miniatures that you choose from.<br/>- It can be combined with all Modes from the Monster Trail.<br/>- You can use Mages, Lost Mount, as well as Adventure Pack while adding Legendary Hunt.<br/><br/>&mdash;Kickstarter summary<br/><br/>",

Sharrash army are mobility of HQ, the ability to blow up even the fastest enemy units and to paralyze the slower ones, and the possibility of bypassing the enemy's defense lines thanks to the mortars. Another advantage of the Sharrash is a difficult to eliminate Foundation Tile (Hole), which can easily thwart the enemy's plans.<br/><br/>Sharrash's disadvantage is a smaller number of fighting units than in other armies, their low mobility, low toughness and initiative, as well as a complete lack of armors.<br/><br/>",

Innocent townsfolk hurry home at night, barring their doors behind them, as bloodthirsty, savage creatures venture farther and farther from their lairs in search of their next meal. The realm has called upon its greatest heroes to venture into the hills and mountains to confront this threat. Only the most stalwart will return with Runebound (Third Edition): The Mountains Rise &ndash; Adventure Pack!<br/><br/>Like other Adventure Packs, The Mountains Rise offers new cards that can be incorporated into any existing scenario to dramatically change the flavor and feel. Fifteen new adventure cards (five per deck) introduce new enemies, events, and quests while twenty new asset cards and ten new skill cards give you dozens of new ways to customize your hero. Many of these new assets come with new combat tokens, some of which introduce new combat symbols to the game &mdash; ensuring that your Runebound battles will never be the same. Finally, you&rsquo;ll gain an entirely new hero: Nanok of the Blade, a warrior who eschews armor in favor of the pure thrill of battle.<br/><br/>",

As objects, animals, and people vanish, so too do they disappear from the memory of those left behind. Only you and your fellow investigators remember them&mdash;or so you thought. When an enigmatic letter arrives, its author claiming to also remember those who disappeared, it marks the beginning of an epic journey that will take you across the globe and under the scrutinous eye of the mysterious and deadly Red Coterie.<br/><br/>When we say &ldquo;across the globe,&rdquo; we mean that literally. The Scarlet Keys Campaign Expansion introduces the game&rsquo;s very first completely non-linear campaign. After the prologue concludes, you and your party choose where to go next, and wherever you go determines what scenario you play. This means that, with the exception of the prologue and the finale (which always occur first and last, respectively), all of the scenarios in this campaign can be experienced in any order. However, you may not experience all of them in a single playthrough, since one of the greatest threats in the campaign isn&rsquo;t the Mythos: it&rsquo;s time.<br/><br/>There has never been a campaign for Arkham Horror: The Card Game of this scale and this scope, and only you and your fellow investigators can travel the globe and unravel the mysteries of The Scarlet Keys before it is too late.<br/><br/>The Scarlet Keys is the newest campaign for Arkham Horror: the Card Game. Just like with Edge of the Earth, you will find only player cards in the Investigator Expansion and only scenario cards within the Campaign Expansion. Whether you want one expansion or both, the world of Arkham Horror just got bigger!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Between two of the bridges that span the river, there stands the Unvisited Isle. The foggy shores are barren and unwelcoming, and as you row closer, you try to remain silent, as if to keep the river itself from noticing. Not a soul greets you as you draw closer to the island, save for the judging gaze of ghostly birds that observe you from the trees. In the distance, a pillar of spectral energy is rising into the clouds, a vortex of otherworldly mist spiraling about it.<br/><br/>As you explore the island, you will find braziers scattered at various locations, that you can either light or douse with the new Circle action ability. Lighting these braziers may help push back the heavy mist, allowing you to further explore the island, but it may also be the key step in completing the ritual that has already begun. How far can you push Arkham to the brink of chaos without surrendering the city to the dark forces battling for control of it?<br/><br/>",

Here is the complete order of battle for a new nationality - one never before offered in the long history of the SL/ASL systems.  The Italian soldier of the Second World War has been much maligned - but is this view totally justified?  How much was his performance affected by the quality of his weapons and the abilities of his small-unit leaders?  Playing HOLLOW LEGIONS, which incorporates the results of extensive research on this lesser-known army and its equipment, will allow you to form your own opinion by giving you the opportunity to command every major vehicle, gun and troop type employed by the Italians in North and East Africa, Russian, Sicily, the Balkans and Italy during World War II.<br/><br/>This is the first and second edition.<br/>  <br/>The two mapboards (#s 30 and 31) contained herein depict open desert; added to those in WEST OF ALAMEIN, they allow you to re-create North African battles of even greater expanse than was possible with just the British module.  But HOLLOW LEGIONS is certainly not limited to the desert; indeed, of the eight scenarios in this module, five are set in Europe.  <br/>Also included are the ASL Chapter H (Design Your Own) Italian vehicle and weapon listings, point values, historical notes and DYO charts - plus the ASL Chapter N (Armory) pages for the countersheets in HOLLOW LEGIONS, those for the Allied and Axis Minor infantry and support weapons, and those for British ordnance and transport.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    Board 30, 31<br/>    Chapter H Italian<br/>    Scenarios 51 - 58<br/>    3 Counter Sheets<br/><br/><br/>Scenario List:<br/>ASL Scenario 51     The Taking of Takrouna<br/>ASL Scenario 52     Too Little, Too Late<br/>ASL Scenario 53     A High Price to Pay<br/>ASL Scenario 54     Bridge to Nowhere<br/>ASL Scenario 55     Retribution<br/>ASL Scenario 56     Half a Chance<br/>ASL Scenario 57     The Battle for Rome<br/>ASL Scenario 58     Ci Arrendiamo<br/><br/>(from MMP website)<br/><br/>",

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>This Big Box is the same size of the previous, but with a slightly different component mix. This big box includes the basic game, Inns &amp; Cathedrals, Traders &amp; Builders, Princess &amp; Dragon, Abbey &amp; Mayor, River 2, Count, King, and Cult.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Before the Black Throne is the sixth and final Mythos Pack in &quot;The Circle Undone&quot; cycle for Arkham Horror: The Card Game.<br/><br/>After your battle to close the rips in reality in In the Clutches of Chaos, you have left your city and your world behind, traveling an impossible distance, and yet you are still many leagues from the nighted throne where your ultimate foe stirs. As you are chased by your fate across the cosmos, you may be forced to bring &quot;empty space&quot; into play, losing the top card of your deck as you place it facedown to embody the seemingly infinite space that divides you from the rest of humanity. This is not a location; it cannot be entered or investigated, and the only way to reclaim your lost card is to fill the empty space with a Cosmos location. These impossible places, drawn from the new Cosmos deck, do not have set places they must connect to. Rather, each Cosmos card has a connecting instruction you must obey in order to place it. Torn from all you know, it may be easy to surrender to the existential dread, but even if all you can do is delay the inevitable, the battle is not over yet!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Its destructive moods swing wildly from impotent rage to obsessive nostalgia. It stalks the darkness, lashing out at anything it meets. Survivors that run across the moody monster usually fall prey to the unseen waves of ruinous pain that emanate from the monster's glowing heart. Those survivors lucky enough to drive off the monster will be amply rewarded with a trove of new armaments crafted from the abandoned husk of the monster's body.<br/><br/>The Dragon King is a major content expansion for Kingdom Death: Monster that adds a whole new huge monster, new armor kit (2 male and 2 female as usual), rules, AI cards, hit location cards, new special resources, settlement events, innovations gear and new lore to the game. Everything you will need to step up and challenge this dangerous entity.<br/><br/>",

The player must place or move one of these figures, if possible.

The mage adds one point for each tile in the feature, while the witch cuts the number of points scored for this feature in half, rounded up. After such scoring, place the mage/witch next to the score track to await the drawing of the next mage tile. Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>",

Just mix the 55 transparent cards in this new set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family - the malodorous Malone mob - including The Broken Arms Hotel as a Residence card to use with the Unhappy Homes expansion. When Boils Malone brought his family overseas to &ldquo;get away from the heat,&rdquo; he wasn&rsquo;t expecting quite so much rain!<br/><br/>Adding an extra level of strategy, new persistent effect icons on cards allow their special effects to continue to be active even if covered by another card. A persistent effect ends only when the attached character is killed.<br/><br/>Also inside are five Unwelcome Guest cards. Deal one or more face up to the table&rsquo;s center at the start of the game. Guests &ldquo;follow&rdquo; the card types noted on them; no matter where it currently is, a living Guest immediately moves to join the family of the character on which one of its &ldquo;trigger&rdquo; cards is played. All its Modifiers are moved with it, and it&rsquo;s considered a member of that family until it moves again. This may delay the game&rsquo;s end if a final play draws a Guest to the near-winner&rsquo;s family.<br/><br/>",

The Tactician cards, along with the updated deck of Napoleonic Command cards, are designed to spice up each and every player&rsquo;s Napoleonic experience by enhancing the role<br/>of Leaders on the battlefield, without adding additional complexity or pages of rules.

The 4 different modules can be combined however players wish to, guaranteeing a lot of variety and replayability. The 4 modules are:<br/><br/><br/>     The Summer Palace: Players travel to the Summer Palace of the Emperor, where they can obtain extra servants, Jade, and even the services of the mysterious Court Ladies&hellip;&nbsp;Players will have to score majorities in order to obtain these bonuses, but will also be able to manipulate the results by exchanging specific Gifts with the officials, as word has it the Emperor is collecting a very particular type of Gift. <br/>     The Peasants Revolt: During the Ming Dynasty, peasants revolts were common. Although the Ming Dynasty itself came to power through a peasant revolt, this did not mean that the rulers had any more empathy for the peasants than the previous rulers. Players will gain a lot of support from the peasants in this expansion, but if pushed too far, players will have to work together to avoid their wrath.<br/>     The Palace Stairs: Moving your Envoy towards the Emperor will not be without consequences with this expansion module. Players will be able to choose a longer or shorter path leading towards the Palace of Heavenly Purity. The shorter path will require some achievements, the long path will earn players rewards at first, but when they get close to the Palace, they will have to pay certain taxes or risk seeing their Envoy take steps back.<br/>     Extra Decrees and Gift Cards: Spice up your game with new Decrees and special kinds of Gift Cards, like the lamp and jade knives, which will add even more variety to your game of G&ugrave;gōng!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Breaches in reality begin to rip through the fabric of the Earth, and a faint melody of discordant pipes can be heard throughout the streets of Arkham. Frightened citizens have sealed themselves in their homes, yet you continue to patrol the streets, desperate for some solution to end the chaos.<br/><br/>In In the Clutches of Chaos, doom does not accrue at the usual rate. Instead, breaches are made at various locations, marked by resource tokens. When enough breaches have been made a single location, an incursion occurs. An incursion adds doom to its location and causes the breaches to spread, opening rifts in reality at connecting locations. Your goal is to prevent incursions by removing the breaches that cause them, but this can only be done by activating the action abilities on each location. If you do not maintain control over the breaches, you may soon find yourself overwhelmed with Arkham falling into madness. You cannot allow that to happen!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Decades ago an apocalypse destroyed the world, wrecking its cities, ravaging the land, and devastating the population. Now, after more than a generation, a new age dawns with The Cataclysm, an expansion for Talisman Revised 4th Edition. People are returning to establish settlements, nature is evolving in bizarre, unprecendented ways, and traces of the former civilization can be found everywhere. This is a time of chaos and possibility, of challenges and heroism.<br/><br/>The Cataclysm introduces [an entirely new main board to replace the one found in the base game], that opens up a reinvented, post-apocalyptic realm for your exploration. Those brave enough to inhabit this world are brought to life in the Denizens deck, while the Remnants deck fills spaces with lost treasures, broken artifacts, and the lingering after-effects of the apocalypse. Five more characters now seek the Crown of Command, including the Black Knight who once menaced the Middle Region, and four alternative endings shape your quests in this ever-changing world.<br/><br/>Changed Characters<br/><br/>Some of the Characters who first sought the Crown of Command may undertake that quest again in this altered, post-apocalyptic world. Competing with them in The Cataclysm are five others who have never sought it before. Some of them have long inhabited the realm. For instance, the Black Knight  has abandoned his castle in the Middle Region to claim greater power. He now rides through Talisman, forcing the other Characters he meets to give him gold or else he&rsquo;ll take one of their lives. The Mutant  has also lived in this realm her whole life, and also remained there through its darkest times, but she is no longer the human that she once was. Magical energies that flared and fluctuated during the apocalypse infected her body so thoroughly that her form, Strength, Craft, and fate have continually changed.<br/><br/>Others have no memories of what it was like before the apocalypse. The Scavenger  grew up during the decades that followed and learned how to survive by staying in motion and collecting whatever Objects she could find. The most valuable ones she stashes away so that they cannot be stolen. Youngest of all is the Arcane Scion  , born during the outburst of magical energies that transformed the Mutant. Unlike the Mutant, who cannot fully control her mutations, the Arcane Scion has harnessed those energies, using them to wield Magic Objects and cast Spells.<br/><br/>",

Baron Blade merely saw potential. He worked through many channels to recover parts of the Omnitron frame, and rebuilt and reactivated them as his own personal Omni-Blade!<br/> However, after the Vengeful Five's defeat, there was enough sentience left in the Omni-Blade that it knew to hide. It slowly accumlated parts and resources, but it had lost much of its intelligence. It struggled to reach its former power, but it was missing too much of itself. Instead, it formed a massive construction assemblary. There, it pumped out drones and devices, hoping to match in numbers what it once had in power.<br/><br/>Many seeking power have attempted to harness the automatically generated troops and resources created by the fourth incarnation of Omnitron. Heroes have faced more than one villain in the self-aware factory, each attempting to join forces with the robot, or even to subjugate its programming. If any were to succeed, the results would be disastrous...<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Omnitron IV is a mini-expansion Environment Deck of 15 cards that adds a new place for the Heroes of Sentinels of the Multiverse to battle the Villains in.<br/><br/>",

In Tiny Epic Pirates you take control of a Pirate ship with the goal of burying vast amounts of wealth on secret island hideaways.<br/><br/>Each turn, you move your Captain Token around your ship&rsquo;s action wheel (rondel), selecting which action to perform... Plunder, Trade, Crew Up, Attack, or Search. Each player has a randomized and unique arrangement of these actions on their rondel. Sailing your Pirate Ship is something every player can do every time they take an action.<br/><br/>Plundering allows you to acquire booty from settlements at a very reasonable rate. It&rsquo;s amazing how negotiating changes when your blunderbuss is at the ready. A crate of gunpowder for a promise of no harm? Fair exchange. Trading allows you to sell your ill-gotten goods to the Black Market for gold. Each Market is only interested in a specific good, so make sure you are sailing in the right direction. Timing is everything, sell your good at the wrong time and it&rsquo;s worth a pittance. Crew Up adds a new crew member to your growing Pirate Ship. Crew increases your ship&rsquo;s combat advantage and unlocks new abilities for each spoke of your ship&rsquo;s action wheel, making that action more powerful every time you take it! Attacking Merchant Ships and other Pirates will grow your reputation. It also happens to be a great way to score some gold and more booty to sell. Be enough of a menace and you may just become a Legend of the Sea!<br/><br/>Search the high-seas for treasures left behind by the unfortunate souls that preceded you. Salvage old ship parts for temporary aid or get lucky and find something worth selling.<br/><br/>The end of the game is triggered once a player has buried three treasures. To do this, a player must first acquire the amount of gold required to bury at the various bury spots on the map. After all players have had an equal number of turns. The player who has buried three treasures wins the game. Ties are decided by the player who has the highest legendary status, followed by which player has the most gold.<br/><br/>Includes the Crimson Silver Mini-Expansion.<br/><br/>--description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Realm Eternal stands as a bastion of justice throughout the cosmos. Only Loki, the God of Mischief, dares threaten Asgard&rsquo;s peace in his obsession with usurping the throne. Loki&rsquo;s minions, all traitors and henchman mired in his tricks and illusions, work both secretly and openly to execute his master plan. It&rsquo;s up to Thor, Valkyrie, and Korg to untangle the web of intrigue and bring Loki to justice. Trouble is, even knowing Loki&rsquo;s ultimate goal, one can never be certain what traps the Trickster God has laid for the Heroes pledged to thwart his rightful rule.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the trio are not without their allies, Asgard being home to many of the universe&rsquo;s most powerful individuals. But, can they all be trusted? Loki&rsquo;s insidious illusions play upon hearts and minds, needs and desires, and no one, not even the Mighty Thor himself can wholly guard against his influence. Why, even one of the renowned trio might be unwittingly in Loki&rsquo;s employ!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a race against time and hidden fears as this Tale of Asgard unfolds.<br/><br/>",

You've experienced paradrops, glider-borne landings, Stuka attacks and opposed river crossings. Only one major type of WW2 land combat remains unexplored:   the classic amphibious assault. Now, in GUNG HO!, this too is added to the combat repertoire of ASL. And what better way to present assault landings than with the introduction of the U.S.Marines. GUNG HO! offers four types of U.S.M.C. squads, reflecting their evolution through the war years, along with the most comprehensive tactical-level amphibious assault rules ever offered in a wargame.<br/><br/>It is all here in the balance of Chapter G: deep and shallow ocean, beaches of variable width and slope, sea walls, piers, beach obstacles, reefs, heavy surf, naval gunfire, and all the important types of landing craft used by the Allies and Japan throughout the war.  As if this weren't enough, GUNG HO! also introduces rules and counters for the infamous cave defenses employed by the Japanese, plus new infantry counters for the early U.S. Army in the Philippines and the entire order of battle of the Chinese Army. Last but not least, two new mapboards, several sheets of overlays and eight scenarios are included.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Boards 38, 39<br/>PTO Terrain Overlays [Be1-Be7, Efl1-Efl3, OC1-OC4, P1-P5]<br/>Chapter G (Sections 11-18 - Pages G15-G42) <br/>5 Counter Sheets (680 1/2&quot; &amp; 328 5/8&quot;)<br/>Scenarios 67 - 74<br/>Chapter H (Pages 101 - 112)<br/>Chapter N (Pages 17 - 20)<br/>Page B29(91)-B30(91)<br/>Page D1(91)-D2(91)<br/>Chapter Divider<br/><br/>Scenario List:<br/><br/>67 Cibik's Ridge<br/>68 The Rock<br/>69 Today We Attack<br/>70 KP 167<br/>71 Jungle Citadel<br/>72 Sea of Tranquility<br/>73 Hell or High Water<br/>74 Bloody Red Beach<br/><br/><br/>(more info :)<br/><br/>Requires ASL, Beyond Valor, Yanks, West of Alamein and Code of Bushido to play.<br/><br/>",

What GRNDL does to the environment is nothing short of criminal.&rdquo;<br/>    &ndash;Tallie Perrault<br/><br/>Fear and Loathing is the fifth Data Pack in the &quot;Spin Cycle&quot; for Android: Netrunner. The futuristic world of Android: Netrunner is one of vertiginous discrepancies between achievement and poverty. The megacorps that have redefined humanity with the development of custom genetics, bioroid manufacturing, and mind-machine interfacting are at least partially responsible for stabilizing social policies that mire countless masses in overcrowded, unsanitary living conditions. In the shadows of the megacorporations&rsquo; towering corporate headquarters, the vast majority experience mundane desperations, fear for their jobs, loathe their limited social status, and fight a daily war for survival.<br/><br/>The sixty new cards of Fear and Loathing (three copies each of twenty individual cards) translate this dichotomous existence to your games of Android: Netrunner. On the one hand, you have powerful and exploitive business entities like GRNDL, a subsidiary of the Weyland Consortium, and on the other, you have the beaten down and fearful masses. But there are other categories, too, and while many people may be driven to silence, the game&rsquo;s Runners and other spirited individuals, like the investigative reporter Tallie Perrault, are driven to action.<br/><br/>",

It depicts the stand of Rodmistev's 13th Guards Division in the crucible of Stalingrad! This module contains two Red Barricades: ASL Historical Module 1-style maps, NKVD troops, more commissars, and new terrain types for urban combat.<br/><br/>There are 17 scenarios and 4 campaign games included: one short 'mini-CG' using a small map section and lasting four CG dates for a total of seven possible scenarios (due to the option of counterattack scenarios); one short CG using the entire map and lasting five CG dates (seven possible scenarios); one large CG lasting nine CG dates (14 possible scenarios); and a 'monster' CG lasting 14 CG dates (22 possible scenarios).

Valor of the Guards, the seventh Historical ASL module, takes ASL players to the streets of downtown Stalingrad where the German 6th Army and the Soviet 62nd Army would clash for weeks ending with the surrender of the German Army in January of 1943.<br/><br/>The map for Valor of the Guards encompasses a vast area, extending from the north of the 9th January Square to the south of the Square of Fallen Heros (&quot;Red Square&quot;) and from the west of the Stalingrad-1 Rail Station to the banks of the Volga and the critical ferry landings in the east. The hand-painted artwork of Don Petros brings the tortured landscape of the ruined city to life. New terrain types like gutted and partially collapsed buildings and rail cars give veterans of Red Barricades new challenges in their continued conquest or defense of Stalingrad!<br/><br/>Valor of the Guards contains:<br/><br/>     2 22&quot;x32&quot; mapsheets<br/>     5 countersheets<br/>     ASL rules chapter V (V1-V32, O1-O6) (new terrain and 4!

Play Impossible Mode to make competitive play even more hard-core.<br/><br/>The eight superheroes and twelve super-villains from Heroes Unite have been reimagined for the ultimate co-operative showdown.

Doubles all require their owner to spend a click to play them, in addition to their normal costs, meaning they&rsquo;re high-risk gambles in a game that&rsquo;s as full of bluffs, counter-bluffs, risks, and gambles as Android: Netrunner.<br/><br/>Still, if you play them right, these Doubles can offer tremendous rewards. In Double Time, you&rsquo;ll find a significant focus on these events. Twenty-one of them are mixed into the Data Pack&rsquo;s sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards), along with new hardware, programs, ice, upgrades, and more. Will you sacrifice versatility for raw power? It&rsquo;s time to Double down!<br/><br/>",

The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.<br/><br/>Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>This particular box, The Family Box, comes also with Alhambra: The Vizier's Favor expansion and a Pro version of Granada game.<br/><br/>The Vizier's Favor expansion adds 4 new modules to Alhambra:<br/><br/>1. The primary module is &quot;The Vizier's Favor&quot;, which allows players to buy a building out of turn but has to be paid with exact amount.<br/><br/>2. &quot;The Builders Huts&quot; (Die Bauh&uuml;tte) introduces a number of new tiles that only count in the scoring when other tiles of the same color are built next to them. Hut tiles are free, but their number is limited to three per player.<br/><br/>3. With the &quot;The Currency Exchange&quot; (Wechselstube), players can buy building tiles by mixing different currencies.<br/><br/>4. The fourth module is a set of bonus cards that are dealt to the players. Each of the tiles shows a particular building. If the matching building is part of your Alhambra, then the bonus card can be revealed and will count as another building of that category.<br/><br/>About Granada, also called as Alhambra Advanced: it is a standalone game the players develop the city of Granada next to Sierra Nevada, where the famous Alhambra stands, by buying building tiles to construct the city which will earn the most victory points. Building tiles now have two sides and there are new building types for which the value is set during the game.<br/><br/>",

There has never been a more dire need for Heroes. Everyone who remains must rise up, must unite, and must risk everything to preserve what little spirit remains.<br/><br/>Tiny Epic Defenders The Dark War, an expansion to Tiny Epic Defenders, is the latest installment in Chronicles of Aughmoore. It introduces new Heroic characters like the Lionkin Charioteer and the Birdfolk Shadow Walker. It also introduces new Epic Foes, new Dire Enemies, and new Artifacts, but more importantly it introduces new and exciting features that keep players making difficult choices from the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>These new features include a Campaign Mode, with Enemy Generals, Skills that Heroes can learn, Advanced Regions and Caravans.<br/><br/>Caravans represent the shattered homes of villagers during this dark time and are spread across all the Regions. Players are faced with the additional challenge of rescuing these Caravans and escorting them safely to the Capital City before they are can defeat the Epic Foe.<br/><br/>Skills are useful abilities players can assign to their Heroes and require Experience Points to activate. Experience Points are now earned during play by making meaningful decisions that help the party reach their goals.<br/><br/>The Campaign Mode plays like an evolving gauntlet challenge, where players must play through the game multiple times facing Generals at the intervals instead of the regular Epic Foe. The different abilities players will have at their disposal, as well as the threats they face, are unique to each Campaign and evolve with the choices players make during each Campaign. If players can survive long enough, they will face an Epic Foe at the conclusion of the Campaign.<br/><br/>The Advanced Regions introduce new threats and also new abilities to aid the players in The Dark War. These new threats and abilities come in the way of 3D constructs like a giant Tree Heroes can hide in, a flying Manticore Heroes can ride, or mysterious Sandstorms! They play a big part of the evolving Campaign Mode. Each Advanced Region features a dark, harmful, side and a light, helpful, side. As player progress through the Campaign Mode, they will work to restore the dark regions to their helpful side. Making the right choices to restore these Regions and rescue the Caravans are critical to achieving victory in Campaign Mode.<br/><br/><br/>For a deluxe edition of this expansion, see Tiny Epic Defenders: The Dark War – Deluxe Edition<br/><br/>",

Well, not quite, as in this game you hold your cards so that they're visible only to other players. To assist other players in playing a card, you must give them hints regarding the numbers or the colors of their cards. Players must act as a team to avoid errors and to finish the fireworks display before they run out of cards.<br/><br/>An extra suit of cards, rainbow colored, is also provided for advanced or variant play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Galactic Empire may technically control Tatooine, but on the planet&rsquo;s surface, the rules are seldom determined by laws made light-years away. Crime is the closest thing to government that Tatooine has, and all crime on Tatooine feeds back to Jabba the Hutt. Jabba has spent decades establishing his criminal empire and crushing all competitors. Now, he can help guide your mercenaries' strike team to victory with the Jabba the Hutt Villain Pack.<br/><br/>Three new Agenda cards invite you to spread the might of Jabba the Hutt across the Star Wars galaxy, even when the Rebel heroes venture beyond Tatooine itself. When he takes the battlefield himself, Jabba the Hutt offers a formidable presence in your campaign or skirmish. Though he prefers to stay out of direct combat and his great bulk makes it difficult for him to move quickly, Jabba excels at ordering his minions into battle and subtly undermining your enemy&rsquo;s plans. With this Villain Pack, your options for using Jabba the Hutt to control the crime world are nearly unmatched.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require the Jabba's Realm expansion.<br/><br/>",

He is the frozen death that splits bone; he is the frostbite that corrupts flesh. Rukar is followed by the insane Gruggar who revels in reckless bloodshed, and the wily Bragg who uses magic trickery to destroy his foes. With them come hordes of fleet-footed Chargers, and the cunning magician-warriors known as Thwarters. Onward these proud reavers march across frozen wastelands, hastening to Grognack and the promise of bloody war.<br/><br/>But the marchers have not gone undetected! From the depths of his volcanic fortress, Prince Elien of the Phoenix Elves reveals weapons previously kept hidden. From the heights of the greatest volcano comes Rahlee, swooping down on the enemy with her giant eagle. The fire mage Laleya blasts attackers from afar, and the much-feared Holleas summons frightening Fire Beasts from what some claim are the depths of the Hells themselves. These terrible beasts have no qualms about destroying themselves in blasts of superheated plasma if it destroys their opponents. And joining them is a legion of Fencers, elegant warriors who dance into battle using martial skills from a past age.<br/><br/>But even these forces aren&acute;t alone! Rukar&acute;s Power sees the addition of Magos, the mercenary champion. This enigmatic wizard gives his employer more power while bombarding the enemy with long-ranged attacks. In addition are the Spear Grounders - mercenaries from the bizarre city of Heap who can attack from any direction.<br/><br/>This reinforcement pack is the perfect addition to your Phoenix Elves vs. Tundra Orcs starter set, allowing you to bring new troops to the War for Itharia, and experience the excitement of deck construction.<br/><br/>",

As a seventh-generation dragon rancher, your last name is associated with the most sought-after serpents in the 5-Realms. Yet it&rsquo;s not all glamorous! Young dragons are a handful to raise: they are fussy eaters, require lots of room to grow, and leave behind huge, steaming piles... Do you have what it takes to maintain the ranch and the Draketooth Dragons pedigree?<br/><br/>The Dragon Rancher is a new merchant you can play as. It is centered around a mix of bag-building and mancala-style mechanisms, where you draw food and drop it on your board, piece by piece. Once food is placed, the young dragons can follow the trails&mdash;and grow bigger with every bite!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Bossk was one of the bounty hunters searching for the Millennium Falcon in The Empire Strikes Back, and with this figure pack, you can harness his unbridled ferocity. Whether you&rsquo;re taking contracts for the Mercenaries faction in a skirmish or working for the Imperial player in a campaign, Bossk will quickly prove himself a dangerous hunter.<br/><br/>During your campaigns, the Bossk Villain Pack offers new challenges and thrills with an additional Agenda set to supplement your other cards. You can use these Agenda cards to brutally hunt down the Rebels or smuggle guns through the Toydarian wilderness, but no matter how you use them in the game, Bossk is sure to endanger the heroes with his wild attacks and regenerative talents.<br/><br/>You may also include Bossk in your strike team for a skirmish game. Two new skirmish missions introduced in this figure pack challenge you to navigate the dangers of a Wasskah Hunting Ground, and an assortment of new Command cards introduce unexpected and unpredictable maneuvers. For instance, you may play Wild Attack when you declare an attack to immediately add one red die to your attack pool! In exchange, however, you must add a white die to the defending figure&rsquo;s dice pool. If you need to destroy a powerful figure in a single attack or suffer the consequences, Wild Attack might give you the edge you need.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require The Bespin Gambit expansion.<br/><br/>",

The treasure chests are worth points for being brought to buildings that match their color.<br/><br/>The Architect Cards<br/>These have a double function. They allow an additional remodeling of your Alhambra, but can also be used as money cards.<br/><br/>The Bazaars<br/>These add a new building type to the game. When built to their best use, they can bring up to 24 extra victory points. The points are gained by having buildings of matching colors built next to them.<br/><br/>The Attackers<br/>The palace is being attacked. Lookouts keep a close watch for the attackers to try and figure out which direction the attack is coming from. This allows the player to build protective walls in that direction.

Still, the Rebellion's losses could have been much greater. They were lucky to escape with the majority of their command structure intact, and the very fact the Rebellion was able to continue its liberation efforts after the battle owed much to the GR-75 medium transport and the role it played during the famous evacuation effort.<br/><br/>Recreate the drama of the Rebellion's desperate escape from Hoth and explore new adventures in the Star Wars galaxy with the Rebel Transport Expansion Pack for the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game!

Control your destiny.<br/><br/>Data and Destiny is the fourth deluxe expansion for Android: Netrunner The Card Game, focusing on media giant NBN and three groundbreaking Runners.<br/><br/>In the world of Android: Netrunner, knowledge is just about everything, and no one has more or better access to the knowledge that humanity has collected and stored on the network than info-giant NBN. After all, not only does NBN boast the most pervasive data network ever imagined, it literally controls the infrastructure, media, and messages that define modern society. Accordingly, amid the 165 cards from Data and Destiny (three copies each of fifty-five different cards), you'll find a wealth of new media-focused assets, agendas, and resources. You'll be selectively targeted by new advertisements and tagged by new ice as NBN launches the initiatives of three new divisions, each of which rolls out with a new identity card.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, even as Data and Destiny lends new strength to NBN's efforts to shape the world in which we live, it unleashes chaos upon that world in the form of three new Runners. One is a network security officer sent to hack servers with the full blessings of Globalsec. One is a bioroid mysteriously set free from the Third Directive. One is a mysterious and predatory presence on the net, devouring all that it encounters. Each represents a unique take on the Runner's experience and, more than that, each introduces a new Runner mini-faction, so that for the first time since the Core Set, Data and Destiny explores brand new Runner paradigms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website:    <br/>The critically acclaimed game of dungeon delving, kill-stealing and cooperative - backstabbing becomes even more challenging with the inclusion of a NEW game mechanic, an Event Deck that makes even the most familiar Encounters new again. And mixed among the Events are ways to earn powerful new Relics that confer game changing abilities upon their owners.<br/><br/>Plus, this set includes 15 of the deadliest creatures yet. Can you resist the lure of a 14-card hand? Will you succumb to the PVP inducing effects of Voodoo? Or will you become a horrific beast yourself in the final moments and turn on your companions?<br/><br/>Okay, that's what it says on the box... what's it really like?<br/><br/>Relics and Ruin is the second expansion to Cutthroat Caverns and what an expansion it is! First, let me highlight the fact that several of the Encounters and the inspiration for the Event Deck came from you, the fans, in our Create an Encounter Contest. Sure, we beat 'em into shape - but these amazingly compelling encounters get right at the heart of what players wanted - because players created them. And as you will see, they are deadlier than ever - with many new and unique ways to challenge players to work with and against each other.<br/><br/>Plus, the Event Deck is an inspired way to keep the game evergreen. Sure you may have faced the Boogens countless times, but thanks to an Event card, some dark power may have them swinging for double damage or you may find yourself in close quarters with a gimped hand. Or perhaps your next run in with Fear will lead to a friendly side wager about who can swing hardest in a given turn - with added Prestige on the line.<br/><br/>To balance the harsher environment, you will be able to earn powerful Relics. Unlike the Items in the base game, many of these items have game-long abilities to give you an edge over your companions. For example, Vampiric Bracers grants the ability to gain life for powerful attacks, while Talisman of Renown gains an additional Prestige Point every time you gain Prestige. But items of this magnitude aren't just lying around, they must be earned. Perhaps it will require a sacrifice of life to claim one or maybe playing the last action card before the creature dies is the key. It sets up an interesting situation in that you may find yourself deciding between taking action to score a kill - or a Relic.<br/><br/>And speaking of the Relics - many of them are real items created by real artisans. Yep, you can own some of them by contacting the creators in our gallery. And of course, the gallery is full to brimming with more great art from artists around the world and we encourage you to visit their personal galleries to see more of their great works.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an expansion that is not to be missed!<br/><br/><br/>Relics and Ruin will also feature some of the winners from the Create Your Own Enounter Contest including:<br/><br/>    6 MERCURY by Claus Jensen<br/>    3 VENOM SLINGER by Greg Dapkus<br/>    2 WEREBOAR by Fred Barnard<br/><br/><br/>And the GRAND PRIZE Winner:<br/>GLUTTONY by Miles Armstrong<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Defenders of the Realm: The Dragon Expansion provides the means to ramp up, ease up, expand and customize your Defenders of the Realm gaming experience in a variety of ways. The three new Dragon Generals (Onyx - black, Hemlock - green, Brimstone - red) can be used with Sapphire, the original blue Dragon, in a struggle that will severely test the mettle of the Heroes of the Realm. The new General card for Sapphire gives her an additional hit point for each other Dragon in play.<br/><br/>You can also mix and match the new Generals with the existing Generals. The new Generals minions' each have their own special abilities:<br/><br/>     Onyx's (black) Zealots go berserk when fighting - the survivors together dealing one point of damage after each combat action. You'll still take a wound from each if you remain in the same area with them at the end of your turn.<br/>     Hemlock's (green) Imps propagate quickly (whenever you place an Imp, another one pops up in every adjacent space) and steal a random card from you if you remain in the same space with them at the end of your turn.<br/>     Brimstone's (red) Fire Elementals spontaneously combust whenever three of them get together, setting the area on fire. Areas on fire require 2 Actions to move into, taint whenever three minions are present, instead of 4 and deal wounds to Heroes remaining in the area at the end of their turns.<br/><br/><br/>The Generals each have their own special nastiness as well. For example, Brimstone, instead of moving along the usual red-General path, moves every time her card comes up when Darkness Spreads, flitting here and there and setting the world on fire. Players can lose cards when attacking Hemlock.<br/><br/>Any of the new dragons can also be used as an Agent of the Dark Lord when playing with at least one of the original Generals (Varkolak, Gorgut, or Balazarg). You can add up to 5 of the 10 Global Effects Cards (5 Good, 5 Bad) to the Darkness Spreads deck to adjust the toughness of your campaign. Likewise, a number of Royal Blessing Tokens (4 max) can also be added to the game. Royal Blessings allow players to either ignore a Darkness Spreads card, remove a taint crystal or prevent a General from moving.<br/><br/>For a more Campaign-style game, players can utilize the King's Champion Scoring Variant which allows players to track their feats, major and minor. Feat examples include: taking on 3 minions at once, killing two with one blow, attempting to complete a quest, successfully completing a quest, healing the land, putting out a fire, dealing wounds or the killing blow to a General... The player with the most fame at the end of the game becomes the King's Champion. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th most famous Heroes also receive titles and awards. The titles and awards each provide a special ability to that character that can be utilized the next time it is played by the same player.<br/><br/>Scheduled to debut at Spiel 2010 is the Dragon Expansion (formerly the Black Dragon expansion), which consists of the following:<br/><br/>3 General Miniatures (3 Dragons) <br/>3 New General Cards<br/>1 New Sapphire (Blue Dragon) General Card<br/>4 Wound Tokens 1 for each General <br/>3 Agents of the Dark Lord Cards<br/>10 Fire Tokens <br/>4 Royal Blessing Tokens<br/>1 Royal Blessing Card <br/>12 New Quest Cards<br/>10 Global Effects Cards <br/>1 Fame Card<br/>6 New Special Cards <br/>New Darkness Spreads Deck<br/>New Hero Cards Deck <br/>King&rsquo;s Champion Variant Scoring Tokens <br/>7 Kings Champion Reward Cards<br/>Rulebook and A Story from the Realm<br/><br/>",

He is always eager to rush into battle, and he has brought with him the priest Tordok who uses defensive runes to protect his fellow Dwarves. Joining them is the vicious fighter Halvor, who would gladly sacrifice himself to land a killing blow on an enemy soldier. These mighty champions are followed by the stoutest of Dwarf warriors known as Guardsmen, whose armor lets them shrug off blows that would fell ordinary folk. And the Dwarves have not stopped there - joining the fray are ancient siege weapons. Dwarven Ballistas are stronger than those employed by other folk - they fire bolts that can punch straight through solid stone!<br/><br/>But the Cave Goblin Sneeks has not been idle. He too has drafted new troops to his cause including the opportunistic champions Reeker and Krag, and the frighteningly strange shaman known as Scagg. Strange cries fill the air as Beast Riders swarm from their mountain dens. These Goblins ride strange creatures into battle, quickly overrunning the enemy. Goblin Climbers appear at the highest mountain ridges, firing their bows as they advance. These warriors care little for fortifications, scaling the strongest of walls with ease.<br/><br/>And as the Dwarves and Goblins prepare to escalate their ancient war, even stranger warriors appear on the field of battle! The mercenary champion Malevolence offers her magic blade to the highest bidder, and the plague-ridden Vermin will fight for any army that will brave their diseased presence.<br/><br/>This reinforcement pack is the perfect addition to your Guild Dwarves vs. Cave Goblins starter set, allowing you to bring new troops to the War for Itharia, and experience the excitement of deck construction.<br/><br/><br/>Grungor&acute;s Charge Includes: - 32 Cards<br/><br/>Guild Dwarves<br/>&bull;1 Grungor - Champion<br/>&bull;1 Halvor - Champion<br/>&bull;1 Tordok - Champion<br/>&bull;5 Guardsmen - Common<br/>&bull;5 Ballistas - Common<br/><br/>Cave Goblins<br/>&bull;1 Reeker - Champion<br/>&bull;1 Krag - Champion<br/>&bull;1 Scagg - Champion<br/>&bull;5 Beast Riders - Common<br/>&bull;5 Climbers - Common<br/><br/>Mercenaries<br/>&bull;1 Malevolence - Champion<br/>&bull;5 Vermin - Common<br/><br/>",

The Age of Iron and Rust provides new choices for players to build their influence, exert their Imperial power, and even play alone!<br/><br/><br/>    New Influence Cards -- Deckbuilding is a key aspect of Time of Crisis, and the means by which players grow their influence among the Senate, the Legions, and the People of Rome throughout the game. While the base game provides an array of cards for players to choose from, The Age of Iron and Rust DOUBLES the number of choices with a full new set of cards that are available for purchase alongside the existing cards. Explore new strategies and card combinations to seek new ways of building your dynasty's Legacy.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    New Emperor Rules - During the Third Century, Emperors didn't only sit on the throne in Rome - they ruled from the provinces and commanded armies in the field, where they were at risk of being killed in battle or assassinated.  These optional rules place Emperors directly on the board in place of a Governor or General token.  Bold use of your Emperor will grant you bonuses, but if the Emperor token should be removed from the board, your reign is at an end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    AI Players - New optional rules for non-player factions driven by easy-to-use &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; instructions will allow 2 or 3 players and even solo players to enjoy a full 4-faction game.  Three different AI Player profiles can fill your empty seats to provide a mix of challenges working against the human players' Imperial aspirations.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The tale of The Scarlet Keys begins in Arkham with a spread of mysterious disappearances. As objects, animals, and people vanish, so too do they disappear from the memory of those left behind. Only you and your fellow investigators remember them&mdash;or so you thought. When an enigmatic letter arrives, its author claiming to also remember those who disappeared, it marks the beginning of an epic journey that will take you across the globe and under the scrutinous eye of the mysterious and deadly Red Coterie.<br/><br/>When we say &ldquo;across the globe,&rdquo; we mean that literally. The Scarlet Keys Campaign Expansion introduces the game&rsquo;s very first completely non-linear campaign. After the prologue concludes, you and your party choose where to go next, and wherever you go determines what scenario you play. This means that, with the exception of the prologue and the finale (which always occur first and last, respectively), all of the scenarios in this campaign can be experienced in any order. However, you may not experience all of them in a single playthrough, since one of the greatest threats in the campaign isn&rsquo;t the Mythos: it&rsquo;s time.<br/><br/>The Scarlet Keys is the newest campaign expansion to Arkham Horror: The Card Game. Just like with Edge of the Earth, you will find only player cards in the Investigator Expansion and only scenario cards within the Campaign Expansion. Whether you want one expansion or both, the world of Arkham Horror just got bigger!<br/><br/>The Scarlet Keys Investigator Expansion brings a massive spread of new player cards to the game, including six new investigators!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There is some alien architecture such as pathways and ductwork to funnel the lava in practical and ceremonial ways. In the Caverns, Dark Stone is melted into the magma itself and can be found in liquid form! This has led some industrious explorers, both human and otherwise, to set up mining equipment in an attempt to siphon it out of the rock itself. Of course the Heroes must always beware of the foul creatures lurking the corridors as well as those that will rise up out of the molten rock itself to attack &mdash; not to mention the constant threat of eruptions and rising lava pools at your feet!<br/><br/>Shadows of Brimstone: Caverns of Cynder Expansion offers a new Otherworld for players to explore, with a set of 18 new double-sided map tiles. There are new Encounter cards, artifacts, Otherworld threats, and map cards, as well as three of the new lava men Enemy.<br/><br/>Cynder Tiles include a mechanism in which you can take damage if you pass over certain fiery spaces. If you have a high Agility you get to roll two dice, so swift and nimble characters are less likely to burn. Cynder also has mechanisms in which Clothing items make you susceptible to heat exhaustion and burning, so there's some interesting decisions to be made about how many items to keep equipped from turn to turn.<br/><br/>",

He had been so close to victory, so nearly had he trapped and destroyed the Emperor and his forces in the ancient fortress at Karak Varn. But he had been foiled at the last minute by the Emperor&rsquo;s accursed Champions. The same fate had befallen his powerful ally, the Witch Lord, whose Army of the Dead had crumbled following the slaying of their leader.<br/><br/>Morcar needed some new and subtle means to attack the Empire and weaken its forces before he could lead his armies against them once more. Suddenly his gaze froze and a smile sent ripples through the lines of his ancient face. A plan had come to him.<br/><br/>A month later, Morcar again sat back to examine the scheme he had set in motion. He had never before considered the ancient race of Ogres as a potential tool. Their undisciplined and random nature made them unreliable as servants and dangerous as allies. However, using the magical arts at his disposal, Morcar had planted one of his Chaos sorcerers, Festral, within the subterranean fortress of the infamous Dirgrusht Ogre clan. Drawing from a magical pool of Chaos power, Festral had subtly taken control of the Ogre clan and started them on a series of raids on the Empire&rsquo;s farmlands. This was only the beginning, for as raids went on, other Ogre clans and Orc tribes came to swell the ranks of this new army.<br/><br/>Contents.<br/><br/>A new Quest Book containing 7 new adventures that must be played in sequence with rules for variable Body Points, Chaos Sorcerer Spells (Mind Lock, Dominate and Mind Blast) and new dungeon features.<br/><br/>7 finely detailed Citadel Miniatures that require assembly featuring:<br/>- 1 Ogre Lord<br/>- 1 Ogre Chieftain<br/>- 1 Ogre Champion<br/>- 4 Ogre Warriors<br/><br/>New full-colour die-cut game board overlays including:<br/>- 1 new large overground starting tile<br/>- 2 new double-sided room tiles<br/>- 15 Chaos Spell tokens<br/>- 4 Stone Doorways<br/>- 4 Pit of Darkness tokens<br/>- 4 Secret Door tokens<br/>- 6 Fallen Rubble tokens<br/>- 1 Ogre Throne<br/><br/>Expands<br/><br/>    HeroQuest<br/><br/><br/>",

Despite his recent rise to respectability, Lando is still a smuggler, a gambler, and an outlaw at heart, and he now chooses to exercise his influence in the aid of the Rebel Alliance by helping their operatives elude the Imperial Security Bureau agents.<br/><br/>Your Imperial Assault campaigns can certainly benefit from having a charismatic scoundrel like Lando Calrissian by your side. A new campaign side mission introduced in this figure pack invites you to investigate missing shipments of supplies and help Lando root out corruption, but no matter where you employ the help of Lando Calrissian, his resourceful nature and cheerful disregard for the rules are certainly useful assets to your heroes.<br/><br/>Skirmish games can also reap the benefits of Lando Calrissian&rsquo;s support. An entirely new skirmish map invites you to travel to a Lothal Safehouse, where you&rsquo;ll struggle to recover artifacts or hidden shipments of weapons before your opponent. You may also take advantage of new Command cards like Tough Luck . Any figure can play this Command card after your opponent rerolls a die in order to remove that die instead! Between Tough Luck and the other cards in this Ally Pack, Lando Calrissian&rsquo;s unconventional tactics can quickly turn a battle in your favor.<br/><br/>This is not a standalone product. A copy of the Imperial Assault Core Set is required to play. Includes missions that require The Bespin Gambit expansion.<br/><br/>",

It's the fourth official expansion for Cards Against Humanity, featuring 70 brand-new white cards, 30 brand-new black cards, and blank cards for you to seamlessly add your own inside jokes to the game.<br/><br/>In this card game, players take turns being the Card Czar, which means they read a black question card or a fill-in-the-blank statement card. The other players then select a white answer card from the ten in hand that they think best or most humorously fits the question/statement. The Card Czar then shuffles the answers and chooses the one he likes best, with that answer's owner receiving the black card as his &quot;awesome point&quot; for winning the round.<br/><br/>Once a player has at least one awesome point, he can wager an awesome point when giving a white answer card in order to throw in a second answer card, theoretically giving him a better chance to be chosen. The winner of the round receives the original black card as well as any that are wagered in that round.<br/><br/>Play continues until a pre-determined score is reached, or until everyone is tired from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>You can to get FREE Cards Against Humanity, or you are busy, you can to buy it by anywhere, visit link to see more imformation: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://bestcardsagainsthumanity.com/where-to-buy-cards-against-humanity/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://bestcardsagainsthumanity.com/where-to-buy-cards-again...</a><br/><br/>",

Are they also somewhere in these expansive lands? Perhaps if you find the lost castle and return with proof of the Dreamlands, you can save everyone: yourself, your friends, and the other dreamers as well. So, despite the advice of the Dreamlands&rsquo; inhabitants, you and your companions seek unknown Kadath, where the gods dwell.<br/><br/>The Search for Kadath is Scenario 2&ndash;A of The Dream-Quest. This scenario can be played on its own in Standalone Mode or combined with the other expansions in The Dream-Eaters cycle to form a larger four-part or eight-part campaign. As your team of investigators becomes separated between the dream and the waking worlds, you will need to work together across realms to earn victory and return home. To help you achieve this, you will find new player cards that create new synergies between investigators, letting you offer aid during your turns or even the Mythos Phase.

The theme of this Battle Pack shifts to actions in France, Belgium and Norway from late April to June 1940, looking at critical moments in this brief span where the forces of both sides tested each other sorely. To reflect this, the scenario special rules are designed to make the Allied Minor hand exhibit flexibility (which was demonstrated whenever higher echelon interference was reduced). CC&ndash;Fall of the West features twelve new scenarios printed on cardstock as well as ten new maps.<br/><br/>Special experimental AFV Rules are featured in four of the scenarios where tanks are facing infantry in settings that reveal how the doctrines, armaments and countermeasures were still early in development. While unfettered races by companies of tanks across the countryside remain a landmark image of the blitzkrieg, we found many instances of a more tentative level of engagement, suitable for our attempt at capturing an unusual element in the CC scope &ndash; TANKS!<br/> The new maps depict specific locations in France, Belgium and Norway, which have been located and specifically verified (from the sky, maps and in texts). The player will discover the actual names of roads and other terrain features as a reminder of the reality of the events.<br/> The scenarios included in CC&ndash;Fall of the West are:<br/><br/><br/>74 &ndash; &ldquo;Sturmgruppe Granit&rdquo; starts with the daring glider landings on top of Fort Eben Emael and serves as the opening to the Fall of the West, 10 May 1940;<br/>75 &ndash; &ldquo;Sturmgruppe Beton&rdquo; set near Maastricht, Belgium with another element of the glider landings facing fierce counterattack by Belgian forces , 10 May 1940;<br/>76 &ndash; &ldquo;A Most Gallant Dirty Little Imp&rdquo;, set at the Dyle River, Belgium, featuring heroic leadership by the first winner of the Victoria Cross in WW2, 15 May 1940;<br/>77 &ndash; &ldquo;The Crucible of Fire&rdquo; set at Petegem, Belgium, during the early tactical withdrawal of the BEF &ndash; features the Bren Carrier, 21 May 1940;<br/>78 &ndash; &ldquo;By These Deeds They Shall Be Known&rdquo; set in Cassel, France during the desperate rearguard work by the BEF to protect the Port of Dunkirk, 27 May 1940;<br/>79 &ndash; &ldquo;Battering Ram at Kvam&rdquo; set in the Gudbrandsdal Valley in Norway with valiant British defenders facing heavy German assault by tanks and bombers, 26 April 1940;<br/>80 &ndash; &ldquo;Bitter Isthmus&rdquo; set at the French frontier town of Montherm&eacute;, showing that locally the French were equal to the test set before them, 14 May 1940;<br/>81 &ndash; &ldquo;The Bottleneck&rdquo; set near Sedan, France in a fluid seesaw moment during the swift German advance &ndash; features the FCM 36, 14 May 1940;<br/>82 &ndash; &ldquo;Hidden Guns Lash Out&rdquo; set at the outskirts of Gembloux, France, where defiant, capable defenders held off a major German assault &ndash; features the PzKfw III, 14 June 1940;<br/>83 &ndash; &ldquo;Thrust in the Dust&rdquo; covers the zenith of the heroic French anti-tank defense of Gembloux, facing waves of German armor, 15 June 1940;<br/>84 &ndash; &ldquo;Seize the Canal&rdquo; set at Ch&acirc;teau-Porcien, France on the River Aisne, with a heavy urban assault by German forces seeking to breech the river line, 9 June 1940;<br/>85 &ndash; &ldquo;The Striking Hammer&rdquo; features a  major armored counterattack against the German-held positions at Perthes, France &ndash; features the Char B1bis, 10 June 1940;<br/><br/> <br/>NOTE: CC&ndash;Fall of the West is not a complete game and requires ownership of Combat Commander: Europe and Combat Commander: Mediterranean to play.<br/> Designed by John A.

Players bid against one another to purchase the transportation tiles that are available each turn. To generate the gold for these purchases, players must make a choice each turn to either take gold or more cards. This can be a very difficult decision as tiles are useless without cards, and vice versa.<br/><br/>As is becoming normal, this expansion was released shortly after Elfenland won Spiel des Jahres.<br/><br/>",

Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Ordinary Townsfolk, or special character such as The Sheriff, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Fortune Teller and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is &quot;lynched&quot;, reveals her role and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.<br/><br/>Some versions of The Pact also contain a few promo cards for Dixit that feature art inspired by The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow.<br/><br/>",

Each Network Executive has their own advantages and drawbacks.<br/><br/>Second, there is a new deck of Show Cards with a different mix of Genres. Each Genre now has an equal chance of appearing, unlike in the base game where Reality and Sports shows were less common. However, Sports Shows now have a higher upkeep, and Reality Shows don't get you as many Viewers on average as another Show with a bunch of Stars.<br/><br/>Third, players no longer automatically get starting Public Access Shows, Stars, or Ads. Instead there is a starting &quot;Pilot Season&quot; draft in which players pick their starting TV shows. These starting Shows determine a player's starting resources, like Stars, Ads, and extra money.<br/><br/>Fourth, you now get a Mogul Card when you get your first 5-Show Genre Bonus or your second 3-Show Genre Bonus. These Mogul Cards act like supercharged Network Cards, so they're worth picking up!<br/><br/>",

The 10 new Missions utilize 3 new tiles containing zones already filled with Mold. That means extra Xeno spawning, and a more imminent threat of the base being lost for good. These Mold zones also feature glowing pods of an altered form of Xenium, which may be fired at causing a Hellfire explosion! As dangerous as that sounds, it may be used for our advantage, if we're careful.<br/><br/>This dilapidated base is also under threat of a new type of Abomination we call the Juggernaut. This thing is as ugly as it is unstoppable. Upgrading your weapon won't work, concentrating your fire won't work. I guess we'll just need to lure it into one of those sensitive Pod zones.<br/><br/>Black Squad brings some of its own elite equipment to the mission, including the hard-hitting XN35 &quot;Crawley&quot; Bot, the devastating Meteor Sentry Gun (a rail gun that can hit multiple zones), and an arsenal of powerful Starting Equipment and other gear.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Prussian Army is a Coalition expansion for Commands &amp; Colors Napoleonics.<br/><br/>During the Seven Years&rsquo; War, small Prussia under Frederick the Great defeated the armies of Austria, Russia, and France to increase the size of its territories two fold and become a major power in Europe. But in spite of Prussia&rsquo;s reputation as a formidable fighting nation, Prussia withdrew from the First Coalition as an active opponent of the French Revolution and remain on the sidelines until the Fourth Coalition in 1806.<br/><br/>In 1806, the Prussian Infantry were products of a system that had not altered since the Seven Years' War. The cavalry although probably the best mounted in Europe thanks to the East Prussian horse studs, were scattered amongst the army divisions at Jena, and were committed in numerous uncoordinated attacks. In general, the lack of coordination of the arms in combat was one of the major causes of the Prussian defeat at Jena.<br/><br/>In the words of Napoleon&hellip;<br/><br/>&quot;At Jena, the Prussian army performed the finest and most spectacular maneuvers, but I soon put a stop to this tomfoolery and taught them that to fight and to execute dazzling maneuvers and wear splendid uniforms were very different matters.&quot;<br/><br/>- Napoleon<br/><br/>In 1806 Napoleon crushed the fearsome Prussian military machine. The humiliation of military defeat and being forced to cede much of its territories forced the Prussian king, Frederick William III, into much-needed military reform. The new Prussian army that emerged became one of the finest in Europe., due in part to the organizational genius of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau and in part due to Field-Marshal Prince Bl&uuml;cher, who drove his regiments to fight with relentless vigor. In 1813 Prussia rejoined the war against Napoleonic France and the Prussian army under Bl&uuml;cher, although sometimes playing second fiddle to Austria, Russia and Great Britain, was a major force in bringing an end to Napoleon Bonaparte's rule.<br/><br/>In 1815 Napoleon returned to meet the English and Prussians, which would lead to his Waterloo. Prussia&rsquo;s reward in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the Rhineland and Westphalia and other territories. Prussia therefore emerged from the Napoleonic Wars as the dominant power in Germany.<br/><br/>In this expansion you will find 18 historical scenarios that focus on the Prussian Army battles from 1806 to 1815 against Napoleon, plus all the new units you&rsquo;ll need to field for these engagements.<br/><br/>- Richard Borg<br/><br/>",

Though he has a reputation for being slow on the draw, his price is cheap and perhaps best of all, he&rsquo;s expendable. If you want a bounty hunter who can lead a group of hired guns in a desperate attack, you should certainly consider the Greedo Villain Pack.<br/><br/>Costing only four points to include in your army, Greedo might be just the bounty hunter you need to fill out your strike team. Two new skirmish missions included in this pack bring your strike teams into a fortified hangar bay, and a new three-card Agenda set invites you to hunt down Rebel operatives on Ord Mantell. With the addition of new Deployment cards, Item cards, Agenda cards, and Command cards, the Greedo Villain Pack is essential for every mercenary.<br/><br/>",
