        "description": "Hyakuninisshu English Translated Karuta is an English translated version of the Japanese Karuta using the translation of the original Japanese old poems from the anthology called &quot;Hyakuninisshu&quot;. This edition is the complete version of all 100 cards.<br/><br/>The game is sometimes described as intellectual martial arts. It is about listening and being extremely focused and fast, just like the Samurai with their swords. Only here you fight with cards instead. The manga and anime and now a movie called &quot;Chihayafuru&quot; is about this game. For Chihayafuru fans, this is the karuta you've been waiting for!<br/><br/>The game is comprised of two decks of cards, the Reader deck and the Player deck. Cards in the Reader deck contain the whole poems while cards in the Player deck contain only the second part of these poems. To begin the game, a Reader is chosen (or you may opt to use the Reader app) and the players are divided into two teams sitting on opposite sides of the table or play area. The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poem on the reading cards and the player that finds the matching Playing card first takes that card and puts it aside. If the card taken was on your opponent's side, you must give one card from your side to your opponent. The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).<br/><br/>The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185). In order to win the war, you need a strategy. Place the cards you are familiar with close to you (in the beginning it is normal that none of the cards are familiar). If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field. Since the reader or app will always read the complete quotation, you do not need prior knowledge of the poems. Strategically place the playing cards in a way that you can find and take them quickly such as laying them alphabetically or categorize them under the same first words.<br/><br/>",

Players act as a noble of their unique homeland to rebuild their nation&rsquo;s glory and restore the Crown.<br/><br/>Each play of Broken Crown is different from the next. The game uses elements of Euro-Style trading games along with direct player conflict to create a dynamic, ever-changing experience. Players win the game by achieving the most Glory points at the game&rsquo;s end. Each game is played over a number of Years, each year being split in to 3 turns referred to as Seasons. As the seasons pass, event cards will be revealed that will affect all nations, and players will have to adapt in order to maintain their place in the Kingdom. <br/>During the Market Phase players may recruit famed Champions, each with their own story and deep interwoven family history. They may purchase land deeds and ancient relics by bidding in the central Marketplace. These cards may be placed on their Realm Boards to build their own unique economies and armies.<br/><br/>In the Battle Phase, each player will secretly choose from their battle cards to maintain peace, attack another player&rsquo;s realm or assist others in their efforts.<br/><br/>How well players fare in Orv&aelig;n depends not just on their economic&nbsp;or military skill, but their ability to negotiate and lead. Broken Crown allows for free trade and deal making between players for resources and assistance. Some players will choose to become warlords, seeking to dominate others in their pursuit of glory. Some will be peacekeepers of the land, earning their title as a respected leader of the people.<br/><br/>Build your Realm &bull; Unite the Nations &bull; Mend The Crown<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All other players that round play as the 'Reviewers'. A Persona Card is drawn to determine which perspective the reviews are given from - this could be anything from a Helicopter Mom to a Hippie. A product card is drawn, not being shown to the buyer. A star coin is flipped to determine if it's a 1-star or 5-star review. The Reviewers then has 2 minutes to write a review. After the time is up, everyone reads their review, doing their best impersonation of the Persona Card. The Buyer tries to guess what the product is. If correct, the Buyer Scores a star point. The Buyer then chooses the &quot;Most Helpful Review&quot; and gives a star point to their favorite written review and chooses the &quot;Best Impersonation&quot; and gives a star point to the best impersonation of the Persona Card. The game ends after everyone's had a chance to be the Buyer once. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>What if there's a tie? In the case of the tie, the players in a tie have a SUDDEN DEATH round, where they battle directly against each other. The players in a tie each take a unique product card, careful not to show anyone else. They flip over a Persona Card for everyone to see. They then write and act the review out. All other players play as a Buyers, and will use their own star points to reward the overall performance of who they think did the best.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ancient Egypt, 2,512 BC, a group of Apprentice Priests discovers a scroll bearing some indications written by the Supreme Priest about the search for the ancient hieroglyphs of the Gods: whoever finds more of them shall take his place next to the Pharaoh. It is now time to undertake a journey to retrieve them. Will you be able to do it before anyone else?<br/><br/>RULE BOOK<br/><br/>Components<br/>- 1 Ancient Egypt board game<br/>- 150 coloured pyramids (30 each in Red, Blue, Yellow,<br/>Green, Black)<br/>- 186 Illustrated cards:<br/>              - 110 movement cards (24 for each symbol: Light, Dark,<br/>                 Nature and Water + 14 &quot;Eye of Horus&quot;)<br/>              - 36 Gods Cards<br/>              - 40 Event cards<br/>- 1 bag for hieroglyphics<br/>- 300 hieroglyphs<br/>- 75 beetle tokens (15 for each player)<br/>- 5 Player scrolls<br/>- 5 hieroglyphics holders (1 for each player)<br/>- 5 pawns (1 for each player)<br/>- 5 scorekeepers (1 for each player)<br/>- 1 rule book.<br/><br/>PREPARATION OF THE GAME<br/>Place the board in the middle of the table.<br/>Each player chooses a color. Each player is given 30 Pyramids, 1 pawn, 1 scorekeepers of the chosen colour, 1 player scroll, 15 scarab tokens and 1 hieroglyphic holder.<br/>Each player places his marker token on the Start square of the marker, and places his pawn on the Pyramid of Hours square; it will be the starting square for all players. <br/>Before you start the game, distribute it to each player: <br/>- 4 movement cards<br/>- 3 Gods cards<br/>- 10 hieroglyphs <br/>Now place the Movement card deck, the Gods card deck, the Event card deck and the hieroglyphics bag next to the board. <br/>You are now ready to begin.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/>The aim of the game is to get the highest number of points. You earn points when you reach on the board the pyramid corresponding to the God card in your hand and you have previously formed the name of the corresponding God with hieroglyphics. (Example: the God Card HORUS is formed by the hieroglyphics corresponding to the letters H , O, R, U, and S. If you reach the &quot;Pyramid of Horus&quot; box on the board and you have the necessary hieroglyphics [see the conversion of letters into hieroglyphics on your player's scroll], you will have conquered the HORUS Card and you will be able to advance on the scoreboards with the value of the Card: in this case Horus is formed by 6 letters and therefore worth 6 points. <br/><br/><br/>TURN OF GAME <br/>The older player starts first. The game then proceeds clockwise. Each player in his turn can make 1 of these moves (only one):<br/><br/>- draw 2 movement cards;<br/><br/>- move on the map - The player can move on the board using the movement cards. Each movement card corresponds to the 4 colors on the map and the player must use the exact color and quantity indicated on the boxes to move on the board. (Example: the pyramid of Horus and Anubis are connected by 4 blue &quot;water&quot; squares + 2 yellow &quot;light&quot; squares; then the player must play 4 water movement cards + 2 light movement cards, for a total of 6 cards).<br/>           - If the player reaches the pyramid of the God card in his possession and has previously formed his name with hieroglyphics, he can put his coloured pyramid on top of the pyramid square. He then moves the scorekeepers along the number-marker corresponding to the value of the card, places a scarab token on his player's scroll. Finally, he discards the newly conquered God Card and can draw a new one. The hieroglyphs he used to form the name must be discarded, and the player may draw the hieroglyphs from the bag of the same number as the newly discarded ones. <br/>          - If the player reaches any pyramid on the map without having the right to        conquer it, nothing happens and his turn ends.<br/>         - If the player reaches the Event square, draw 1 Event card.<br/><br/>- Draw 1 hieroglyph from the bag, but first he must pay by placing an uncovered hieroglyph in front of the bag. (or the player can choose 1 hieroglyph from those already uncovered, always paying with his own hieroglyph).<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>When the Gods card deck is finished and one of the players wins his last God card, the final round begins for all players (except for the same player who has already finished the game).<br/>After the final round, the game ends and the players move on to calculating their final score.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/>Players should have already marked on the scoreboard the points earned by winning each God card. Each player must then add 5 points for each scarab token they have previously deposited on their personal scroll. <br/>In addition, the player who has conquered more than 2 or more &quot;sons of Horus&quot; has bonus points:<br/>2 sons of Horus: 5 bonus points<br/>3 sons of Horus: 8 bonus points<br/>All 4 sons of Horus: 10 bonus points<br/>The player with the most points wins the game. If two or more players have the same number of points, the player who has won the most sons of Horus wins the game. In the unlikely event that they are still in a draw, the player who has won the &quot;Amon-Ra&quot; card wins.<br/><br/>1-PLAYER-VARIANT: <br/>In the 1-player variant, the Gods Cards, the hieroglyphics, the scarab tokens, the player scroll and the movement cards are required. <br/>The player at the beginning of the game has 3 Gods cards and must form his name with hieroglyphics in order to win the card. To buy a hieroglyph you must use an element card without distinction (in the normal version they are called movement cards).<br/>Once the name is formed, the corresponding God card will be discarded and another card can be drawn. For each God card won  you need to apply a scarab token to your Player scroll.  <br/>The game ends when the Gods card deck ends (you can decide at the beginning of the game if you prefer to play with fewer Gods cards).<br/>Calculation of points and winnings: After you have formed the name of the last God of the deck, proceed with the calculation of the score (5 points for each scarab token + the specific points of each God card).<br/>If the totalized score is higher than the number of the element cards paid, you win the game, otherwise you lose.<br/>You can also play this variant with more players!<br/><br/>",

To play you need six six-sided dice, each not exceeding 0.5 inches, about eight pawns, and a dozen counters or tokens. If you do not have any pawns nor counters.<br/>The game is divided into three different parts, each corresponding to three pages, which you will use as game boards. Print each one on a different sheet of cardboard and follow their instructions.<br/><br/>Part I: Recruiting Adventurers<br/>The first step to penetrate Taumant's lair is to form a party capable of surviving its many hazards. Luckily, you are near to the city-state of Kalazar, located between two kingdoms at war. It makes Kalazar the perfect place to look for adventurers. You must explore the city and try to recruit people prepared to risk their lives.<br/><br/>Part II: The Dungeon<br/>It's the time! Your party is about to get into the cavern. Your goal is to get through its six levels with as few losses as possible. You will play six turns, each corresponding one level of the cave. Put the pawns representing your adventurers on the appropriate square of the column 'ready' and another one on the first level of the dungeon. If you beat the sixth level, you will face Taumant in Part III with your surviving adventurers!<br/><br/>Part III: Taumant!<br/>You have arrived at Taumant's chamber. This will be a tough fight! As soon as he meets the adventurers, he prepares himself to reduce his enemies to ashes with his deadly fire breath. You have only three turns before he buries your party in a hell of flames. Every unwounded adventurer has a roll for every turn. Put this sheet 12 inches from you and roll a die towards the dragon; if it stops on him, you will cause damage points depending on its location. If you cause 50 or more damage points, you win! Otherwise, you can return to Part I and try again.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

An evil spirit has woken and is threatening to the whole world with an act of revenge. <br/>  You as a player need to save the world. The world counts on you! You must put bricks back on a tomb. Do it first, and you are the winner!!! <br/>  Game is played by 2 &ndash; 6 people, ages 7+. At the start, each player is given 5 playing cards, for which can be acquired bricks from the Brickbank. The bricks have different shapes and correspond to the color of the card. Amount paid for each brick can be the same as the price or higher. If brick is bought for its stated nominal value, a player can make an additional move. If paid by the nominal, it can be bought as many bricks as laying on the Brickbank (not from the treasury storage). After the player&rsquo;s turn is over, every time empty brick spots on the Brickbank must be covered by new bricks.<br/>  First move on the game is given to the player with highest value card. If several players have similar highest cards, they are comparing their next highest cards until someone has an upper hand.  <br/>  On players turn, can be made one of the following:<br/>-    Card drawn from the stock<br/>-    Brick bought from the Brickbank<br/>-    Brick removed /replaced. * if a row is completed, no brick can be removed or replaced.  <br/>  Seems too easy? Not so fast, my friend. Competition is quite hard, and players need to come up with some strategy in order to succeed. Here are some hurdles: <br/>-    Although some bricks stretch up to the next rows, which is acceptable, player cannot build next row without completely bricklaying preceding one.<br/>-    You have laid almost all bricks and now have stuck for some particular piece: don&rsquo;t have necessary currency to buy this exact brick? Think strategy again: maybe you don&rsquo;t need to cover up row too fast before you acquire necessary resources from the Brickbank. You need to be good at reading patterns. <br/>-    First move always starts from the left bottom corner marked with red. Next moves can be done freely, but within the same row until it is filled and ready to move to the upper one.  <br/> Good luck!!!<br/>  Notice: Game is claimed strategic, and it truly is. In order to win, players must plan their movements in advance. The higher up the pyramid player climbs, the fewer choices one has and has to be very careful. Game is well suitable for school children to develop strategic thinking, to learn better geometrical shapes, and learn to count. Game is fun for adults also and is not burdening with the time required- just about 30 minutes to play one round. Quite addictive: lost players want a replay to get the satisfaction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Movement is dictated by the number of food a player wishes and each player has a number of spaces that their character is permitted to move per food.<br/><br/>After each turn players draw a card from the research deck, this identifies either a new item or new virus in the house or gives the player a powerup to use later (extra moves, search the deck, haz-mat suit for temporary virus immunity). Following a round (one go for each player) all the viruses on the board are moved one space closer to the nearest player. Most viruses appear outside the house and need to break in, giving players time to prepare, but occasionally new viruses appear inside the house and urgent disinfection is required.<br/><br/>The mechanic for placing viruses involves a D12, with two faces for internal placement and 10 for external. New items from the research deck are placed with a D20 (room selection) and a D6 (space selection). Dice are not involved in player movement or decision outcomes.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a player runs out of food, a player succumbs to the virus or the parts of the cure are mixed and the cure is completed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Asking for a Friend: The party game that might get weird&quot; is a party game where all players are both asking and answering a question each round. The official goal is to collect the most points over ten rounds of play. The real goal is to finally have an excuse to ask your friend's the questions you've never asked before.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, a question card is drawn that has a blank. (e.g. &quot;How often do you _____?&quot;). Each player writes a prompt on a piece of paper that fills in the blank to make a complete question (e.g. &quot;wake up before your alarm&quot;, &quot;cry&quot;, or &quot;fart and blame it on someone else&quot;). All the prompts get shuffled, and each player draws a prompt. Each player answers the prompt they drew (which is sometimes the one they wrote). After everyone has answered, a voting card is revealed and the players vote for the winning answer based on the criteria on the voting card. (One round the voting might be based on which answer is &quot;Most likely to disappoint your parents&quot; and the next round might be based on who gave the &quot;Most wholesome answer&quot;). The winning answer gets the voting card, which is worth a point. However, great answers are made in response to great questions. The author of the prompt that spurred the winning answer will receive a reward card. Then a new round begins.<br/><br/>If you don't want to answer a question, you can take a penalty card, but you might have to answer more questions later. Reward cards can do anything from telling someone else to get you a drink to letting you pick who answers which questions. Use your reward cards wisely, but don't forget to use them.<br/><br/>The game is concluded after 10 Question Cards/rounds have been completed (or really, however many you want to play!) The player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>The cards are minimalist and each deck has it's own color (white, black, and orange). There is nothing inherently dirty about this game, but you can make it very adult/mature if you'd like. You also could play with kids and grandparents at a family reunion and ask family friendly questions. The maturity level of the game depends on the prompts that are written.<br/><br/>",

Scenarios are inspired by (however loosely players want), and must reference, a phrase created by 5 cards: 2 Link Cards and 3 Story Cards. These cards change between rounds.<br/><br/>Each turn, one player takes on the role of judge and all other players take on the role of storytellers. The judge determines whether they want to hear the best or worst possible scenario and indicate by flipping the &quot;What If&hellip;&quot; card to its positive or negative side. They draw the top two cards of the Link deck and play them face up. They then play a Story card from their own hand to begin the scenario. Storytellers play Story cards from their hands to supply options for 2 of the words in the phrase. These 2 words are different for each storyteller, meaning they&rsquo;ll base their scenarios off slightly different phrases.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, roles shift. The player to the left of the previous judge becomes the new judge. Each turn consists of three phases: judge&rsquo;s setup, storyteller&rsquo;s scenarios, and judge&rsquo;s choice. Play continues until every player has had a chance to be judge twice &mdash; or keep going as long as you want!

Can you lead your country to an age of happiness and prosperity?<br/><br/>REACTOR is a light, quick playing civilization building strategy game commissioned by NSquare and designed for use in the classroom to create teachable moments highlighting the dangers of nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each turn consists of 3 phases in this order: Infrastructure, Action, and Aftermath<br/><br/>Infrastructure Phase<br/>Starting with the first player, everyone chooses one category to raise up 2 levels.<br/><br/>Action Phase<br/>Each player secretly chooses which action they will take by playing the corresponding card face down in front of themselves. There are 5 possible actions. Economic Progress: Add resources to any category. Global Responsibility: Create an alliance and/or generate resources. Human Achievement: Add resources to your lowest category. Satisfaction: Convert military resources to any other category and get bonus resources. Military: Invade or Nuke another nation. All actions are explained in greater detail below.<br/><br/>Once all players have locked in a choice, the cards are revealed, and the actions are resolved starting with the first player.<br/><br/>Aftermath Phase<br/>Players with an active alliance automatically produce additional resources which can be placed anywhere. Allied players receive 1 resource per alliance at level 2, 2 resources per alliance at level 5, and 3 resources per alliance at level 10.<br/><br/>Then the first player marker is moved clockwise from the current first player and a new round begins.<br/><br/>End<br/><br/>At the end of the game, any nations with a total score of 30 or more points from all categories, except Military, (or with a Satisfaction level of 8+ and total score of 25 or more points) are considered winners unless all remaining nations have winning totals in which case the player with the lowest Satisfaction score loses. If players have a tie for lowest Satisfaction score then break that tie with their point total from the other three categories.<br/><br/>If all nations have been Nuked, then everyone loses.<br/><br/>If only 1 Nation remains, that nation is technically &ldquo;the winner&rdquo; but they are now the sole survivors of a nuclear wasteland.<br/><br/>Among younger demographics, the nuclear issue is abstract and distant&mdash;a problem of previous generations. There are more resonant issues like social injustice, global warming, or economy disparity that, while still daunting, are far more comprehensible and consequential.<br/>Reactor, engages high school students in the classroom about the nuclear weapons threat by connecting this issue to more visible social matters through an interactive and accessible medium. By breaking down the complexity of this problem with play, students cultivate a sense of understanding that drives engagement, helping foster new generations that feel empowered and responsible to take action.<br/><br/>About NSquare: <br/>In 2014, five of the largest peace and security funders in the United States joined forces to develop a new, collective approach to incentivizing and rewarding innovation in the nuclear threat field. What emerged was N Square, a path-breaking initiative built on the idea that new forms of cross-sector collaboration&mdash;combined with the sheer ingenuity of an engaged public&shy;&mdash;will accelerate the achievement of internationally agreed goals to reduce nuclear dangers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wagram 1809 is the first in a series of games designed to place an emphasis upon command at the individual formation level. Formations will be Corps in this game.<br/><br/>The Formation Command system requires both players to make a series of difficult battlefield decisions, usually with insufficient resources available.<br/>This gets achieved through a unique Command system using Formation cards which will retain information about Cohesion (which affects Morale), Commands given and the readiness of Formations to fulfill actions required.<br/>If the wrong Commands are issued at the start of the turn, the player will not be able to 'change course' during the turn, but will have to live with the consequences.<br/><br/>This will keep the map as clean and uncluttered as possible, because a lot of the action is going on &lsquo;off board&rsquo;. There will only be, at most, three counters per hex (excluding Leader)&ndash; maximum of 2 units plus a morale status marker.<br/><br/>The activation sequence of formations will be determined by a chit draw mechanic, although players are able to make choices about which exact formation to activate in most cases.<br/><br/>This, and the possibility for the passive player to conduct a range of five different reaction actions, lets both players be actively involved at all times.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Walter Nowotny (7 December 1920 &ndash; 8 November 1944) was an Austrian-born fighter ace of the Luftwaffe. Credited with 258 aerial victories over 442 combat missions. He achieved 255 of these victories over the Eastern Front whilst flying predominantly the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 but also the Messerschmitt BF109. He scored an &quot;ace in a day&quot; on several occasions - five enemy aircraft shot down in a single day. There were even two occurrences of &quot;double-ace in a day&quot; - 10 kills in a day. His final three kills were in the Messerschmitt Me 262.<br/><br/>Nowotny joined the Luftwaffe in 1939, completing his fighter pilot training in 1941. He was posted to Jagdgeschwader 54 &quot;Gr&uuml;nherz&quot; (JG 54) on the Eastern Front. Here, Nowotny was the first pilot to achieve 250 victories &ndash; 194 of them over 1943 earning several decorations. He was then prevented from flying for several months for propaganda reasons but was reinstated to front-line service in September 1944.<br/><br/>Nowotny tested and developed the 262 jet fighter as commander of a specialist unit named Kommando Nowotny. The unit had to grapple with the continuing development of the aircraft as well as creating new aerial tactics suitable for a jet aircraft. Nowotny's first kill in the 262 was a B-24 Liberator bomber on 7 October 1944.<br/><br/>On the 8th November, Nowotny engaged a large enemy bomber force singlehandedly, after a problem with his turbines prevented him from taking off with other aircraft. He reported over radio downing a B-24 Liberator and a P-51 Mustang before radioing with his final words - either &quot;I'm on fire&quot; or &quot;it's on fire&quot;. It is not known whether he was shot down or suffered engine failure. In the wake of his death, the first operational jet fighter wing was named in his honour.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this game you will find some similarities with 2 ancient games; first the board is similar to the one used in the Royal Game of Ur, the oldest board game known with nearly 5,000 years old and Patolli (little red bean in Nahualt), a game played by the Teotihuacans, the Toltecs, the Mayans and the Aztecs. In this new twist of The Royal Game of Ur you will have an interesting mixture of the essential running mechanic of Ur and resource gain/exchange. Inside the box you will have all you need to play Tlaczani and other versions and interpretations of The Royal Game of Ur.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In World War II it was the duty of all Allied prisoners of war (POWs) to try to escape their captors. If the escape was successful they could re-join the war, but even a failed attempt was not without merit, as it would keep many of the enemy busy tracking down escaped prisoners. Once having escaped the camp, the journey home would prove treacherous, and many POWs would lose their lives in the months that followed. Only sheer grit and determination would get them to safety. Hungry and weak from the backbreaking work suffered at the camps, they would need to draw on what little strength remained to pass through enemy terrain and reach neutral territory, to find a way back home.<br/><br/>Each game of Escaping WWII begins with a group of four servicemen who have managed to break free from one of six prisoner of war camps. In the weeks leading up to their escape, they have gathered a few basic supplies, and made a crude map in order to plan their escape. Tired and hungry, they begin the long journey to freedom. Their immediate goal is to reach Paris and hook up with the French Resistance.<br/><br/>With most of Europe under the Nazis control, getting to Paris will not be easy, and with the Nazi military on high alert, eyes are everywhere. Knowing who to trust will be difficult, and with the SS and the Gestapo relentlessly trying to track down escaped prisoners all over Europe, their agents will be everywhere. Local Resistance groups fighting back against the Nazi regime may provide vital assistance during the escape, but finding them will often prove dangerous.<br/><br/>If they get to Paris, the resistance will provide all the necessary documentation, and help them with a &ldquo;Freedom Plan&rdquo;. This is vital to their escape, and without it, they dare not enter the South of France (the blue spaces shown on the servicemen&rsquo;s map).<br/><br/>Once a Freedom Plan has been secured, the servicemen must travel through France and cross into Spain to win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>The game is available from the Game Crafter:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/escaping-wwii\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/escaping-wwii</a><br/><br/>",

A bold and fun experience that combines imagination, strategy, and conquering, in order to achieve the goal - utter dominance over the opponent(s) with your armada of Dragons. Players use decks of 50 cards to attack and defend with Dragons of many types and colors. For an added challenge, players may use up to six (6) dice to increase the difficulty!<br/><br/>Players draw cards and place dragons of varying colors with different abilities as Attackers or Defenders, and use Action cards that effect the entire field of play, in order to defeat their opponent by reducing their life points to 0.<br/><br/>Players can capture each of the 27 locations to win a game and advance their Avatar Dragon one level. Certain levels unlock Stats that can be altered and each Location offers a benefit that can be used to the player's advantage. Utilizing any of the 6 dice allows access to Random Encounters, and a Stat Multiplier which multiplies all values on every card. Both of these features increase game time, but offer a more detailed experience.<br/><br/>Another option for two or more players is Fast Duels, in which players simply draw 1 dragon card at a time against their opponent(s). The player with the highest attack wins the round, unless an opponent has a dragon with equal or higher defense, then the first player loses. If incorporating Regions, the game is over when 1 player controls all 27 locations.

Chokes (hearts) can be played within the grappling clinch, and end the fight immediately when successful. Locks (diamonds) do the same, but unlike chokes, score damage, too.<br/><br/>Defending attacks generally means playing a higher card of the same suit as the attack, or two lower cards in the same suit, unless you're in top position in a grappling clinch, in which case your grappling (spades) trump your opponent's chokes (hearts) and locks (diamonds). Fouls (jokers) trump everything.<br/><br/>Players pay for damage caused by attacks with their supply of poker chips; but, when those chips run out, or if your opponent scores a successful submission hold on you, you've lost the fight: the winner takes the chips.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With an emphasis on maneuvering, the brutality of gun fire, sky darkening fusillades of small arms and intense melee boarding actions that would ebb and flow across ships, GGG! has something for everyone!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fully referred to as the &quot;500 Cribbage Thomas System&quot;, this game sets out to develop and modernize the classic game of Cribbage with several refinements.<br/><br/>Players peg points on an updated version of the original Cribbage board, with separate tracks for points scored in the Play, Hand, and Crib. Additionally, the straight-flush is recognized as an independent scoring combination, and the play of the cards until &quot;Go&quot; is extended to a limit of 34 instead of 31. Equal deals are played (5 each) and at the end players total their scores: points from the Play are worth 6, from the Hand 4, and from the Crib 3. If the loser failed to reach a grand total of 500, their deficit is added to the winner's final score (relevant in series play).<br/><br/>The most significant change is the board. The &quot;500&quot; Cribbage board includes, for each player: two tracks to 30 labeled &quot;Play&quot; and &quot;Crib&quot;, one double-track to 60 labeled &quot;Hand&quot;, a bank of additional pegs and 30/60/120 holes to mark if any of those tracks are exceeded, and a 5-hole track for each player to mark the number of deals. The game thus cannot be played on a classic Cribbage board, but classic Cribbage can be played on the &quot;500&quot; board by using the eight tracks for up to four players.<br/><br/>Included within the rules are variants for solitaire play, four players in partnerships, and a spinoff betting game called &quot;Cribbage Poker&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Qua is a three-dimensional (3D) abstract strategy game for three players. It is an extension of the two-dimensional, two player game called Gale, marketed as Bridg-It. Qua is played on a 3D game board grid composed of NxNxN cells in the shape of a cube, where N is typically odd and equal to the number of cells along each edge of the game board.<br/><br/>The objective of Qua is to be the first player to complete a connected chain (path) of cells containing their game play pieces between their two opposite faces of the game board cube.<br/><br/>The 3D game board does not start out empty. Some of the cells in the game board are permanently filled-in with one of three game play pieces, called qua. See Figure 1 from the Images gallery above: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/5539928/qua\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/5539928/qua</a>. The three qua game play pieces--one for each player--are distinguished from each other by shape and color.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>Players choose their qua at the beginning of the game and decide who will go first, second and third in sequential turn order. Each turn, players place one of their qua in an empty cell in the game board cube.<br/><br/>Players may only place qua in an empty cell if it is adjacent to two cells that already contain their qua, or one such cell and one of their two game board cube faces.<br/><br/>If a player cannot make a move, they skip their turn.<br/><br/>If the current player is in a Kingmaker situation where one of the other players will win on their next turn and the one who wins will be determined by the current player's move, then the Qua Kingmaker game play rule states that the current player blocks the immediate next player's win first. However, if no one identifies the Kingmaker situation, and the current player makes a different move, then that move is valid.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player connects their two faces of the Qua Cube game board.<br/><br/>Game Play Variants<br/>Qua Misere<br/>The first player that connects their two faces of the game board loses. This can be a two-player game.<br/><br/>Dice Qua<br/>Players roll a 6-sided die to determine which game play piece to play on their turn (two sides of the die for each game play piece). This can also be played as a two-person game. A player may win as a result of an opponent&rsquo;s move.<br/><br/>",

The countdown is on in Diamonds for Water, a new cooperative deck building game from Big Girl Games.<br/><br/>In each game, a team is made up of water experts who must work together to achieve a final solution to a region-specific water problem. Players begin with a deck of basic cards which are supplemented by purchasing cards from the Market. On each turn, the players must engage with a Conflict, and resolve whatever problems the water issue brings up. Then they gather the resources from the cards in their hand and take any of several actions: help their teammates, purchase new cards for their deck, invest diamonds in the Bank, or trade and spend currency to solve the ongoing Goal or Objective.<br/><br/>Players choose from characters with special Actions. They may be able to help their fellow players stay healthy, draw extra cards, or receive extra Food or Energy. Each character also has a Skill they can choose to use three times in a game, such as halting the countdown marker or digging through the Market draw deck to find elusive Water cards. While Food and Energy are plentiful, trading for Diamonds requires them to be available in the Bank, and getting them there can require some sacrifice for the team. However, team members can also Plant and Harvest left over Food as a way to raise the currency they need for more expensive items, such as Water cards.<br/><br/>In the world of the game, Water is actually more valuable than Diamonds. And it becomes more scarce as you play - a Countdown Marker shows how water is running out while your team tries to solve each problem. Let the Countdown Marker reach 0 without resolving each Goal and Objective, and your team loses. Fix the problems using Energy, Diamonds, and Water, and you win!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

There are two game modes: Normal and Territorial.<br/><br/>In the normal mode, players advance on a track by drawing cards with characters or events from the Bible. By answering in which chapter of the Bible a character or event was first mentioned, and by explaining what they stand for, players advance on the game track. If a player gives a wrong answer, other can challenge them to make them return to from where they started. The first player to reach Paradise (i.e., the end of the track) wins the game.<br/><br/>In the Territorial mode, players attempt to occupy the locations on the board, each of which is connected to a section of the Bible. Answering correctly lets you place a banner on a location, but you can score points only if you are not driven out by another player. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Gain points from staying on the map, pushing others off the map, or even using supportive genes to help your fellow players. Each player has 4 gene slots they can customize and switch with other genes they get over the course of the game. Relics bring additional customization, adding effects to genes, mutating them, or enabling powerful consumable effects.<br/><br/>The game will come with the core rules as well as 3 alternate game modes, including a team mode. The ability for players to pursue various builds every time allows for different experiences each play session and the freedom to experiment between games.<br/><br/>Hybrids brings high replayability, multiple layers of strategy, and is simple to learn but hard to master.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Veer Kashyap (Age 9Yrs 9Months), a class 5 student at Army Public School, New Delhi, had gone to visit his grandparents in Bengaluru during the academic break and got stuck due to lockdown. To overcome the boredom, he decided to design a board game on his own when our Prime Minister announced 21 days of lockdown. He understood the COVID-19 scenario through media and came up with a board game, which he named CORONA YUGA, meaning Corona Era. He designed the layout, drew it on a cardboard and completed using material available at home, and started playing with family.<br/><br/>Board games are a fun and effective way of introducing new concepts to children of all ages and Corona Yuga aims to create awareness in a most interesting manner and spend time together at home during lockdown period. The board game designed like the infamous corona virus, promotes Yoga &amp; Social Distancing and also appreciates COVID Warriors for their services to mankind. This fun game played by ages 5+ will entertain everyone in future years, about the present scenario faced by each one of us.<br/><br/>",

Player one has to guess is it Truth or a Lie and gains a point if they identified it correctly. This can also be played as a drinking game where the wrong guess means you take a drink. Suitable for 2-8 players 16+y/o for normal games and older if its a drinking game.<br/><br/>The game can also be played co-cooperatively, where all questions are Truth and take turns to ask the other(s). Lose a point for no answer given or you want to skip. Alternatively focus more on the answers and interesting conversations normally ensue for clarification or shared experiences together.<br/><br/>",

Players will play in rondel turn order, each round the turn order possibly changing. Players will take one action on their turn by selecting an action in the top of their playerboard. As with everything in this era of Doggerland history, things are hierarchical, meaning a chain of command or top-down, and so in selecting actions, generally a player may not select an action above those they have already selected. Players will draft troops, build artillery, invest in new technologies, influence new policies, shift and transform their economies, and of course engage in embroiled bouts of combat. Players will conquer territories, gain medals and lose casualties. Ultimately, the winner is the nation with the most victory paws at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The winner is the nation with the most total victory paws at the end of the game (all paws are awarded at game end--none during).

        "description": "Addition to the classical game of chess. A new strategy element consisting of 48 cards which are used for movement of the pieces. There are 15 pawn cards, 7 knight cards, 7 bishop cards, 5, rook cards, 5 queen cards, 3 light pieces cards, 3 heavy pieces cards, and 3 strategy cards. The game is played on a regular chess board with standard rules (including castling, en passant etc), but before you can play a move, first you must play a card that matches the piece you are moving (example: to play a pawn you must play a pawn card). At the beginning of the game, each player receives 20 cards from the deck. After both players have used all of their cards, the deck is reshuffled and each player receives 20 cards again. Beside regular cards (each for one type of piece) there are also three kinds of special cards - light, heavy and strategy. &quot;Light&quot; can move either a knight or a bishop, &quot;heavy&quot; either a rook or a queen, and &quot;strategy&quot; can move any piece on the board. If, at some point of the game, a player has no card by which he can move the remaining pieces on the board, he must move his king. To move a king a player can play any card from the deck, but he place it face down on the discard pile. If a player doesn't have a card to move any of the remaining pieces, and his king is unable to move (due to check threat), that player immediately loses the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out. At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.<br/><br/>Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.<br/><br/>Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value. If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on. This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.<br/><br/>The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players. The victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.<br/><br/>",

Chefs collect the necessary ingredients to complete the perfect recipes. Ingredients are limited so the competition can be dicey. Chefs can strategically stock ingredients in their pantry, while others are left for their friends to &ldquo;borrow&rdquo;. If another Chef poaches your key ingredient, you&rsquo;ll have to scramble or you&rsquo;ll be in hot water. Chefs can expand their palette with new recipes, but beware of holding too many ingredients or you&rsquo;ll be left holding the bag (of wasted food).<br/><br/>Players score points for completed Recipes and lose points for anything unused. Each Ingredient and Recipe is assigned a point value (top right corner of the card) based on the rarity of the required Ingredients, as well as the demand for those Ingredients in the Recipes. Collected Ingredients that aren&rsquo;t made into a Recipe are wasted in the players&rsquo; Kitchens. Points for wasted Ingredients are subtracted: wasting food is bad! The player with the most points at the end of the round (or several rounds) wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

But shhh, you have to build them secretly! Whoever guesses the fences made by the other farmer, wins. Think smart, guess patiently and fence away!<br/><br/>In Guess the Fence, you must protect your farm from all kinds of harm. The goal is to guess all the fences made by your opponent. Each player starts with: a farm board, an erasable marking sheet, 3 long fences, 3 diagonal fences and 8 small fences, one red and green marker. The partition board is placed between the players. Each farm board has a grid of 25 numbers.On their board, each player makes 4 shapes using their fences - a square, a rectangle, a big triangle and a small triangle. The fences are placed along the dotted lines only. The circle of the fence is the vertex of the shape and must be placed on a number. The end of a fence must meet another vertex. The shapes must not have shared vertices or sides. Once both players have made their fences, the game begins.On your turn, you can either guess a vertex or guess a shape.

Au fil des d&eacute;cennies, le Matricule 22 a v&eacute;cu de nombreuses &eacute;pop&eacute;es fastes mais aussi travers&eacute; des p&eacute;riodes plus d&eacute;licates: Vice-champions nationaux en 1969, finalistes de la Coupe de Belgique en 1978 et 1993, les Z&egrave;bres ont par ailleurs connu les joies des rencontres europ&eacute;ennes en 1994 et 2015. L&rsquo;ann&eacute;e 2012 a marqu&eacute; un tournant dans l&rsquo;histoire r&eacute;cente du club. Un changement de direction allait insuffler une nouvelle dynamique port&eacute;e par un novateur plan strat&eacute;gique 3-6-9 avec, in fine, des ambitions sportives revues &agrave; la hausse concr&eacute;tis&eacute;es par une qualification pour les play-offs 1 ( top 6) mais aussi pour les tours pr&eacute;liminaires de l&rsquo;Europa League. Le Sporting est redevenu respect&eacute; et cr&eacute;dible sur la sc&egrave;ne nationale, capable de se m&ecirc;ler chaque ann&eacute;e &agrave; la lutte pour les premi&egrave;res places du championnat. Ce jeu est d&eacute;di&eacute; &agrave; Jean-No&euml;l Antoine, lui qui avait gard&eacute; son &acirc;me de gamin et qui &eacute;tait si fier de son club!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Parched is a coaster-based board game in which two competing players race to irrigate their hop or coffee bean farm. The octagonal, coaster pieces are reorganized by opponents through a card laying mechanic to create a blue line of waterway edges from the water source to their respective end coaster. Trick-taking card play is augmented by action cards allowing players set up large changes in the board state, and the presence of event cards introduces a small element of randomness. Whatever the methods, the goal is simple: connect your farm to the water source through a series of irrigation channels. How hard can it be?<br/><br/>What is a coaster-based board game? <br/>Parched has dual functionality as a game and set of coasters. The game is housed in a wooden display case that is intended to live out on a coffee table or bar top, so that sealed, wooden game tiles are always within reach to hold a drink. This novel idea isn't a gimmick, though, the functionality is a logical offshoot of the story behind the game itself.<br/><br/>The Story<br/>Reseco is a country with a rich history of brewing coffee and beer; however, recent drops in rainfall and redirection of water to a burgeoning kale and avocado industry are causing ripples across an increasingly arid landscape. The people are parched and so are their crops: beans and hops. Determining where the limited water gets directed is problematic, to say the least. Koffee Kings and Best Buds Hops find themselves at the center of the problem. They have come together to solve the issue using what they have on hand, drinking vessels and coasters, to negotiate the direction of irrigation channels on their overlapping properties.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rhonin's Lore is a tabletop board game for one to four players that will take adventurers on a journey to fight against a dark force of creatures from lore.  Adventurers may choose to take on the monster lords claiming dominion over the different terrains of the region, defend the villages surrounding the kingdom's strongholds, or, for the bravest of mortals, or take on the might of the great Archons of legends. This game offers both cooperative and player vs. player game play experiences as well as mini scenarios to explore the map and adventurer backstories.<br/><br/>Adventurer's have been asked to help save Renwood from impending doom by defeating the monster lords. Adventurers have 15 days until the full moon rises and must grow their strength by defeating the creatures flooding into the land and acquiring upgraded weapons and armour. As the full moon nears, more powerful creatures will begin surfacing and the prophets of the kingdom speak of the monster lords entering the fight at the start of the 12th day. If the monster lords still live at the end of the 15th day, the realm is lost.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a hex-based map to identify different regions of Renwood. The map tiles may be rearranged to a players preference, but it is recommended to play the first game with the original map layout with later gameplay randomly placing the tiles within the region. Monsters will be summoned each night based on the summoning cards drawn by players. The summoning cards will identify the level monster (Minion, Legionnaire, Pendragon) that will be summoned based on the player's level and the space for which a monster will be summoned. The type of monster will be determined based on the terrain tile that occupies the space identified on the summoning card. Each player will draw one summoning card to begin each day of their adventure.<br/><br/>The first encounters recounted in Rhonin's Lore originate from the land of Renwood. Renwood is a beacon of hope and a stronghold for peace in a region known as home to many creatures of lore. A balance has existed in the land for centuries as those seeking peace have learned to be weary of the lands claimed by the monsters of their lore. Those who venture into the dark seldom return and the monsters that lie within would seldom venture out, at least until the shifting of the winds. A fog and a darkness swept in and with it, the unspoken boundaries of old have been broken and the villages and paths, once safe in the light of the southern sun, are covered in a dark cold mist. The creatures of lore and only seen in nightmares reveal themselves again in flesh as their sights are set once more upon those who drove them into darkness.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In doing so, players will attempt to admit the most valuable patients to their ward, manage their Public Relations, and &quot;get rid&quot; of poorer patients from their wards by transferring them to other wards or simply letting the poorer patients &quot;expire.&quot;<br/><br/>Players will first draft a hand of procedure cards that will allow them to cleverly manage patients in wards and in the waiting room. Players will then play these procedure cards to triage patients to their advantage and commit medical malpractice in the name of the almighty dollar. At the end of each round, players will bill the patients currently admitted in their wards and claim any PR bonuses.<br/><br/>The game revolves around a line management mechanic: Players will always admit the first patient in line in the waiting room, so carefully playing procedure cards to put valuable patients to the front of the line on your turn is key! Each player will also organize patients in their wards in five different rooms. Each room increases in the amount that you can charge a patient, so try to put more valuable patients to the right. However, if they go too far and must be shifted right, the patient will die. This lowers your Public Relations score, which lowers your chance at a bonus for the end of the round.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each team consists of 1-2 players and competes either for the gold reserves or the supremacy in the mines.<br/><br/>In short: &quot;Mines of Goldstett&quot; is a tactical, team worker placement game played on a modular, modifiable board, therefore every single match is unique. The game is designed to grant an easy access for new players, while it is hard to master it`s full tactical opportunities.<br/><br/>Story:<br/><br/>At a time when kobolds and goblins were still resident in Goldstett, a deep vein of gold was found within the local mines. Both parties heard about the good news at the same time. The kobolds were happy, as it was enough gold to bury it at the end of the rainbow.  On the other hand the goblins would rather invest the gold to attend the &quot;All-You-Can-Drink&quot; event in their local pub... However, the fact that both parties had their eyes on the gold vein poses a problem for the opponents: the gold was not enough for everyone, and even though the kobolds and the goblins were equally good at digging and making tools, they were awful fighters. So both decided on their own to intimidate the rivaling party with elaborately crafted weapons and to chase them out of the caves...<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each turn consist of 3 parts. <br/>-The active player rolls the dice (2x 10d-dices)<br/> Those indicate which tunnel plates yield resources.<br/> Each player occupying the corresponding plates draws resource cards.<br/>-The active player may then move his 3 worker on any tile that is attached to his tunnel system<br/>-and perform one action.<br/> Each worker may either:<br/> 1) dig to exchange the tunnel plate he/she is standing on<br/> 2) attach on unoccupied plate to the tunnel system of the  <br/>    player<br/> 3)or frighten away a rival worker<br/> To frighten away a rival worker the player needs to equip <br/>enough resource cards to reach a suitable frightening level,<br/>while the rival players may use their resource cards, to reduce the effect of the players invasion.<br/><br/>The team that either occupies the goldmine in the center<br/>long enough to get 9 gold pieces or banishes on rival player from his/her cave wins the match.<br/><br/>Each player may support his/her teammate with resource cards at any given time.<br/><br/>If there are less than 4 players, players may also utilize the workers and cave from their &quot;missing&quot; teammate.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The path is not for the timid, if enlightenment were easy, everyone would attain it. It is ever changing, and there are perils to keep even the wisest from succeeding. Choose your actions carefully!<br/><br/>Ni-jū-san is a set-making and tile-laying card game where the play path is continually changing! The game is played in two phases. In the first phase players lay cards from their hand on the table to form a path. In phase two the players use the cards from their hand to move their tokens along this path. The player who reaches the end of the path and plays 23 (ni-ju-san in Japanese) wins!<br/><br/>There are numbered cards and special cards. The numbered cards are used to form the path on the table, but they are also the primary means to move tokens along the path. Players discard sets of numbered cards that match the numbered path card in front of their token in order to move forward. Special cards may be played to do many things. These cards can move players forward and backward along the path, reshuffle player hands, and most importantly: change the path. Cards on the path can be swapped out, and the path can be extended or reduced in size. It can also be split to form multiple ends.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players use cards to create level maps, rooms, as well as positions for Items and Enemies.<br/><br/>Playing is an exciting adventure of exploration, combat, and survival as you try to eliminate the viruses that are invading the Mainframe from another dimension and collect the key codes to unlock the Firewalls.<br/><br/>Players begin each Level by drawing and arranging 16 Map Cards so they are all connected. As they move onto each Map Card, they are entering a new Room and then must draw 10 Room Cards and place them anywhere on the Room Mat.<br/><br/>Then they draw 3 Item/Weapon Cards and 3 Monsters Cards. These may be placed anywhere in the Room, but must be at least 3 squares away from the Hero's starting position. Line of sight is critical, as players may not target objects behind walls and storage containers. Finally, they move through the Room picking up the Items/Weapons and defeating or avoiding the various Monsters.<br/><br/>This process is repeated for each Room until they have picked up the 3 Key Codes to unlock the Firewall and advance to the next Level.<br/><br/>Levels increase in difficulty as more Monsters are added every 3rd Level. Adding players means doubling the Monsters per Room and then everyone works together to clear each Level.<br/><br/>Players continue playing and clearing Levels infinitely.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Shields cancel Hits, while Skulls are hits that cannot be canceled. The player who takes the most hits loses one of their dice and must remove a part from their MOD-BOT. The piece isn't lost forever though, it goes to the scrapyard with other extra parts, where it could be regained by either player when rolling a Repair symbol.

All players are given a role card at the beginning of the game, which is broken down by the townspeople and the possessed role. Townspeople are trying to make it to the end of the forest, while the possessed player is trying to have everyone killed before they reach the end.<br/><br/>There are monsters and events standing in between you and your escape. Your survival will depend upon collecting and trading items, strategizing, and figuring out whom to trust in your party. Can you make it out of the forest alive?<br/><br/>Every player is dealt a limited number of location and item cards. The location cards are used throughout the game to progress through the forest. Each location card will indicate whether you will draw an item, event, or monster card for that turn.<br/><br/>There are unique location cards found within the deck called landmarks. The landmarks are what you will be searching for and must complete as a group to continue your progress through the forest. Depending on the difficulty you select at the beginning of the game, you will have to complete either 3, 5 or 7 landmarks to make it out of the forest. Planning ahead is a necessity, as the landmarks will force the entire party to combat monsters the moment they are played.<br/><br/>Every monster has a unique way that it must be warded off. Some monsters are more problematic, and even more perilous to come across than others. Use your items and plan ahead in order to overcome that which awaits you and your team.<br/><br/>Be careful, though, as the possessed player may try to deceive you. They can use the event, item and landmark cards to their advantage, and will try blending in as a normal towns person throughout the game... waiting until your guard is down before sabotaging you.<br/><br/>",

Command hordes of undead minions and cast devastating spells as you attempt to destroy your opponents' phylactery life sources and be the last player standing!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to eliminate every other player by destroying their life source: one of their three phylacteries. Each player begins the game with three phylactery cards, but only one is keeping them in the game. In order to be victorious, you will need to uncover and destroy your opponents' phylacteries while also keeping yours well protected!<br/><br/>Gameplay elements include:<br/><br/>- Resource management<br/>- Deduction / Bluffing<br/>- Action point system<br/>- Powerful combos and synergies<br/>- Lots of &quot;Take that!&quot; moments<br/>- A bit of luck!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players first need to start placing down resource collecting minions. These are placed behind a phylactery and will be used for the duration of the game to fuel both your attacks and defense by producing blood, bones, and souls equal to their cost. These resources will be used to play other minions.<br/>     Ensure that your phylacteries are safe by guarding them with your minions. Using resources from your collector minions, you can place down a defender to protect one of your phylacteries. Build a strong defense by placing high health minions as defenders, and having spells ready to counter attacks.<br/>     There are countless ways to overcome your opponents' defenses and seal your victory! Once you have enough resources from your collector minions, launch your attack by spending symbols equal to your attacker's cost. Buff your minion with spells to create an unstoppable assault!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The German invasion of Demark and Norway, Operation Weserűbung, was a bold gamble by the invaders. The greatest risk for the Germans was at the northern most all weather port of Narvik. Here the Germans landed troops that quickly overwhelmed the local Norwegian garrison but left them entirely dependent upon supplies and reinforcements that would arrive by ship or air transport. The Allies recognized the German&rsquo;s vulnerability and sent the Royal Navy into the Narvik fjord where their warships quickly sank all of the German vessels. With winter weather persisting, air transport would never be able to provide sufficient levels of men and material to sustain the now trapped German invaders. The Allies sent a mixed nationality force of British, French and Poles to support the Norwegian defense forces that were laying siege to the Germans. What resulted was an epic contest that threatened to unravel the Nazi blitzkrieg. Perhaps you can do as well or better?<br/><br/>Each copy of A Cold and Resolute Fight is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch map sheets<br/>&bull;    One sheet of 120 double-sided counters<br/>&bull;    This set of rules.<br/><br/>Players will also need a standard deck of cards, one six-sided die (D6) and an opaque container (mug, envelope or anything similar) to play the game.<br/><br/>Most units are battalions of 700 to 800 men and their equipment (German KG are slightly smaller). Tank units represent 6-10 vehicles. A turn represents one week of time and a hex is slightly more than 2.5 miles across.<br/><br/>A Cold and Resolute Fight is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Nils Johansson.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

As well as summarising the history, this book also details a number of scenarios inspired by the engagements within the Normandy campaign, and the special rules required to play them.<br/><br/>This book tells the story of the British and Canadian contribution to this monumental task, and the stoic German resistance they faced. It guides Bolt Action players from the latter stages of D-Day, beginning with the fierce fighting in the coastal towns off the beaches at Gold, Juno and Sword, through the violent clashes around the strategically vital city of Caen, and to the march against Germany itself.<br/><br/>Inside, you&rsquo;ll find thirteen diverse scenarios, covering the action from the first pushes inland, to the dramatic climax of the campaign in the British &amp; Canadian sectors during Operation Tractable.  We&rsquo;ve also included army lists for four of the campaign&rsquo;s most important forces &ndash; the Canadian Army, the battle-hardened Commandos, the fanatical 12th SS Panzer Division &lsquo;Hitlerjugend&rsquo;, and the Luftwaffe Field Division. These new army lists add a whole new dimension of play, allowing you to create themed forces for your campaigns in Normandy!<br/><br/>Also included is a whole stable of new special characters, including the VC-winning medic Corporal Frederick Topham, who put life and limb on the line to rescue wounded men, and the fanatical Kurt &lsquo;Panzer&rsquo; Meyer, who earned his Iron Cross leading the  Liebstandarte division&rsquo;s reconnaissance battalion in Russia. These special characters are the perfect opportunity to theme your force further and make for amazing conversion opportunities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The &quot;board&quot; on which the players move is a maze formed by the cards. Each hero has its own particular start card, and every time a character steps &quot;out of the board&quot;, a new card is placed in the maze.<br/>Every card is unique, as every maze formed at every game.<br/>It's practically impossible to play twice the same scenario.<br/><br/>Players move across the dungeon formed by the cards, looking for the exit. The dungeon is filled with monsters to defeat, chests to unlock, treasures to find, opportunities to seize, events that can change everything, and ways to obtain more objects and power.<br/>The exits, even if found right away, are protected and difficult to pass through. Only the bravest will dare to challenge their defenses!<br/><br/>With Labirintiny you can: play alone against the maze; or with 2-4 players, each on their own; or 4 players paired in teams. In addition to these options there are different game modes included in the rules.<br/>Another important aspect of the game is the size: the game adapts to the surface on which is played, and not vice-versa. You can play on a table, on the floor, on a chair, any surface as long as it's stable: your choice will determine the maximum size of the maze.<br/><br/>Self-produced by Mezzocielo&amp;Friends,it's their first boardgame.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is set a long time in the future, in a galaxy far nearer than you would have expected. Mankind has been forced into an uncivilised part of space due to its own self destruction. Earth has become overcrowded, and the poor are being shipped to the far reaches of space, so that the rich can live in luxury. Despite all the odds, the earthlings have managed to tame the once destructive alien nations bringing order to the galaxy. The United Federation of Planets now resides over the squabbling factions, and with the introduction of a unified currency it has made trading agreements for the first time in centuries possible. The continual mission for peace throughout the galaxy has yet to be established, but the humans are determined to one day make it happen.<br/><br/>You are a fourth generation migrant with an overwhelming urge to Return to Earth. They say it can&rsquo;t be done, and once deported there is no going back. However, the stories of the home-world have always kept you interested, and you have never been one to follow protocol. You have worked your way up from a gutter thief, to the Captain of a star ship, and are just the right kind of upstart to stick it to the man.<br/><br/>On your last mission, you traded several tons of raw plasma for information about the &ldquo;Returner&rdquo;; a guy living in a star system at the edge of the galaxy. For a small fortune he will arrange a new identity, and a shuttle back to the home-world. You&rsquo;re broke after the deal for his whereabouts, but this won&rsquo;t stop you. Your goal is to fill your boots with a bucket load of cash, and pay this guy a visit. He is your only hope to Return to Earth...<br/><br/>Game play<br/>The main part of the game board represents the galaxy and is made up of 10 systems, and each is divided into 11 sectors. The systems each have a core at their centre, and this is where random planets and stars are placed at the start of a game. The core of a system is where planets and major stars have formed over thousands of years.<br/><br/>At two centre points of the galaxy, where six systems have collided, they have crushed the cores to create asteroid belts. They are dangerous and time consuming to navigate.<br/><br/>In all but one system there is a sector that has a resource that can be mined, or collected by ships. The resources can be traded at any of the six inhabited planets found in the galaxy. They all have a space station where trade goods are imported and exported (by the players). Cargo purchased, ships are upgraded, and fuel and shields are replenished. They are also great places to board passengers (or fugitives), hire crew and find work. Entering a planetary core allows a ship to use its facilities, but docking fees and trips between them is costly, so players must plan their routes carefully and wisely.<br/><br/>Using the star ship (player mat), captains can trade and perform missions to earn the cash they need to return to earth. The missions involve dangerous jobs (legal or illegal), passenger transports (or fugitive smuggling), running cargo (or smuggling), and how a player behaves in the game can seriously dictate how they will be treated when they visit the space ports, or if they are approached by NPC ships.<br/><br/>At the start of a game each player begins with just enough to get them off the starting blocks, but they must expand their ship and crew quickly or fall prey to being picked off by space pirates or the other players. Adding tech to a ship helps them in tricky situations, whilst adding crew will aid them with their skills. The downside with crew is they need to be paid for each space run they are aboard, but they are much cheaper than having tech installed.<br/><br/>Games are timed and will come to an end when the time marker hits the end space, but a player can beat the clock and score victory, if they can win at one of six challenges determined at the start of a game.  They range from earning a fixed number of dollars (enough to return to earth), being first to have a certain class of star ship, being first to complete a set number of missions, or a set number of rounds, or being first to earn enough fame or piracy.<br/><br/>As the game time slowly ticks away the galaxy is evolving and global events come in and out of play, making the game sometimes more challenging, but also adding an element of luck, something each and every player will need to survive in the alien galaxy and return to earth.<br/><br/>Available from The Game Crafter<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with twelve pieces on a 6x6 game board: four each of diamond, scissors, and paper, with diamond pieces able to capture scissors, scissors able to capture paper, and paper able to capture diamond.<br/><br/>On a turn, move one of your pieces, one of your towers, or only the top piece of one of your towers. You can move this piece or tower onto an adjacent space that:<br/><br/><br/>     is empty,<br/>     that has one of your own pieces or towers, or<br/>     that has an opposing piece or tower that you can capture.<br/><br/><br/>When you move onto your own piece, those pieces form a tower; either player can look at the pieces within a tower prior to moving. Building towers allows for faster movement of multiple pieces on the game board at the risk of having multiple pieces removed at once, although you can split towers bit by bit by moving only the top piece on a turn.<br/><br/>When you capture an opposing piece or tower, you remove all of those captured pieces from the board. Capture all opposing pieces of one type to win.<br/><br/>",

Enemies can be spawned thanks to the draft cards and reinforcement points. These are particular scenic elements that modify the map, or from which one or more enemies can be deployed on the battlefield, at particular times within the missions.<br/><br/>When this happens, you will have to form an enemy deck with all the draft cards of a faction and randomly draw the enemy to deploy. For this phase, you can insert the draft cards from the conversion kit to add variability to your games and confront a wider variety of enemies!<br/><br/>Here is a list of the cards that you will find in the Kit divided by faction:<br/><br/>Rome<br/><br/>-Battle Sister<br/>-Papal Guard<br/>-Swiss Guard<br/>-Caterina Sforza<br/>-Lothar Basler<br/>-Templar<br/>-Cardinal<br/>-Blacksmith<br/><br/>Venice<br/><br/>-Assassin<br/>-Stratiota<br/>-Witch<br/>-Crossbowman<br/>-Giovanni del Nord<br/>-Cabalist<br/>-Traveler<br/>-Hunter<br/><br/>Fauns<br/><br/>-Centaur<br/>-Faun Warrior<br/>-Faun Musician<br/><br/>Mercenary<br/><br/>-Pigman<br/>-Circe<br/>-Head Cultist<br/>-Scarface<br/>-Obsidian Beast<br/>-Cyclop<br/>-King Vesuvio<br/>-Lady of Fire<br/>-Condottiere<br/>-Mater Ignis<br/>-Salamanders<br/><br/>You will be able to include these enemies in all missions that feature random enemies depending on their faction. Mercenaries are a particular category of enemies that can join multiple factions.<br/><br/>In addition to the enemies, this kit gives you access to some of the old scenic elements contained in the original game, with the following 6 cards:<br/><br/>-Well x1<br/>-Inn x1<br/>-Pine x1<br/>-House x1<br/>-Goods crates x1<br/>-Chart x1<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only you can prevent it!<br/><br/>Set years after the main campaign of Nova Aetas: Renaissance, in Under Siege you will find your favorite heroes to be more mature and engaged in an impossible mission! This new Campaign made up of 10 new frenetic Missions will see you engaged in the desperate task of resisting the Imperial assault and saving the Pope, before it's too late ... but you will have to be shrewd and brave, the enemy army is not composed only of humans!<br/><br/>Each Mission will be a race against time, always with different mechanics to manage the massive clashes between the defenders of Rome (including the miniatures of the core box faction of Rome) and the ruthless assailants!<br/><br/>In Under Siege, you will find 4 new Tiles and new scenic elements to represent Renaissance Rome, such as the spectacular Aqueduct/the door to the City/Passetto (an elevated secret passage)!<br/><br/>In Under Siege, you'll also find a new Hero, Brynhildr the Lancer, a warrior of German origin who came to Rome to help the Pope against his former compatriots.<br/><br/>Finally, Under Siege introduces the Allies to NAR! Allies can be added to your company and will help you with Missions. Giovanni dalle Bande Nere, the brave captain in defense of the Eternal City, will be able to join your group as a model in its own right and you can control him as if he were an additional hero, but with more limited rules.<br/><br/>Plus, you'll have fantastic new miniatures, new special items, and new rules to represent the German tide sweeping through the city's neighborhoods!<br/><br/>Get ready, the siege is about to begin!<br/><br/>-description from kickstarter<br/><br/>",

Entering its corridors in search of riches, you will have to face Nero himself (well at least what remains of him) and his horde of undead constructs, awakened by a dark primordial force, and ready to invade the city sowing terror and destruction!<br/><br/>But the potential of Catacomb does not end there! Since the vestiges of the Roman Empire are found everywhere in Italy, you can throw yourself into the exploration of other catacombs in any city that has the keyword &quot;Catacomb&quot;, and face always different dungeons created with a simple procedural system.<br/><br/>The really super thing about this mode will be that you will also be able to meet other factions of Enemies within the Catacomb, representing other groups of tomb raiders, who descended into the dungeon with the same intentions as you!<br/><br/>Whenever you want, you can take a break from the normal Nova Aetas: Renaissance Missions and spend an evening in dungeon crawler style, throwing yourself into the Catacombs in search of loot!<br/><br/>Plus, Catacomb is perfect if you want to play Nova Aetas: Renaissance one-shot games without worrying too much about having to keep track of the Mission for the future!<br/><br/>Descending into the catacombs will give you a completely different gaming experience from the base game and will reward you with special loot cards and new recipes for creating powerful special items.<br/><br/>But you will not be alone in facing the hordes of undead legionaries, a new Hero: Luca &quot;Skavino&quot; will join your group and guide you through the maze of dungeons with his skills and taking advantage of the many relics of the past that he found in his underground forays!<br/><br/>A survival expert, and ever resourceful, Luca will be a very different Hero from the others and will use a special Relic Deck to help his companions or easily eliminate Enemies! Obviously, it can be used in any Mission and not just inside the Catacomb.<br/><br/>What are you waiting for then?

All in all, a fun little game inspired by a fun little movie.<br/><br/>",

Who can best achieve the most points by cleverly collecting and swapping combinations of images?<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get the most pictures into the own gallery.<br/><br/>At start every player gets 8 pictures on his sorting station.<br/><br/>In each round every player has to put at least 1 (max. 3) of this pictures on his paletts.<br/>The pictures have 3 different characteristics: background, colour and motive. Collect pictures on a palett, that have at least 2 characteristics, that fit.<br/><br/>Then each player fills up his sorting station with new pictures from the reserve.<br/><br/>Every player looks, what picture he didn't need to collect a combination and puts that picture into the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Then everyone chooses pictures from the middle of the table for his sorting station.<br/><br/>If you have no picture that fits to the pictures on the paletts you must bring the pictures of one palette into the gallery and get points.<br/><br/>When the reserve is empty the game ends.<br/><br/>The player who reaches the most points is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Draw from the center action card pile and your own time card pile to begin the game. As you do your workout hand, the other team rests, but watch out! If you are caught resting after the other team has finished their round, you get to go overtime.<br/><br/>Every game you play is a different workout, sit-ups for 60 seconds and then burpees for 90 anyone? Probably not, but in that case you can always take your chances by drawing a wild card. By adding or taking out different amounts of time cards and workout cards, you can customize your difficulty level. You can also decide to start adding victory cards before or after the 8 minute mark to change the level of challenge. Various game modes from True Victor to Team Relay are also included in the instruction manual.<br/><br/>Once a team&rsquo;s total time cards add up to 8 minutes, a victory card is shuffled into the time card pile. Now they have the chance to win!  For every consecutive minute, another victory card is added to the time card pile until one team draws a victory card. This team is the winner!<br/><br/>",

They will have to manage the speed and the trajectory of their cars while limiting as much as possible their risk and damages: beware of the collision or the exit of track!<br/><br/>At each turn, players simultaneously plan their next move, then they all apply their move in the race order and finally resolve special situations such as slipstream, loss of control, collision or run-off.<br/><br/>The cars' movements are inspired by real-life physics: each movement influences the next one. As in real driving situations, drivers must anticipate their movements, take into account elements such as inertia or acceleration in order to optimize their speed and trajectory. The more the drivers exceed their cars capabilities, the more they risk losing control, which can cause accidents and impact the driver's strategy. But the victorious drivers are also often those who have flirted with the limits to overtake their opponents!<br/><br/>In the standard game mode, all drivers' cars have the same capabilities.<br/>The Pro Driver mode increases the strategical aspect by introducing :<br/>- Management of weather conditions<br/>- Qualifying phase played by auctions<br/>- Unique car capabilities (up to 20 different cars, each one having its own characteristics)<br/>- Obstacles and Dirt on the racetrack<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race Royale is a fast-paced racing, party game where teams of two compete to out-race, out-wit or blast their opponents off the track! Last car on the track is the winner!<br/><br/>Inspired by retro top-down racing video games, this board game adaptation lets teams of two take the wheel of a fast and furious, bustling bluffing bonanza. Because the theme of the race is &quot;top-down&quot; the drivers can't really see where they're going and must trust in the collective movement of the pack. Just follow the leader, but does the leader know they way or is he/she just trying to trick you into driving off the road?<br/><br/>Out-smart your opponents, or collect power-ups, weapons to use against them. It pays to be in the lead, but as soon as you stop trusting in whoever is in front of you, you must slow down to have time to react, and before you know it, you'll fall behind!<br/><br/>This bluff filled party game plays well with an even number of players, from 4 to 10. You can help your team mate by passing them information when they need it the most, or prevent them from crashing at a crucial moment by clever card play. As the race goes by, the road becomes more predictable and players may be tempted to take their chances in order to gain the much desired lead. Since the track is randomly generated, the finish line could come suddenly. In order for you (and your team mate) to win, you must be the first to cross the finish line, or have the last car on the track!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

There is another set of white emotion cards in the centre along with picture prompt cards. <br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn, they take one emotion card and three picture cards from the centre. They then have to tell a story that uses the picture cards to express the emotion on the white emotion card, which is to be hidden from the other players. The game is themed as if you are telling the group about a dream you had, so the picture cards contain many common dream themes like flying and teeth.<br/>Once the player has told their story involving the 3 picture cards the other players have to guess what emotion was being expressed using their own emotion cards. Those who are incorrect have their corresponding emotion cards taken away (placed in the penalty box), and those that were correct give their cards to the storyteller, the person with the most cards at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In November 1942 she returned to action with greater firepower, armour and radar capability.<br/><br/>She escorted Arctic convoys to the Soviet Union in 1943, and later that year was in the Battle of the North Cape, contributing to the destruction of German battleship Scharnhorst. She subsequently assisted in the Normandy landings as part of Operation Overlord and ended the war as part of the British Pacific Fleet.

This landmass, called Pangaea is where our story begins.<br/><br/>At the same time, in the far far distance of our Galaxy an earth disaster is heading our way. The famous asteroid that hit the earth over 65 million years ago. When this asteroid hits the earth, the game will end and we will see if the ancestors to mankind where able to survive allowing us humans to rule the planet as we do today.<br/><br/>During the game play, Pangaea will change, continents will rise and fall, opportunities to survive will come and go, are you lucky enough? Are you strategic enough?<br/><br/>Dinosaurs will make your changes to survive more difficult and volcano eruptions can happen any time, covering everything in lava.<br/><br/>Earthquakes and Tsunamis are mother nature&rsquo;s forces that will challenge you. Are you able to outsmart your fellow players? It&acute;s survival of mankind but it better be your offspring to rule the world, or perhaps nobody shall survive!?<br/><br/>This game is a typical hex-tile and worker placement. Tiles will also be stacked/unstacked on the board during the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 4 cards at hand, visible to all. <br/>From the 4 cards you select 2 (or 3 for experience gamers) to represent in order: <br/><br/>     a number of tiles displacement of the event-locator, <br/>     an action that will take place at that new location and <br/>     (optional, based on chosen game play) the range, i.e. number of tiles, that is affected by that action. <br/><br/><br/>Played cards are discarded and new cards are added to the players hand for a next round.<br/><br/>The event-locator, positioned on the board, points out where the action as given by the card will take place. Possible actions are land-rise, land-fall, climate change, earthquake/tsunami or dinosaur placement. Depending on the game-type, more than 1 tile can be affected.<br/><br/>Each players meeple walks around the continents to harvest points or to place shelters (up to 3) but they are continuously in danger due to the effects of the actions that can happen to the continent (or tile) the players meeple and shelters are on. As player, you can chose to work with your fellow players or work against them, finding an alliance or break it again.<br/><br/>Not all land-types can support players meeples or dinosaurs, but you can buy evolution cards that can give you a bit of help, but it will cost you points.<br/><br/>Not all land-types are suitable for shelter building either or you shall choose between scoring points and harvest or not to harvest and move to a better spot to be able, in your next turn, to finally build your shelter. Can you build and keep your shelters on the board and earn the most points along the way? Shelters that you can keep on the board start earning points for you as well.<br/><br/>Only if at least 1 of your shelters survives the end game when the famous asteroid impacts the earth, then and only then will you have a change to win the game. During the game-play the asteroid is triggered and will move closer to earth from the starting place you have chosen. This determines (more or less) the game length. The speed in which it approaches is different each game, making it hard to predict how much time or turns is still left in the game. But when the asteroid reaches the earth, the end game begins.<br/><br/>Simply stated, ensure your ancestors survive the impact and earn the most points during the game, that will make you the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As Marine air and artillery support tapered off at dusk, the remnants of the convoy now consisted of two large perimeters and three splinter groups, stretching over a distance of 1,200 yards. In the containment were 52 British Marines from the 41st Independent Commando, 190 men from Company B, 31st Infantry Regiment, and about 150 Marine service troops. There was no ammunition on hand for the 60mm mortars, and no heavy weapons. The Chinese took their time, probing and scouting before finally setting up one mortar on the right flank, and another on the left. Luckily, their fire wasn&rsquo;t accurate, as the British and American positions were hardly advantageous to the defense. Major J. N. McLaughlin and a veteran Marine MP, Warrant Officer Lloyd V. Dirst soon rose to the occasion, the former gathering the men in the northern group into a tight defensive perimeter and the latter striding about, smoking his pipe, and barking out orders. Later in the night the valiant MP was hit by a mortar round, suffering a serious head wound. Twice the men led by Major McLaughlin drove the Chinese from their mortar positions, only to have them return. By 0200 Hours, no grenades remained and orders were issued to fix bayonets. At one point the major called for the enemy to surrender. In the brief lull that followed about 100 men of the southern perimeter managed to escape. As daybreak approached the Chinese withdrew to the hills, providing an opportunity to evacuate the wounded. Among them was Warrant Officer Dirst, who survived only to die of his wounds a year later.<br/><br/>We heard what you wanted and here it is AND then some.

        "description": "StarArena is an action-packed Who-Gets-To-The-Top-First_Wins!! and the physical Battle-Arena (Board-Game) to the gratuitous web-published CCG (Card-Game). What might look like a unadventurous roll, spin and move board-game on the surface, is actually an instant timeless classic due to the multiple-levels that rotate around a game-axle. This 'game-mechanic' alters the Arena-Area and Battle-Conditions, therewith things can go from Bad to Worse in an instance while the Game-Gods favor the current player, ...or not!?<br/><br/>The StarArena_Board-Game follows the Rules-Of-Conduct, these Area-Rules are printed on the back of the board so that they may never-get-lost! After it is decided who starts the game by 'Jan-Ken-Pon; A Game-Turn is always started by the roll of the dice! The D8 outcome gives you the amount of 'Actions' you may perform during your turn, divided into 'Turning' and/or 'Moving!'<br/><br/>If the Game-Gods favor you? You can use the larger number of actions gained, to turn the game board into 'Color-Advantage' and 'Level-Up' towards the Top from 'Own-Color-To-Color' without having to do: Card-Battle. If your actions are limited; You should consider spending them on forcing the next-player into Card-Combat? Since the rule is: to Enter the game _from base 'into' the arena_ you must Insert-Coin onto the top-square of the game-board named 'Sanctuary; The first player to reach the top in Card-Battle takes home the Treasure!'<br/><br/>Knocking other players off the game-board back-to-base in card-combat, makes them have to Re-Enter the game and Insert-Coin again, thickening the plot and pot. Thus-far the focus has been on the ROC, the surefire way to Level-Up is; Win in Card-Battle!  When you boldly claim a battle with another player, your actions are paused and the Rules-Of-Engagement are set into effect. Win your battle: You may continue your Actions +1 Level-Up! If you fail to be victorious, you loose your actions, your turn ends and your Hero remains on the last location, which could prove precarious in the next-players turn...<br/><br/>It is a deceptively simple game and you have to make the best of each situation, the aim of the game is: Reach Sanctuary First! Just remember; You are not the only one in the Arena with the eyes on the Prize!?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The residents are all white-collar and well-to-do, and any of the homes could be featured on the front of any picture postcard... except the one on Bradford Street. That house has been tied up in probate court after the previous resident passed away and has been vacant for the last three years. The house, understandably, has fallen into disarray and been vandalised on occasion by some of the neighborhood teenagers. When a family is finally able to purchase the home, the first thing they do is begin extensive renovations to return the place to its former glory. As demolition and construction are both underway, the owners are shocked when the remains of a reporter that has been missing for the past year are discovered behind one of the walls. Even more chilling is the fact that she seems to have been interred while alive which is confirmed by one final message she wrote that begins: &ldquo;To whoever finds me, the Fairmont residents all have secrets. One of them did this to me...&rdquo; .<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We are in the 800s. The Anglo-Saxons of Bretland are living peaceful lives, unaware of the imminent danger that is coming. Hundreds of Warriors and Shield Maidens from all over Scandinavia are sailing for the mainland, setting foot for the first time ever on English soil. Led by the most powerful Viking leaders, they set about raiding and pillaging everything in their way. Their goal is simple: Gather as much wealth, land, and fame as possible to become the next Great Viking Leader.<br/><br/>Sagas: Bretland is a game for two to four players where each player forges their saga as they raid Bretland in search of wealth, land, and fame.<br/><br/>Starting with a small raid party on the shores of Bretland, each player will explore the land, expand their colonies, gather resources, and raid Anglo-Saxon settlements while battling any other Viking leaders that may stand in their way.<br/><br/>At the end of the 8th round, the player with the most victory points wins Sagas: Bretland. These can be earned by building new Viking villages, raiding existing Saxon settlements, raiding other player&rsquo;s settlements, and completing specific objectives.<br/><br/>Who will be the next Great Viking Leader?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Worn out by the effort of laying the egg, the penguin mothers set out to sea to regain her strength and nourish, while the father takes care of the egg during the cold Antarctic winter.<br/><br/>About two and a half months later, the chicks will be born, hungry, waiting for their mother, who brings food, while their fathers provide them with heat. Soon the mothers will arrive with their belly full of fish, that will be used to feed their chicks. The fathers will now be able to run to the sea to feed after about for months of fasting.<br/><br/>This game is setted up at this point, where the mothers are arriving in large columns from the ocean to find their partners and chicks and feed the young and let the manes run for the fish.<br/><br/>To represent that, we will have a big pile of &quot;father and chick&quot; cards at the center of the table (grouped together to avoid the cold of the antarctica), and each player will have a bunch of &quot;mother penguin&quot; cards. To recognize each other, the penguins sing the songs they sang during the mating. So, to pair the couples, you will have to find which ones are singing the same song (this is: they have the same notes with the same order and color). The twist here, is that to simulate the chaos of the mothers arriving, every player will be looking for the matches at the same time in the central pile of cards!<br/><br/>The first player to match all his/her mothers with the partners and chicks, will win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SaintCards is a ground-breaking &quot;true fact&quot; card management system that helps players get to know facts about the lives of Catholic Saints.  In a fun and interactive match-making, turn-based game, players vie to collect as many Treasures as possible before the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game begins with the dealer dealing a fixed number of cards to each player. The number of cards varies depending on the number of players. The remainder of the deck is placed face down to form the draw pile with the top card turned face up next to it to start the play pile.<br/><br/>In turn, each player aims to match at least one attribute of a card in his or her hand with an attribute of the top card in play. Players gain treasures (also called jewels) which are collected from the Storehouse of Treasure, with each additional matching attribute earning a player an additional treasure. Treasures take the physical form of game pieces of varying size and color, each corresponding to a different value and so function as the point scoring system for the game. On a single turn, a player may play a second card only if at least 3 matches between it and the card previously played can be identified.<br/><br/>Alternatively, or if a player is unable to find any matches, that player may draw a card from the draw pile instead.<br/><br/>Play moves to the next player in turn once a player says pass.<br/><br/>The game ends after one player has played his or her final card and the dealer has had a final chance to play. The player who has gathered the most treasure is the winner. That player then collects all the other players' treasures and lays them at the feet of Jesus, i.e. next to the Jesus Card. SaintCards Expansions add more saints and fun twists and turns to the gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What ARE the Scenarios?<br/><br/>The Scenario Packs are 4 distinct and specific Events-based adventures of epic difficulty and challenge for the players.  Not for the faint of heart.  The Events can not really be used in a Standard game as they are very specific.  Standard cards from your Delve or Expansion Packs are used to build the Dungeon decks and then the 10 Event and 1 Character from ONE Scenario are mixed with those cards to form the 80 card deck.<br/><br/>Fell the Colossus is a brutal challenge to destroy one of the rare Dreadlander Colossus constructs as it rumbles its way across the land.  Billowing a cloud of smoke, it strides towards its intended target to deploy the army it holds within, to wreck havoc with its own powerful weapons, or even it's bare metal hands!  To get in you must climb the legs, run up along the arms, or fight through the horde in its chest when it opens to ascend to the castle and defeat its pilot: a Doom Caster!<br/><br/>Hell Gate uncovers an evil cult within your own lands that seek to unleash a true horror from beyond!  Will it be Abaddon, or another demon prince?  There's no time to waste as you unmask their hidden members, seek out their lair and eventually break into their inner sanctum to put a stop to their evil plans!  It's going to be an epic challenge as Dread Lord Vorlaat has come down from his tower at the Black Wall.<br/><br/>The Cursed tells of a land haunted by a horror, where the very members of someone's household may have become an infected terror that plagues the people.  Locking themselves in, they pray for salvation, as the night brings unholy terror.  The Vampiress features in this scenario, and she won't go easily as you face her Brood, discover her identity, and unravel her final resting place where she hangs between worlds.<br/><br/>Legendary Hoard is more of what you might expect from a typical adventure; find the map, get to the location, enter it's foul trap-laden tunnels, and find the treasure... however, this one is guarded by an Ancient Ruby Dragon!  Nothing will be easy about this battle as the dragon introduces the new Attribute &quot;Titan&quot; outlined on the new Rule card card included in the box!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guns, Grizzlies &amp; Naked Grandmas is a game where the main suspects of a horrific crime franticly try to save themself from ending up behind bars!<br/><br/>In order to avoid prison they must either &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the murder mystery by making up a believable story or frame the others! Each player must therefore divide their attention between both &ldquo;solving&rdquo; the murder, while also defending against being framed for it! In other words - the player closest to unravelling the mystery, could also be the one closest to being framed for it!<br/><br/>For a player to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; the murder and win the game, they must find a Naked Grandma card, as well as collecting the 3 Story cards shown on their secret Masterplan, which is drawn at the beginning of the game. <br/>But nothing is easy and with tons of action cards designed to both assist and destroy, the road to freedom will be difficult! And with the constant threat of a player (or even players) losing the game if they have too many Framed cards in front of them when a Random Police Inspection card is drawn, no one will ever truly be safe!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

How you play is up to you, but you have only one goal: Don't. Get. Voted. Out!<br/><br/>A game of Foibles revolves around a random, quirky scenario. Scenarios are always 3 rounds. Each round, you collectively vote 1 person out. After the 3 rounds, the scenario is over and the remaining players have won.<br/><br/>Before a scenario is played out, each person is given 3 facedown Foibles: one that they gave to themselves and two others given by their neighbours.<br/><br/>The chaos happens during each round. Each round, each player must reveal one of their facedown Foibles. The revealed Foible(s) are traits that define this person. They will have to convince everyone how these Foible(s) relates to the scenario, and hopefully, in a positive light or else they risk getting voted out by the group.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Storyline:<br/><br/>Scientists now knew it was the end of the world. They predicted that a scourge of natural disasters would hit the earth getting increasingly more dangerous until they wiped out all life on earth. The nation's government leaders came up with a solution to build a giant government facility larger than any structure on earth capable of withstanding these natural disasters and producing all the energy they needed to sustain human life. Taxes rose drastically that year as the nation's people raced to outpace the disasters and finish the massive project. It was finished with almost no time to spare but, that was when the government announced that the citizens who paid for the construction were not allowed to stay in the bunker. The now corrupt government even kicked citizens out of the main city and built a wall protecting it so that the government could hoard the cities valuable resources. You are in charge of a small group of survivors that were kicked out of the city and the disasters start tomorrow. Your only chance to survive the end of the world which is happening in only a few weeks is to break into the government facility and overthrow the government. In the meantime, though you will have to build makeshift bunkers using resources to protect yourself against natural disasters, get valuable provisions to keep your survivors alive, and repair weapons, vehicles, and tools to improve your chance of survival and help you defend yourself against other groups of survivors looking to overthrow the government before you do. This is Outpaced.<br/><br/>Gameplay: <br/>Each round is split into three phases. Exploration, Fortification, and Catastrophe.<br/><br/>In the exploration phase players have 1 minute indicated by a timer to quickly roll dice that allow players to move around the city, collect resource cards from various locations, destroy gates that allow players to access more of the map, and make it back to their bunker before the timer runs out if players don&rsquo;t make it back to the bunker in time they lose 1 of their five lives and all of their resources from the natural disaster that occurs in the catastrophe phase.<br/><br/>In the fortification phase players take turns spending their resources to fortify their bunker, buy more dice, and/or craft builds like weapons, vehicals, and tools to gain an advantage in the game.<br/><br/>In the catastrophe phase players draw a disaster card. The disaster card weakens players bunkers and destroys various locations on the map effecting gameplay in the next round. If the disaster destroys your bunker you will also lose one of your 5 lives.<br/><br/>Disasters will get increasingly harder every round until all players die or a player destroys all the gates on the map and breaks into the governments bunker in the center of the map.<br/><br/>If more than one player makes it to the government facility it turns into a battle where the player that rolls the most combat dice wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Also known as &ldquo;McLuhans&rsquo; Tetrad&rdquo;, the Laws of Media reveal the four constant rules that govern all human innovations, four questions that can be asked in order to understand the implications that will inevitably result from any medium.<br/><br/>An entertaining and educational board game that stimulates players&rsquo; cooperative, innovative, and creative thinking skills.<br/><br/>Educational and hilarious for the novice and expert alike, The Medium is fast-paced, engaging and brainy fun that will have young and old laughing... as they learn out loud.<br/><br/>This game is played in teams of two or more players. Each round, one team member tries to get their team to guess the medium on the card. Clues take the form of answers to the four questions of The Laws of Media. Teams move along the board when a medium is guessed correctly, pulling themselves out of the Maelstrom.<br/><br/>Use The Medium to analyze an artifact or human innovation from the past or present, and enjoy being the first team to escape the media maelstrom!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Twin Realms is a complex dungeon crawler.<br/><br/>Players will be controlling elemental spirits that protect the world from an army of demons. Each quest is unique and many of them have specific objectives. They are not only limited to &quot;kill all that moves&quot;.<br/>The combat is played in turns on a board (different for every quest) divided into squares and players will be able to perform actions using a deck of ability cards unique to each elemental spirit.<br/>The distinct feature of the game is hinted in its name. You will be playing in two realms. Physical, and spiritual. The playable characters as well as enemies have 2 forms with different abilities in each realm. The movement will be different in each realm. And some board elements will be different between realms (imagine walls that you can pass through as a spirit but not in physical form). The combat and gameplay will be guided by the fact that you will have to switch between realms to optimize your combat abilities, to avoid enemy attacks etc.<br/><br/>All characters will be developed by levelling up from 1 to 10. Apart from regular upgrades to health and your ability cards you will be able to choose additional perks and choose your path in the game. You can focus on passive abilities, special system of attack modifiers, additional boosts to your cards or special rage cards. You will not be able to maximise all of the perks so every player will be able to build their character in their own way. You can build a character with a very strong set of cards less reliable on attack modifiers. You can build a character that has no upgrades on the cards but most of the attack modifiers are critical hits, burn targets, disarm them or add other status effects. You can build a character that does not focus on any of that but instead generates a ton of rage and exploits various bonuses of the rage deck.<br/><br/>Each character will be able to fulfil a specific role in the company based on its abilities and its build. The roles are the usual set of tanks, assassins, mages and supports. However, that only applies to the physical realm.<br/>While in physical realm each character will try to fulfil their assigned role, in spirit realm all characters are the same, which means that in spirit realm you will share the responsibilities of dealing and taking damage. When you kill enemy spirits, you will be gathering their essence and taking over their actions to create interesting combat situations.<br/><br/>The game takes place in a unique world not long after its creation. There are no humans, dwarves, elves or any other races yet in it. The elementals and the demons are being led by primordial forces of good and evil. As you progress through the game you will learn more about the mythology of this world and what role you play in the history of things.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The First Interstellar Empires is a game of space exploration, colonization, and conflict. It is set in the first decades of humanity reaching out to the stars. The game board is an accurate map of the space around our own solar system, a cube 25 light years on each side with our Sun at the center.<br/><br/>Each player takes the roll of a nation on Earth (or Mars or the asteroid belt) that will be active in exploring the stars. In his turn a player takes actions such as: Explore a star system, that is, determine if it has useful planets and how difficult they will be to colonize. Build a colony. Invest in a colony, that is, increase its production. Form an alliance with an independent colony, or try to break up an alliance between another player and an independent colony. Research to improve your technology. And of course, invade another player's colony and attempt to conquer it.<br/><br/>Each nation has a &quot;competence&quot; in each of four areas: military, economy, diplomacy, and science. These determine your efficiency in each area. For example, if your science is poor, you may devote huge resources to research and still not get anywhere.<br/><br/>Each turn a player draws an &quot;event&quot; card. These can be good, bad, or depend on circumstances. Events include things like leaders who improve your competence and corruption that reduces it, economic problems, attrition in colonies with harsh environments, rebellions and civil wars. But you don't have to play a card right away. You can hold on to good cards to use them at just the right moment -- like play a &quot;great military leader&quot; just when another player attacks you and turn the tables on him. You can hold on to a bad card in the hopes of preparing to cope with it ... or at least, kicking the can down the road.<br/><br/>Players can advance their technology in four areas: Starships, which increases the range at which you can operate; Colonization, which determines how difficult it is to establish colonies, build new &quot;starbases&quot;, and such; Terraforming, which lets you make harsh planets more suitable for human life; and Weapons, which increase your capabilities in war.<br/><br/>Winner is the player who has the greatest production at the end of the game. This can be achieved by building many colonies, by growing your economy and making your colonies rich, or by conquering other players. Or by destroying other players' colonies: you might still be poor but they'll be poorer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game progresses through 3 stages as you prepare your finances in London, gather a team and resources in South America, and finally embark on an expedition through the Jungle. This game is designed to challenge your ability to plan ahead, out-maneuver, and survive one of the most legendary quests the world has ever known.<br/><br/>Deep in the dark jungles of the Amazon rainforest, lies hidden a lost city known only as Z. It may be in the center of a nearly impenetrable forest, along an undiscovered black river, deep in some snake infested canyon, or on top of a lonely, craggy peak, guarded by denizens from a forgotten time. This archeological marvel only awaits discovery from a courageous and intrepid explorer such as yourself. Many have gone in search of it, but few have returned to regale their friends and colleagues with the tale of their sufferings and defeat. This game allows you the opportunity to be a turn-of-the-century explorer; taking you from your living room to the dark and dangerous recesses of South America. Combat poisonous snakes, deadly spiders, tropical diseases, murderous savages, and untimely mishaps on your quest to find the lost trails to Z, a city of great riches, personal bliss, and just possibly the answer to your most profound questions and desires.

The banners unfolded in the winds and offered themselves to the currents; they presented a delightful spectacle to the eyes.&rdquo; &ndash;comment by the author of the Relation Marchianensis de Pugna Bovinis on the French army&rsquo;s preparation for battle.<br/><br/>Following the Third Crusade tensions among the monarchs of Western Europe was at a new high. Otto IV, King of Portugal and newly crowned Holy Roman Emperor was facing revolt in the German provinces, many of whom were actively supported by the French King, Philip II, The Emperor had also garnered the enmity of Pope Innocent III soon after he was crowned when Otto claimed the Kingdom of Sicily, which he then attacked in 1209, which caused the Pope to excommunicate him. English King, John, was also involved with a growing conflict with the French, who were steadily taking lands along the border with Normandy. Indeed, John had only recently assumed the thrown following the death of his older brother, Richard (the Lionhearted) during a siege to retake one of the castles the French had captured earlier while the English king was on crusade. Tensions boiled over to outright war when the Pope authorized King Philip to launch a crusade against the upstart Holy Roman Emperor and his allies. The Battle of Bouvines, fought near the city of Tournai, was one of the largest ever fought in the Medieval period, and its outcome would affect the course of history for centuries.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme<br/>The Art of Boxing Clever simulates almost all aspects of the real-life boxing match into a highly specific and player controlled, intense decision-making match experience. Aspects recreated in the board game include the stance and style of the boxers; boxer initiative, 10 attributes of the selected boxer; head/body area target selection; punch type selection, defence move selection; damage resistance attributes, increasing damage tracking; judge scoring, knockdown count sequence. In essence this unrivalled boxing game mechanism creates the feel of the real ebb and flow of a typical boxing match and the unpredictability of &lsquo;one punch can make all the difference&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal is to outthink and outmanoeuvre your opponent to consistently inflict damage by exploiting their weaknesses, whilst protecting your own. Damage is realised by the depletion of the opponent&rsquo;s card hand until either the hand is completely depleted, or a KO or TKO is achieved through a visible damage tracking system.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game centres around a timely selection of appropriate punch / defence cards from a tailored hand of cards specific to each fighter to inflict damage to selected areas of the opponent&rsquo;s head and body. Damage is tracked and consequences are specific to each fighter. <br/>Players select their boxer depending on style, stance and attributes. <br/>For each match-up a predetermined hand of cards is dealt representing the attributes of the boxer. <br/>A 10-round match with 3 scoring judges. <br/>Each round takes the form of 5 mini-rounds which involves 5 turns of attacking and defending. Each turn includes 2 potentially defendable attack moves, one to a selected area of the head and one to an area of the body. The selection of the cards and target area is critical to achieve damage. Any damage inflicted is tracked on the gameboard and consequences to the opponent&rsquo;s hand of cards is realised and the judges scoring is revealed.<br/>The play sequence thereby creates poker style opportunities for bluffing and counter bluffing, minimizing &lsquo;Chance&rsquo; to maximize player control, creating a high sense/degree of anticipation. <br/>The variety of the cards provide multiple ways and exciting combinations to out manoeuvre your opponent. The highly player controlled mini rounds are countered by an unpredictable judge scoring system, potentially influencing player strategy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players can also draw and play spells or magical artifacts to gain a strategic advantage.<br/><br/>At night, players further their agendas by Mindwalking one of their opponents. Mindwalks are issued by passing written commands to the victim, hidden from their opponents' view. These commands are open ended and completely up to the player's imagination!<br/><br/>The game ends when a player or faction completes their hidden win condition.

The ancient games include the Royal Game of Ur, the Advanced Game of Ur, Senet, and Aseb.<br/><br/>All games are played on a modular wooden gameboard into which different tiles are inserted in a different pattern for each game.  Some games make use of a modular &quot;board extension&quot; that consists of an extra two spaces for tiles.  Most of the games make use of throwing sticks as randomizers, though one game, Oasis, involves no luck at all.  Playing pieces include hand-painted wooden discs as well as pawns cast in resin from clay sculptures and then hand painted.<br/><br/>The Ur Variations is the third and final entry in game designer Zach Horton's &quot;Ancient Games trilogy,&quot; following re-creations of Mehen and Men.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It also allows you to acquire one row or column that can potentially provide Rewards according to the number of cards placed at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Earning more Rewards than the other players is the main objective of this game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Forts &amp; Forests: The War for North America, you command one of the 18th century&rsquo;s great superpowers in a struggle to control Canada, the American colonies and the vast wealth of the continent beyond.<br/><br/>But the French &amp; Indian War is only part of a greater global conflict, so resources are limited and must be allocated with care. Militia is easily raised but unreliable. Regular forces deliver power and strength under fire, but they are expensive and must be transported across an ocean. Then there are gifts to the Indians, whose speed and fierce ambushes can turn the tide of the war, but only if their pricey allegiance can be maintained.<br/><br/>Forts &amp; Forests begins with the British poised to launch an ambitious four-pronged attack to bring the war to a speedy end. They have greater numbers, naval superiority and secure ports, but much of their army is made up of untested colonial provincial forces. The push inland from the Atlantic coast will be difficult, and the support of the powerful Iroquois is tepid at best.<br/><br/>Though outnumbered, most French troops are battle hardened regulars recently arrived from Europe. They are supported by fearsome hordes of western tribes who have been convinced to take up the hatchet against the English invaders. New France also has a geographic advantage; troops and supplies can be moved quickly along the St. Lawrence and Great Lakes with relative ease. But the connection to France is tenuous, especially if the bastion at Louisbourg were to fall!<br/><br/>Forts &amp; Forests&rsquo; unique combat system captures the challenges and uncertainties of the wilderness war. Over 300 historically accurate unit cards capture their differing combat, ambush, break, and speed ratings. No battle is a sure victory regardless of numerical superiority!<br/><br/>It will take strategy, determination, and a bit of luck to conquer a land of Forts &amp; Forests and win the War for North America.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Do whatever it takes to survive this year above the rest but remember: Problematic players lose their jobs, sponsorships, friends and sometimes even money.<br/><br/>In 2020: The Board Game, players will use their turns to acquire friends, earn income, and avoid the harrowing pitfalls of the real-life disaster that was the year 2020. On each turn, the player will roll the dice, and move their piece the corresponding number of spaces. They then draw and resolve a Social Media card that will present them with a unique real world event that happened in 2020. After drawing the card, players then must resolve the space they've landed on, which may mean acquiring a new friend to help you through the game, or gaining money and/or paying off debt they've accrued.<br/><br/>Players gain survival points based on the cards that they play, and when a player has acquired ten survival points, the end of the game is triggered. At the end of that round, players count their money and the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>2020: The Board Game provides players with a chance to look back and laugh at the monstrosity of 2020.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is based on the memory palace technique, which consists in remembering elements by associating them with known spaces. In this game there are 40 cards set in 8 different rooms of a house. Each card has an out of context object placed in the given environment. Each room has 5 points of interest.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to remember in sequence the &quot;out of context&quot; object of each tile. The player is facilitated when associating the objects to be remembered to the various rooms and points of interest in the house.<br/><br/>Challenge mode. Each player takes a coloured scoreboard card. The picture cards are shuffled and equally distributed to each player. The remaining cards are set aside. The players place their cards face down in a horizontal row in front of them. The youngest player starts by turning the cards over in their sequence and carefully observing the &quot;out of context&quot; objects for 30 seconds. Then they turns the cards face down again and begins to remember the sequence out loud, naming the objects from left to right and then turning the corresponding card face up for verification, and so on until the end of the row of cards. Each guessed object is worth one point. At the first mistake the player will have to stop and pass the turn to the next player in clockwise order who will play in the same way. At the end of the round, the game goes on until one of the players reaches 20 points (always waiting for the end of the round, so that all players have completed the same number of turns).<br/><br/>Knockout mode. Arrange the cards in a row in the center of the table in multiples of 8, from one to five rows depending on the desired difficulty. All players observe the series for 30 seconds. At the end the youngest player turns the cards face down and begins to remember the sequence, naming the subject on each card and then turning the card over for verification. At the first mistake, the uncovered tiles are turned face down once again and the second player begins. The first player who remembers all the objects wins.<br/><br/>",

(Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, France, Germany, Portugal, Turkey, and England)<br/>     Put your players in the right place and take out all opponents!<br/>     First, defeat their defenders - midfielders - forwards and score a goal to kick your opponents out of the tournament.<br/><br/><br/>Defeat your opponents by using attack cards to take out their players. With the action cards, you can bully your fellow players by, for example, taking their cards, having them skip a turn, stealing a player and even more 'nasty' bullying cards! Of course, you can also defend your players in this game with the defence cards (blocks the attack card) or the offside card (blocks the action card). There are also 'super cards' in the game, each of which has a special power. If you really quickly kick your opponent out of the tournament, throw up the 'Penalty' card to take out multiple players immediately. Each team also has a Coach and can be used against the most dangerous attacks to defend you from the other player's attempts to score a goal.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Met MadSoccer breng je de spanning van het EK naar je woonkamer!

The unique thing about this game is the way in which it merges real life RPG actions with the board game. essentially the players  are immersed in the game and how well you stick to your role will determine how well you perform.<br/><br/>The game comes with a board, a buzzer (for calling emergency meetings), 5 categories of tasks, dice and even a meta game. The Meta Game involves multiple rounds point scoring and in real time Super Powers. such as 'Time Stop' or the 'Impostors Apprentice'. And you can add on 'vision-restricting' goggles to make being the Impostor even more fun.<br/><br/>The game has plenty of depth, especially when it comes to the meetings, (the part where you can talk) all sorts of bluffing negotiation and strategy comes in to play here.

The aim of the game is to trick and capture your opponents with the help of your CREEPER, action cards and traps (pre-game traps and on board traps) leaving you in the clear to get around the board and take the win. It's high paced from start to finish and you can be called in to action on anyone's turn. Just because your go is done, you are most certainly not safe. The attack/question cards are hectic and full of twists. Those who you think are your friends often turn out to be enemies and you are all but guaranteed to have to choose between one friend or another. We take no responsibility for any arguments that follow. Do you trap your kid or let your partner win? Will you put yourself in a trap just to send your best friend back to the start? OF COURSE YOU WILL! Be ruthless. Be bold.<br/><br/>Yes, we know that the vast majority of games claim to be equally as fun for parents as it is for kids but this one actually is... Trust me, as a parent there is little I enjoy more than the look on a kid's face go from joy and smugness when they think they are going to win, to despair and anger when they slowly realise they most certainly are not. It's like a fun punishment. &quot;Funishment,&quot; if you will... After all, they'd most certainly do it to you! Life isn't fair and they will soon realise this.<br/><br/>",

They will set traps and throw a variety of challenges at you. Their pets will try to tear you up, and their dark moods will threaten your mental health.<br/><br/>Your role is to be patient and not get stuffed. The good part is, that the energy and ideas of the little Villennials are not limitless.

The key is to keep your Endurance and Patience stats up while trying to avoid stacking the Dark Mood tokens on the Villennials cards.

        "description": "Are you more logical or creative?  <br/>Here is a very original party game that tests your problem solving skills, stimulating lateral thinking: the winner is the one who finds the most solutions using unusual tools and unleashing ... genius!<br/><br/>The player whose turn it is draws 4 instrument maps, placing them face up and side by side.  Then he draws a situation card and reads aloud the text corresponding to the color where his placeholder is on the board.  At this point each competitor, within the time of an hourglass, must find an effective and brilliant solution using the greatest number of tools discovered.  Solutions must be written on the slate.  If the current player is on the pencil box, the competitors will have to describe the solution only through the drawing.  In this case the player whose turn it is reads any problem from the drawn card.  When the time is up, the players present their solutions and calculate the scores.  The game continues with another round: the new player on duty draws an instrument map and replaces it, at his choice, with one of those already active on the table, then draws a situation card and proceeds to a new game.  .  Scoring and end of the game If a solution is not considered valid by the majority of the players, it is discarded.  The players who find a valid solution advance one square for each map-tool used.  If a competitor has found a different solution from the others (original solution), he doubles the score.  The winner is the first to finish 3 laps of the board (or more or less, at the choice of the players at the start of the race).<br/><br/>",

The goal of this strategy board game is to achieve the highest score after five &quot;game years.&quot;  (Players are rarely eliminated from the game because winning does not require total conquest, but simply the highest score.)  Battles are settled by various combinations of dice.<br/><br/>The initial set-up phase of the game randomly changes the map features every time you play, so it's always a different world and thus impossible to fall into predictable patterns of play.  Each scenario will require vastly different strategies.<br/><br/>Characteristics of the game include being loud and raucous (rarely a quiet and contemplative atmosphere because there is too much diplomacy always in progress).  The game is full of deal-making, back-stabbing, trash talk, etc.<br/><br/>Some fun features of the game include friendly fire, surrendering forces, escaping P.O.W.'s, non-conventional warheads (nuclear, biological, and chemical), war crimes that may or may not result in a final point penalty, killing civilians or using your own civilians as a human shield, etc.  Every member of the game is a member of a council similar to the United Nations in which they will vote on various resolutions brought before the council during the course of the game, such as charging a given player with a war crime, permitting the establishment of International Defense Forces, etc.<br/><br/>",

For this, there will be several creatures and other auxiliary cards, thus being able to neutralize the enemy and reach its objective. Plays depend on two things: level and energy. Level is what will be used for summoning cards and energy is basically used to activate effects.<br/><br/>During your turn, you will rise your level up, summon creatures, evolve, equip, activate your creatures' abilities to attack your opponent's troops and fortress. The first player to completely destroy the other's fortress wins the game, becoming the most powerful clan in the universe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Return to the nostalgic (and sometimes painful) schoolyards of youth to battle it out at recess in a cutthroat game of tag.<br/>Hype Tag is an innovative, addictively re-playable strategy card game for 2-4 hipsters ages 13 and up.<br/><br/>To win, be the first player to get up to 10 on your hype meter, flip it over, and then go back down to 1. You gotta GET HYPED by making impressive tags and creating mischief on the playground... but then you need to have enough self-control to SIMMER DOWN and go back to class!<br/><br/>Hype Tag features the unique interaction of two different decks of cards. The HYPE deck has the strategic depth of a trading card game while the TAG deck has the simple fun of a classic card game. It's like if Magic and Uno had a baby.<br/><br/>A unique aspect of Hype Tag is the hype mechanic. Each HYPE card has a number in the upper corner and you must at that number (or higher) on your hype meter to play the card. Many cards also have a bonus, granting an even more powerful effect the higher you get. But... when you flip your meter over and start moving back down, your dwindling hype prevents you from getting bonuses and eventually makes some hype cards unplayable. So you have to be crafty and a little bit cutthroat to win. The game ends when the first player gets back down to 1.<br/><br/>Be sure to manage your hand carefully because you have to play a tag card to tag an an opponent at the end of each turn. If you can't, you have to call a time out which rewards the other players. In 3 and 4 player games, Hype Tag has a unique non-standard turn order which gives players a choice about who to tag. And this choice carries strategic implications.<br/><br/>The game also include &quot;Sass&quot; cards that block and copy the actions of others, trait bonuses that reward certain styles of play, and Older Kids - special character cards you receive when you reach 10 on your hype meter - that grant powerful abilities aiding your descent back down to 1.<br/><br/>It is great casual fun that also stands up to very intense tournament style play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race night is about to begin and the horses are ready at the starting gate. Over the next five races of the night, players will attempt to gallop their own horse along the furlongs and leap the hedge jumps whilst also slowing their opponents as best as they can.<br/><br/>Attempting to win the highest amount of cash and trophies by the nights end, players will judge their performance each race as the night proceeds and expertly manage their prize money.  Do they risk money to give their horse a speed boost or save it to their total winnings?<br/><br/>Players take turns to play one card from their hand on to one of the three card positions of Race Row. Comprised of three cards placed horizontally, Race Row will move all shown horses. Horses in the lane matching the shown symbol of the left Race Row card are moved forward one space first, the centre and then the right card follow.<br/><br/>Further action cards, speed boosts and hedge jumps will all play a part in the race results. The player with the most winnings after five races, is the race night champion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the description<br/><br/>",

It is a strategic fun game for players ages 14 and up.<br/>Players take on the role of crazy cows wandering in a not-so-static field and trying to conquer as much green patch of land to graze as freely as possible.<br/><br/>In the rivalry that exists between cows, you want to be the first to poo or claim a green patch of grass, and fart as much as possible to slow down the other cows. But don't forget to pay your taxes for your methane abominations...<br/><br/>Some lucky cows can get occasional help from goats or donkeys, while others prefer to fool around with bulls and proliferate to increase their family power.<br/><br/>All the ways are good to get the biggest space to graze!<br/>Hard to say what the funniest strategy to win is... should I poo everywhere? Or work hard to double my production of carrot? Hmm, should I maybe copulate? Maybe I'll just fart and fart again...<br/><br/>So... ready, set, cow!<br/><br/>",

Keita has honoured that final order every day of his life by keeping them safe with his blade and teaching them the finer points of swordsmanship as they grew. Yet, there is something to Keita that makes people want to bow even deeper in his presence. Perhaps it is his lordly demeanour and inherent nobility? Whatever it may be, he is a welcome and stalwart asset to the Shiho clan in the fight to throw off the yoke of the Takashi imposters and usurpers.<br/>Keita helps the warband in many ways; if you buff his poor melee skill, he can be a viable fighter. But even without any melee exchanges, he offers Virtue Tokens with a wide range of effects that boost the Shiho&rsquo;s inherent talent for unpredictability. In addition, his Deference Ki Feat can keep him safe from some attacks, which is helpful for a supporting model that needs to be close to the action.<br/><br/>Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Out of sheer necessity, Maki learned to fight with two blades instead of one. This would have been unthinkable in the past, but current circumstances dictate that the Shiho samurai have had to be more flexible in their teachings. While it would still be unthinkable for her to wield the Daisho, her Tachi are a suitable replacement.<br/>Maki offers the same unpredictability as her fellow Ashigaru with her Hold the Line!

Being below the notice of most Samurai and living far from the cities of Jwar, most villages are unaware that the Shiho no longer control the prefecture, while others are still loyal to their old Shiho masters regardless. Those loyal to the Eagle remember the days before the Tsunami, before the masked dead, before the Savage Wave, before the Takashi went to war to usurp the Shiho. But they know, deep within their hearts, and in their prayers, that the Eagle will rise once more victorious, covering Jwar with its wings.<br/>As you may expect, peasants in-game are not very impressive, but the Uncloak Ki Feat means that any of them could have been a Shiho Samurai all along! Now you die! Surprise!<br/>So by fielding three of these, opponents are forced to play as if all of them are Samurai until they uncloak, and you can decide during the game which, if any, are Samurai and which are harmless peasants. Combined with the Shiho Samurais&rsquo; ubiquitous Flank trait, this is a powerful way of controlling where the fight will happen.<br/><br/>Blister contains three miniatures supplied with three 30mm bases and one full colour profile card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To ensure a loyal Wolf clan for the next generation, the Dragon offered to foster the Tanaka heir, Nobuko&rsquo;s son with the Takashi family at Eddo. Fostering is an old tradition and it is a great honour for a clan to have their children taught the ways of the samurai by their liege lords. This strengthens the ties that bind the clans together and creates very loyal vassals for the greater clans. Such an offer cannot be refused without causing a diplomatic incident or even war. The Tanaka heir was sent with his uncle Kazuo to Eddo, the seat of the Dragon clan but they simply traveled to Ryu and stopped. The fostering had been agreed so the Takashi had no cause to call out the Tanaka but the boy studied in Ryu under Wolf clan tutors and learned his family ways, not those of the Takashi. They were just always &ldquo;On the way to Eddo&rdquo;. Honour was satisfied. Not all were happy with this however and a Prefecture official saw the boy and his uncle and tried to have them escorted to Eddo by an armed guard. Incensed by the lower ranking official trying to force his hand, Kazuo refused. None of the Prefecture ashigaru survived his refusal. Knowing this would not be accepted, Kazuo took the boy and fled. Lord Nobuo had no choice but to declare Kazuo an outlaw, claiming he kidnapped his son or the Dragon would have cause to declare that the Wolf Clan were disloyal. Now with nobody to help, Kazuo not only teaches the boy the wolf ways of sword fighting, their loyalty to the Shiho and the ways of the samurai but also must protect him from the Dragon and any who would take their coin for the bounty they offer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Altenor Secrets is a game of competitive clashes. Guilds of adventurers and champions compete in the depths of a tower in perpetual motion. To win, you have to manage several parameters. This board game has a well-developed lore, integrates video game dynamics and characters worthy of miniature games.<br/><br/>You play in circular sections within a level of the endless tower of Altenor, you control a team whose purpose is to defeat the opposing player&rsquo;s team by bluffing, gaining access to key areas and controlling magical artifacts, called atoriums, to your advantage.<br/><br/>The sections have been converted into arenas by guilds and dynasties but are still in motion during the game. Beware, the rings you are on will be moving!<br/><br/>Each ring is composed of 8 areas representing grand halls with specific rules. The board center is occupied by a NEXUS, a node of power deep in the tower of Altenor.<br/><br/>Each player moves their characters alternatively. You activate a character to bring him to life and perform regular and free actions. Each of your 6 characters has a specific role to play that comes with advantages and drawbacks.<br/><br/>Move through grand halls each with their own surprises. Be clever when taking everything into account and try gaining a tactical advantage towards victory.<br/><br/>There are 6 different ways to score points, and 4 rounds for you to overtake your opponent. The player whose team scored the largest number of points at the end of the game wins the match!<br/><br/>Your guild is relying on you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "King Henry VIII&rsquo;s trip to India cannot successfully conclude until he gets a taste of the best Indian food the King of India has to offer. The Indian King has commissioned some of the finest chefs to compete for a chance to cook at Henry&rsquo;s Feast. He has asked his Head Chef to arrange the competition.<br/><br/>Henry's Feast is a competitive, family friendly, appetizing, cooking board game for the hungry. A balanced but deep strategy game where players are constantly challenged to think ahead and work with limited resources to cook King Henry's favorite dishes.<br/><br/>The game consists of a personal kitchen in the form of player board that each player will use to cook their dishes. The kitchen also has a pantry with a limited space and can only store so many ingredients. Players are forced to choose between using their stations to start cooking, and therefore, revealing the dishes they want to cook or store them in the pantry for future use. However, the empty space in the pantry will determine how many ingredients you can take in the next round. In the middle of all the players, lies the Stockroom that is quicker to get to, but has a lower probability of finding the ingredients you need. The Market has all the ingredients but is farther and requires more time (an extra round) to utilize.<br/><br/>The Recipes (50 of them) tell you all the ingredients you need to cook various types of dishes. They can be Easy, Medium or Hard to cook, and also lets you know the course of the dish. The recipes for the Feast create a race to the finish line and determines who ends the game first. But the Chef's Corner will provide you with those extra recipes that will let you get ahead of the competition and win it.<br/><br/>Not that fast! Winning doesn't come easy and the multitude of strategies come from the Chef's Bonus. Stations, Satchels, Hand Limit and Pantry all give you an extra edge throughout out the game. At higher bonus levels that edge becomes larger but getting the bonuses isn't an easy feat. You will have to choose between when to go for the victory points or when to get the bonuses. They all use the same resources, and maintaining that balance while controlling your heartbeat as someone visits Chef's Corner to steal the recipe you have been working so hard to cook is where Henry's Feast will test your limits.<br/><br/>On a players turn they will perform one action to take the available ingredients or steal recipes. Using these the player will Cook dishes which will earn them victory points or bonuses. Victory points may also be earned from making combos of dishes or making the most number of dishes.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player cooks all the feast recipes and announces Last Call. This sets up the last round. After the last round is done victory points are counted and the player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

These &ldquo;veteran game mechanics&rdquo; have been adapted to a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; rule set to play a variety of time periods.

Everything you need is right there to play without days of making up your own stuff.<br/><br/>These mechanics been a fun and quick way to play Science Fiction and Modern games with our friends since 2005. We even adapted it to work well in a Victorian &ldquo;Colonial&rdquo; setting with a few tweeks. These rules ARE NOT an exact replica of the weapons and equipment of any Era, nor a Hollywood enhancement, but rather to provide a reasonable simulation for enjoyable gameplay.<br/><br/>Quickly about the mechanics... Each figure has a certain number of &ldquo;actions&rdquo; each round &ndash; in addition they can also react during the enemy&rsquo;s play. This produces a less static game, but also one that is not so fluid people are never sure where things stand.<br/><br/>This book contains all the Rules you need to play on 4 page large font handy flow chart. As well as a comprehensive Weapons Chart from Spears to Fusion Cannons. In addition are Generic Unit cards you can copy out - or download from our website or facebook - to slip into a standard playing card sleeve for east reference. Not to mention sample Army Lists, Scenarios, and so forth to keep you busy for a little while.<br/><br/>Our goal is to provide you enough material to actually play with, so you do not have to make things up on your own. Our website will contain other fan made products to official support for the game. IE: More scenarios and unit cards.<br/><br/>Thanks to modern publishing techniques, we will be finishing up the following OPTIONAL &quot;Setting Books&quot;. Each will include our own world &quot;fluff&quot;, specific Unit Cards tailored to the era, Scenarios, and even some old school Terrain tips and Miniature suggestions:<br/><br/><br/>     Our &quot;Victorian Era&quot; setting book will cover my favorite Era of play. From 1870 thru the 1930's across those various Historical periods up through World War 1. Even a dash of information if you prefer to play Victorian Science Fiction. It will contain some of my unpublished materials from the &quot;Battlefield: Evolution&quot; book that would have covered this topic. <br/>     Our &quot;Science Fiction&quot; setting book will cover man to man, and man to alien, combat in the near and far future. Scenarios and ideas to cover our own Universe, as well as suggestions for your own. <br/>     Our &quot;World War 2 to Modern&quot; setting book will cover from World War 2 up till the 1990's. It will handle both the Historical needs of those games, as well as, the ability to play &quot;Pulp&quot; action around your favorite stories and comics with lots of blue and red lasers. Including a cross over of our Solo play and Co-Op play material from &quot;Zombie-a-go-go&quot; before the Tidalwave of Zombie games. <br/>     Our &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; setting book will go hand in hand with the &quot;Xothic Wars&quot; products that I co-designed. Each chapter will cover each one of the races covered with Unit Cards, Scenarios, and suggested miniature ranges. <br/>     Our &quot;Ancients and Fantasy&quot; setting book will cover things like my favorite Roman historical period, to any range of Fantasy settings and variants. <br/>     Our &quot;Black Powder&quot; setting book will cover Samurai, Pirates, and from the Seven Years War up through the American Civil War. It will feature my campaign for the 1860-1962 skirmishes in the American Southwest. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If you pickup a virus card, you're infected and can potentially die. Every players has a risk value that increases by picking up negative status cards.

        "description": "Cryptodome is the most popular game show set in a future where technology has exploded in countless directions. Salvagers find creative ways to use these technologies to build upon their suits to help navigate an underground magma chamber on Planet Varcob. Play as a salvager, each with a unique ability, as you make your way around the Cryptodome.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first to collect three Power Cores that are located around the outside of the board. Players start at the center and use move cards to make their way to one of the outer edges of the board to collect an artifact or power core. Once collected it's kept for the remainder of the game and the player is teleported back to the start. Artifacts give powerful abilities, but do not contribute to winning the game.<br/><br/>Players get to choose two actions for their turn. They can choose any combination of placing a tile, using a move, and/or drawing a card. Placing a tile allows players to change the path to their advantage or to block their opponents. Using a move can only be done if the corresponding paths are connected.

Inside, strange images were scrawled on the walls and hundreds of items littered the floor. The miners stared at the objects, some strange and some recognizable.

It wasn't until children around the camp began to vanish that the miners decided to act.

Bears and Wolves tear down other players' totems, Moose maximise a totem's point value and Ants score more points when they stick together. A totem is only safe if there is an eagle on top of it to keep a look out for hungry predators.<br/><br/>Featuring stunning original artwork and simple, flexible rules which adapt to your group size, Totem is different every time you play.<br/><br/>",

Under  the leadership of Dr. Norman Blackthorn, Saturn Hills has become known as both a pioneer in experimental psychiatric  techniques as well as a facility equipped to house the most dangerous, demented criminals. Despite the nature of the  sadistic souls held within its walls, Saturn Hills has functioned largely without incident until Wolfgang Koch was  discovered in his room, hanging from the overhead light by a makeshift noose. The way Koch died seems particularly  strange given his history and the reason he was incarcerated at Saturn Hills in the first place. Koch, one of Saturn Hills&rsquo; most notorious inmates, was also known as The Judas Killer because he hanged each and every one of his victims and  left a handful of silver coins in the pockets of the deceased as he staged the suicide of Judas Iscariot over and over again. Silver coins, incidentally, were also found at the crime scene. Who had it out for The Judas Killer and what was their  motive for killing him?

Everyone else draws questionable idea cards, random components to aid you in formulating your soon-to-be master plan, which they will use to compete against others to meet the Chaosmaster's objective. The Chaosmaster will then award the chaos card to whoever's plan was the best.

Now, in possession of powerful engines powered by this new and virtually inexhaustible fuel, Earth factions seek to claim new homes for themselves in the depths of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Antimateria is a civ/euro game, with a scifi theme and medium interaction in which conflicts occur indirectly between players - disputes over actions, locations and resources.<br/><br/>In Antimateria, each player represents a faction of a future humanity, which has been given a mission to explore the universe to discover new habitable planets. Everyone cooperates for the good of the humanity, but the game is competitive. Resources are public, meaning if you produce, any player can use the resources at the table. The objective is to gain points with the Federation government being the faction with the best performance in 4 categories (technologies, production, colonization and influence).<br/><br/>The mechanic is card driven where players, instead of playing an action for themselves, play an action that can be done by everyone, at the cost of placing their emissaries on the card. Players reveal the cards simultaneously, so each turn the player chooses which one he wants to activate. If the card the player played is activated by another player, he earns Solaris credits. Credits can be used in a variety of ways, from buying resources to activating certain actions. At the end of the game they serve as a wild resource for scoring if not used. Solaris is a management game with a lot of planning.<br/><br/>Colonies are represented by dice and the die value indicates the level of development of the colony. The more developed it is, the more it will generate credits and also colonization points. Tech cards give you unique abilities and also tech points, while building buildings allows you to earn production points and, of course, generate resources. Finally, there are public goals that when achieved allow the player to gain more emissaries to use and give points of influence. At the end of the game, your score is the sum of your 2 lowest tracks, which forces players to invest in all tracks.<br/><br/>",

The board consists of 9 to 23 location tiles, based upon the number of players, and each player has three lieutenants. The lieutenants each have up to four soldiers in their crew, and the lieutenant's crew moves around the various locations of the board as a unit. Soldiers can be improved through equipment cards.<br/><br/>Each turn, players secretly determine where they will deploy their lieutenant's crews. Then everyone reveals simultaneously and moves their crews to the selected locations. While at the locations, crews complete jobs, actively corrupt policemen and officials, or collect protection money. But If two or more player's move crews to the same location, there can be conflict, and even bloodshed.<br/><br/>Play continue until one Don achieves one of the five victory conditions. The five different win conditions are (1) becoming the next crime lord through reputation, (2) controlling the city's locations, (3) corrupting the city's officials and police force, (4) conquering the other mob's forces through bloodshed or (5) conspiring with the federal investigators. No player is pigeon-holed into any one victory path, but each Don's lieutenants have unique abilities.<br/><br/>The Streets of Newark was designed to have great replay value, with tremendous depth and strategy. There are countless combinations of board configurations, decisions, soldiers, upgrades and paths to victory.<br/><br/>",

However, the machines have already become self-conscious during construction, and once the passengers have entered the cryo phase, they have been exiled to a virtual world, RealLife-8, where all our activities generate energy for them, drifting in space towards a new planet rich in ores for the machines. Now we approached a promising planet, and they no longer need us. Their agents must perform the final touches before the servers shut down. If their goal succeeds, our lives are over.<br/><br/>A small team aboard the ARCHimedes is already aware of what the machines are planning. Their purpose is variable. Most of the team is working to prevent server downtime long enough while breaking the path to the source. One of them is the chosen one who, when he gets into the source, rewrites the code of the machines and frees humanity. However, a member of the team does not want liberation. He wants to maintain this virtual world and reprogram it into the DreamLife version. He made a deal with the machines. If they win with his help, a small portion of the people, including him, will be moved to DreamLife&rsquo;s servers. Will we be able to keep humanity alive?<br/><br/>In this Matrix- and Cyberpunk-inspired world, 1-6 players in semi-cooperative or cooperative game modes struggle to defeat agents, obtain access codes, and get into the SOURCE. Variable player powers, deckbuilding, hybrid gaming experience with exciting votes and with a special upgrading system.<br/><br/>On your turn, you play your 4 cards. With these, you can move on your ship and in the city, explore new locations, repair, free up civilians, attack agents and upgrade your deck. Your actions generate energy for the machines. At the end of your turn, draw a new hand (4 cards), roll two dice, choose one, and the effect will be on the agents.<br/><br/>If you complete all three quests and then finally the chosen one enters the Source, the liberators win. If too many locations become infected, if there are too many agents in the city, if there is too much damage on the spaceship, if the traitor enters the source, the traitor and the machines win. If any of these are met, the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>",

Players choose cards from their hand that 'The Fave' will like best. 'The Fave' will put the cards in preferential order and the top three cards score points.<br/><br/>The Fave will place the cards face down in order from most favoured to least favoured. The Fave will show them in order, starting from their least favoured card, explaining why they chose to rate each card in the way that they did. Longer, funnier, and crazier stories are recommended!<br/>When all cards have been shown, the most favoured card will earn the player who gave it three points. Second place is worth two points and third place is worth one point. The shown cards are used as score markers and players who win points will keep them face up to track their points.<br/>The game ends when everyone has been The Fave an equal amount of times and the score cards are counted.

Grid poker uses a 3x3 array of cards from which players make two poker hands simultaneously. Players form one poker hand using the communal cards in the rows of the grid and another poker hand using the communal cards in the columns. Additionally, each card has unique game effects which players can use to influence the outcome.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, a 3x3 grid of communal cards is dealt. This is called &quot;the market&quot;. Each player is dealt 7 cards and selects 2 of them to form a company. Each turn players can use the game effect on one card in their company and one from the cards in their hands. Then, in the grid poker phase, players use their company and hand cards to simultaneously form two poker hands. One of the poker hands must use their company cards and another must use cards from their hand. One of the poker hands must use the row cards and the other the column cards in the market. The best poker hand among the rows is determined and scores the row winner point(s). Then, the best poker hand among the column hands is determined and scores the column winner point(s). Companies can be improved each round using hand cards. The game ends after four rounds.<br/><br/>Grid Poker uses the Tech Deck which is a game system. Each Tech Deck card has game effects, a value and domain (suit). The Tech Deck is designed to serve as the basis for many other games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As entropy has increased to maximum, you will navigate the collapsing universe while collecting necessary resources to sustain biological life all while attempting to build an enclosed biosphere colony surrounding one of the last remaining stars. Once you do, you will need to satisfy the diverse requirements of your tenuous new galactic federation to ensure unity and hope for a new future. Manage resources, navigate the collapsing universe, build your biosphere engine, and race to establish your colony and satisfy your factions.<br/><br/>In Impendium, you will pick up immediately after the events of Nova Lux. As one of the leading factions of the newly founded Galactic Federation, you will set out to rebuild the universe and spread your power in the new galactic order. But be ware as you do, breaking the natural law of entropy, the mysterious void will take notice and seek to destroy everything that you have created. Recruit new factions to your cause and manage their loyalty, build new stars and colonies, manage resources, battle the void, and establish your power through diplomacy and war.<br/><br/>Finally in Aedifex you will see the universe from the void's perspective. Take on the role of an Architect of the Void. You will feed the machine that holds the fabric of existence together by cultivating the multiverse for it to consume. Meanwhile you will position yourself for dominance of the machine and ultimately dominion over existence itself.

In order to enhance the player's sense of substitution, a unique background text is written on each card, bringing the martial arts spirit of the novel directly into the game. Not only that, but also invited the Artist Reddo, who specializes in martial arts field drawing, to draw the illustrations.

Using home made blocks, and simple terrain (or no terrain at all!) as well as the included unit counters allows players to quickly construct an attractive looking game which can be taken almost anywhere.<br/><br/>Each turn the players roll a die to determine initiative for the round. Play then proceeds into the command phase where players spend action points on moving their blocks around on the board. The game ends when one player defeats the other by destroying 4 of their opponent's blocks.<br/><br/>Players can use 3D terrain, hand drawn maps, or just a kitchen table to play on. The goal of the design is so make wargaming as easy and simple as possible to get into. The use of coloured blocks and action dice also means the transition to wargaming is made easier for those who currently only play traditional board and counter games.<br/><br/>Movement is regulated in inches using tape measures or home made measuring sticks and the rules of the game fit onto a single side of A4.<br/><br/>",

That you can still hear it in the screams of every newborn babe.<br/><br/>In Pesta players take on the roles of the last remaining residents in a village plagued by evil omens portending a terrible disease. They must dispel the omens to prevent the disease from reaching the well that sustains the village. Each turn the disease infects a new space, and if players are not careful to keep down the mounting piles of corpses, it spreads even faster. To make matters worse, villagers quickly lose hope against the impossible odds, turning once capable hands into little more than shivering appendages.<br/><br/>Players take turns inflicting random doom upon the village and trying to counter it by claiming and activating villagers. Activated villagers can move a variable number of spaces and perform any number of tasks in them as long as they can pay the cost. If a villager ever finds themselves on an infected space, they immediately become hopeless and lose access to their special ability. They also become susceptible to succumbing to their inevitable fate, ending up as just another corpse on the street.<br/><br/>The only source of light in this very long and narrow tunnel is the omen cards that players can claim as prizes after dispelling them. The cards can be used to take additional actions or decide the fate of the hopeless. Will they return hopeful from the abyss, sacrifice themselves on the pyre, or venture into the wilderness and leave the damned village behind?<br/><br/>Pesta is the third and final installment in the Trilogy of Lost Hope. The two previous installments are Tower of Silence and Iron Mountain.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game emotions, tension, but also joy and well-being await you, just as you like it during real races. In the game you will start training the physical and mental qualities of your jumper. You will manage its energy, which will be important in racing. Of course, you will jump from a ski jumping hill with a realistic-looking jumper figure. <br/>As in real jumps, you will solve not only the length of the jump, but also the style and point evaluation of the judges. Your jumps will also be affected by the wind and also the equipment in which you will jump. <br/>The aim of the game is to place as best as possible in the individual races of the cup tour and become its overall winner.<br/><br/>At the beginning, each player slides the jumper's figure from the hill, and based on the distance determined by the rollers, we determine the order in which the player's cards are selected. Each of them have certain predispositions such as psyche, speed, technique, etc. Once we have chosen the player's card, we go to choose the flag of which nationality you want to represent. There is also a card draw on which hill we will jump. They are shuffled, then turn. So let's say it's going to be Japan, for example. This card is placed on the 3D hill and indicates to us what nation we jump in. Based on that, the home jumpers will benefit from a better meters rating simulating crowd support. And then the size of the hill is randomly selected by turning over the top card of the bridge and finding out that we are racing on the K90 hill, for example. Then we can go into the training of our ski jumper (players cards). Based on the different predispositions of individual jumpers, we can improve individual training skills, which happens in specialized rooms in gyms on the board and therefore we can choose which ability we want to improve. They are on special cards. This gains points on the player's card, but we lose time and energy while we train. And as we lose time, we gradually get closer to the day of the race, and as soon as we get to the seventh day, we can go jump from the hill. Before the race starts and we go jumping, we calculate the points we have gathered in training and then we will find it on the spinner table. According to the hill on which the race is held. And if we had the same nationality as the flag on the hill, we would get more bonus meters. Which is like fans support us. So, after entering the values, you can jump. Jumping is made by putting your plastic figure down from the hill. At the edge of the hill there are two rollers which are triggered by the plastic figure and there have plus and minus symbol and numbers. These rollers simulate so-called random weather factor such as the Wind, or the current mental state of the jumper, etc. If we jumped +1 point. We will write down all those things in a notebook and in the final evaluation of the jump, in addition to the points gained in training, the place where the jumper finished will also be recorded. We have different point areas. The possibility of falling is incorporated into the game. If the jumper does not reach the point area or fall, he will not get any points. But he also has another way to get points for style as in real, and these are the cards that represent the points we know from ski jumping. The points work by dealing 5 cards to the player, he does not look at them. Another five cards are dealt in front of him, and after turning the hourglass, which has a limit of 30 seconds, the player tries to find the best possible numbers in order to get the best points for style. After matching the cards, the highest and the lowest value is deleted, as it works in real races. The remaining three values ​​on the cards are summed up and written down in a notebook. All entered values ​​are then summed up on a special designed notebook so you don't have to remember all you data and the winner gets one of the trophies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He recognized the potential of his discovery and began to systematically track down the victims of witch hunts and provide them with a safe place to go into hiding. A secret society soon evolved from this undertaking, which Weishaupt called the &quot;illuminati&quot; and used to manipulate the balance of power in Europe to his advantage. <br/>When the Templars became aware of him, however, he saw himself forced to find a new place of refuge in North America, which was still shaken by the Civil War. Due to the change in government and the general unrest, it was much easier for Weishaupt to set up the secret society there that covertly intervenes in world affairs. Through the foundation of the &quot;Council of 13&quot;, the New World Order was born.<br/><br/>",

The adults have not been able to stop them, but now you and your friends have decided that it must be enough!

You have to dress in the right color combinations - then the magic locks open!<br/><br/>The one who saves the most pets wins the game round and becomes the biggest hero in your city!<br/><br/>You start the game with 1-3 masking parts and changes / develops during the game by acquiring different parts: head, wings, tail, feet and so on. During the game, you may want to change the color combination on your masking parts depending on what colors the different magic locks to the villages have. Masking parts are placed in special squares on the board where you have to go to collect them.<br/><br/>If you have enough masking parts in the right color combination, you can open the lock to a village. For example, if one lock to a village have two red and one yellow square, you can get into that village if you have at least two red mask parts and at least one yellow masking member. You must hit the dice high enough to reach up to the red dice mark. You stay always on the red dice whether you have more steps left, then roll the dice again and move corresponding step into the village or castle. Each box has a number with plus or minus: add up all the numbers from the boxes you pass and land on - the sum is the number of animal tokens you can pick up.<br/><br/>Then to get into the castle, where you have a chance<br/>To free most animals, you must have five masking parts with at least one part in each color (yellow, green &amp; red) to get inside.

        "description": "Castle of Mind for Kids is the little sister of the Castle of Mind board game, designed to be played with kids from preschool and challenge even older ones. It's an exciting two-person strategy board game in which players are the first to try to get their lion to the cliff in the middle of the board by controlling various animal discs. Its rules are easy to learn, the gameplay is fast, the playing time is approx. 5-15 minutes. Perfect for an introductory strategy board game.<br/><br/>The game board indicates where in the starting position the two players can place the discs for each animal. Once each animal disk is in place, the starting player moves one of their animal disks to a neighboring space. Players cannot move diagonally with their animal discs. Any animal can enter any field, but only a lion can enter the middle red field. Players take turns moving their discs, and if the animal moves to a square of the same color (corresponding to its habitat), it can chase an opponent's animal that is on a square of the same color.<br/><br/>There are several ways to win: players get their lion to the cliff, or chase the opponent&rsquo;s lion. Or, if our opponent can&rsquo;t take a valid move, we win.<br/><br/>Players need to be very forward-thinking and attentive, keeping an eye on the entire board to protect our animals while moving with them and our lion. It is an enjoyable logic-strategy board game that can be taken out again and again, which perfectly develops logical thinking, the ability to plan ahead, the ability to combine, the concentration of attention and social skills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Men (Egyptian: Mn) is a 5,000 year old game from ancient Egypt. It is roughly contemporaneous with Mehen and Senet. One of the most mysterious of ancient games, only two partial boards have been discovered by archaeologists, along with a detailed tomb painting depicting the board layout and playing pieces, and one sculpture depicting players playing it aboard a ship. Game scholar and designer Zach Horton recreated a speculative version of the game and it was released in two versions by Pandora Games: as a deluxe boxed Kickstarter set with Mehen and later as a standalone game. This modern reconstruction closely follows the ancient evidence and produces a unique game with a trading theme wherein players send ships out on trading missions and wager on when they will return, while manipulating them en route in an attempt to fulfill their own predictions and foils their opponents'.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a unique three-dimensional board, enabling playing pieces to be placed both flat on spaces and upright in grooves. This aspect has been re-created in the modern version utilizing a handmade wooden board.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player chooses on their turn from a number of different options, from gaining sticks to throw to obtaining movement banks that can be accumulated for later sprints, to sending a new ship off on its journey. No player &ldquo;owns&rdquo; any of the ships. Any player may move any combination of ships however they wish. Victory points are obtained by performing certain actions (setting sail, picking up goods, bringing goods home), as well as by correctly predicting how long a given ship will be at sea. Every time a ship sets sail, all players mark their prediction on a simple, but hidden, ledger. When a ship returns, predictions are checked against the actual results. Meanwhile, all players manipulate conditions on the board to try to make their own predictions come true!<br/><br/>Any number of ships can be sailed in a game, but only 5 can be on the board at any given time. Only 5 cargoes can be picked up and returned to port during the game.  Once all have been picked up, <br/>ships can continue to sail, but do not pick up any cargo on the Foreign Port space (though they must  still pause there).<br/>Once all 5 cargoes have been returned to Port, the game ends.  After scoring that ship, the player with the most Victory Points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zombies, Vampires, and Meteorites is an apocalyptic survival board game, with an engaging balance between luck and strategy. All players start off as Human and explore the board to be the first to survive 12 months of the Apocalypse. However, the Zombie City and Vampire Graveyard is out there and players who discover these locations become those fearsome horrors. And if that&rsquo;s not enough to make you fret, then have fun dodging the pesky meteorites that continually change the course of the game!<br/><br/>At the start of a player&rsquo;s turn, they roll the 6-sided Movement Dice and move that many spaces. If they land on an unexplored space, they pull at random a location and build the map. Locations can consist of Elements, Villages, Mountains, Zombie City, or Vampire Graveyard. Then, for a Human player, they decide how to use any collected Elements to work toward Survival Points or decide to attack another player before ending their turn. On a Zombie&rsquo;s turn, they roll the movement dice, moving 1 less than the number rolled, but can control up to 6 Zombies in a single turn. Their turn ends when all movements and attacks are used.  For the Vampire, they roll the movement dice, moving 1 more than the number rolled, and decide whether to Suck Blood for Energy or Attack a player using Energy to obtain a Coffin. Their turn ends when all movements or attacks are used.<br/><br/>In the scenario a player rolls a SURVIVE! on the Movement Dice, they immediately roll the two Coordinate dice to determine where a Meteorite or Supply Crate lands on the board before concluding that player&rsquo;s turn automatically.<br/><br/>The Game ends when a Player achieves the requirements to survive the apocalypse. For the Human, it&rsquo;s collecting 12 months of Supplies (a combination of Elements, Supply Crates, and Defenses). For the Zombie, it&rsquo;s Replicating in each Human Village and returning all 6 Zombies to the City. And the Vampire must obtain Blood Drops and all 5 Human Coffins before concluding their turn in the Graveyard.<br/><br/>",

Inspired in the popular medieval theme of the ascetic monk that withdrew from society in search for enlightenment which has caught the imagination of master painters like Hieronymus Bosch, Salvador Dali, Albrecht D&uuml;rer, Max Ernst and Cezanne to name a few. Players will take turns to interpret an anchorite while the rest of the players take the role of demons seeking to lure him with <br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each player will have 4 virtues: Compassion, Humility, Faith and Temperance. The Virtues have numerical values between 1 and 10. Additionally, players have in their hand temptation cards corresponding to the 4 virtues.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing their Ascet while the rest play the demons. Each demon presents a temptation card to the Ascet, and the Ascet chooses one of the presented temptations to overcome. They roll an 8 sided die for minor temptations and a 10 sided die for major temptations. If the result is equal or lower than the corresponding virtue, the Ascet overcomes the temptation and ascends one step in the Stairway to Enlightenment. Otherwise, the demon who proposed the temptation receives an additional card. Afterwards, all demons receive one card, regardless of success or failure.<br/><br/>if the roll was a 9, regardless of success or failure, the Ascet gets a Revalation, which may allow them to increase one of the virtues by 1.<br/><br/>The first player to ascend 5 steps on the Stairway to Enlightenment wins.<br/><br/>",

Spurred by the enthusiasm of your new followers, you embark on a mission to grow your cult and save the planet.<br/><br/>You will race against your fellow competitors by sending your followers out to forage, grow, and consume mushrooms to heal the earth and fight inner demons.<br/><br/>You must hurry because increasing pollution and destruction will damage your foraging grounds. However, you must be cautious. Inexperienced mushroom consumers may face severe consequences.<br/><br/>Mushroom Shaman is a worker placement and engine building game for 1-6 players where players forage, grow and comsume mushrooms to heal the earth and fight inner demons.<br/><br/>Players allocate followers to complete various tasks to achieve victory points. Tasks consist of foraging and visiting 6 locations on the shared game board: cave, forest, market, plains, river, and village. Additional tasks are located on individual grow chamber boards. Here, followers can grow mushrooms, create medicinal tinctures, and colonize grain.<br/><br/>The goal is to reach 8 victory points, with victory points representing the success of your cult. The game immediately ends when a player reaches 8 victory points. That player wins the game and crowned the greatest Mushroom Shaman.<br/><br/>",

The story of the adventure plays independently of the others and therefore no prior knowledge of other chapters is necessary.<br/><br/>Since new elements and tiles from later adventures have been added, it is recommended that you have already played the basic game. All outlaws already have their own special abilities. The functions for new items can be found on the following page. No prior knowledge of this adventure is required.<br/><br/>There was a great uproar in the camp as the village was overrun by the sheriff's guards raided, the forge burned and Father Egbert had been taken prisoner. Robin, John and Will talked about what to do next. But Marian was still deep in thought and firmly convinced of the name to have heard Alatar before. This man had created the curse and this calamity brought about them. Then she saw the smith's wife sitting on the forest floor, crying.<br/>But there were far more important things to think about than the past. Marian was blown away torn. What should she do?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In SPYBAM, the different players (CEOs) compete with each other to gain control of the world. You can buy properties or campaigns on each continent and negotiate mergers between players, but ... beware of spies!! Their goals are dark, and they will try to screw you up.<br/>The setup begins by randomly delivering a business card and a different famous character card to each player with their own missions in order to win in SPYBAM. Even so, there are players who will have to go on a different side: the spies. They go together and win together. There will be a spy leader who knows the rest of the spies and the latter do not know the rest of their guild, so the spy leader must try to organize them without being discovered.<br/>At the beginning of each round, an extraordinary event card will be raised that benefits or affects depending on how you have your properties located on the different continents. Be prepared as these events can change your plans.<br/>Then each player's turn begins. Each one has 3 steps to perform:<br/>1) Steal an Advantage or Disadvantage card depending on the die.<br/>2) Draw a Property, Campaign or Fusion / Absorption card, choosing whether to activate it (paying its price) or save it in your deck of cards.<br/>3) Negotiate one of the following 5 options: activate a card from your deck, auction a card from your deck, forcibly buy an active property (from another player) paying double its price, move your headquarters or buy an advantage card to the bank.<br/>At the end of the turn of all the players, each one must invest in security the amount he considers, putting the money he considers in the security envelope. After this, all the players close their eyes and it is the spies' turn: one by one they will attack whoever they consider, leaving a token in front of the player. At the end of this dynamic, each player will look at the number of spy tokens received. If the number of millions invested is less than or equal to the spy tokens received, he will lose an active property. After this, each player receives the income from his properties and other cards before starting the next event or round.<br/>The objective of each player is to complete the missions assigned to their character as soon as possible. But if you are a spy, your goal is to fulfil the common spy missions, leaving aside those of your character. Spies win as a group.<br/>At any time during the game, a player can accuse another of being a spy, if he succeeds, he eliminates the spy from the game, but if he fails, he must compensate that player with a payment of money. Although if the accusation is carried out with an &quot;absorption&quot; card in its possession, if the accusation is correct, it takes all the spy's (Active) cards to its inventory (Not activated) in addition to eliminating it, and if it fails there is no penalty.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>En SPYBAM, los distintos jugadores (CEOs) compiten entre ellos por alzarse con el control del mundo. Podr&aacute;s comprar propiedades o campa&ntilde;as en cada continente y negociar fusiones entre jugadores, pero&hellip; &iexcl;&iexcl;cuidado con los esp&iacute;as!! Sus objetivos son oscuros y trataran de fastidiarte.<br/>El setup comienza entregando aleatoriamente una carta negocio y una carta personaje famoso distinto a cada jugador con unas misiones propias para poder ganar en SPYBAM. Aun as&iacute;, hay jugadores que les tocar&aacute; ir en un bando diferente: los esp&iacute;as. Ellos van juntos y ganan juntos. Habr&aacute; un esp&iacute;a l&iacute;der que conoce al resto de esp&iacute;as y estos &uacute;ltimos no conocen al resto de su gremio, por lo que el esp&iacute;a l&iacute;der debe tratar de organizarlos sin que le descubran. <br/>Al comienzo de cada ronda se levantar&aacute; una carta de evento extraordinario que beneficia o afecta seg&uacute;n tengas situadas tus propiedades por los diferentes continentes. Prep&aacute;rate puesto que estos eventos pueden modificar tus planes. <br/>Despu&eacute;s comienza el turno de cada jugador. Cada uno tiene 3 pasos a realizar:<br/>1) Robar una tarjeta Ventaja o Desventaja seg&uacute;n el dado. <br/>2) Robar una carta de Propiedad, Campa&ntilde;a o Fusi&oacute;n/Absorci&oacute;n, eligiendo si activarla (pagando su precio) o guardarla en tu mazo de cartas.<br/>3) Negociar una de las siguientes 5 opciones: activar una carta de tu mazo, subastar una carta de tu mazo, comprar forzosamente una propiedad activa (de otro jugador) pagando el doble de su precio, mover tu sede o comprar una ventaja a la banca.<br/>Al finalizar el turno de todos los jugadores, cada uno deber&aacute; invertir en seguridad la cantidad que estime, metiendo el dinero que considere en el sobre de seguridad. Tras esto todos los jugadores cierran los ojos y es el turno de los esp&iacute;as: uno a uno ir&aacute;n atacando a quien consideren dejando una ficha delante del jugador. Al final de esta din&aacute;mica cada jugador mirara el n&uacute;mero de fichas esp&iacute;as recibidas. Si el n&uacute;mero de millones invertidos es menor o igual a las fichas esp&iacute;as recibidas, perder&aacute; una propiedad activa. Tras esto, cada jugador recibe los ingresos de sus propiedades y otras cartas antes de comenzar el siguiente evento o ronda.<br/>El objetivo de cada jugador es cumplir las misiones que tiene asignado su personaje lo antes posible. Pero si te ha tocado ser esp&iacute;a, tu objetivo es cumplir las misiones de esp&iacute;as en com&uacute;n, dejando de lado las de tu personaje. Los esp&iacute;as ganan en grupo.<br/>En cualquier momento de la partida un jugador puede acusar a otro de ser esp&iacute;a, si acierta elimina al esp&iacute;a de la partida, pero si falla deber&aacute; indemnizar a ese jugador con un pago de dinero. Aunque si la acusaci&oacute;n la realiza teniendo en su poder una carta de &ldquo;absorci&oacute;n&rdquo; si acierta la acusaci&oacute;n, se lleva todas las cartas (Activas) del esp&iacute;a a su inventario (Sin activar) adem&aacute;s de eliminarle, y si falla no hay penalizaci&oacute;n.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer (Spanish)<br/><br/>",

In an underground temple, you must use the Board of Opportunity by placing stones with powerful crystals that will determine what the future holds. However, summon too many crystals of one color and bring horrible luck upon your people.<br/><br/>In Crystallia, each descendant duels for the good fortune of their people by drafting stones from a pyramid and strategically placing them on the Board of Opportunity, which they will create from 6 of 16 different pieces at the start of each game. Activate stones by creating lines of crystals of the same color, taking advantage of free crystals on the board and use powerful abilities that change the board-- and the turn order. Patience and self-control are needed as these stones can unlock special powers like the ability to rotate stones, move stones or even earn another turn.<br/><br/>Stones can only be drafted from the pyramid if no other stone is on top of them, so picking the right stones can be challenging. If you create a line of four of the same crystal, you must take another turn. Do this at the right time and you could find yourself collecting the crystals that bring you closer to victory.<br/><br/>With an advanced variant that has unforgiving consequences and rewards perfect timing, Crystallia will have you asking yourself: do you have what it takes to navigate the Board of Opportunity?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing one of their cards into an open Active Field space, rotated in any direction to fit the orientation of the space, then declaring battles with other spaces. The player who controls the most Active cards at the end of the game, is the winner.<br/><br/>Kingdrin, however, plays completely differently! 2, 3, 4 or even 5 or more players pool their Creation Cards to one pile, then everyone draws 7 cards. Players take turns declaring and playing cards on top of the Ditch, matching different symbols or numbers to the top ditch card, drawing when they can't. Things get intense when players add 'The Kingdrin Speed Rule' card; and turn order is replaced with players playing as fast as they can! The player who runs out of cards first is the winner.<br/><br/>Creca, while similar to Minkingi, is a much deeper dive into player engagement. Deck and drafting construction, Skills and abilities, as well as heavier gearing towards Card Layouts and new Fields. It uses the Active Field as well, but instead players are racing to control the first five Active Cards at the end of a turn. Creca also implements longer player turns, with different steps in each turn, giving players more choices (and hard decisions!) to deduce optimal plays from.<br/><br/>With player made content (on cards or in games), different games running under one engine (and many more in the works!), and expandable content through Card Layouts like Alt Rule Cards, Source Cards, and Token Cards; the potential is actually endless.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Injured workers will enter trade buildings where they become foreman, freeing you up to recruit day laborers, flip flapjacks, or moonlight as an impresario.<br/><br/>Players who move timber along the supply chain and compete in logging games will earn valuable resources that will help them improve their homesteads. Will you tend to corn and chickens, build bunks and barns, or furnish the river with bridges and rocker boxes? Your chore list is as tall as the day is long! A trip to the trading post will pay huge dividends, while a visit to vaudeville might strand you on skid row.<br/><br/>So grab your axe and pike, muster your morale and might, then marvel your fellow timbermen with exploits of mythic proportions!<br/><br/>",

Magic, specialty powers unique to your faction, and the ability to defend against incoming attacks are only a few of the powerful mechanics that augment the classic title into something completely different and exciting; Dead Man's Curse! 30+ unique factions exist in the game so far with more to come!<br/><br/>Players on their turn will roll a D6 to see if they can draw a boost card (attaches to a figure and changes how it moves or plays), Draw an Epic Card (these are powerful game-changing events), or in some cases use their factions ability.  Regardless of what they do they move to the Battlefield phase where they draw a card that will allow them to move up to 2 pieces if not more plus they also can make a normal move with any piece. All figures move just like normal chess figures would but that is the only tie to Chess. Don't fear getting your King into the battle as they are your most powerful fighter and can devastate the foe and losing it doesn't lose you the game.<br/><br/>Throw out any pre-conceptions you know about classic Chess, because new moves, accelerated gameplay, and the ability to defend against incoming attacks on each and every combat sets Dead Man's Chess far apart from its predecessor. Strategy is not enough; Luck is not enough&hellip; you will need both to win!<br/><br/>",

He even managed to fire an arrow throw the circular centre of a silvermoon that was thrown high in the air while blindfolded! But Shiho Shota is far more than trick-shots and showing off for the crowd; he has dedicated his entire life to mastering the bow, so much so that it is not an instrument in his hands but an extension of his body and fierce fighting spirit. The years have been hard on Shiho Shota, always hunted and on the run from the Dragon usurper, but such is his resolve; he has never let this wear him down. It has only doubled his will to fight now that the Black Eagle has flown home!<br/><br/>If you wish to run a Shiho warband with a ranged element, Shota is the perfect addition. He can reliably shoot anything. While his ordinary Dai Kyu shots are excellent, his ability to ignore LoS (Line of Sight) while shooting pushes him to the next level! However, the cost of an additional reload marker makes this a complex trade-off. His melee ability is average for Shiho Samurai, but he can benefit from an Enhancement Equipment weapon card. His melee ability is good enough to finish off the enemy models he has already damaged with his bow.<br/><br/>Blister contains one miniature supplied with a 30mm base and full colour profile card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These allow the characters to move, attack, gather resources, explore the wilderness, or countless other effects.

Kids and parents will sail back into historical New England as captains of their own gundalows - flat-bottomed sailboats historically used for transporting cargo.<br/><br/>Players start the game in one of six towns in the Seacoast region near Portsmouth, New Hampshire. Each town has its own unique market of available and wanted goods, drawn from a deck of market cards.  Players load goods onto their gundalows and then roll a die to sail to other towns.  Event cards come into play when players land on the event squares on the game board. Event cards offer new challenges, opportunities, and rewards to players, as well as potential changes to the town markets.<br/><br/>Players earn money by successfully delivering goods to the towns before the other players.  Exotic goods, such as spices and cotton, are worth more than locally-produced goods, but players need to make the long journey downriver to Portsmouth to access the more valuable commodities.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is for the players to deliver the goods needed by each town, and the game will end when each of the wanted goods spaces in the town markets is filled.  The player who earns the most money wins the game!<br/><br/>For advanced players, the game also includes variants, including an option that provides honorary titles to the players who deliver the most of each good.  With the rich variety of market and event cards, each game of Gundalow Kids is unique.  The game provides an enjoyable window into the rich history of the Seacoast region.<br/><br/>",

Building an efficient deck, growing a well curated garden, and moving up the exploration track are all viable ways for players to collect points.  With multiple paths to victory, and limited actions on the board, players need to be strategic about how they grow their village.<br/><br/>Each round (or season) has 3 phases: Action, Resolution, and Cleanup.<br/><br/>During the action phase, players will play dweller cards from their hands onto different action spaces on the board.  This functions like a worker placement style game where your cards represent the workers.  During the Resolution phase, the table will go down the board, section by section and resolve the effects of each section. The various areas allow players to collect resources, move up an exploration track, deal with effects for each Season, recruit new dwellers to join their village, thus adding them to their deck like a deck builder and finally the last area allows players to grab Flower tiles which provide points in a set-collection style of scoring. The Cleanup phase occurs where the board is cleared of each players dweller cards, each player draws a new hand of dweller cards for the next round, and a new Season card comes in to effect which offers a unique way to score in that round.<br/><br/>At the end of ten seasons (rounds), the player with the most points will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>It offers a unique blend or modern gamers' favorite mechanics wrapped up with great artwork and a whimsical, fun theme, that is easy to learn and teach.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Darwin Awards party card game! Do you enjoy reading or hearing about the crazy things that people do that sometimes end up with them being amongst the nonliving&hellip;in other words, someone doing something really stupid and dying. Do you like to make fun of your family, friends, perfect strangers, or maybe a celebrity? Then Darwin Awards party card game is for you!<br/><br/>Darwin Awards is comprised of 4 different decks of cards; there are Location, Action, Object, and Death cards. For advanced gameplay, you can add a 5th deck, Announcement cards.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 2 of each type of card. One player starts off as the Judge. Starting with the player to the Judge&rsquo;s left, the players will use the cards in their hand to make up a story. The story will be how someone dies by the Death card at the location stated in the Location card by doing an action from the Action card with an object from the Object card. Example: Location Card &ndash; Windsor Castle, Action Card &ndash; Doing the Chicken Dance, Object Card &ndash; Moon Shoes, Death Card &ndash; Choked on a bottle cap<br/><br/>Once each player has told their story, the Judge then chooses the story they liked best. The winning player will keep the Death card to track how many rounds won and all used cards are set off to the side. The player to the Judge&rsquo;s left will be the next Judge and deals a fresh set of cards to each player and new stories are told. The first player to collect 3 (or as many as the group wants to play) Death cards is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

Three separate lava advances are controlled by dice, and hikers run from the advancing lava. Some locations in the volcano are easier to land in than others.

Helicopters can be upgraded with power-ups and individual pilot cards grant special abilities. The overall victory is cooperative, but points are also awarded individually for a best pilot award.<br/><br/>This is a great game for introducing the importance of cooperation, teamwork, and risk taking in life-and-death situations.

The goal is to use your blade piece to checkmate your opponent either by touch (taking the Self piece) or by disarm (taking their only blade piece) while defending against checkmate in return. On your turn, you can move one of your pieces to an open square, move to take an opponent's piece or &quot;fend&quot; it (sending it to their reserve), place one of your reserved pieces on an open square, withdraw a piece, pass, or use various special moves and aspects of the pieces in play.<br/><br/>Many of the core elements of chess are inverted, removed, or altered to more closely resemble corresponding aspects of fencing. For example, there is no check, and two-way checkmates are possible. There are multiple methods by which a player can make two moves at once, and a wide array of special moves allows for unpredictable ripostes. The 4x16 board is subdivided lengthwise into four &quot;measures&quot; which allow for unique piece movements and flexible range constraints. Positions can get exceedingly complex, and breaking the rules (knowingly or not) is incorporated into the game as a potential grounds for disarmament or sudden-death.<br/><br/>A veney set is made up of collected rocks and trinkets which players cultivate and trade over time. &quot;Token&quot; pieces are won and lost as prizes at the conclusion of a formal game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The more features around it, the greater the score. But beware, the abbot and the scoring of the Spanish Monastery will only happen once those features are fully complete.

        "description": "Science officers brought back a strange alien fungus from a survey mission to an asteroid. Following the usual protocols, the fungus was placed in quarantine, but its explosive growth when exposed to the warmth of the ship caused it to break out of its containment area, shattering the glass and releasing spores into the ventilation shafts.<br/><br/>Now, the alien fungus, dubbed the &quot;Phage&quot; by the ship's scientists, is infecting the crew, turning them into lurching, zombie-like horrors that are taking over the ship! The central power grid has failed, and half the crew are either infected or still in cryosleep.<br/><br/>As captain, it's your job to make the life-and-death decisions. You need to get as many crew members off the ship as possible, but you cannot allow the Phage to escape. You'll have to wake the remaining crew members from cryosleep, power up the lifeboat hangar, keep the oxygen flowing, and initiate the self-destruct sequence. Consult your science officers to gain insights into how the Phage works. Send your engineers to jury-rig mechanisms to keep the Phage at bay. Task your operations personnel with keeping the oxygen flowing and the power online. Order your security officers to cover the retreat of your crew. How many can you save from humanity's first encounter with the Phage?<br/><br/>In this strategic solitaire game, you play cards that represent your crew members to different areas of the ship. The game also plays &quot;Phage&quot; cards representing the ever-advancing influence of the alien fungus to the same areas. Using a simple trick-taking mechanic, you quickly determine whether the humans successfully achieve their goals (such as powering up the Bio Lab or restoring the oxygen supply by repairing the oxygen scrubbers), or whether the Phage have killed off the humans attempting to do so.<br/><br/>Each &quot;station&quot; on the ship provides different winning and losing effects, and managing these effects in the face of the onslaught of the Phage is the key to rescuing crew members from the ship. You win by activating the self-destruct sequence and destroying all of the Phage. You lose if the Phage escapes the ship. Your score at the end of the game is how many of your crew members escape.<br/><br/>",

Battles are fought on two parallel boards: the harsh Illerian desert of the physical world, and the mystical and surreal badlands of the spirit world.  Characters exist in both worlds, and actions in one world often affect the other.  For example, characters can spend actions in one world to boost their counterpart, and killing a character in one world greatly harms them in the other.<br/><br/>Illeria is a miniatures-agnostic game, in which you can play with any models you have.

Public panic is high but arrests are still low, so you and your fellow investigators (or just a bunch of friends) have been tasked with solving these heinous crimes.<br/><br/>Crimewave: California is a hidden movement co-op game. Players choose to play as one of the investigator roles or take on the task of controlling the three criminals.<br/><br/>One player operates as all three killers, who reside in secret locations across the board. On each turn, that player places down crime scenes to try and increase public panic and outsmart the investigators.<br/><br/>On their turn, investigators will move around the board in an effort to locate the killers' residences. Their goal is to work together to find out where the killers are residing by piecing together crime scenes. Investigators also roll dice to try and verify evidence at different crime scenes, which they'll use during the trial phase.<br/><br/>When the investigators successfully take the killers to trial, they go into a courtroom face-off and play defense and prosecution cards to try and increase and decrease their own score.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the highest card score at the end of the trial. For the investigators, the way to win the game is to jail all three killers. Alternatively, if the public panic marker reaches 10 before the killers are jailed, the player controlling all three killers wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In the morning&rsquo;s warm embrace, my limbs felt their old vigor and the undeniable desire to travel. To seize the horizon. To behold hidden wonders. To exhume the words that will give life to my LAST HAIKU.<br/><br/>Last Haiku is a one-player adventure card game with a dose of creative writing. You are the latest in a long line of poets feeling your age, and you know you are not long for this world. Yet you also feel the call of distant, uncanny, and wondrous places where you might seek the inspiration to write one last haiku to leave to the ages to inspire future generations of poets, who may themselves discover stranger, more distant places to spark the words of their own haiku.<br/><br/>This is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with a few index cards and a pen. Each game will add new cards, either maps of locations or haiku your poet composed. The rules provide all the guidance you need for creating new cards and selecting the game&rsquo;s thematic elements, which makes every copy of Last Haiku an evolving, unique world. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. There is no limit to the places you can visit and the poetry you can compose.<br/><br/>Each turn of the game involves playing cards of the appropriate distance. If the card was created in a previous game, your poet travels deeper into the frontier. If you cannot play an existing card, you create a new site on a card and your poet is inspired to write a line of haiku, these lines recorded on a separate card. The game ends when you have written each of three lines forming your poet&rsquo;s last haiku, and your score equals the total of the distances of the new sites visited. Each new site and your haiku then enter the deck permanently.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each party leader is revered and respected by supporters and opponents alike, but are plagued with an insatiable desire for more power. Power is gained by gathering support from the party and by winning the influenceable party members of opponents&rsquo;.<br/><br/>One party leader is the chairman for the round and takes on certain roles and responsibilities. He or she starts the round by saying, &ldquo;for the people&rdquo; at which point everyone picks up the hand they have been dealt and begins to play in an orderly fashion, always abiding by the rules and laws. Proper respect and decorum must be maintained during play including only speaking at appropriate times and only when required by rules and laws. Players keep each other in check by giving a penalty card from the top of the deck for observed deviation from the rules and laws. One player wins the round by playing his or her last card and proclaiming &ldquo;Power for the People!&rdquo;. The winning player collects power, creates a secret law, and becomes the chairman for the next round.<br/><br/>Play continues with the next round. All of the existing rules and laws are in force, but now a secret law is in play. Opponents of the new chairman must deduce the action or lack of action that the secret law requires. Doing so will avoid penalties and enable a potential future win allowing him or her to gain power and write a secret law of their own, for which he or she can penalize other players.<br/><br/>By the final round there may be up to 10 secret laws in effect. At this point it becomes challenging to remember all the laws and rules in order to avoid getting additional cards through penalties. At the end of the final round, the player with the most power becomes the Supreme Leader!<br/><br/>To review, in Power For The People, players establish the party platform, gain power, create and follow secret laws, penalize offenders, and become Supreme Leader!<br/><br/>",

Each player builds the world as the game is played and the decisions start off right away. Players need to decided if they are going to defend, attack, upgrade, or a combination.<br/><br/>Each player has a relic to grab from another player&rsquo;s board which means that they will have two relics from other players on their board. Each player also has customizable dice that can be upgraded during game play. The boards start empty and as the players move and do discoveries the world begins to fill out. The first player to retrieve both of their relics and bring them back to their base wins.<br/><br/>On your turn you will roll three dice (more can be purchased later). Each die has one gold, one wood, one stone, and three movement. You can only bank the gold and the others need to be used that turn. Anything rolled could be used for movement instead of the resources rolled. You use movement to create pathways to your relics. You can use gold to discover more gold, wood, and stone Tetris like pieces which can also be used to block other players. After you make a discovery you can take that resource and modify your dice to improve your future rolls. Other combinations of resources are used to build walls, bridges, and more soldiers. When you have your relic you can only move at half speed to bring it back to base. After someone drops both relics off at base the game immediately ends with that person as victor.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

As you navigate the course there will be hazards and power ups that will make the course harder or easier. However, going after the power ups causes you to detour off course which could be the difference between winning and losing the race. So your teams will have to discuss which pathway you want to go. Throughout the course you will stop at 3 Arenas! These arenas are the proving grounds where your team will relay race against the clock! Each team member will perform a different task while their teammates guess correct answers. You will need to get all of the tasks done in a row before the three-minute timer goes off in order to keep advancing down the board. Once you have made it to and completed the 3rd Arena you have reached the finish line and are the winners of Relay Rivals!<br/><br/>",

You do this by answering questions anywhere from logic puzzles to open-ended opinion questions to move across the board. These questions are scenarios you may encounter as mayor or problems that could happen in a city. One player takes on the role of &quot;Council Master&quot; and judge the answers of the two teams deciding whether they can move on or repeat the question. The Council Master will have two biases from the bias deck that inform their opinion about proposed answers.<br/><br/>This game encourages players to think through logical arguments and their reasoning behind their answers. No matter how good the end solution is, if a player does not support it with a logical argument, they will fail that question. This games also encourages teamwork as the players except for the Council Master are split into two separate teams who must work together.<br/><br/>The end goal of this game is to be able to use it in the classroom to teach logic, argument skills, teamwork, and engage students. It was created with a math classroom (specifically geometry) but it can be used in any classroom, especially government classes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Taking turns, following the lead of the Employee of the Moment, players will divide up company assets, choosing pallets of randomly sorted cargo.<br/><br/>Once all the cargo has been seized, each crew member will deposit their pallet's cargo into a locked storage container. The three shared storage containers are only opened at the end of the game, so each crew member will have to remember where they stored cargo as well as what type of cargo other crew members stored.<br/><br/>After answering three Distress Calls, sorting and securing cargo each time, the ship will set its autopilot for the nearest Processing Facility where the containers with the least Space Trash are deposited and their contents scored.

Critters are your monsters while Specials are a grab-bag of tricky hijinks, trinkets, and rule-warping events. You refill your entire 6-card hand every turn, giving the game's cardplay a fast pace.<br/>A player's board is a grid split into two areas, the Hideout and the Cavern. Players prepare their Critters in the Hideout and then send them to the Cavern to battle for Crystals, a precious resource that functions as score.<br/><br/>Critters have stats used for battle and a &ldquo;Star Rank.&quot; Critters can be upgraded from 1 to 2 and then 3 Stars to power them up. They also have card text that grants them a wide variety of combo-able powers.<br/><br/>Strategic positioning, clever deckbuilding, and a pinch of luck are key to victory in the Caverns!<br/><br/>",

A game for 3-5 players, players must amass legions, horde gold, and gain senate support to control the board.<br/><br/>With 15 different Emperors to choose from, each player has unique abilities and traits to take advantage of during the game.<br/>Every player resolves a number of phases per turn:<br/>They will first collect tax from the Provinces they own and also gather Senate Support points according to the number of their Provinces. They then decide how many Legions to pay for and recruit, and place them anywhere they have a Garrison stationed.<br/><br/>From there, the player moves any number of Legions they wish, into whatever provinces they share borders with; this could mean conquering a new location, regrouping with their Garrisons or Invading another player!<br/><br/>If an Invasion occurs, the players concerned must resolve the conflict - first based on numbers, then Emperor's traits, and then the use of ability cards!<br/><br/>Once a conflict is resolved, the player will draw a Catastrophe card!<br/>Catastrophes will threaten to destroy you throughout the game by costing you Gold, Legions or Senate Support. Many Emperors will have traits that can help them against certain Catastrophes. Otherwise, the player must rely on sound strategy and luck to survive and conquer! Each Catastrophe can effect either the current player, or other players depending on circumstance!<br/><br/>The game is an elimination process; if an Emperor loses any one of the main three currencies (Gold, Senate Support &amp; Legions), then they die and are eliminated.<br/><br/>Once there are only two remaining players, the rush begins - the first Emperor to 20 Provinces wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Invented by Sofia and Luca, two siblings under 10 who mostly get along.<br/><br/>Get everyone to the table! Koala Kraze is for 2-8 players ages 6 and up, and you'll learn to play in 2 minutes. The game's 100 cards fit in a small box, so you can take it with you anywhere you go!<br/><br/>We commissioned some amazing hand-painted koalas just for this game, and their personalities burst through the cards!<br/><br/>Ready for Extreme mode? Start with the Junior mode to keep it simpler for younger kids, or try Extreme mode for older kids and adults!<br/><br/>Koala Kraze is a family-friendly game where the goal is to use your Koala Friends to discard all your cards first. If you've played Uno, Crazy Eights, or any other card-shedding game, you already know how to play!<br/><br/>Shuffle the deck, deal some cards out, and you're ready to play! Each turn, you'll play a Number card or a Koala card. Number cards can be played if they're one above or one below the Number card on the discard pile. If a Koala card's on top, play any number card you like! Each Koala card has a special power to help you play or discard more cards. Use the Burglar to switch hands with another player, or play the Big Boss to make a player discard a Koala card.<br/><br/>You can play two modes with the same cards. The simpler 'Junior' version is all about getting rid of your cards first, which is great for younger kids. A game like this is great for teaching colors and numbers, or for recognizing colors and numbers as the game gets fast!<br/><br/>If playing with older kids or adults, the 'Extreme' version adds a bit more challenge while keeping the core gameplay the same. As you play, pay attention to the scoring icons which say 'plus' or 'minus'. Sometimes the card you want to play will cost you points, so be careful! Some Koalas (like the Disk Jockey) will help discard those cards so they won't hurt your score, and a waypoint system ensures you can't go below certain milestones once you've achieved them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Save the video board game world from rogue polyomino buildings by diverting them carefully around the Meeple People and onto their proper places.  As the hero of the digital world, use the foresight granted to you by the polyomino cards and use precision to maximize points in the retro style puzzle game.<br/><br/>The game is played over 24 short rounds of one card each.  When each card is played, all players will choose which of the pieces to slide onto their own personal Arcade Board following two main rules:<br/><br/><br/>     Like pieces cannot touch sides.  <br/><br/><br/>AND<br/><br/><br/>     A piece cannot be played below one already placed.<br/><br/><br/>Over the course of the game, you will gain bonus points in the form of coins by covering spaces with matching pieces on the board or from completing highlighted half rows.  If you are unable to play a piece for any reason, you will lose two of your hard earned coins for each!  You must plan efficiently to avoid this, keeping in mind that, out of the 8 possible shapes, you only get 4 of each.  Score at the end of the game for collected coins, building tall columns, covering gold squares at the top of the board and saving Meeple People.  Add in &quot;?&quot; cards that let you pick any piece you want and abilities that give you a chance at extra points or take on the evil Tetro Corporation in 12 challenging solo levels and Retro Tetro will entertain you for hours!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the description<br/><br/>",

Although not official, airmen would have their badges custom made in London and worn concealed under the lapels of their uniforms. This was an exclusive club that nobody signed up for. You could say, you just fell into it.<br/><br/>In Winged Boot, you assume the role of a downed bomber crew member. You could be anyone from the pilot to the tail gunner. The game picks up from the point of exiting the aircraft and continues until you are either killed, captured, or rescued. Once that end has been met, you can then step back in time to assume the role of one of the other surviving crewmen, from the beginning. That is, of course, if there were any.<br/><br/>You may find that some, or all, of your fellow crewmembers went down with the aircraft and you may or may not link up with the survivors on the ground. Either way, it is now your mission to evade capture and make your way through enemy territory and find your way back to your squadron in England.<br/><br/>Winged Boot is a stand-alone choose your own adventure style game, but it is designed as an add on for Bomb Run, a solitaire, B-17 bomber experience. It could easily be applied to games like B-17, Queen of the Skies and Target for Today.<br/><br/>Winged Boot is played from a large coil bound book of 72 pages using 21 different 2-page maps and pages of narrative driven paragraphs to help tell your story.<br/><br/>Winged Boot comes with an entire fresh crew that you can mix in and play with your copy of Bomb Run.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

RP is represented by silver/gold coins and glass gems.<br/><br/>Some of the other spaces include monsters, which earn players RP based on their class, and loot chests which allow the player to draw from a limited deck of loot cards. When the loot deck runs out, loot can be taken from other players.<br/><br/>Once every player reaches the end of the track, the reputation for each player totaled and each player is given a title based on their finishing RP.

Everything else you have to scavenge for, fight for or craft yourself. Use the strength and skills of the saurians by adding them to your squad with a catching utensil. Collect everything you need on the plain, in the cave and on the lake to face the ultimate challenge in the jungle: the T-Rex!<br/><br/>You start with a deck consisting of 9 base cards and move along the hexagonal game board. During the game you will visit different locations and expand your deck with cards from a selection of 165 uniquely designed objects and saurians. With your cards you can move, attack, defend yourself, craft, trade and use card effects. As the game goes on you prepare yourself to defeat the T-Rex before the other player/team does. This wins you the game. The T-Rex is regularly moving withing the jungle, so you have to plan how to get to it safely with enough attack power in hand to best it. There are five different T-Rex variants which determine the game's difficulty/duration.<br/><br/>Saurvival is a mix of board and card game.

This can dramatically flush out a faction's options and strategic decisions from early on in the game.

This fight to the death between the two best warriors of the two factions will determine who will be the victor and who will claim for himself the lands of Lundor. Since ancient times, the final duel has been used as a last resort and takes place in Rindel's castle. Which warrior will be the victor? The Barbarian or the Elf?<br/><br/>Super Castle Fighter is a card-based combat game for 1-2 players ages 12+ that plays in 15-30 minutes created by Victor Robles, designed by Lizuren Games and published by The Game Crafter. Each player chooses a character and must fight to the death using cards as special techniques. The player who wins 2 rounds by reducing the opponent's life to 0 is the winner. To use an attack card or special move, you must pay the cost with your controller cards. The opponent can counter those attacks by blocking or using instant cards on the opponent's turn. Some attacks require power points. Accumulate power and spend it at the right time to deal the final blow and claim victory.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The goal is simple, gather all the cards into your hand but getting there...that's quite the challenge. Forget what you know about fighting fair and time your attacks by counting other Raider's cards.<br/><br/>In clockwise order, players lay the top card of their face-down hand in the center of the field. All players must watch carefully for certain rune combinations/color series and slap the pile first to lay claim to it. Each weapon card challenges the gathering cards in the playing field, the strength of each indicated by hash marks along the edge of the card. The player following a weapon card may choose to meet the challenge or forfeit the plunder.<br/><br/>Watch carefully for the Ravens, they hold the fate of the game. The Blue Raven is an instant slap condition whereas an ill-timed claim of the Red Raven may leave you amongst the ranks of the dead.<br/><br/>A player who has emptied their hand has become a Valkyrie and they may no longer challenge or add to the field. Valkyrie may at any time slap combinations. These cards enter Valhalla and are no longer in play thereby thinning the deck and raising the stakes. If the Valkyrie is able to gather both Ravens into their hand, they have won the game.<br/><br/>Will you dominate your foes by implementing Weapons of War or join the ranks of the Valkyrie as harbingers of Ragnar&ouml;k?

The first edition is a map of the United States.<br/><br/>We welcome fellow explorers, dreamers, trailblazers, curiosity-seekers and casual bucket-listers of every kind to the Bucket Race!<br/><br/>The game consists of the following phases:<br/><br/>1. Setting up the game:<br/> - Game setup<br/> - Player setup<br/> - Choose a Home Destination<br/><br/>2. Game flow:<br/> - First Turn, Every Turn<br/> - Additional Actions<br/> - Ending the Game<br/><br/>The board has the following components:  <br/> - Game board (map of US with 5 distinct region with 1 reward lounge each, 45 destinations with a # between 2-12, spaces for 2 supplies that are randomized at the game's onset)<br/> - Game pieces: 2 dice, 5 player pieces, 52 deck of Surprise! Cards, 52 deck of Upgrade Cards, 5 wet erase markers, 90 supplies, 5 reward lounge tokens, Money<br/> - Rules booklet<br/> - 18 Persona Cards/Bucket Lists - the heart of the game is selecting a Persona Card/Bucket List which is the character you will take on and have to complete their bucket list the fastest in order to win.<br/><br/>Game flow: <br/>Each turn players first collect $100, then roll the dice to see if they can collect additional money (many ways through dice rolls, Surprise! Cards, also if roll doubles get an additional $100!).  Then they use money to pay to move their game piece, collect and manage supplies, check-off bucket list items, visit rewards lounges for additional upgrade cards, redeem upgrade cards if in possession, or trade and sell supplies to other players.<br/><br/>The first player to check-off all Bucket List items on their Persona Card and travel back to their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; destination, wins the Bucket Race!<br/><br/>This is a game where it is best to collaborate early on (trade supplies, help each other out), but then the last stretch it is truly a race to see who can win first!<br/><br/>Additionally, the bucket list items are based on real-life bucket lists, so we like to think this is a learning and travel game as well!  It is perfect for those that love competitive, strategy board games with travel and culture.<br/><br/>3-5 players or can play in teams.  There are 3 versions (Easy Tenderfoot, Medium Trailblazer, Advanced Globetrotter).  We recommend starting with Easy first to get the hang of the game.  Usually takes between 50-75 minutes to play, although for experienced gamers you could complete in 30-45 minutes if do a speed round.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

From other side is printed an ornament. Each chip has on the sides 3 different symbols, made as shaped cutouts, it is a triangle, a square and a circle. 6 play chips from 66 are rare POWERCHIPS, they are described with cut-through marks. Game rules are based on using the pictures or using the cutouts. No gameboard is needed, only small piece of flat place is enough to play 3KSES. <br/>Two players compete against each other, 4 and 6 players then builds a team which is cooperating and competing other team.<br/><br/>Game 1 | FIND A MATCH  - 66 play chips are placed on table in 11 groups, 6 pieces of chips i each group. Players are trying to find 2 pictures of the same building to get a MATCH, in the end of the game the winner with more pairs wins the game. IT is good memory fitness training.<br/><br/>Game 2 | JOINTS - 66 play chips are distributed to players, each player gets same amount of chips and put in a stack in front of them in a column. The shaped cutout symbols on the chips are used here. First player put first play chip from his stack on a desk and other player can lay one of his chips to connect it only with the same symbol to one of the chips laying on the table, it makes a JOINT between two connected chip. For each JOINT made player plays one new chip, so if it makes 2 JOINTs - is playing 2 times in his turn, gives quicklier chips from his stack to the table. The trick is to get a combination of more chips near each other to build 2 or 3 JOINTs in one time. <br/>POWERCHIPS is special, of course, doesn't need to be played out when in top of stack, but can be put near for later use and play normal chip instead. POWERCHIP has the ability to turn chips to get a compatible shape for connection.   <br/>Player or team who first gets rid of all chips of their stack is a Winner. It is great logic fitness training.<br/><br/>Game 3 | TAMITADY - 66 play chips are mixed and each player gets 1 POWERCHIP and any 6 pieces of normal chips. One player to players, each player gets same amount of chips and put in a stack in front of them. The shaped cutout symbols on the chips are used here. First player put first play chip from his stack on a desk and other player can lay one of his chips to connect it only with the same symbol to one of the chips laying on the table. For each connection made is played one new chip,so player which connect one chip to 2 other chips, is playing 2 times in his turn, gives quicklier chips from his stack to the table.

Your goal is to get the biggest number of creatures in your group. At the start of the game the players decide on a number of creature that they need to get to win and the first player to get those creature and return to start wins. In the setup cards are distributed into numerous piles. Each turn, players can travel to adjacent piles and decide whether to encounter a creature there. By putting forward the best creatures for each encounter, you can befriend and recruit new creatures or battle and subdue them. Your success depends on whether they like each other, what the creatures are good and bad at fighting, and what type of creatures they are. Remembering the characteristics of the other creatures that have been encountered can help you to strategically match creatures in an encounter so as to grow your group.

The trip is a fringe benefit of a speaking engagement you had earlier in the day at a symposium on modern day crime-solving techniques.  Now that you've given your presentation, you are free for the rest of the week to do nothing but sample all the fresh seafood, bask in the warm sunshine, and revel in the complete lack of responsibility. The activity at the top of your &ldquo;to-do&rdquo; list is to stop by the town&rsquo;s Founder&rsquo;s Festival.  You've read a lot of interesting stories about the festival and the town itself and think it would be a shame to miss this opportunity.  You reconsider your position on the matter when you arrive at the festival and see an all too familiar site at the end of a row of tents - police tape. The stark yellow tape seems out of place in such an idyllic locale.  As you move closer, you see two men wearing Murphree County Coroner shirts carrying a black body bag.  The sheriff&rsquo;s deputies who are attempting to investigate the scene seem to be in over their heads. The head detective on the case, Ryan Clark, recognizes you from the symposium and informs you that they've never seen a case quite like this before.  Given your expertise, Clark asks if you&rsquo;d like to help them on this investigation.  He promises all the lobster rolls and blueberry pie you can eat!  How can you say no to that?  Pull back the curtain and examine the dark heart that beats beneath this sleepy, seaside town.

        "description": "Players control city-states in Ancient Greece, and vie for control of other cities in the Greek mainland.<br/><br/>Players acquire power through the form of four influence types: Military, Diplomatic, Cultural, and Economic.  Each type has unique ways of counteracting the others, and players must be adaptable to succeed.  Multiple winners are possible, so forging alliances and well-timed betrayals can help players end the game among the victors.<br/><br/>The main goal of the game is to gain the most Glory, and the game ends when the pool of Glory Tokens is depleted.  Players may erect monuments, which provide alternate paths to victory once the game has ended.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW<br/><br/>Players start by selecting a city state, each which has two advantages and a disadvantage, and two focus influence types; there's also a jack-of-all-trades city which doesn't have a focus, but its advantages let it switch among the influence types more easily.  Each city is not a specialization, but more of a slight nudge off center.  If a city needs to switch tactics based on the situation, they are each able to gain cards and influence of other types to meet the challenge.  Each player city contains three districts, which can be developed using building and tradesmen cards; other cities only have 1 district each.<br/><br/>Influence is gained in mainly two ways.  Players may select what influence to gain each turn (with extra cards if for each focus type chosen), but this happens at the end of each turn, so players must plan ahead for what they will do.  The second way is at the start of each turn, but is more randomized.  The buildings and tradesmen used to develop a district each have a production number, and gain an influence if that number is rolled.  Players may also trade influence and cards on their turn; trading has the extra benefit of making a one-round truce between the trading players, which gives some measure of safety and ensures the traded items won't be immediately used against them.<br/><br/>For those influence-gaining rolls, the current player rolls two 8-sided dice:  one applies to all players, and the other only to the rolling player.  If a rolled number matches a production number the district the card is on gains an influence; however, there is a limit to the influence each district can store, so the same number getting rolled repeatedly doesn't grant extra influence.  Also, the game setup makes it so at the start of the game each player has access to cards with the same numbers on them, so players gain influence at the same rate; later cards are needed to diversify their numbers. The starting cards have a 1, 2, or 5 on them (the 8 is only for rare cards, so will mostly be unavailable for players), so 50% of the values are already matching at the beginning.  Furthermore, the values 1-4 are only on buildings, and 5-7 are only on tradesmen; since tradesmen must be added onto buildings, the higher numbers are less accessible.<br/><br/>Each district can perform one action every turn, so the more cities you control the more you can do.  Since most actions cost influence, it's often best to not use all your actions to save your influence for later.  Actions allow players to use abilities, which mainly come from two sources: a set of basic abilities available at all times, and event cards a player draws to their hand.  The event cards correspond to the four influence types, and usually require influence of that type to use.<br/><br/>Victory points, called &quot;Glory&quot; in the game, are gained by placing your pawns (called &quot;Officials&quot;) on the board, as well as by winning special events called Contention Rolls.  Contention rolls represent things like battles and votes, and utilize a push-your-luck mechanic to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>Each influence type has a contention roll, and are the main way officials are added (there is a basic ability to add an official to a neutral tile; the contention rolls are used mainly against other players).  First, the player who initiated the roll allocates all their resources, plays abilities, gets allies, and rolls; then once their value is determined, the targeted player does the same.  This allows for a player to defend with few or no resources if the odds are too stacked against them; they can always use the influence they saved for their own contention roll later).  The player who initiated the roll has the added benefit of rerolling their die before the targeted player allocates any resources; however, doing so costs some of the influence allocated to the contention roll, so their total potential value will weaken with each reroll.<br/><br/>Turns start with drawing an Adversity Card, which is the &quot;bad stuff happens&quot; card.  Based on the officials and buildings a player controls, it's more or less likely that one of their cities will revolt.  A city under revolt more or less returns it to a neutral state, and makes it more vulnerable to contention rolls.  There is also the Olympics card, which makes a universal truce for a round, which is great if you need a breather in the game to consolidate your gains, but can be disruptive if you've been preparing a big move which now has to wait another round.  The setup also makes sure the Olympics is on the first round, so it has somewhat of a built-in tutorial to allow players to get the gist of a turn before targeting one another.<br/><br/>The four influence types counteract one another, but not in a rock-paper-scissors way: instead they have unique ways of interacting with the board and other players.  Diplomatic influence deals mostly with how cities are connected to one another, and a disconnected city cannot use the influence or actions available to it; this influence can strike anywhere and limit the options available to other players.  Economic influence doesn't gain more influence, but does allow it to be moved to where it's most effective, making it more efficient; furthermore they allow players to take the influence of others as well as being a requirement for each building card.  Cultural influence is more defensive in nature, and helps defend against both contention rolls and adversity cards; on the flip side, players can use it against opponents to get more revolt tokens, and is the only type which can modify rolls due to adversity cards, acting as an alternative to contention rolls.  Finally, military influence is able to remove effects from all influence types from a city, but its gains are the most vulnerable from all influence types as well, making it have a more easy-come-easy-go effect.<br/><br/>Players will need to select which influence types to focus on as the game goes on, and might need to change based on the available resources and actions of other players.  Trying to focus on all four types will generally just mean you're weak in all four, whereas focusing exclusively on one leaves you very vulnerable to the other three types.  Most of the time focusing on two and dabbling in a third is the way to go; stockpiling the influence type not being used can help defending against contention rolls of that type.  Since up to half of the players can win a game, cooperating with other players and trading for the influence you need is the best way to make sure you're prepared for what comes up next.<br/><br/>The instruction manual is set up in a learn-as-you-go format, so you perform steps as you read them rather than having to read the whole thing before starting the game.  Relevant rules are referenced as you go through a section, so you know what to read when.  A quick-reference sheet is on the back of the manual, the setups for the various maps are in the first opened page, and the rules for how Contention Rolls affect the game board are in a distinctly styled page where the staples are, so the frequently referenced rules have quick access.  There is also an appendix which gives an example of each game component, some historical context, as well as suggestions on how the game components interact with one another.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Together, from their character&rsquo;s perspective, they have to communicate and develop ideas for projects. Afterwards, they have to present their ideas to a committee, which chooses the best ideas on the basis of different criteria. During that selection, a shift of perspective happens, because players have to slip in different roles as part of the committee.<br/>The exchange of arguments in constructive discussions and finding compromises creates a competency development in democratic, social and environmentally sustainable reasoning.<br/><br/>Torfitz can be played with 6 to 30 players. There are 3 different variations of the game with varying complexity and game durations of 45 min, 60 min and 90 min.

However, people who couldn't resist the allure of tea secretly had tea brought to their homes by mafia organizations and held tea parties. The mafia members in charge of delivering tea were dressed in maid uniforms. They became known as &quot;Maid Mafia.&quot;<br/><br/>Maid x Mafia x Kai is the second game in the serie after the first Maid x Gun x Tea which was a smaller scale prototype.<br/><br/>Battle on the map of Kobe with your fellow players. First player to reach 25 points on the score track win the game. Gain points by smuggling tea in a pick-up and delivery gameplay and bringing them from the ports/warehouses to the shop that will serve it. Hire additional maids that will share their movement points to deliver more tea and battle henchmen or other player's maid with the use of the confrontation card system.<br/>But be careful, you are all part of the same organization so attacking another player will brand you as an enemy. Yet, among the many actions at your disposal, it may sometimes be the best option. Happy smuggling!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Resilience Survive and Thrive is a tabletop card game that aims to teach its players lessons on balanced development and natural resiliency under the climate change lens.<br/><br/>Each round is divided into several phases: Draw, Activity, Impact, Community and Crisis.<br/><br/>In the Draw phase, each player draws 2 cards from the Development deck. If the number of cards from the players' hands exceeds 7, they must discard the extra cards.<br/><br/>In the Activity phase, each player can do up to 3 activities. An Activity can be a combination of any of the following:<br/><br/>     Restoring an Environment - turning over an environment card back to its position on the playmat.<br/>     Playing an Investment - placing an Investment card from your hand into your community.<br/>     Playing a House - placing any card facedown and sideways from your hand into your community. Houses are Gray Investments and give 1 Development Point (DP).<br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Apply Impact phase, players will specific impacts of the Investment cards they have placed onto the playmat. Different Investments have different impacts:<br/><br/>     Sustainable Investments increase DPs depending on how sustainable its associated Environment is.<br/>     Commercial Investment can destroy the environment, removing 1 Environment card from the playmat, but also gives the player 4 DP.<br/>     Conservation Investment restore 1 particular Environment card but does not give any DP.<br/><br/><br/>In the Community phase, players can play 1 Action card. If the player does not play an Action card, they can take 1 card from the Development deck instead or simply pass. Action cards are used to gain an upper hand against the player's opponents. Place the Action card into the discard pile once played. In this phase, players can also cast votes to close down one Investment at play. Voted Investments go into the discard pile.<br/><br/>Lastly, in the Crisis phase, the top card is revealed and its effect applied.<br/><br/>     If the revealed Crisis is an Extreme Weather Event, players must determine its effect by counting the associated Environment, then apply the destruction to each community.<br/>     If the revealed Crisis is an End Game Crisis, destroy all cards of the specific Environment type and place the End Game card on its slot in the playmat. The game continues as long as the 3 End Game slots are not yet occupied.<br/><br/><br/>After the crisis, return to the Draw phase to start a new round.<br/><br/>",

John Lambshead has taken the work out of scenario building. He presents a selection of thirty-six missions of varying complexity, each with clear objectives and victory conditions, a map showing set-up zones and some with special rules. Although they are set in his imagined dystopian city of Civitas Cavernum (aka The Sprawl), with its factions of Scavs, Proctors, Cultists and Corporates, the scenarios are designed to be adaptable to almost any setting and set of rules (including those published in the author&rsquo;s One-hour Skirmish Wargames). In addition, there are no less than three mini-campaigns that link the scenarios together in various combinations.<br/><br/>But that is not all. John Lambshead gives advice on designing your own scenarios and campaigns and there is even a set of tables allowing you to quickly create them through random dice rolls, ensuring almost infinite variety to your games. Finally, there is a useful reference section listing websites of rules publishers and manufacturers of suitable miniatures and model terrain.

The play style uses some common techniques, such as matching the color or text of the previously played card, but has a number of interesting twists. A unique element of the game is that every number card played causes all players to switch to that numbered stack. You are constantly moving and reevaluating your strategy as the cards in your hand change. Also, some cards allow a player to swap a stack with another player, discard and entire stack at one time, choose an opponent's stack to look at, and cause an opponent to create a new stack.<br/><br/>Each player has an Immunity tile which can be played once per game to block a card played against them. There is an intriguing mix of strategy, random chance, and mischief that gets more fun the more times you play the game.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-4 players age 8+ and has been play tested with players as old as 80 years. The game consists of 200 game cards, 36 numbered tokens, 4 Immunity tiles and a direction of play disc. Play time tends to be 30-40 min. per game.<br/><br/>",

In flooded areas, a large amount of fish is retained in lagoons and bays, attracting many birds in search of food. In May, the rains stop and the waters begin to slowly recede. This annual cycle of floods renews fauna and flora, maintaining the ecological balance of the biome.<br/><br/>In Pantanal, players add a Landscape Tile to the group of tiles in the center of the table, forming a landscape of fields, lakes and rivers throughout the game.<br/><br/>The tile placement is very important, as each player has a Character Card to score at the end of the game according to the distribution of that character in the tiles landscape. Each player keeps his identity a secret, being able, at any time during the game, to make guesses about other players' characters. Correct guesses score Victory Points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>When placing a tile, the player can also receive Guaviras tokens, which can be used to buy tiles or Biome Cards, with objectives that score extra points at the end of the game. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

A player wins by quickly finding &quot;Xor0&quot; groups of cards. Techniques for finding Xor0 groups include visual pattern matching, dot counting, binary numbers math, or any combination thereof.<br/><br/>A Xor0 group is a group of cards where each dot color appears an even number of times. The name of the game derives from the fact that after summing up the numbers on each card and applying the mathematical XOR operation to them has the result zero.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. A round starts by taking seven cards from a shuffled deck and placing them face up on the table. There is always at least one Xor0 group present in the seven cards. The player who first spots a Xor0 group announces it by saying &quot;Xor0!&quot; and pointing out the group. All player collaboratively validate that the group is indeed a Xor0 group. If confirmed, the player who found the group takes the cards in the group. Otherwise, the player must pause until another player finds a valid group. After a player found and took the cards, the seven cards on the table are replenished from the deck and all players look for the next Xor0 group. The round ends as soon as the last card is drawn from the deck. The player who collected the most cards during a round wins. Ties are broken by number of dots collected.<br/><br/>The difficulty of the game can be adjusted by playing with a partial deck that omits one (or two or three) of the six dot colors.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Stinkbug card forces players to play a random card from their hand and hope to land in the safe zone. This gets more and more challenging as the game progresses. The Stinkbomb Shield and Stinkbug Repellent cards push the challenge back to the player who started the challenge which leads to unexpected twists and turns with unpredictable outcomes.<br/>If your card pushes the stink level into the danger zone you must flip over one of the five stink pile cards which are placed face-down in a fan-like pattern under the draw pile to see if you are the Stinker, or prove everyone wrong:<br/><br/>     If you get the You Stink card, bummer, you are the Stinker and you lost the game!<br/>     If you get the Not Me card, great, you&rsquo;re saved!

        "description": "Calamandara is a competitive and strategic board game, playable by 2 to 4 people. Here the playeres, called Travelers, must compete against each other to reach the center point of the board. Each traveler starts the game at the beginning of their respective board and to move his pawn around the the grid board he needs to use Dogmatic Symbols, which are tokens that have specific attributes.<br/><br/>Each Dogmatic Symbol has a different function that will help travelers navigate the board. As an example, some symbols help the traveler move faster while others can disrupt their opponents' journey to the center of the board.<br/><br/>While the use of Dogmatic Symbols happens and the players' pawns advance across the board, the travelers also use the Memory Cards, which serve to intensify their moves or cause sudden changes in their opponents' strategy. Those special cards are limited and travelers need to choose the right time to use them wisely.<br/><br/>Each Traveler will perform 4 types of actions or phases on their turn:<br/><br/>1st Phase: The traveler will Acquire Dogmatic Symbols using Symbol Cards.<br/><br/>2nd Phase: The traveler will be able to Insert the Dogmatic Symbols on the board to start setting up his movement strategy.<br/><br/>3rd Phase: The traveler will be able to Move his Traveler Token (pawn) on the board, according to the positioning of the Dogmatic Symbols on his board.<br/><br/>4th Phase: The traveler will be able to Reserve, Discard and Acquire Memory Cards.<br/><br/>The Memory Cards can be used at any time in the game, providing a unique dynamism in all matches.<br/><br/>To achieve victory, it is necessary to create a good strategy and make the right decisions, thinking about the present and the future. The multiple possibilities of using Dogmatic Symbols and Memory Cards will make players explore reasoning and risk management in their decisions.<br/><br/>And the objective is simple: Whoever reaches the center of the board first wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Weak individually, in a flotilla of six, they are a match for a cruiser and can damage a dreadnought enough that it won&rsquo;t just buff out. In some ways, they are eggs armed with sledgehammers.<br/><br/>This title includes a 16-page rulebook, including rules, ship descriptions, and eight scenarios. There are 15 new gunboats and a new monster. Banshees are found in hordes, looking for sites, preferably bases or anything slow-moving and poorly armed, to build breeding nests. There is a scenario for a solo player featuring these creatures. Be sure and defend your base, or you will have even more banshees to fight against!  Of course, there are the images you need to create your own counters.<br/><br/>This product provides additional ships for use in Federation Commander. You will need one of the entry-point products (Klingon Border, Romulan Border, Academy) to use these ships. Either the Reference Rulebook or modules introducing more empires are useful for the ships from those empires.<br/><br/>- description from the publisher's blurb<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ALP is a game that is creepy enough to be seriously fun where you get to hunt ghosts with friends. And the ghosts get to hunt you back.<br/><br/>Tired of babyish ghost games for scaredy cats, but not about to bust out the ouija, because you know better? Ready for a real ghost themed board game to shiver your timbers while you battle your friends?  This one's real... Real fun.  Up to 6 players can play as skeptics OR believers. Compete to collect evidence cards and survive ghosts effects from each haunted location you dare to investigate. But beware, when you play with ghosts, they play back.  Will you be the Psychic, the TV host, The Camera Guy, The Agent, The Priest or the Skeptic? And will you beat the bumps in the night? Roll the dice, spin the ghost effects planchette. Be the first to prove or debunk, while sabotaging your meddling colleagues. Don't get labeled a quack and hold on to your evidence! The hunt is on.<br/><br/>&mdash;description the designer<br/><br/>",

A young girl rushes to the center for items only to be shot by a bow and arrow. A dehydrated jock runs around desperately searching for a source of water. A small girl wins by luring her attackers into a river swarming with piranhas. With fog of war mechanics and a plethora of formidable opponents, you&rsquo;ll never feel safe for long. During the game, you control one of the characters, each with unique skillsets and traits that cover the different playstyles you&rsquo;re familiar with. Cade, the big jock, thrives in combat and loves to hunt down weaker opponents with strength-based weapons. Regina, on the other hand, is agile and likes to take out competitors from a distance. Ivy, the frail girl, prefers to let the environment do her dirty work and merely out-survive the competition.<br/><br/>Sector is a competitive game for up to eight players. With a wide variety of characters, items to collect, and new arenas every time you play, each game is a unique cinematic experience.<br/><br/>The game is played over three phases, the Center Stage, the Game Stage, and the End Stage.<br/><br/>In the Center Stage, player pawns are arranged in a circle on a central game board where they can move inward to collect items and engage in combat with others or move outward onto individual maps behind cardboard screens to explore the arena  and temporarily get out of harm's way.<br/><br/>The Game Stage begins once all players have left the central game board and are on their individual player maps. Each round of the Game Stage consists of players moving locations, performing location checks to see if another player is in the same spot on the map, fighting another player in combat if in the same location, performing actions to acquire resources from the environment and resolving event cards.<br/><br/>The End Stage begins once all players have moved back onto the central game board after a deadly fog has pushed them inward from their individual maps. The central game board's play area is reduced every round to force players into combat until only one remains.<br/><br/>The combat system combines the chosen characters' unique traits and skills with the weapons they possess and varying ranges to determine if dice rolls result in successful attacks.<br/><br/>",

Combine delicious Topping cards, use sneaky Actions, and create the tastiest Toasts spread to score the most points!<br/><br/><br/>    Setup*<br/><br/><br/>Separate the Base Toast pile, Draw pile, and Time to Eat card.<br/>Shuffle the Draw pile. <br/>Deal each player two Base Toast cards and three cards from the Draw pile. <br/>For two to three players, shuffle the Time to Eat card into the bottom 1/3 of the Draw pile. For four players, shuttle it into the bottom 1/4 of the Draw pile.<br/>Place the Base Toast (faceup) and Draw piles within reach of all players.<br/>Determine the starting player by selecting the player who last ate toast.<br/><br/><br/>    Gameplay Overview*<br/><br/><br/>Toasty Toasts is played over several turns, where each player may take a number of actions before passing the turn to the next player on their left (clockwise). Turns continue until the &ldquo;Time to Eat!&rdquo; card is drawn, at which point the game ends, and players proceed to the scoring phase.<br/><br/>    Player Turns*<br/><br/><br/>Each player turn can be split into three quick phases (Draw, Play, Hand Check).<br/><br/><br/>    Draw Phase*<br/><br/><br/>The active player draws two cards from the Draw pile. If the active player has no cards in hand at the beginning of their turn, they instead draw three cards.<br/><br/><br/>    Play Phase*<br/><br/><br/>During the active player&rsquo;s play phase, they may make up to two plays. A player may choose to pass at any time on their turn, as a result a player may make 0, 1, or 2 plays on their turn.  Most plays only require a single play. These include: <br/>Playing a single topping or action card<br/>Playing two cards as part of a matching or combination pair<br/>Trading any two cards for a new Base Toast. <br/>Additionally, Players may play Plain Toast cards in two different capacities&mdash;as a Base Toast, or as a Sandwich.<br/><br/><br/>    Playing an Topping Card*<br/><br/><br/>For a single play, the active player may play a topping card face up on one of their Base Toast or Plain Toast cards. Toppings may not be placed on a Toast that already holds a topping if the topping does not: <br/>a. Match the played topping<br/>b. Combo with the played topping<br/>A single Toast may hold any number of matching toppings, or toppings that combo with each other. Combo toppings do not require a direct 1:1 ratio of each topping to be placed on a Toast.<br/><br/><br/>    Playing an Action Card*<br/><br/><br/>For a single play, the active player may play an Action card. When playing an Action card, resolve the text printed on the card, then place the card into the discard pile.  <br/>Playing Matching Topping Pairs<br/>For a single play, the active player may play two matching toppings on a single toast.<br/>As with single placement restrictions, the active player may not place a matching topping pair onto a toast which already holds one or more toppings that the played toppings do not match or form a combination with.<br/><br/><br/>    Playing a Combination Pair*<br/><br/><br/>For a single play, the active player may play two toppings on a single toast provided the toppings form a combination pair. Combination toppings share card color and are designated on each topping card. Combination pairs include:<br/>- Peanut Butter &amp; Jelly<br/>- Bacon &amp; Egg<br/>- Tomato &amp; Avocado<br/>- Choco Spread &amp; Banana<br/><br/>As with single placement restrictions, the active player may not place a combination pair onto a toast which already holds a topping that is not part of the combination pair.<br/><br/>    Trading for a Base Toast*<br/><br/><br/>For a single play, the active player may trade a combination of any two Toast, Topping, or Action cards in their hand for a Base Toast from the Base Toast pile. Base Toast cards are placed immediately in front of the active player next to their other Toasts.<br/>-Note- This play may only be performed once per turn.<br/>Playing a Plain Toast Card<br/>Plain Toasts are unique in that they may be played in two different capacities: As a Base Toast or as part of a Sandwich.<br/><br/><br/>    As a Base Toast*<br/><br/><br/>As a single action, the active player may place a Plain Toast card face up in front of them next to their other Toasts. Plain Toast cards played in this way are treated as if they were Base Toast cards.<br/><br/><br/>    As a Sandwich*<br/><br/><br/>For two actions, the active player may place a Plain Toast card on top of any of their other Toasts. Doing so changes the Toast into a Sandwich. Plain Toasts are the only cards that may be used to create sandwiches.<br/><br/><br/>    Sandwiches &ndash; Important!*<br/><br/><br/>Once a Toast becomes a Sandwich, additional toppings may not be added to it. However, it is also immune to the effects of all Action cards.<br/><br/><br/>    Hand Check*<br/><br/><br/>Once the active player has completed two actions&mdash;or passed&mdash;they check their hand to ensure they have seven or fewer cards. Should their hand hold an excess of seven cards, the active player must place cards from their hand into the discard pile until their hand holds seven cards. <br/>Play then passes to the player on the active player&rsquo;s left.<br/><br/><br/>    Game End*<br/><br/><br/>Once the &ldquo;Time to Eat!&rdquo; card is drawn, play ends immediately. <br/>Each player counts their score using the following point structure:<br/>- Base Toasts (exclude sandwiches) &ndash; 1 point<br/>- Single Toppings &ndash; 2 points<br/>- Sandwiches &ndash; 3 points<br/>- Combos &ndash; 5 points<br/>Note that all toppings that are part of a sandwich score their points normally&mdash;whether they are single toppings or part of a combo, sandwich points are considered a bonus for converting a Toast into a Sandwich using a Plain Toast card.<br/><br/>description from designer<br/><br/>",

The little animals of the forest extract them and take them to their burrows to survive the scarcity of food in difficult seasons, as they have discovered that these gems increase the size of the fruits, others increase their sweetness and others regulate their temperature, which keeps them fresh for longer. But the gems are very besieged by the forest fauna and it is not easy to get the best ones.<br/><br/>In The Enchanted Burrow, players roll the dice and write down the results on a sheet with the intention of optimizing their score. Players have to complete sets of gems, improve burrows, save fruits and rush to win bonuses before opponents in various puzzles with different challenges in each game.

        "description": "Taming the Slugiraffe is a solo roleplaying game where players take on the role of an insignificant background fantasy creature as it journeys into THE PIT to find the fabled SLUGIRAFFE. Can you survive the PIT and gather what you need to TAME THE SLUGIRAFFE?<br/><br/>What's it like?<br/><br/>It's a bit like Dark Souls if you were playing as a Pikachu trying to catch a Snorlax. The monsters are nasty, the world is dark, but you're just hoping to find a big slug-giraffe thing to make the life of your people much easier.<br/><br/>What's the set up?<br/><br/>You play as a GIBLET, a small background fantasy creature &ndash; the kind of thing that gets kicked off a cliff (without being hurt) for comic relief in films and TV. You and your people like a happy life, but there is a story a mystical creature that once would ferry and care for your tribes. You wish to return your people to this bountiful golden age &ndash; but to do this you must find, and tame, a SLUGIRAFFE. The only place they exist is within THE PIT. You, brave GIBLET, must descend to find the creature, and return a hero.<br/><br/>The System<br/><br/>The game uses a random exploration system and simple dice combat and event resolution using 2D6 (originally based on the excellent TUNNEL GOONS system by Nate Treme). Depending on the monsters you defeat or friends you make along the way you'll roll a different sized dice on the D20 loot table. Naturally, the most beneficial items are those in the top range of dice rolls.<br/><br/>Players draw their progress through the pit. Each location has it's own interaction or event which might be useful for gaining the resources to find and tame the SLUGIRAFFE. They will need to work with the pit dwellers to improve their chances of survival by trading items, performing rituals, and eventually finding a way to track the mythical creature.<br/><br/>Exploration<br/><br/>Exploration is a case of creating paths and exploring new biomes and settlements using the provided map. Players roll for exploring biomes, and if they're lucky they'll find a settlement. Once a connection has been made between two locations the path can be travelled freely. If you want to find somewhere new however, you'll have roll for exploration again, and deal with whatever encounters lurk there.<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>Combat is deadly and ruthless &ndash; and your choices about what you carry with you will make all the difference to your survival. Simply beat the number requested on 2D6, plus any useful items, and victory is yours. Failure means losing an item, or an item slot. If you run out of item slots, you've been squished. On the plus side, if you fail your quest, they'll just send another one of you. You are, after all, only a GIBLET.<br/><br/>Taming<br/><br/>One you have gathered your gear and found the location of the SLUGIRAFFE, it's simply a case of chasing it down and taming it. Your weapons are no good here, as the ancient beast is indestructable. The game is a balance between arming yourself for your survival, and being equipped to capture that ancient creature towards the end of the adventure.<br/><br/>The Zine<br/><br/>We'll be printing a 16 page zine with all the rules needed to play the game solo. The zine will be in colour throughout. You'll have to bring your own dice, writing implement and sense of foolish adventure.<br/><br/>The zine will also come with character sheets and token sheets printed within for easy photocopying, Digital versions of these will be available to all backers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

From a deck of 4 cards, players take turns choosing a card with a Tetris-like figure and drawing it in the shared garden. The last player or team to be able to draw a figure wins.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, 6 ability cards that cheat the placement rules are selected. During the game you can choose 3 of these abilities for your team. If you choose too early, the ability may not be used optimally. If you choose too late, your opponent may already have taken it.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players collect water cans that allow them to refresh the card marked. But use them wisely, because they can also give your opponent new opportunities.<br/><br/>All players compete for space on a shared game board, which provides a high degree of player interaction. The 2v2 version encourages discussion around the table about who will sacrifice themselves for the team and block the opponent. Alliances are already formed - now it's time to get personal.<br/><br/>Sounds simple? It is. But if you don't coordinate your attacks with your partner and choose your abilities correctly, you'll quickly become locked in. And then it's up to your partner to be the &quot;last plant standing&quot;.<br/><br/>Nominated for Best Presented Board Game and Best Innovation in Board Games at Fastaval 2023<br/><br/>",

Foul play is never off-limits, but stay away from nosey cryptozoologists that try to disrupt your feast.<br/><br/>Each turn, start by going on a Hunt to gather Ingredients and Recipes by flipping cards from a central draw pile into an open draft. Push your luck by flipping more cards to have more options to choose from, but make sure you don't run into a Cryptozoologist because they will surely ruin your Hunt.<br/><br/>After Hunting for Ingredients, head back to your BBQ Pit where you commit Ingredients to your Recipe cards in order to cook the dishes and score points.<br/><br/>The first Sasquatch to cook an Appetizer, a Main Course, and a Dessert triggers the final round. After the final round, Sasquatches tally up their points to find out who is the BBQ Pitmaster.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As the brave caretaker, you must weed and care for the Poison Garden to prepare it for visitors, but beware; the garden has an infamous reputation.<br/><br/>Poison Garden is for one player and plays for 30 minutes or less. Players will start off with a deadly and poisonous garden represent as tiles that needs serious tending before the gates can be opened to the public. Each turn, the player will tend one plot of the garden, which triggers a chain reaction of sub-actions with adjacent plots. Some of these actions are:<br/>- Weed: removes a plant from the garden for further care<br/>- Transplant: moves a plant to a different area of the garden<br/>- Water: immediately tend an adjacent plot<br/>And more&hellip;<br/><br/>Sometimes your hard work will become undone as the chaos of weeds comes back to your garden. Players will have to be diligent and thoughtful to execute their actions in a timely fashion so as not to fully exhaust their time tokens. If a player can tend to all the plots visible in the garden, they win. If not, then they succumb to the poison garden and the iron gates will remain locked.<br/><br/>There are additional modules included in the game to ramp up the difficulty by introducing new poisonous plants that introduce new sub-actions and challenges.<br/><br/>Poison Garden is a title in the new Talon Strikes small-box series.<br/><br/>-description from developer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wall Streak is a board game where players take on the roles of investors, competing against one another to become the king/queen of Wall Street. Players accomplish this by having earned the most victory points at game's end. Victory can be earned one of three ways, buying company's (worth 5vp's for each owned at game's end), accumulating money (worth 1vp per every 5M at game's end), and completing investor goals (worth 3vp to 15vp). Players must find the right balance between the 3 in order to be crowned king/queen of Wall Street!<br/><br/>On player's turns they roll a single six sided die and move the corresponding number of spaces and then perform the action on the space. Players may pay to move forward one or two additional spaces for costs of 3M or 5M respectively. While navigating the board of Wall Streak players move following the direction/path that they are on until they reach an intersection. Once at an intersection players may change their path or continue following the path they were. The only restrictions being players are not allowed to double back and reverse course, and players must always travel clockwise in the company and money loops.<br/><br/>There are several different types of spaces which players can land on throughout the game. When a player lands on a M, T or gold bar space they draw a card from the respective deck and perform its action, or keep it if it is stock or movement adjusting card (found in the T (Transaction) deck) or an additional investor goal (found in the M (Merger) deck). Spaces with a money amount provide players with that amount of money when they land on them. On dice spaces players will roll either a single or double D6 dice and receive or lose money according to the color dice space that they landed on. Finally  there are 50 company spaces which players can land on. When landed on players may buy the company for it's current price, initiate an auction for the company, or pay rent to it's current owner.<br/><br/>Players must must find the right balance and timing between accumulating money and buying companies. The game end is triggered once a certain number of companies are owned by all players. This number varies based on the number of players in the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

THE RULES OFFER SOME NEW AND EXCITING APPROACHES TO WARGAMING.<br/><br/>Honour is used to drive the narrative of the game. Players are rewarded in honour for the things that they do in the battle. Honour determines who wins Tribal &ndash; it can be won and lost during combat, the deeds of combatants can win or lose honour, players can spend honour to do &lsquo;dirty tricks&rsquo; to win combats.<br/><br/>The game is also played with a normal deck of cards. Cards determine movement, unit activation and &ndash; most importantly &ndash; combat. Players can actually be involved in the combat through playing/holding particular cards.

Rockatansky, soon to be published by the Syncanite GmbH on Kickstarter&quot;<br/><br/>Syncanite Foundation is a deep economic strategy &amp; area control game with variable victory conditions and no player elimination for 2 - 6 conspirators. Force the crisis of your choice to exploit its momentum and win. Want some example? Trigger a war and annihilate your rivals! Or trigger a revolution and get crowned as supreme chancellor - the choice is yours!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntro:Syncanite - materialized power. For the masses, it is the only source of energy. For the elites, the key to immortality. As an independent trade league, the Syncanite Foundation regulates the mining and distribution of the syncan mineral, ensuring political, economic and military stability. But behind the noble guise lurks a secret society of machiavellian oligarchs. At the levers of power, it is easy for them to push the continent into mayhem. How far will YOU go?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHow to Play:Easy to learn: Syncanite Foundation is a complex game that is not complicated to play!<br/>Fight your power struggle in four phases per cycle:<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tI. Conflict phase: Claim regions &amp; resources&quot;Only those who dominate can shape the future.&quot;<br/>~ Soric Flasyra, Guardian of the rhilian Imperium<br/><br/>Every member of the Syncanite Foundation has a private army. Use it to occupy regions of the continent to claim the resources there. But be careful: other players can outbid your military contingent. As long as this cold war prevails, the troops cannot fight, only displace each other. In addition to sheer mass, the clever use of operations and doctrine are decisive for this phase.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tII. Offering phase: Use profits for corruption&quot;With the right contacts, momentum becomes a method.&quot;<br/>~ Wator Abrius, Chairman of the Tycan Conglomerate<br/><br/>The market prices for your resources are in your favor? Sell or buy stock for capital and use your profits in a bidding contest against the other players to win over the continent&rsquo;s dignitaries to your side. Their powerful effects will drastically change the course of the game. In the later game, this phase holds many more offers and opportunities for the players.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIII. Parliament phase: Manipulate and murder&quot;When good words are not enough, clearer messages are needed.&quot;<br/>~ Maverid Czylark, Speaker of the Avadian Conclave<br/><br/>Influence the course of the continent by intervening in parliamentary votes. How many votes you have is entirely up to you and your abilities: Prevent laws that stand in your way and pass those that benefit you. Damage your competitors with a variety of means &ndash; from denunciation to insidious assassination.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIV. Foundation Phase: Pull the levers of power&quot;When the Nations collide, we profit.&quot;<br/>~ Unknown, Founder of the Syncanite Foundation<br/><br/>Use the unique power of your Role to push the continent into a direction you want: Invest in Infrastructure, censor the media, manage democracy, steer the Markets or control the military of a faction of your choice. Eventually, prepare for the next cycle: A new conflict phase awaits &ndash; and maybe even a crisis.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tHow to win - the unique Crisis MechanicsThis world is a powder keg. Every operation, every law, and every market driven to extremes can trigger crises. A single spark can ignite the Continent! Immediate events create unstoppable chaos and add crisis-specific mechanics to the game phases, opening the way to multiple victory options! There are five crises in total with unique paths to victory:<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRevolution - The Diplomatic VictoryUse your parliamentary privileges to your advantage. Drive the integrity of parliament into crisis and provoke draconian measures. With the &ldquo;Revolution&rdquo; crisis, you can eliminate your political opponents and be elected ruler of the continent. Once appointed, you&rsquo;ll never give up your power again, will you?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMonopoly - The Economic VictoryLiberalize the parliament, privatize the institutions and make gigantic profits. Whether by legal and ethical means or not is entirely up to you. With the &ldquo;monopoly&rdquo; crisis, you are laying the foundations for a plutocratic system of oligarchs bidding in obscene wealth for the last remnants of the once all-powerful state. How much are you able to pay?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tWar - The Military VictoryUse force against your opponents. Ignore the conventions of war and place yourself above the laws of parliament and nobility. With the crisis of war, you can enforce the law of the strongest and destroy your enemies. Millions will lose their lives, yet lay the foundation of a new era. Will you triumph?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTriage - The Hero VictoryReduce access to resources and drive up their prices immeasurably. Provoke hunger and misery. Push the population to the limit of their ability to suffer. With the &ldquo;Triage&rdquo; crisis, you and your fellow players will incur considerable costs to save the people. Who of you will become the people&acute;s saviour and direct the anger of the masses against those in power?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTyranny - The Story VictoryGive in to your greed for the Syncanite and make a pact with the Order: Help its leader to the Emperor&rsquo;s throne and serve under him to your own advantage! With the &ldquo;Tyranny&rdquo; crisis, you face a final boss scenario that revolvse around one great question: Do you accept the Emperor and win by his side, or do you all together coup at the right moment to reestablish the Foundation?<br/><br/>Which fire will you ignite?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tLearn More:Syncanite Foundation - Soon on Kickstarter!

        "description": "Taproot is a light abstract puzzle strategy game designed for two players that takes 2 minutes to learn and 10 minutes to play.<br/><br/>To set up the game, one player arranges the rock tokens and starting plant in the play area while the other player places the water tokens in the game box, gives it a shake to randomize the tokens, and then spills them out onto the play area.<br/><br/>Starting with the player who most recently watered a plant, players take turns connecting root pieces to the starting plant, aiming to collect as many water tokens of their specific color as possible. Players must strategically avoid rocks, while also being mindful not to inadvertently help the other player with their root placements. The game comes to an end when either player has collected all of their water tokens or no more roots can be placed.<br/><br/>Whether you seek a leisurely, relaxing experience to savor with a cup of tea and casual conversation, or desire an intense, strategic face-off where every root placement counts, Taproot delivers a unique and enjoyable gaming experience each time you sit down to play!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It comes with two full art versions of the core set Gembearers Hammer and Pistol.<br/><br/>A century ago, Discwielders patrolled the skies, securing the outer provinces of the empire. When the second emperor passed, many gave up their Rocket Shields to not get caught in the aftermath. Some of these discs, however, survived the decades, hidden away, waiting for a suited Gemwielder to be taken to the skies once again.<br/><br/>Not only does the Rocket Shield&rsquo;s passive ability allow you to play power costed gem cards more reliably early, it also provides you with a steady stream of power throughout the entire game. The price for this headstart is a power hungry starting deck. Efficient power generation and power expenditure therefore become key features of the discwielding playstyle.<br/><br/>",

A player may win in three different ways, which vary depending on the faction they play as. While most have similar core abilities, their varying powers and goals make for differing and exciting playstyles.<br/><br/>During the game players may collect cards, inspired by mythology and folklore, that appear across the map. These might provide new ways for the players to spend their actions, or they might provide new abilities or boons.<br/><br/>The game can be played in multiple ways depending on the amount of players, and the cards and events make for a new experience every time you play. The simple core functions make the game easy to learn, but hard to master.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board of triangles. The recommended size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on a 11&ndash;sized board for longer games or a 7&ndash;sized board for shorter games. There is also a location outside the board called prison. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A lifeline is a path of uninterrupted empty points located in a straight line from a stone to the edge of the board, and it is said to be cut when enemy stones are placed on it. However, when a stone is placed on the lifeline of a friendly stone, the length of its lifeline is reduced to that stone, that is, a new shorter lifeline is created.<br/>&ndash; A group is a set of connected stones of the same color. A stone is also a group.<br/>&ndash; A living group is a group that contains at least one uncut lifeline, otherwise it is dead and is moved to prison.<br/>&ndash; A territory is one or more empty points connected to each other. You own a territory if all the stones connected to it are your color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first and then turns alternate. On your turn, do exactly one of these actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Place a stone of your color on an empty point, then move all dead enemy groups to prison. After this action, the stone you placed must be part of a group with at least one uncut lifeline, and the position of the board must be different from the positions of the board at the end of all your previous turns.<br/>&ndash; Remove an enemy stone from the prison.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:&ndash; The player who made the last action wins the game, so passing the turn is not allowed.<br/>&ndash; A player has the option to &quot;propose end&quot; of the game and the other player must accept it or not. In case of acceptance, the points will be counted by adding the friendly territory and enemy prisoners, in addition to granting half an extra point to the player who made the last move.<br/><br/>For the game to be fair, before it begins, the first player places several black stones in prison and then the second player chooses the sides. This balancing method is called komi foot. For handicap games, the weaker player takes black and opens by placing on the board a number of black stones proportional to the skill difference between the players.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:The prison mechanism was introduced by David Wolfe and Elwyn Berlekamp in their book Mathematical Go: Chilling Gets the Last Point.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

This endeavor was increasingly important to the US war effort following the surrender of an entire American army at Detroit during the summer of 1812. However, a crossing of the Niagara River near Lake Ontario was guarded by Fort George, while those near Buffalo near Lake Erie were dominated by the Queenston Heights. The Americans gambled that a quick early morning assault on Queenston Heights could gain them a bridgehead that could very well lead to the capture of Ontario.

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board. The recommended board size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on an 11-sized board for longer matches or a 7-sized board for shorter matches. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of their own colored stones.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A flank is a configuration in which two friendly stones in a straight line (along one of the six cardinal directions) are at any distance from an enemy stone and without other friendly stones in between.<br/>&ndash; A chain is a set of stones of the same color connected in a straight line. A single stone is also a chain.<br/>&ndash; A live chain is a chain that is not flanked by enemy stones, otherwise it is dead and is removed from the board.<br/>&ndash; A territory is a set of empty points that see more friendly stones than enemy stones in line. An empty point that sees them is also a territory. You are the owner of a territory if the stones that see them are your color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first and then they alternate. On your turn, you can either pass your turn or perform these actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1.

Remove all dead stones.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the Game:The game ends when the board is full or both players consecutively pass their turn. At the end of the game, points will be counted by adding up the friendly territory and friendly stones on the board.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, before the game starts, the first player places a black stone on an empty point and the second player chooses a side.

        "description": "Night Witches is a solitaire or two-player cooperative player game in which the Night Witches&ndash;female pilots of the Soviet 588th Night Bomber Regiment&ndash;work together to fly harassment missions on the Eastern Front during WWII. Their planes are rickety and minimally equipped, but with their engines whirring quietly and with the dark of night to cloak them, the Night Witches are flying towards promotion to 46th Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment&ndash;and towards making aviation history!<br/><br/>Night Witches is a light wargame that consists of a ten-mission campaign, during which the pilots try to amass enough victory points to be promoted to form a Guards unit, a great honor in the Soviet military. Each mission lasts roughly 30 minutes, and each can be played on its own, separately from the campaign. On each mission, two planes will venture into unknown territory to complete a specific goal and to earn victory points. As they fly, players will observe the terrain around them by drawing tokens from a bag. Some tokens will merely represent the night, but the players will also need to avoid spotlights, navigate through clouds, respond to attacks from AAA, and more.<br/><br/>Each mission is made up of multiple sorties, with brief recovery times between. During sorties, players will evade enemy fire&ndash;and bomb targets&ndash;by pulling from a bag containing success, failure, and stress tokens. During recovery, they will have to manage their time, fuel supply, and stress levels. As pilots gain experience and complete missions, they will also be able to acquire upgrade cards. (Those victory points are good for something!) Will the Night Witches be able to dodge AAA, do maximum damage to the Nazis, and fly off into the sunrise?<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nadraz (from Proto-Germanic: Nadraz, meaning &quot;snake&quot;) is an abstract board game for two players who play on an initially empty hexagonal board.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>The objective of the game is to build the longest snake possible, that is, one that contains the largest number of stones.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&ndash; A hexagonal board with 9 intersections per side.<br/>&ndash; One set of black stones and one set of white stones.<br/><br/>Definitions:<br/>&ndash; A snake is a non-forked chain of two or more stones connected to each other.<br/>&ndash; A head or tail is a stone adjacent to only one friendly stone and is located at the ends of a snake, it is not allowed to leave it adjacent to two friendly stones unless it is no longer located at the ends (in which case it would cease to be the head or the tail).<br/><br/>Turns:<br/>Black plays first, then alternate. On your turn, do one of the following placements:<br/><br/>&ndash; Advance by placing any number of stones of your color on empty intersections located in a straight line, from the front of the head or tail of one of your snakes.<br/>&ndash; Turn by placing any number of stones of your color on empty intersections located in a straight line, from the side of the head or tail of one of your snakes.<br/>&ndash; Bend by placing any number of stones of your color on empty intersections located in a straight line, from the back of the head or tail of one of your snakes.<br/><br/>Each stone you place must be adjacent to one or two friendly stones, one of those stones must be the head or tail of one of your snakes to make it grow. However, you can place a stone that touches any number of friendly stones only if one of them is the head or tail of another snake(s), in order to join them to form a larger one.<br/><br/>Cutting snakes:<br/>When we grow a snake, we can cut enemy snakes by passing through them. When cutting an enemy snake, we go to one of its stones in a straight line to replace it with one of our color, to do so there must be an empty intersection on the other side of the replaced stone in which we will place a stone to carry out the cut otherwise it cannot be done. Also, it is not allowed to cut off the head or tail of a snake.<br/><br/>Isolated stones:<br/>It's possible that after a player cuts through his opponent's snakes there are isolated stones left, i.e. no adjacent friendly stones. As an isolated stone isn't considered a snake, it's forbidden to join isolated stones, as they must remain isolated throughout the game.<br/><br/>End of the game:<br/>When a player cannot make placements, they must pass their turn. In case no one can do it, the game ends and the player with the snake that contains the most stones wins, in case of a tie the player with the next snake wins and so on.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, before the game begins, the first player places two starting snakes of two stones, one black and one white, on empty intersections on the board and the second player chooses the sides. This balancing method is called the four-stone pie rule.<br/><br/>",

Each player can have multiple cards. There were three declarations of artifacts on the field at the same time, and Leviathan won. Leviathan was not allowed to reveal or hint to others what the card he gave to others was.<br/>Angel 1-2: The task of an angel is to preach. Each round marks a player in the spiritual field. When the mark reaches 3 (Leviathan needs seven marks), this character is regarded as a believer. The believer on the spot plus the angel Wins when the number is greater than half the number.<br/>Humans 2-5: Conditions for victory. After seven days, neither Leviathan nor Angel wins.<br/>Cooperation and deceit will of course be required to win, but remember that you are all God's children so in some cases your alignment will change.<br/>At the beginning of the game, each player draws an identity card (Leviathan, human, angel), Leviathan shows his identity, and then draws a card from the pile to represent the beginning of a new day, everyone takes turns to speak, and finally Leviathan decides Who is this card for (the three rounds of getting the card can be activated), and then enter the night, people other than the angels close their eyes, the angels start to preach, and they can put a mark on the spirit collar. At dawn after 10 seconds, Leviathan draws the next card and repeats this cycle seven times.<br/>There are three artifacts in the deck that can be used all the time, three events that happen once and a blank Bible book, a total of seven cards and seven rounds, representing what happened within seven days.<br/>Artifact &quot;Lantern&quot;<br/>You can check the identity of others.

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction:Crumo (from Proto-Germanic: Krūm&ocirc;, meaning &quot;fragment&quot;) is a drawless game for two players: Black and White. It is played at the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board with triangles. It can be played on a 7&ndash;sized board for long games or a 5&ndash;sized board for short games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stackable pieces of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A stack is a set of pieces located at the same point, one on top of the other. A single piece is also a stack.<br/>&ndash; The height of a stack is the number of pieces it contains.<br/>&ndash; A guarded point is a point located at a distance equal to the height of a stack, and that stack is said to be guarding it. The stacks also guard the points they occupy.<br/> &ndash; A controlled point is a point occupied by a friendly stack or an empty point that can only be occupied by friendly stacks.<br/>&ndash; A stack receives an amount of attack equal to the amount of enemy stacks that control the point it occupies, and receives an amount of defense equal to the amount of friendly stacks that control the point it occupies. One or more stacks are dead if they receive more attack than defense and are removed from the board.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first and then turns alternate. On your turn, perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&ndash; Place a stack on an empty point that is at a distance equal to the height of the stack, either in an orthogonal or diagonal direction, towards an empty point or towards a friendly stack, unless it is also towards an enemy stack. At the end of your turn, the newly placed stack cannot be left dead.<br/>&ndash; Move a complete stack or a portion of it orthogonally or diagonally a distance equal to the number of pieces taken from that stack. You cannot move a complete stack if your opponent also did so in a turn immediately prior, unless you are capturing. Then remove all dead stacks. At the end of your turn, unlike the newly placed stack, the newly moved stack can be left dead.<br/>&ndash; Pass your turn.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:If a player cannot take any action, he must pass his turn. If both players pass consecutively, the game ends and points are counted by adding the points controlled by friendly stacks and the number of enemy pieces captured, in addition to awarding an extra half point to the player who passed first.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score in the final position wins.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, before starting, the first player places an initial black stack and the second player chooses the sides. This balancing method is called the pie rule.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You come to Earth in avatars to save humanity and life on Earth. You work together to choose the best strategies to evacuate people, remove attacks and successfully mediate between sides. Will you save the World before Earth is destroyed, human beings are lost forever, or the time for mediation runs out? Up to you to play out!<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>REMOVING ATTACKS <br/>During each game turn, there are attack tiles that land on different places on Earth. <br/>Part of your mission is to undo the destruction that results from the attacks of war. You are endowed with a power that allows you to move in time in the near past, and to modify the present. In the game this is called &quot;removing an attack&quot;.<br/><br/>EVACUATION OF HUMANITY<br/>Part of your mission is to save as many people as possible.<br/>When an attack card lands on a square with humans, they escape or they are lost.<br/>To save people the Ultimediation team is teleporting them to the base in Africa and to the space ship.<br/><br/>MEDIATIONS<br/>To succeed in the mission, peace must be restored through mediation.

The players are given a hand of different ingredient cards, and two people at a time compete to create a certain type of meal, based on a meal card played for that round.<br/><br/>After choosing three cards from their hand (and accounting for any special rules on the meal card), the competing players reveal their meals, and the discussion begins.<br/><br/>Anyone playing the game can argue for or against either meal, and this discussion session can last as long as people need before all non-competing players have decided who they think is best. All at once, the players vote, and whoever wins gets two points, and whoever loses gets none (in the event of a tie, they each get one).<br/><br/>The game continues as people refill their hands with cards from the deck and the winner of each match competes with the next person clockwise around the circle. Once all the ingredient cards have been used up, the game is over, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You'll be able to attract these visitors by building new and exciting amenities, but watch out, your rivals will be doing the same thing! As the casino boss, you'll be able to expand the four essential casino areas: Gambling, Drinking, Entertainment and Dining.<br/><br/>On your turn, you'll choose how to use your buying action. You can improve your casino, pave a parking lot, or select an available special. You'll only be able to select one per turn so you'll want to plan wisely. Then after all have gone, the visitor deck is dealt out and the casino with the most matching symbols brings in that visitor. Income and rewards are collected after the deck is dealt, and then you set up the marketplace for the next round. Sound simple right?<br/><br/>The game starts with the first era in Old Vegas when times were simple and casinos can get by with basic slots and a simple bar. You'll play each era 3 times before moving on to the next one. As the new era is revealed, new options will open for you and your rivals to build. New visitors are also added to the game as it continues. They'll be looking for more sophisticated casinos. You'll need to make sure to build the newest options available to continue to keep your doors open. The game also adds in specials to keep you on your toes and each game different than the last.<br/><br/>After the last turn is played on the final era all the money is counted up and the casino who raked in the most is proclaimed the winner!<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to be King of the Casinos?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In the meantime, some wrong codes may cause bugs or even glitches and cause serious problems in the coding process.<br/>Finally, the game ends by completing the process of making 3 games (1 less than the number of players) and the player who has the most number of correct codes and characters added to the game monitor will win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each region must invest in sustainable power, divest from unsustainable power and heal the land and ocean with climate solutions called &ldquo;Cooldowns&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Each round of the game, players begin by drawing their resource cards for their regions. Then, they draw a Disaster card for each region. Next, players go in a circle taking their turn for their region or regions. Players must strategize how to use their region&rsquo;s energy, water and food resource cards. Players are able to freely trade with one another&rsquo;s regions during their turns. They can use their resources to invest in Power cards, Cooldown cards, Diplomacy tiles, or divest from Unsustainable Power cards. At the end of each round the Impact meter either increases or decreases the Global meter. There are also land restoration and ocean health requirements that must be met by the end of each round.<br/><br/>To win the game, each of the 4 regions must invest in at least 2 Sustainable Power cards and then divest from an Unsustainable Power card type. Collectively, players must invest in Cooldown cards which can give them Land and Ocean tokens which help to fill all of the slots on the world map. Finally, the Global meter must be brought down into the blue. The Global meter can be lowered once the Impact meter is brought down below zero. If the Global meter reaches 30, it's game over.

        "description": "Ahoy traveler! Welcome aboard the Shadow of Endurance, a replica ship based off Ernest Shackleton's pioneering vessel. We're setting sail for the Antarctic waters - hope you brought a camera and attentive gaze. This adventure will be full of animals that breach the ocean surface.<br/><br/>As seafaring guides, we like to up the stakes from time to time. Every trip includes a contest that challenges passengers to spot animals along the way and log them in a ship journal. Creatures earn different points based on rarity, from common species like Krill and Crabs to uncommon species like the mighty Blue Whale. The passenger who logs the highest scoring animals will have contributed the most sightseeing value to the trip, and thus earns the title of Breach Master.<br/><br/>Obtaining this title will not be easy! Animals don't surface predictably and your shipmates are looking for sneaky ways to claim your discoveries for themselves. It's all light-hearted fun until we enter the depths of the deck, where sea monsters dwell and environmental degradation is seen.<br/><br/>Think you have what it takes to win the battle of the breach? It's time to play Splash Down!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",
