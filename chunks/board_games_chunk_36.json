The expansion introduces the French army into the third war to end all wars. Highlighting the fighting in not only West Germany, but also right into Paris, Honneur et Patrie features French conscripts, the Foreign Legion, Paratroopers, and lots of tanks. You&rsquo;ll match AMX30 B-2 tanks against the best Russian armor, direct Jaguar airstrikes, and recon enemy positions with ERC-90 and AMX 10RC armored cars (tanks?).<br/><br/>The expansion includes 12, story-driven scenarios and plays out on the boards of the popular Heroes of the Blitzkrieg. With a plethora of new counters, new scenarios, and a unique perspective on some of the most beautiful boards ever drawn for the Lock &lsquo;n Load system, what&rsquo;s not to like?&quot;<br/><br/>The expansion includes:<br/><br/>Approximately 130 counters representing the infantry, leaders, support weapons, vehicles, helicopters, and planes of the French fighting forces. Includes over 50 vehicles, helicopters, and planes. Nine extra die-cut Belgian counters (including a German, experimental E-100 tank and two scenarios will be included in any Purchaser level order below). These will only be available through our site.<br/><br/>12 story-driven scenarios.<br/><br/>Full color rules and scenario booklet.<br/><br/>All zipped up nice and neat in a durable zip-lock bag (Exception: limited edition is boxed, numbered and initialed. See below.).<br/><br/>You must own both Heroes of the Gap and Heroes of the Blitzkrieg to play Honneur et Patrie.<br/><br/>This game is no longer available and the new, improved and expanded edition can be found in Lock 'n Load Tactical: Heroes Against the Red Star<br/><br/>",

Save our people, gather the shards and re-forge the Crystal of Power.<br/><br/>Now 5 or 6 players can embark on a Quest for the DragonLords.  Two new races fight for control of the shards.

        "description": "Are armored fighting vehicles a Godsend - or the work of Satan himself?<br/><br/>In the years following the First World War, men looked back upon the grim carnage with a mixture of horror and hope. Horror, of machine warfare where valor and courage meant nothing in the face of industrial warfare. Hope, that these very same machines if perfected and produced in large numbers, might make warfare quicker, more decisive, with less overall bloodshed, or perhaps deter it altogether.<br/><br/>Few realized they faced a devil's choice, and were damned if they did, and damned if they didn't. But most nations had enough sense to banish conflict to the fringe of their empires, whose inhabitants would not be missed if there were suddenly less of them.<br/><br/>Infernal Machines is the first expansion kit for Clash of Arms' Landships game. You must own Landships to play Infernal machines. Designed by Perry Moore, Infernal Machines retells the story of man versus machines in 20 new scenarios. These range from the technological fantasies of the Great War through the gritty Russian Civil War, to the deserts of Morocco and the high altitude Chaco.<br/><br/>With two new double-sided map panels and 280 counters, Infernal machines is fully compatible with Landships and provides new vehicle and terrain rules to improve the basic game. The infantryman's war is not neglected either. The first mortars, SMGs, body armor, and light machine guns all make their deadly appearance. For artillery (the real killer in action), Infernal Machines explores the ticklish intricacies of single creeping and double creeping barrage lines, interdiction fire, counter battery and suppression fire.<br/><br/>(from COA website)<br/><br/>",

Every unit in the game gets a 1 to N action points that allow it to fire a weapon, do forward observation, move at top speed or even do electronic warfare. Movement does not require action points.<br/><br/>The game also provides the players with a pool of Command Points that can be transferred from the commander unit  automatically if within Auto Comms radius or by using a communications event. Communications events can be stopped by using Electronic Warfare's Electronic Counter Measures with a unit that has ECM equipment. Electronic Warfare, Attacks and Defense are based on opposed skill roll. The skill ratings translate to the number of dice rolled with the highest number being the result (two sixes translate to seven, three sixes to 8, etc.).<br/><br/>The game is well supported by DP9 and its fans. There are design tools available in the the DP9 website. The miniatures available for the game are of the highest quality and they have actually been nominated for awards. The game provides and abstracted system for aircraft and artillery support.   It could have been called Heavy Gear Blitz 2.0, but it is sufficiently different from the original Heavy Gear Blitz to merit the Locked and Loaded subtitle instead of a 2.0.<br/><br/>Major differences from the original are:<br/><br/>1) Only one weapon per unit per turn even if it has more than one action.<br/><br/>2) Top speed movement now requires an action point.<br/><br/>3) STUN counters to signify results of a stunned pilot.<br/><br/>4)  Drones have been simplified and now become extra characteristics of the controlling unit<br/><br/>5) Army building is now based on the allowed units for a particular Priority Level.<br/><br/>6) Priority Levels also define Support Points that can be used to buy Aircraft, Artillery, Defensive Structures or even more Command Points.<br/>The rulebook is very well organized and the support in the forums in the DP9 websites help the neophyte players immensely.<br/><br/>",

There are 41 (forty-one!) scenarios, each based on an actual battle or situation, plus historical background on the German mountain divisions and their exploits.<br/><br/>Edelweiss includes 161 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces: 157 of them the standard 2/3-inch square pieces of the Panzer Grenadier series, and four of them double-sized monsters.

He also spent three months of his service in diving bells in the Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The records show that he married on September 14th 1867 in St Senan's Church in Kilrush. It is not recorded if the couple had any children.<br/><br/>Brady was later discharged (referred to as a 'bad chicken dinner') from HMS Liverpool for reasons unstated, but guessed to be insobriety on duty.<br/><br/>After his wife died of 'The Shakes', Brady sobered up and travelled to America, visiting his sister and her mining engineer husband - both were employed by the Cottonwood Mining Company.<br/><br/>Brady worked at Rattlesnake Creek for a time, utilising his knowledge of rifles and explosives to make a few bucks - even completing a contract for Fort Murphy up at Lincoln County.<br/><br/>Colonel Ned McReady deputised Brady when the McSween brothers and gang kidnapped Jackie Peppin. During the gunfight at Peppin farm, on Sept 1st, 1891, Brady shot both brothers in the face at one hundred yards, and also 'Turkey' Joe in the buttocks. Ned is reported to have called Brady Logan 'The best shot with a rifle the Lord has ever seen.&quot;<br/><br/>Noted to have an eagle tattoo on his left forearm, from his service days, Brady also sports a small scar on his upper lip - he insists it was cut by an Apache knife, others whisper that it was from years of playing the Mouth Harp. Badly.<br/><br/>Married his second wife, Josie Hopkins, at St Ezekiel's Episcopal Church.<br/><br/>Was also once struck by lightning during the summer of 1890.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Horse and Musket: Sport of Kings is the first expansion to Horse &amp; Musket: Dawn of an Era. This volume will cover warfare from 1721-1748, when linear musket combat approached its apogee. Large armies of well drilled infantry used volley fire and bayonet charges in set piece battles. Horsemen were used almost exclusively for charges, and artillery was increasingly mobile. Great commanders such as Nader Shah and Maurice de Saxe left their stamp on military history. The period also saw the emergence of Frederick II of Prussia, known to most as Frederick the Great.<br/><br/>The battles include...<br/><br/>Gulnabad - March 8, 1722  &ndash; Zenith of the the Hotak Dynasty<br/><br/>Mehmandost - September 29, 1729 &ndash; Safavid Restoration<br/><br/>Samarra - July 19, 1733 &ndash; The Fate of Baghdad<br/><br/>San Pietro - June 29, 1734 &ndash; The Blurred Line Between Bold and Reckless<br/><br/>Guastalla - September 19, 1734 &ndash; The Day the World Lost<br/><br/>Ogoula Tchetoka - March 25, 1736 &ndash; Father Senat&rsquo;s Hymn<br/><br/>Ackia - May 26, 1736 &ndash; Bienville&rsquo;s Blunder<br/><br/>Karnal - February 24, 1739 &ndash; Death Knell of the Mughal Empire<br/><br/>Grocka - July 22, 1739 &ndash; The Treaty of Belgrade<br/><br/>Stavuchany - August 17, 1739 &ndash; Stănileşti Avenged<br/><br/>Fort San Lazaro - April 20, 1741 &ndash; &ldquo;To Admiral Vernon, the scourge of Spain&rdquo;<br/><br/>Mollwitz - April 14, 1741 &ndash; &ldquo;We'll retreat over the bodies of our enemies.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Chotusitz - May 17, 1742 &ndash; Frederick II's First Victory<br/><br/>Fontenoy - May 11, 1745 &ndash; &ldquo;Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Hohenfriedberg - June 4, 1745 &ndash; Der Hohenfriedberger Marsch<br/><br/>Prestonpans - September 21, 1745 &ndash; Accidental Cannae<br/><br/>Soor - September 30, 1745 &ndash; &ldquo;God is against us.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Kesselsdorf - December 15, 1745 &ndash; &ldquo;O Lord God, let me not be disgraced in my old days.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Culloden - April 16, 1746 &ndash; Tragedy on the Moors<br/><br/>Lauffeld - July 2, 1747 &ndash; Ligonier&rsquo;s Charge<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Black SS is a book supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series, with 30 new scenarios by Mike Perryman depicting the actions of Waffen SS divisions in the last years of the Second World War. There are also 165 new die-cut and mounted playing pieces depicting all of the SS playing pieces found in Elsenborn Ridge, Road to Berlin and Beyond Normandy games with a black background requested by many fans, rather than the camouflage pattern used in those games.<br/><br/>A note regarding the use of black to depict SS units; from the AP website:<br/><br/>&quot;...many gamers have asked for them in that pattern, and my views have altered. For one thing, these are just little squares of colored, laminated cardboard. The black scheme has little to do with Nazi Germany; it's a game publishing idea. German situation maps made during the war do often use black ink for SS units (with blue for regular Army, red for enemies, green for allies). Otherwise, it's a tradition out of the dawn of wargaming. When we asked for feedback on new counter sets, the black SS units were far and away the leading choice.<br/><br/>And so we have the Black SS set, 176 die-cut and mounted pieces in a new color scheme. It reproduces every SS unit and leader from three games: Elsenborn Ridge, Beyond Normandy and Road to Berlin. If you don't like the black scheme, you don't need them. If you like it and want to see the SS get crushed in the most visible form possible, it just plugs right in. It's an extra, and a fairly inexpensive one at $9.99.&quot;<br/><br/>Read the full article here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.avalanchepress.com/Black_SS_Pieces.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.avalanchepress.com/Black_SS_Pieces.php</a><br/><br/>",

They will offer valuable resources for your corporation and will help you reach more distant Asteroids as they orbit around the sun. Of course there is always a chance they will explode if they plunge into the fiery embrace of the sun. Will you take the risk to send one of your probes to them?<br/><br/>In this expansion, Comet tokens are placed on the Asteroid belt and they travel, from round to round, from belt to belt, towards the sun. Send there a probe using the same rules as for Asteroids and get advantage of their resources and victory points. Afterwards you may move your probe at no cost to an available neighbor asteroid or risk to stay on it. There is a chance that instead of providing more resources and victory points they get exploded by checking the explosion cards and earn less than expected.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The overall goal of the expansion is to inject a heavy dose of historical theme into the Dark Horse game as well as offer additional game play options.<br/><br/>The expansion introduces the concept of players having a specific Reputation. This is done through various game mechanics and cards by offering two distinct options based on Reputation tokens, i.e., White Hat or Black Hat. The Wild West was characterized by famous heroes, villains, lawmen and outlaws. Players will now be able to choose a side and hire either classic White Hat or Black Hat type characters. The good guys, called Rebels, have abilities that assist players in accomplishing goals. The bad guys, called Rogues, can harass opponents and even rob from them. Players can opt to exclude Rogues or add in a variant that allows characters to initiate gunfights and capture Rogues.<br/><br/>Reputation adds in a thematic decision that can affect player&rsquo;s options in many of the expansion variants. For example, additional Action Cards will be introduced that will have two options on them. Players will only be able to select the option that corresponds to their Reputation. So, if a player chooses to side with Outlaws then they would only have access to &ldquo;Black Hat&rdquo; abilities.<br/><br/>The expansion will also offer players additional Action Cards, Player Characters, and Special Roles.<br/><br/>",

New alliances have been formed, old rivalries have been ignited, and the Great Clans of Rokugan are prepared for all-out war.<br/><br/>Declare your allegiance with Clan War, a premium expansion for Legend of the Five Rings: The Card Game that contains a total of 234 cards and introduces two new multiplayer formats to the game. The Enlightenment format sees three players racing to claim all five elemental rings, while Team Conquest allows players to join up into two teams to break each others' strongholds. When the clans clash in open war, none can be victorious alone! Not only does the expansion include the rules for how to play these formats, but most cards in the set synergize with multiplayer play, and a treaty pad and cards included in the expansion allow you to form and break alliances.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Lancelot has left and King Arthur has fallen ill. Traitor knights, led by Morgana and her unholy child Mordred have rebelled. Only the Grail can heal Arthur and end the evil, but it is a race against time. The traitors are hunting paladins to stop the quest. If the Grail is not found in time, all will be lost to darkness&hellip;<br/><br/>This adventure requires no mapping.

The forces in the Dust Tactics: Light Panzer Walker expansion can be customized to either Heinrich or Hermann, both offering advantages for any Axis general to bring onto the battlefield.<br/><br/>With one of the most deadly weapon systems seen since the beginning of the war, the Panzer AufkclarerLaufer 1-A, aka &quot;Heinrich&quot; can crush an entire squad, whether or not it&rsquo;s equipped with heavy armor. Heinrich&rsquo;s incredible firepower derives from its four powerful FlaKvierling cannons. The Panzer AufkclarerLaufer 1-A is also versatile enough to use against lightly armored targets or engage enemies from a great distance, due to it being a light and agile vehicle.<br/><br/>The Axis&rsquo; newest light footed anti-tank robot, Hermann, elicits the same uneasiness in your opponent as Heinrich. With a revolutionary laser cannon Hermann can easily destroy targets much heavier than itself. Entering into a long engagement? Partner Hermann with your other Axis units, like a Recon Grenadiers squad, to both protect it and utilize it for a lengthy battle. If you&rsquo;re looking to annihilate your opponent early in the game, find Hermann a secure position and use its sustained fire to waste any Allied armored unit.<br/><br/>",

You must use one of these editions in order to play this expansion.<br/><br/>A WILD GOOSE CHASE<br/>It&rsquo;s frustrating to watch an opponent fulfill Quest after Quest unhindered. It makes you wish you could send him off on a Wild Goose Chase instead... Now you can!<br/><br/>Components<br/>&bull; 4 Goose Tokens<br/>&bull; 1 Goose standee and base<br/><br/>Setup<br/>&bull; Each player begins the game with 1 Goose token.<br/>&bull; The Goose standee goes to the side of the board.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>&bull; The Goose token is a Treasure Token which can be used as a Free Action on your turn to temporarily thwart an opponent.<br/>&bull; To play a Goose token, the Goose standee must be sitting to the side of the board; it may not currently be in play on a Region tile.<br/>&bull; To use a Goose token, give your token to any opponent you wish to hinder (place it directly on top of his Adventurer Placard). Then put the Goose standee on any Region on the board.<br/>&bull; The recipient of the Goose token has been sent on a Wild Goose Chase. He may not perform any more &ldquo;Complete a Quest&rdquo; actions until he first catches the Goose.<br/>&bull; To catch the Goose, this player must end her turn in the Region with the Goose standee. When this happens, the Goose tile played on her Adventurer Placard is removed from play for the rest of the game. The Goose standee flies away to the side of the board. The player&rsquo;s turn is now over; she may not perform any further actions (including Free Actions) until her next turn.<br/><br/>ESPRESSO DRAGONS<br/>Tea is relaxing. Espresso is energizing! Fantastiqa&rsquo;s Dragons now serve both!<br/><br/>Components<br/>&bull; 6 Espresso Dragon cards (Events)<br/>&bull; 12 Espresso Tokens (Treasure Tokens)<br/><br/>Setup<br/>&bull; Shuffle the Espresso Dragon Event cards into the Creature Card deck as indicated by<br/>the symbol on the lower-right corner of each card.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>&bull; Whenever you draw an Espresso Dragon as an Event, immediately add three Espresso Tokens to the Region your Adventurer currently occupies. If no Espresso tokens remain in the supply, draw none.<br/>&bull; After performing the Event, as always, set it aside and draw a new card from the Creature Card deck.<br/>&bull; If a player ends her turn in a Region with one or more Espresso Tokens, she may collect ONE Espresso Token and add it to her supply. She may use it in any future turn (but not this one; her turn is already over).<br/>&bull; An Espresso Token is a Treasure Token that allows you to perform one additional Turn Action. (Just like the Double Espresso Artifact.) Return used Espresso Tokens to the supply.<br/>&bull; Note: the Espresso Token awards an extra Turn Action, not an actual extra turn. In other words, the turn does not end by using it: do not discard and redraw until your turn is over.<br/><br/>EXCLUSIVE ARTIFACTS<br/>Add these exciting new cards to the Artifact Tower. (Cards with a cost of 2 Gems are also included as new Starting Artifact cards.)<br/>Exclusive Artifact cards (14 total):<br/><br/>&bull; Coddington&rsquo;s Fog Machine (Cost: 4 Gems): Move each Adventurer (including your own) one Region in any direction you choose. With special thanks to Clinton Coddington!<br/>&bull; Hamster of Histrionic Haggling (Cost: 2 Gems): This turn, each card you purchase at a Statue is discounted by 1 Gem.<br/>&bull; Locket of Landfall (Cost: 2 Gems): Exchange any two Region tiles (along with anything on them).<br/>&bull; Tailfeathers of the Hairy Crane (Cost: 2 Gems): Choose any single-symbol card from your Discard Pile and return it to your hand. The chosen symbol must come from the Circle of Subduing or be a Peaceful Dragon. (You&rsquo;re not sure if it&rsquo;s the hair<br/>or the feathers that make you sneeze like a Mad Man!) With special thanks to Rich Sommer!<br/>&bull; Tassle of Castling (Cost: 2 Gems): Exchange any two Statues.<br/><br/>",

I'll add that they've incorrectly listed Scenarios 24~26 as they 'skipped' #23 but there are still 5 more of them and are listed correctly in the Table of Contents.<br/><br/>",

(Europa I), an historical game/simulation of the German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 that lead to the gates of Moscow and ultimately to the destruction of the Wehrmacht and the fall of the Third Reich. Drang Nach Osten! carries the Russian campaign from June 1941 to the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942. Unentschieden continues the campaign through 1944-45. The two games together comprise the entire War in the East, 1941-45.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/><br/>    Four partial mapsheets (numbered Europa 6 through 9).<br/>    Two 10&quot; x 27&quot; and one 8&quot; x 27&quot; mapsheet extending the DNO map to the east<br/>    One 27&quot; x 13&quot; mapsheet estending the DNO map to the south &amp; east<br/>    One set of six supplementary unit countersheets (for a total of 2128 counters) consisting of:<br/>    One Europa sheet 6<br/>    One Europa sheet 7<br/>    Two Europa sheet 8<br/>    One Europa sheet 9<br/>    One Europa sheet 10 (partial sheet)<br/>    One rules folder and cover.<br/>    One set of supplementary charts and tables.<br/>        One Soviet Initial Order of Battle<br/>        One Soviet Order of Appearance<br/>        One Soviet Unit Substitution Chart<br/>        One German Initial Order of Battle<br/>        One German Order of Appearance<br/>        One German Unit Substitution Chart<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>Ground units are Army HQs, Divisions (and Soviet Tank/Mechanized Corps), Brigades/Regiments, and Battalions. Air units are groups of 40-60 aircraft. Unentschieden adds more unit specialisation, although at 26 pages the combined rules are still quite manageable by today's standards. Drang Nach Osten! with Unentschieden lasts for 52 half-monthly game turns (Jun II 41 through Feb I 45) so allowing for one session of several hours per turn, several hundred hours is a realistic playing time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The expansion includes rules for playing Armageddon War solitaire, six solitaire scenarios in a loose campaign, counters and cards.<br/><br/>Each hex of enemy units in a solitaire scenario will have a &ldquo;stance&rdquo; counter, &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo;, &ldquo;cautious&rdquo; or &ldquo;defensive&rdquo;. When an enemy formation activates, each hex of units will draw a card and act according to the keywords on the card. These are shorthand and more fully delineated in the solitaire rules, but you can get a feel for them from the card. For instance, &ldquo;Close(2)&rdquo; means close 2 hexes with the nearest appropriate enemy unit (if &ldquo;close&rdquo; is in gold you close with armor, red is infantry). &ldquo;Cover&rdquo; would mean movement that utilizes available cover instead of open terrain, and the way you would decide is covered in the rules. Fire would be at the appropriate armor or infantry target, and so on.<br/><br/>On the player turn, the player draws a card each time a unit declares a movement, to see if an AI unit declares opportunity fire, and when that opportunity fire happens. For instance, &ldquo;Strongest(1)&rdquo; would mean that of all the AI units which can see your unit after it moves 1 hex, the strongest one able to opportunity fire does so. Tie-breaker situations are covered in the rules to determine who does it. For instance &ldquo;Strongest(1)&rdquo; would have a tie-breaker of &quot;Color-Closest&quot;, so if two possible Opfire units had the same firepower, you would check to see if one had the same color firepower as the defense type (armor vs. armor, infantry vs. infantry), and if still tied, then the closer of the two would make the attack.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Eagle of Lille expansion to Bloody April (Air War over Arras France 1917) expands the air war to follow the career of Immelmann and some of the other early aces such as Oswald Boelcke and Lanoe Hawker. Seven new scenarios cover the period from August 1915 to early 1917 while including tables which randomize taskings and add replayability to the scenarios. 16 new Aircraft Data Cards are in this expansion.  They include German single seat scout aeroplanes; Fokker Eindecker E.1, Eindecker E.II/E.III and Fokker D.III. German two-seater aeroplanes; Albatros C.I, Albatros C.III, Aviatik C.1 and LVG C.II as well as flying battle plane the AEG G.II with a crew of four. The British get a bevy of new aeroplanes; Bristol Scout C, B.E.12, RE.7 and Vickers FB5 Gun Bus as well as French made Nieuport 16, Morane-Saulnier N, L and BB.<br/><br/>A new 8&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; map extension adds the off-map aerodrome of Treizennes and Merville as a now playable area to fly. A 25 1/2&quot;x 11&quot; map extension shows the German and Allies aerodrome east of Amiens. New Advanced rules for Bloody April such as Aeroplane Quick Turn and new rules for Eagle of Lille have been added.  Two new counter sheets of aeroplanes and informational markers are included to round out this folio expansion.

As the last survivor, you must now face the dangers of the tower alone to complete the mission! Borbarads Fluch is a solo adventure for Aventuria - The Adventure Card Game.<br/><br/>Assemble the Archmage's cursed Mage Tower from a total of 30 tower cards and send your hero to its deadly floors. Your goal is to find out what Borbarad's curse is all about and save all of South Aventuria from a devastating catastrophe. Between you and your goal stands the mysterious tower and its guards and traps, and a single hero can only find certain death here. Fortunately, death in this wretched place, steeped in ancient magic, is only the beginning!<br/><br/>It allows you to learn from the mistakes of the past as you delve deeper and deeper into the tower to unlock its disturbing secrets. This adventure was deliberately designed for a single hero and contains numerous game mechanics to make the solo game entertaining and diversionary, but can also be mastered by entire groups of heroes with great fun.

        "description": "The Allied invasion of Normandy was a watershed moment in the war. Months of careful planning proceeded while the entire uncommitted strength of the American, British, Canadians, and other Allied armies massed in England. Across the Channel the Germans strove mightily to create hardened defenses on the beach and back them with a slew of new and veteran divisions. The clash came in the early hours of 6 June 1944: D-Day. If the Allies failed to grab a large enough beachhead the invasion would be contained and eventually crushed. If the German lines broke, the full weight of Allied power would be loosed to drive deep into France.<br/><br/>The D-Day Quad uses the Fire &amp; Movement system, designed to highlight the ability of motorized units to mass quickly for breakthrough and exploitation. Support fire, representing weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers, provides the extra punch to overwhelm a defense or shatter an attack. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower, and asset management.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>One 34&times;22 inch mounted game board<br/>400 Die-cut counters<br/>Color rules booklet<br/>One six-sided die<br/>Storage bags<br/><br/>",

Conan towered above them, and no two of them could match his strength. They were hardy and robust, but his was the endurance and vitality of a wolf, his thews steeled and his nerves whetted by the hardness of his life in the world's wastelands. He was quick to laugh, quick and terrible in his wrath. He was a valiant trencherman, and strong drink was a passion and a weakness with him. Naive as a child in many ways, unfamiliar with the sophistry of civilization, he was naturally intelligent, jealous of his rights, and dangerous as a hungry tiger. Young in years, he was hardened in warfare and wandering, and his sojourns in many lands were evident in his apparel.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash; Robert E. Howard, Queen of the Black Coast<br/><br/>This expansion lets you bring alternate versions of Conan the Barbarian and B&ecirc;lit, Queen of the Black Coast, as envisioned by the legendary Brom, to your tabletop!<br/><br/>The heroes come with a unique set of skills and equipment that adds more customisation and replay-ability to your games of Conan.<br/><br/>This version of Conan is based on the Cimmerian's days as a thief and as such he appears slightly less powerful in combat. But he does come with more toolbox abilities fitting this new role.<br/><br/>The version of B&ecirc;lit in the core box is that of a charismatic leader, preferring to take a backfield roll. In Brom's version however, she has eschewed this passive attitude in order to lead from the front, blades flashing as she directs her men. Ambidextrous is her new talent, replacing a more defensive one on her other incarnation. This gives her a great deal of efficiency when it comes to performing quick and precise attacks. Her command ability means that she can count on her men to cover her flanks or hold up larger groups as she deals with other targets!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>Two plastic miniatures (Conan and B&ecirc;lit), their two character sheets (one side in French, the other in English), and 12 equipment cards (six in French, six in English).<br/><br/>",

Devoted primarily to the Hastur faction, The Mark of Madness introduces a great number of deranged Artists, Cultists, and Lunatics, as well as the terrible, ancient powers that spur them forward. As Hastur's secret cult expands its powers, you'll also find a maddening array of new characters, support cards, conspiracies, and events, most of which lend new strength to the game's Terror struggle and mechanics for insanity.<br/><br/>Additionally, as Hastur's madness reaches outward to all of the game's eight factions, each gains a powerful new character that enters play insane and reshapes the game when it is restored. It's unknown whether or not these new characters will be able to prevent Hastur's followers from plunging the world into a new age of terror and chaos, but they gain additional support from other characters, events, and support cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On July 25th, 1944 the American, British, Canadian, Free French and Polish Armies launched an offensive to eliminate the deadlock in the Norman peninsula, and launch the Allied Armies into the interior of France. The German Army, over-committed and under-equipped, was soundly defeated; thousands of its troops, in addition to much of their equipment, were captured in the Falaise pocket. In short, the offensive worked, but that doesn't do justice to the blood spilled and courage shown during the six-week battle. As with any battle, the whole is made up of an uncountable number of skirmishes, clashes and firefights. Fourteen such events make up the scenarios of White Star Rising: Operation Cobra.<br/><br/>White Star Rising: Operation Cobra is an expansion for the game White Star Rising in the Nations at War series. This expansion focuses on the events surrounding the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead in July-August 1944. Operation Cobra adds the Canadians, the Free French and the Free Polish to the Nations at War series in addition to new units for the Americans, the British, and the Germans.<br/><br/>White Star Rising: Operation Cobra comes with nine stand-alone scenarios, focusing on events near Falaise, as the Germans tried to escape the converging allied armies. Among the topics are the Polish stand on Mont Ormel Ridge and Canadian efforts to capture the village of St. Lambert-sur-Dives. Operation Cobra also contains a five scenario linked campaign following the breakout of American armored units during Operation Cobra near the end of July 1944.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>126 Counters<br/>Nine Scenarios<br/>One Campaign<br/><br/>White Star Rising: Operation Cobra is not a stand-alone game, you will need White Star Rising first or second edition to play it.<br/><br/>Expands Nations at War: White Star Rising<br/><br/>Other Games in Series:<br/><br/>    Nations at War: Desert Heat<br/>    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph<br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising – Airborne<br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising – Operation Cobra<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this wonderful description page! We plan to put on a really exciting show for you today! Are you ready for these girls to show you what they've got?! Here it is, the moment you've all been waiting for &mdash; it's STARLIGHT STAGE!<br/><br/>Starlight Stage is a fast-paced set-collecting card game in which you are playing a talent manager whose aim is to get the best talent of all your rival agencies. You start with the fresh talent of a model, an actress, and a singer. You help to build their careers by collecting lessons, events, and upgrades for them which earns them more fame. The manager with the most famous talent at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>You start the game with three separate decks in a vertical row: the Idol deck, Fame deck, and Event deck. From the top of each deck, you draw a card for each player and lay them in a row next to the deck from which they were drawn. Each player starts with the beginning hand of new talent: the actress, model, and singer. To start the game, the first player has the option of drawing a card from one of the three stacks and adding it to the end of the row, increasing their options of what to purchase. They then use their accumulated talent points to either purchase an assignment card, acquire a fame card, or take a lesson. Play continues until the fame deck is empty. Then all players tally their fame points and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>The English-language edition of Starlight Stage includes both the original Japanese base game as well as the fourteen cards of Starlight Stage: Expansion Card Set 1.<br/><br/>",

They have led you and your team to a place that this generation has never before laid eyes upon. The Lost City of Atlantis, the fourth level of the Tomb, is now unlocked, and with it come the legend, the mystery, and the answers to why and how the Tomb moves throughout the planes. Atlantis holds the key to restoring cosmic peace: with luck, you&rsquo;ll find a way to repair the malfunctioning Antikythera Mechanism, stopping the terrible monsters from materializing inside of the Tomb for good!<br/><br/>As you explore the deepest parts of the Tomb, you will also discover the Apex, the highest part of the Tomb. Venture forth into the mystical Tomb&rsquo;s Eye&mdash;also known as Medusa&rsquo;s Meridian&mdash;the large pyramid atop the structure, where all of the Tomb&rsquo;s energies are channeled. Learn things about yourself and others in the Order, things that would have once been beyond your comprehension. When you enter the Meridian, you start a countdown clock to the Tomb&rsquo;s departure from our world, but you could very well crack the code that unlocks your team&rsquo;s true potential. The secrets of the cosmos are within your grasp. The Tomb&rsquo;s inner workings will finally be revealed to you. It is your chance now to discover Atlantis: Mystery of the Thirteen!<br/><br/>",

He knows how to use his sword, that&rsquo;s for certain, especially in carving a mighty exit. He earned his sword and spurs in a peaceful time, and was content to sit guard at his Lord&rsquo;s castle, making sure no errant peasants wandered through the long-since-rusted-open gates. But then the zombies came. And Brave Sir Montalban fought his way all the way through a retreat. He&rsquo;s a good man to have at your back in a fight &ndash; especially to carve your escape.<br/><br/>Bob is a wizard of limited magical skills and great theatricality. He learned when he was young that sleight-of-hand and misdirection would go a great distance when scholarly learning and magical talent failed. As such, he has dressed the role and carried on in the manner of a great magician, while much of what he does is not magic at all. On the other hand, he&rsquo;s quite good at small fire spells, and, if you make sure the zombies aren&rsquo;t shambling towards anything important (like the church, or a haymow), fire does a world of good against the creatures.<br/><br/>",

First: &quot;the Liberator&quot; is about allied air forces dropping weapons and meds for the insurgents. The figurine of a Liberator moves through the board. Players can change its path (using new movement card called: light signals). In most of the game rounds Liberator drops something and randomly picked up tokens appear in location on the map. First player who manage to pick it up will receive some small bonus in form of victory points, additional movement, special actions etc. The drop tokens are kept secret and players can use them in any moment of a game which makes interesting combo-opportunities.<br/><br/>The second expansion is about delivering private mail. There are private letters in different locations from the start of the game. Contrary to the orders each letter may be picked up only by one player and each player can have as much of private mail as he/she wants. Moreover the letters should be delivered before the game ends not only in next few game rounds. The tricky part is that each undelivered letter results in minus points to the player who picked it up.<br/><br/>The last part of Liberator expansion are the new secret mission cards!<br/><br/>Two expansions may be added separately or both at the same time to both versions of the base game: basic and extended.<br/><br/>",

Its modular design means the vessel's cockpit pod can be flown independently on missions that don't require heavy weaponry or transport capability.<br/><br/>With the Resistance Transport Expansion Pack, you can put this versatile ship to use in both its forms. In addition to both a Resistance Transport ship miniature and a Resistance Transport Pod ship miniature, you'll also find several high-ranking Resistance officers ready to join your crew, eight pilots prepped for battle, and four Quick Build cards to help you jump into the fight right away.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

During the vessel's first week in the region, 39 crew members &ndash; roughly half the crew &ndash; were killed in a conflict with the Krowtonan Guard. The Krowtonan Guard claimed that the Equinox had violated their borders, but Captain Ransom gave the order to continue through their space.

It contains 207 cards opposed to the 312 cards of Martial Law. Martial Law is a standalone game, playable on its own.<br/><br/>Nightfall is a deck-building game featuring direct head-to-head combat.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them. After the table has been set with the private and common cards, players begin play.<br/><br/>The meat of Nightfall is in the chaining mechanic. Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.<br/><br/>Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.<br/><br/>The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works.<br/><br/>",

Each of the other three modules cover June 1941-March 1942. Raicer gives us &quot;Hitler Turns East&quot; - Rinella &quot;Slaughterhouse&quot; - and Nord &quot;Strike the Bear.&quot;<br/><br/>Played on four full color 17&quot;x22&quot; mapsheets, each module lasts up to 3 to 4 hours, so 12-16 hours to play them all.<br/><br/>",

The ship was heavily armed, well protected, and, like all Borg ships, capable of transwarp speeds.<br/><br/>The vessel was present when Species 10026 was assimilated in 2375; Seven of Nine and the Borg Queen were aboard while this assimilation took place. Later, the vessel pursued the Delta Flyer when it escaped from the Unicomplex after rescuing Seven.

Two smaller scenarios concentrate on the Spanish Civil War and the Japanese invasion of China.<br/><br/>And we have variant rules. One set gives Spain and Turkey their own player, who controls both countries but does not have total freedom of action. And then there's the one players have demanded since the day we released John Prados' Third Reich: jet fighters. New jet fighter counters for Germany, Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan. Sporting the lovely graphics you've come to expect of the Me262, Gloster Meteor, Nakajima Kikka and more. A set of variant rules now requires that major powers build their jets once the science becomes available, rather than receiving an instant upgrade, and the technology can be captured.<br/><br/>There are new political markers included, allowing Germany to develop advanced submarines, V1 and V2 missiles, and the atomic bomb. The German player has to pay a stiff economic and military price for such science, however. There are V1 and V2 unit counters, too.<br/><br/>Drawing on the tradition of the original edition, we've also added a set of pre-war options players can add to spice up their games: Italian and Polish re-armament, the German Z-Plan, Japanese tank development, a Republican Spain, hard-fighting Austrians, Soviet naval development and more.<br/><br/>The book's centerpiece is a series of strategy articles, analyzing the positions of every player in both the separate games and the combined scenarios. There are also guides to key concepts like economic warfare.<br/><br/>",

Before he even saw the walker, he heard its massive cannon blast, and a nearby wall exploded, sending rubble flying. &quot;Where are those reinforcements?&quot; the Captain shouted. He didn't hear his sergeant's response, but saw, instead, the sun glinting off three heavily armored paratroopers.<br/><br/>Save the day with the Allied Red Devils, the elite armored members of the British 3rd Paratroop Brigade. Land them on the battlefield to launch powerful energy pulses at enemy combat walkers with their 60W Phaser Guns. Where other infantry weapons may fail to punch the reinforced armor of combat walkers, the Red Devils have the firepower to do the job. Introduce their phaser weapons and their Rocket Punches to the battlefield. Shrug off small munitions.<br/><br/>Turn the tide of battle with these elite paratroopers.

Despite their status as a new team then, they have an influx of incredible talent, and are already proving themselves to be nightmares (do you see?) for their opponents&hellip;<br/><br/>This multi-part plastic kit contains the components necessary to assemble the Naggaroth Nightmares, a Dark Elf Blood Bowl team. The team consists of 6 Linemen, 2 Blitzers, 2 Runners and 2 Witch Elves &ndash; each is clad in some pretty spikesome armour, with the hides of Cold Ones draped over their shoulders. The Witch Elves are ...slightly less armoured, and can be modelled either with hands pointing imperiously toward their opponents &ndash; or clutching a still-beating heart. The Linemen have 3 different designs of head.<br/><br/>There are a host of extras in the kit &ndash; 2 turn markers, 2 double-sided score coins featuring a Dark Elves icon and 4 balls &ndash; 2 kraken eggs (with protruding tentacles) and 2 balls made from the hide of a Cold One, lacking pegs.<br/><br/>Supplied with 12 32mm Blood Bowl bases, a 1,000,000 GP roster and a Dark Elf transfer sheet.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The included cards have been updated to incorporate the most recent FAQ. In addition, the text on a number of cards has been altered from its original printing, adjusting for game balance and rules clarity.<br/><br/>Among Conspiracies of Chaos' features are six faction-specific conspiracies. Conspiracies are story cards that players can play from their own decks and win to further their goal of claiming three stories. The six conspiracies included within Conspiracies of Chaos play into one of each faction&rsquo;s particular strengths. Also featured are an assortment of characters that thrive in a world of conspiracy&ndash;characters that grow stronger when a conspiracy is in play. In addition, this Asylum Pack also includes support cards and events that can wildly alter the tempo of the game.<br/><br/>",

Thanks to the hard work of accountants like you, the Queen&rsquo;s honey stand is up and running. But now fall has arrived, and winter is coming! Her Majesty has given Her workers new responsibilities: harvest and sell fruit from the fall crop, decorate the hive with colorful autumn leaves, cap and store nectar for winter, and send retiring workers to be honored at the harvest festival before the sun sets on Sweetwater Grove. So strike up the waggle dance, it&rsquo;s time for business!<br/><br/>Fall Flavors is an expansion that introduces five new modules for Honey Buzz. You can mix and match to add these modules to the game in any combination!<br/><br/>Fall Fruit Module &ndash; Forage in a new field of flowers and collect fruit instead of pollen. Sell your collected apples, pears, and pumpkins at the market or save them up to complete special new orders for honey-dipped fruit.<br/><br/>Autumn Leaves Module &ndash; Collect colorful leaves found on the new leafy hive tiles as a means of decorating your hive for the queen. Score points for the leaves in your hive, based on the foliage card in play for that game.<br/><br/>Nectar Caps Module &ndash; Put caps on your nectar cells to prepare for winter. Nectar caps are worth lots of points and might even earn you a trophy, but they slow down your economy because capped nectar tiles cannot produce honey!<br/><br/>Harvest Festival Module &ndash; Trim your labor force by retiring your workers and sending them off to the harvest festival. As each worker retires, you choose whether they propose a toast or work one last time.<br/><br/>Sweetwater Sunset &ndash; When playing with Fall Flavors, use the new sunset board to track progress towards the end of the game. When the sun sets on Sweetwater Grove, winter has arrived, and the game will end.<br/><br/>",

Galactic travel is accomplished through &quot;Warp Points&quot; which connect star systems in a random manner.  Ships are made up of various combat and non-combat systems each represented by a letter (or combination of letters).  A &quot;word&quot; makes up a ship.  Movement is on an &quot;endless&quot; hex map, and occurs in 6 impulses.  As damage is done between ships, letters are crossed off from left to right within the &quot;word&quot; until the ship is destroyed.<br/><br/>",

She controls the space station in a silence broken only by the screams of the latest arrivals. Pandora wanders through space looking for forms of life marked by evil, hunting them down and capturing them, satisfying the wish of her creators. Her trusted Punishers are supported by the Sin Eaters and repair droids, called Shield.<br/><br/>She had lived in darkness and silence for millenniums, until she was touched by two beings that seemed destined to cross her path. In them, Pandora saw something she had never seen before, a pure and candid aura, in strong contrast with their appearance. She immediately understood that she had stumbled across something precious, which if properly moulded could become a lethal weapon, something feared by all, something fair yet terrible.  <br/>She had found Alpha and Omega.<br/><br/>Pandora&rsquo;s vigilant slumber was interrupted by a signal that she never imagined to receive on Phitos. Somebody had intercepted the course of her spaceship. But who would be so foolish? Why?<br/><br/>With this new expansion, our heroes will find themselves managing Pandora&rsquo;s fury, in search of Beli&rsquo;ar, Jukas&rsquo; master, lost in space for decades. In a moment of sanity, Beli&rsquo;ar had managed to yell out for help through the purple flames, and Jukas had heard his echo.<br/><br/>During this mini campaign, you&rsquo;ll visit Phitos in search of Pandora, ready to rescue Beli'ar. You won't be able to use the Blessed Weapons as heroes, but will come up against them as enemies together with the droids and their strange appearance, helping Pandora defend against intruders.<br/><br/>Pandora will end with a breathtaking finale, which will allow you to play Beli'ar in the future, either as a Nemesis or as a Hero. It all depends on you. The final Pandora mission is a nemesis mission, with action cards to manage this new and powerful adversary.<br/><br/>But how did Beli'ar come to be imprisoned on Phitos?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If the trait is not paid, it simply will not be active.<br/><br/>Merchant Guild soldiers usually have low initiative - this is important because the cost of activating a given perk is equal to the initiative of this unit. Activating the Headhunter Sniper will cost one gamble, but another soldier with initiative 2 will cost two gambles. The maximum number of gambles that can be managed at a time is 7, so we should have quite a lot of room for maneuver.<br/><br/>",

Napoleon and Wellington&rsquo;s Armies are roughly equal. Who is the better commander?<br/><br/>&bull; # 40.0 THE FIELDS OF HAL - Wellington&rsquo;s Predicament, 17-18 June 1815<br/>Wellington had prepared for battle at Hal and would have quickly assembled his forces in pre-planned positions. The Prussian Army would have strained every nerve to join forces with the Anglo-Allies, facing a longer march. Can Napoleon defeat Wellington before Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s arrival?<br/><br/>&bull; # 41.0 THE TURNED FLANK - Napoleon&rsquo;s Phantom Left-Hook, 18-19 June 1815<br/>&ldquo;I think I should have respected the English infantry more&hellip;and that I should not have taken the bull by the horns; I should have turned a flank. I should have kept the English army occupied [at Mont St. Jean] by a demonstration to attack&hellip;whilst I was in fact moving the<br/>main body by Hal on Brussels.&rdquo; &mdash;Wellington.<br/><br/>Wellington politely failed to mention that French command issues could be fatal to any strategy. This scenario allows the players to explore Wellington&rsquo;s Turned Flank strategy while minimizing French command errors.

        "description": "In the years immediately following the defeat of Nazi Germany, some leaders among the victorious Allies believed that war between the two remaining superpowers was not only inevitable, it would come very soon. The United States and the Soviet Union continued to design and build new armored vehicles and other weapons for this looming war, but the &ldquo;Cold War&rdquo; would drag on for almost 45 years without ever resulting in open battle.<br/><br/>Iron Curtain is a supplement introducing the post-war weapons of the two superpowers to the Panzer Grenadier system. The scenarios are all hypothetical, of course, but are based on what generals of either side believed would be the course of a war in the years immediately after 1945. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Road to Berlin and Battle of the Bulge.<br/><br/>For those fascinated by huge tanks with big guns, this is the ultimate in tactical armored wargaming. New pieces include the Soviet Josef Stalin III and Josef Stalin IV heavy tanks, T-44 medium tank and Su101 assault gun. There are also infantry armed with the awesome AK-47 assault rifle, still a front-line weapon around the world 60 years after its development.<br/><br/>An American player will need powerful weapons to counter that arsenal, and Iron Curtain provides. There are M26 &ldquo;Pershing&rdquo; heavy tanks, Sherman &ldquo;Jumbo&rdquo; assault tanks, M24 Chaffee light tanks, M4 Sherman tanks with a 76mm gun, M28 ultra-heavy assault tanks, and M29, M30 and M32 heavy tanks. Plus M36 tank destroyers, M39 full-tracked armored personnel carriers, and 90mm anti-tank guns.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HOLD THE LINE now looks at one of the most fabled conflicts in history, the Jacobite rebellions, in HIGHLAND CHARGE. These uprisings were, as of 2013, the last battles fought on British soil. Featured here are four battles from the fearsome contest: Sheriffmuir, Prestonpans, Falkirk, and Culloden. Worthington is also offering the Killiecrankie scenario free to download. The game closely aligns with the Hold the Line system, but includes rules for Highland charges, Scottish militia, and of course the feared Highland clan units.<br/><br/>James II lost his throne in 1689, but he and his supporters did not give the fight to reclaim his rights and titles. From 1689 to 1745 no less than four major Jacobite rebellions broke out in the Scottish highlands, often with limited aid from France and Spain. The battles were the last hurrah for a dying way of war. The Highlanders relied on assault tactics, in particular the feared Highland charge. The Loyalists, made up of British regulars and Scottish militia, used the linear tactics of the day, including volley fire, artillery barrages, and bayonets. For a time the Highlanders seemed to be tactically superior until the shattering defeat at Culloden, a battle that proved the ultimate superiority of musket and artillery fire over the claymore.<br/><br/>As the Jacobites can you reclaim the throne for the Stuart dynasty? As the Loyalists can you protect the Hanoverian succession and deal a final death blow to absolutism in Britain? Across the way the bagpipes can be heard. The clans have mustered, the sound of cannon deafens, men shout commands, smoke fills the air. You must HOLD THE LINE!<br/><br/>",

It is a metal suitcase-style box with a plastic insert that is perfect for holding the cards included in the Munchkin card games. It also comes with some German cards and a Kill-O-Meter.<br/><br/>Where do I get the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>Pegasus Spiele's shop is the easiest way to order it. See the &quot;Links&quot; section for the link to the game page, which has a link to the shop page. The site is mostly in German, but there is a translation option at the top right that makes it easy enough to get through the ordering process without knowing any German (note that it will not translate the product description). Note that you will not pay during the checkout process. Instead, Pegasus Spiele will contact you (using English) and give you instructions on how to pay via either bank transfer or Paypal.<br/><br/>How much does it cost?<br/>It costs 39,95 Euro plus an additional 15 Euro shipping to most locations (at least to the US and Australia, Europe might be less). Payment must be made by either International Bank Transfer or Paypal as specified in the previous question.<br/><br/>What else do you get with it?<br/>There are 101 included cards with German text and backs for various sets. There is also a Kill-O-Meter. The Sammlerkoffer also has its own special rule.<br/><br/>What is the Sammlerkoffer's special rule?<br/>If you are playing with cards that all come from a single Sammlerkoffer, the owner of the Sammlerkoffer may, once per game, take a card from either draw pile at any time that they are not in combat. If more than one person brings a Sammlerkoffer, then play with cards from the heavier Sammlerkoffer.<br/><br/>Are the cards usable with English Munchkin sets?<br/>Some of them can be mixed into your existing sets, but the German backs for some cards are different from the original versions, so they would stand out.<br/><br/>     The backs of the Munchkin cards, both Treasures and Doors, are significantly darker than the English versions.<br/>     The card backs for the following games have the game name in German: Munchkin Bites!; The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin; and Munchkin Booty.<br/>     The cards with the same backs are for Star Munchkin; Super Munchkin; Munchkin Cthulhu; and Munchkin Fu.<br/><br/><br/>How many cards are there for each themed set?<br/>The breakdown is as follows:<br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Munchkin: 45 Doors and 30 Treasures<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Super Munchkin: 1 Door and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Bites!: 6 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Cthulhu: 2 Doors and 4 Treasures<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin: 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Star Munchkin: 3 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Booty: 2 Doors and 1 Treasure<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Munchkin Fu: 3 Doors<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Can sleeved cards fit into the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>Some can, but it is a tight fit. The 56mm x 87mm standard sleeves from Mayday just fit inside the box. Nobody has reported yet whether the premium version of the sleeves or if other types of sleeves fit or not. Note that the sleeved cards do take up more room, so you will get about 25% less cards in the box.<br/><br/>How many cards fit inside the Sammlerkoffer?<br/>By my estimate, approximately 4,000 unsleeved cards or 3,000 sleeved cards can fit if you pack them tightly. This is not counting the areas set aside for rules, dice and Dungeon cards.<br/><br/>How are the card areas arranged?<br/>The plastic base of the Sammlerkoffer includes spaces for various decks and expansions. The included insert suggests putting each core set and expansion in a different slot, but as the ratio of decks to expansions is approximately equivalent to the ratio between Doors and Treasures, it is possible to use a pair of slots (one large, one medium) for the Doors and Treasures of sets with one 112 card expansion or two 56 card expansions, which is perfect for most of the Munchkin themes. The number of slots and approximate number of unsleeved cards that each slot can hold are as follows:<br/><br/>     11 slots for core sets or Doors of an expanded set fitting about 190 cards each.<br/>     12 slots for 112 card expansions or Treasures of an expanded set fitting about 125 cards each.<br/>     6 slots for Boosters and Promo cards fitting about 60 cards each.<br/>     4 slots for Dungeon cards fitting about 40 Dungeon cards each.<br/>     1 slot for storing rules, dice, bookmarks, Kill-O-Meters, pawns and whatever else you want to store.<br/><br/><br/>Is the Kill-O-Meter the same as the Steve Jackson Games version?<br/>Not quite. It features the same art, but it uses different card stock.<br/><br/>What icons are on the cards?<br/>All 101 cards have an icon for the Sammlerkoffer. In addition, 55 of the cards have the More Good Cards icon, one card has the Kill-O-Meter icon, and one card has the Crazed Caverns icon.<br/><br/>What are the translations of the included cards?<br/>We do not provide a translation of the cards here. That being said, all but 18 of the cards have already been translated or have equivalent cards in English (see the &quot;Community Wiki&quot; section, below, for hints on where to look).<br/><br/>",

All three, in my educated opinion, have to do with Elder Gods or their equivalents. For that matter, I consider Hecate, referenced by HPL as &quot;Gorgo, Mormo, thousand-faced moon&quot; as an Elder Goddess. And also possibly the Magna Mater.

        "description": "Ostrołęka 16 lutego 1807 covers the battle of Ostrołęka, fought on Feb. 16, 1807 between the French 5th Corps commanded by Gen. Jean-Anne-Marie Savary and the Russian Corps commanded by Gen. Ivan N. Essen. The main goal of the French Corps was to secure the supply line of Napoleon&rsquo;s main army fighting with Gen. Bennigsen. Just after the bloody battle of Preussisch Eylau (Feb. 7-8, 1807) both sides started to look for possibilities of taking advantage over the enemy and draw away some opposite forces from the main theater before the next expected battle. After set of back and forth operations in the north Mazovia, Russians decided to launch an offensive against units of the Frech 5th Corps situated near Ostrołęka. Russian commander, Gen. Essen, strengthened by the 6th Division of Gen. Sedmioradski, prepared a plan of attack. He decided to divide his forces into two wings. One of them (6th Division and a part of 9th Division), commanded by Gen. Wolkonski, had to attack the town Ostrołęka from the north, approaching along the west bank of Narew river. The other wing (10th Division and a part of 9th Division), commanded by Gen. Essen, approaching along the east bank of Narew river, had to attack the town Ostrołęka from the east. Russians had significant numerical advantage but their problem was that both operational groups were completely separated by the impassable river with marshy banks and in effect could not suport each other.<br/><br/>Before the battle started, Russians had made feign attacks near Myszyniec along the line of communication of the main French army, north-west of Ostrołęka, fooling the French command. Gen. Savary decided to send there whole 1st Infantry Division of Gen. Suchet. Before the battle started, two events had taken place that had great impact on the course of it. The first one caused that Russians completely lost surprise effect. French caught the Russian messanger with letter from Essen to Bennigsen, from which they got to know the plan of the offensive. However we do not know how many details of it. The second event was also disadvantageous for the Russian Corps command. Gen. Bennigsen, who was the commander-in-chief of all Russian forces operating against Napoleon, recalled 6th Division of Gen. Sedmioradski to the main Russian army, to the north. Gen. Wolkonski, supported by Gen. Essen, tried to convince Gen. Sedmioradski to postpone execution of this order and take part in the planned ofensive against French 5th Corps, but Sedmioradski decided to obey strictly order from the upper commander and had marched to the north just befeore the offensive started. The effect was that Wolkonski&rsquo;s group which had to advance along the west bank of Narew river was reduced to 1/3 of its units.<br/><br/>The battle of Ostrołęka fought in 1807 is a classical example of the maneuver from a central position. Knowing more or less enemy&rsquo;s plans, early morning of Feb. 16, 1807, near 4 AM Gen. Savary also decided to divide his forces into two groups. He found the Russian wing approaching along the west bank of the Narew river as more dangerous because it could had cut him off from his line of communication. That is why he decided to march with the majority of his forces to the north, defeat it as the first and then revert back to the Ostrołęka to fight with the rest of the Russians. In Ostrołęka Savary left only 8 battalions with some artillery and cavalry. They had to defend and keep the town until he had defeated the enemy approaching from the north. Battle fought by Savary with Wolkonski&rsquo;s group near Stanisław&oacute;w was quick. Russian General, seeing enemy strongly outnumbering his group, after short combat started retreat. It was 10 AM when being near Stanisław&oacute;w Savary heard the sound of cannonade coming from Ostrołęka. At that moment he realised the Russian group he defeated was the smaller one and the main Russian forces were at Ostrołęka attacking small French contingent he had left there in the morning to defend the town and area around it. Leaving some units to pursuit Wolkonski&rsquo;s group Savary ordered force march to Ostrołęka. It was noon when the first units of his group appeared near the town where they met coming back from the north west 1st Infantry Division of Gen. Suchet. How defenders of the town were able to keep control of it to that time is another story. Some historical sources mention that although outnumbered, they even attacked Russians in the first part of the battle, confusing them and disturbing the decisive attack. Also some parts of Essen&rsquo;s group were delayed. Finally, near noon, when the defenders were about to lose, suprisingly Russian attacks on the town stopped. Russian command decided to withdraw to the positions to the east of Ostrołęka, stay there until the end ot the day and make retreat during night. When Savary&rsquo;s group and the 1st Infantry Division crossed the Narew river and formed the battle line, the last part of the battle commenced. There were no more than 2 hours to the dusk but it was enough for the French to break Essen&rsquo;s group, however in effect of darkness, early coming during winter, the victory was not so overwhelming as it had been if the French had had more time. It is estimated that Russian lost 2500-3000 casualties, while French 1500-2000 ones.<br/><br/>The game is an expansion for Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831. It means that Ostrołęka 16 lutego 1807 uses system rules (also charts &amp; tables), markers and the board which are in Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831. There are special rules for this historical period and battle (2 pages only). There are three scenarios in the game: <br/>- The Defense of Ostrołęka, <br/>- Operational,<br/>- The Battle on the East Bank of the Narew River. <br/>The first scenario covers the initial part of the battle. Its feature is a chit-pull system, used to simulate activity of the French units at the beginning of the combat and their better command system. The second scenario, the largest one, allows to play the whole battle. Its aim is also to show the operational background around the battlefield. It tries to join two levels of warfare: tactical and operational. In fact it is a kind of scenario generator: each player can choose among few options how to divide his forces among two groups. This decision has a great impact on the course of the game. Another important decision up to the Russian player is possible bringing to the battle Russian 6th Division of Gen. Sedmioradski, what gives him more forces but changes victory conditions to more demanding for the Russians. There is a plenty of additional options for this scenario. The third scenario depicts the last part of the battle, great frontal struggle on the east bank of the Narew river with most of the units participating in it. The playing time varies depending on the scenario, style of play and many other factors. The third scenario is the shortest while the second scenario as a whole is definitely the longest one. However in case of lack time, basing on the second scenario you can create little battles which can be played in 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>Components (all packed in ziplock):<br/>- 324 die-cut counters (9 small counter sheets)<br/>- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)<br/>- Two sheets with unit rosters (for French and Russians)<br/>- One sheet with turn tracks<br/>- Four bags for counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crushed by the initial Nazi onslaught, the Red Army reeled back across hundreds of miles. But as resistance stiffened, it became clear that some highly-motivated units fought better than others. These became the Guards, first named in September 1941. They became the Red Army&rsquo;s best troops, with better training, equipment and pay than the regular army.<br/><br/>Red Warriors is a supplement to the Panzer Grenadier series, focusing on these elite fighters and their exploits. It is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front, Road to Berlin and Battle of the Bulge to play all of the scenarios.<br/>While the Soviet Guards are of excellent quality, the supplement also includes German Air Force (Luftwaffe) ground troops of rather dubious merit, plus German Army forces.<br/>Scenarios cover actions of these units in the first two years of the Great Patriotic War, many of them focused on the Soviet Operation Mars, also the subject of our Red God of War game at the operational scale. This supplement lets you explore the same battle at a more detailed level.<br/><br/>The pieces and half of the scenarios appeared in our Heroes of the Soviet Union game, released in 2001 and long since retired to Valhalla. Each scenario from the older game has been completely revised to make use of the many boards and pieces we&rsquo;ve published since they first appeared. Each scenario is fully laid out on its own scenario card rather than the booklet used in most of our games.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game<br/>    Road to Berlin: Platoon Level Combat in World War II – A Panzer Grenadier Game<br/>    Battle of the Bulge: Platoon Level Combat in World War II – A Panzer Grenadier Game<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Panzer Grenadier: March on Leningrad<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Siege of Leningrad<br/><br/><br/>",

Have you been searching for a game that is filled with magic and mystery? Is your gaming group looking for something quick and fun without pages and pages of rules? Look no further!The Shivers is a truly one-of-a-kind tabletop experience that features the magic of hand-crafted pop-ups, combined with just the right amount of spooky puzzle-solving mystery and role playing.<br/><br/>Using our patent-pending modular pop-up system, the mystery will unfold as you and your friends explore a magical mansion, as one of the members of the Shivers family. Each episode takes about an hour to play cooperatively, with one person taking the lead as the Storyteller. Once players finish one episode, a quick change of the system reveals the next story which will be completely new and unique: filled with new clues, puzzles, room layouts, and foes to vanquish.<br/><br/>The Shivers is fun and challenging for young kids, teens, and even older experienced game players. While most games have dozens of pages of rules and take many hours to learn and play, Shivers players have just a couple simple rules, and can get up and playing in less than 5 minutes. Similar to an escape room in structure and feel (but on a much smaller scale), players can get immediately immersed in the mystery, discovering the right path forward as they progress.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They came free and were packaged on the outside of the base game.<br/><br/>The first Bonus Card is Morgan card # 8:<br/>The next time a player chooses to Go on a Quest, the Picts and Saxons unite to form a single Quest. When computing the Total Rumor Value of all Quests, add the Rumor Values of all Pict and Saxon cards together. If the Rumors for Picts+Saxons were baseless (10 or less), place a single Black sword on the table; otherwise, place 2 swords (White or Black, depending on the Total Rumor Value of Picts+Saxons), on the Round Table. This makes your noble quest even more difficult by uniting the Picts and Saxons, letting the rumor of this new combined quest grow even faster. But there&rsquo;s also a greater reward, as you will earn two white swords if you defeat this new combined army.<br/><br/>Note: Mordred adds + 1 to each Pict and each Saxon card; Merlin # 1 cancels both the highest value Pict AND the highest value Saxon card. Merlin # 4 may cancel EITHER the highest value Pict OR the highest value Saxon card (at the player&rsquo;s choice when he reveals that Merlin).<br/><br/>The second Bonus Card is Merlin card # 6<br/>The player who draws this card may immediately Go on a Quest of his choice and add up to 3 points to the Total Rumor value of that Quest (before revealing any of the cards in the Threats pile, of course!). Merlin can be a powerful ally when you face desperate situations&hellip; if he appears at the right time. But all bets are off if a traitor finds this powerful card!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This edition contains all the contents of the Beasts of Balance base set, but also includes two additional expansions: 16 NFC Battle Cards and The Omnibeast. The box cover identifies both the edition name and these added contents.<br/><br/>--from the publisher's Kickstarter webpage:<br/><br/>The size of the box is slightly smaller this time around (11.4&quot; x 11.4&quot; x 4.3&quot; / 290mm x 290mm x 110mm), and the inserts have been redesigned to allow more space for extra pieces. Apart from that, everything else is exactly the same, meaning that the contents of the box are identical to the original edition.<br/><br/>The Battle Cards expansion allows you to graduate to the next part of your training. Under the short-tempered gaze of Alberick, spirit of the volcano, it's time to learn the art of war. If you can master the mysterious, destructive Primal Power, then you'll best your rivals.<br/><br/>Two to three players each take on the role of a Divine Creator of a single region: Land, Sea or Sky. The aim of the game is to fill your region with powerful beasts, while stealing and smiting those of your opponents.<br/><br/>Primal Power enters your world though a deck of 16 unique NFC Battle Cards. They are used by scanning them on the Plinth, just like the Artefacts. Each player wields a hand of these cards, enabling them to invoke a whole host of weird and wonderful effects on the digital realm. Some are focused on attack, some will aid in defense, and some will manifest in much more random ways&hellip;<br/><br/>The Omnibeast expansion contains a rare Artefact that will mix up your game with its mysterious and unique powers. When you play it, Omnibeast will manifest in your world as one of the beasts you&rsquo;ve unlocked in your Bestiary, introducing new strategy and helping you populate your world with extra fabulousness!<br/><br/>",

Extra bonus -- free Munchkins!<br/><br/>These six female Munchkin pawns are scheduled to appear in a 2010 Munchkin Quest supplement . . . but if you want them early, here they are! You get one in each of the six Munchkin Quest player colors. The obvious thing to do would be to throw them into your Munchkin Quest box along with the ones that came with the game, and use the correct pawn for whatever sex you character happens to be at that moment.<br/><br/>But if you are truly evil -- and your friends let you get away with it -- you'll show the world just what a munchkin you really are by using the Munchkin Babes in other games.<br/><br/>In Munchkin<br/><br/>Any time you are entitled to go up a level -- or when you do something that WOULD earn you a level if you weren't already Level 9 -- you may, instead, place a munchkin pawn in front of you. In any combat, you may discard it for a 1d6 bonus. You may only have one in front of you at a time. Unless, of course, you &quot;lose&quot; these rules and tell the other players that you're allowed to have more. Six is a good number.<br/><br/>In Other Games<br/><br/>Because you're a munchkin, you may claim a munchkin advantage for using these pawns in ANY game. For instance:<br/><br/><br/>    In any roll-and-move game, if you use the munchkin as your pawn rather than one that came with the game, then once per game you may add or subtract 1 space to the move you roll. <br/>    In any game in which you start with money, if you use the munchkin as your pawn you start with 10% extra. Round up, of course. <br/>    In chess, a munchkin pawn can move forward two spaces at any time. <br/><br/><br/>If you create your own official rules for using the Munchkin pawn in other games, please share your rules with us at the Steve Jackson Games forums.<br/><br/>",

(Action Jackson and Johnny One-Eye were previously released in a limited manner through FFG's Game Night Kits.)<br/><br/>Action Jackson drops onto the battlefield as a British paratrooper, armored in a high-tech ASOCOM battle suit and equipped with two 60W Phaser Guns. Phaser technology may still be new, but when it all comes together, Action Jackson can blast through even the heaviest Axis walkers in a single instant. Meanwhile, The Priest prefers to operate up close and personal, where he's a sly expert with his dynamite charges, and Johnny One-Eye may not be the first badass to walk the Dust Tactics battlefields, but he's the first Hero with the skill to prove it. His Badass skill means he's not the type of guy who likes running out of ammunition while Axis forces close in around him. Johnny One-Eye and any squad he joins gain unlimited uses of their limited ammunition weapons.<br/><br/>",

On the right at the hotel entrance there is a Tyrolean style Stuberl with the signatures, written on the ceiling, of the team that did the first ascent of Everest in 1953 and of the successful first ascent of Kangchenjunga in 1955, these include Sir Edmund Hillary, Tenzing Norgay, Sir John Hunt, Charles Evans, George Band, Joe Brown, John Angelo Jackson, Wilfred Noyce, Tony Streather, Tom Mackinnon, Norman Hardie, Neil Mather, John Clegg and others including Noel Odell from Mallory's 1924 expedition and Chris Bonington of later successes. There are many photographs and exhibits provided by the original team members in the main bar and guest lounge.

Wounds inflicted by these arrows rapidly necrotize: flesh peels away, foulness spreads, and bones crumble and crack. Panic spreads as healthy warriors fall, rotted from within. Able to kill at range and afflict their targets with the blight of the Mistlands, Reanimate Archers inspire fear in even the most stalwart soldiers.<br/><br/>Fire poisoned arrows down on your enemies with the eight new Reanimate Archer figures included in the Reanimate Archers Unit Expansion! These eight figures give you the option to field another two-tray unit or increase the size of a larger unit&mdash;perhaps fielding a block of archers that will rain death on your foes. Like the Oathsworn Cavalry, these figures are identical to the figures included in the Runewars Core Set, and this expansion gives you an easy way to raise more undead to fight for Waiqar the Undying, while opening dark new paths with five new upgrade cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Website<br/><br/>During the course of the First World War, the United States continued to build huge new battleships despite a pressing need for destroyers and merchant ships. In Britain, Royal Navy planners wondered just what their American allies were up to, because such a fleet could only have one potential adversary. Britain also made plans to construct new ships.<br/><br/>Sea of Troubles is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on the war plans of both sides. Most of the scenarios take place in the Caribbean Sea, using the map from U.S. Navy Plan Gold, but some actions are also placed in European waters on the maps for Jutland or Mediterranean.<br/><br/>There are 210 die-cut and mounted playing pieces, the same pieces that originally appeared in our now out-of-print U.S. Navy Plan Red. The Americans get the huge 1919 program battleship mounting eight 18-inch guns as well as four examples of the South Dakota class with their dozen 16-inch guns apiece. There are also the Lexington class battle cruisers in their original configuration with 14-inch guns, and the 1914 design for a fast commerce-raiding armored cruiser armed with 10-inch guns.<br/><br/>The Royal Navy adds the remainder of its R-class battleships not seen in Jutland, plus the huge battleships of the N3 design with nine 18-inch guns each, and the ungainly but powerful battle cruisers of the G3 design. Plus the Royal Canadian Navy makes an appearance with three dreadnought battleships and a flotilla of destroyers.<br/><br/>There are over three dozen new scenarios featuring brawls between huge fleets of battleships, plus of course background articles on the ships, the fleets and the war plans of all potential participants.<br/><br/>This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of Mediterranean, Jutland and U.S. Navy Plan Gold is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>NOTE: This product acts as a successor to the now out-of-print Great War at Sea: U.S. Navy Plan Red.  As a result, both countersheets that ship with this product are still labeled 'US Navy Plan Red', although the scenarios for that product, set along the United States Eastern seaboard, are now deprecated in favor of scenarios set in the Mediterranean and North Sea.  Additionally, while 'US Navy Plan Red' was a boxed-set and limited to a few scenarios that could work with the components included, as a module book 'Sea of Troubles' is not so constrained.  There are more than 2 dozen scenarios in this product that cover more than just 'Plan Red', along with articles on the ships and historical flavor for this period.<br/><br/>Plan Red was released in a second edition in 2013. It has a completely revised scenario book with 14 battle and 20 operational scenarios, and updated special rules. Sea of Troubles is out of print.<br/><br/>",

Whenever a player creates a planet, they receive one Gravity marker. Gravity markers may be used along with any resource to turn that resource into any other resource. Players may also use 3 (or 2 in a 4-player game) Gravity markers to remove a space tile from beneath one planet. It's an anti-take that play! The Gravity expansion also comes with a plastic holder for the Gravity markers.<br/><br/>The Stars expansion can change the game rules depending on the Star core that is chosen. The Dynamic Star provides an extra resource when a player creates a planet, depending on where around the Star the planet is placed. The Blue Giant provides resource advantages, but at a cost; when a player creates a planet, they may either remove a life marker from a planet to take resources equal to that planet&rsquo;s life creation cost, or discard a Space tile to take 3 resources of any kind. The Chaotic Star allows flexible tactics, as players may move a life marker from one planet to another, as long as that planet has the same life creation requirements. Finally, the Red Dwarf allows players to exchange one Space tile in hand for another after creating a planet.<br/><br/>The Space expansion provides more Space tiles for added variety! These special tiles provide no goals, but they do have two effects to choose from, such as taking a tile underneath a planet and transferring it to another planet, or protecting a planet from any Space tiles that might affect it. Many of the effects are powerful, and will require the player take both a Solar Flare AND a Fusion marker!<br/><br/>",

All units are company size.<br/><br/>The scale of the battle for Kasserine Pass differs from the original 2 miles/hex. The map is zoomed in on the pass itself and is scaled at 0.35 miles/hex. This also led to a change in time scale. Every turn is now 4 hours (instead of half a day in the original game).<br/><br/>A few minor alterations in the original rules have been made to accommodate the change of scale.<br/><br/>",

Kingsport Dreams reintroduces this intriguing Asylum Pack, updated to the 60-card per pack format (three copies each of 20 unique cards). In addition, the text on a number of cards has been altered from its original printing to better adjust for game balance and rules clarity, making for an exciting and challenging gaming experience for both new players and veterans alike.<br/><br/>Take a tour through Kingsport's most interesting locales and meet its charming - sometimes literally so - denizens. Each of Call of Cthulhu's factions will find someplace to call home in Kingsport. Also featured in Kingsport Dreams are a curious cast of characters, including Sorcerors Thomas Olney and Mentor to Vaughn (designed by 2006 Call of Cthulhu World Champion Chris Long), as well as two new Ancient Ones, Nodens and Tulzscha, and doomed necromancer Charles Dexter Ward.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player takes 1-3 tiles from the reserve, places them in a straight line with canals intersecting only canals and buildings adjacent only to other buildings, then places this line of tiles adjacent to at least one tile already in play (again, with canals not intersecting buildings. A player can use a &quot;T&quot; tile to add a branch to the canal, or they can use the reverse side for the &quot;I&quot; or &quot;L&quot; shape.<br/><br/>The rules for victory remain the same. If you make a tile placement that &quot;closes the loop&quot; &mdash; that is, so that every canal is connected to another canal &mdash; you win the game. If you think that the opponent's previous move makes it impossible to close the loop, you can say &quot;Impossible!&quot; If it is indeed impossible to close the loop, you win the game; if the opponent demonstrates how they can close the loop with the tiles that remain in the reserve, then they win.<br/><br/>",

On the battlefield, the actual battle takes place, while the command center forms a new area, which is constructed from hexes like the coreland. You enter this area in the usual way by jumping onto its market. Here are the actions necessary to win your battles. You can build structures, construct traps, mines and bombs, as well as hiring your farmers and citizens and train them to be soldiers. Also, it is possible to heal your soldiers after battle.<br/><br/>Die Kolonisten: Ante Portas offers the opportunity for one to three players to go up against the game or for two or four players to fight in &quot;1 against 1&quot; or &quot;2 against 2&quot; mode.  The new mechanisms also offer a much higher player interaction, as desired by many players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first expansion to the popular Table Battles is set during the Wars of the Roses. Players generally have fewer morale cubes this time around, meaning that there's less of a margin for error, and a well-timed blow can be much more decisive. There are also some formations with unusual special abilities, such as Edward IV's ability to act as a &quot;wild die&quot; for a friendly formation. As with the base game, good play involves being aware of your own strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of your opponent.<br/><br/>The eight battles in this set are:<br/><br/>First St. Albans (22 May 1455)<br/>Blore Heath (22 September 1459)<br/>Mortimer's Cross (3 February 1461)<br/>Towton (29 March 1461)<br/>Edgecote Moor (26 July 1469)<br/>Barnet (14 April 1471)<br/>Tewkesbury (4 May 1471)<br/>Stoke Field (16 June 1487)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Kickstarter Exclusive Ammo Pack brings a new set of rules, to emerge in the battlefield, and a new type of equipment!<br/><br/>The Ammo Pack is designed to emerge players in the battlefield and offer new challenges.<br/><br/>All non-basic weapons become limited ammo weapons. When a Weapon is equipped, players must add Ammo tokens to their cards. In order to use a Weapon, one token must be spent. Once all the tokens have been spent, the Weapon is inactive and can&rsquo;t be used to attack or have its effects applied.<br/><br/>But that is no motive to panic. New ammo can be acquired by reaching an Ammo Crate and performing a Search action, with no limit to the amount of players that can do the action at the same time. Ammo Crates can also be moved to adjacent spaces, in case the location is invaded and becomes too dangerous.<br/><br/>The Ammo pack brings grenades as a new kind of weapon. Grenades can be thrown to a fixed position, causing damage and different effects depending on the Grenade's type.<br/><br/>All grenades have the same range and chance to hit, but depending on the dice result the grenade may hit closer or further locations.<br/><br/>There are three types of grenades:<br/><br/>     Explosive Grenades: Deal 2 damage on the space it hits and 1 damage on all adjacent spaces.<br/>     Smoke Bomb: All Aliens in the hit and adjacent locations can&rsquo;t move, can&rsquo;t be pushed, and don&rsquo;t activate until next round.<br/>     Repellant Gas: All aliens in the hit and adjacent locations must move against the Movement Path when moving or activating inside the area. The effect lasts until the next round. <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An expansion for Nuklear Winter '68.<br/><br/>A New Age Enters World War 2<br/><br/>First, there was the white light, and then everything melted away. The war ended in 1946 with the nuclear annihilation of the Third Reich, but all was not lost; many German units took shelter in underground vaults where they continued to live, train and develop new weapons. The Reich, oblivious of the climatic, technological and political changes inflicted by more than twenty years of nuclear winter, emerged in 1968 under Himmler's guidance only to find the Fatherland, a barren land now known as the Zone, surrounded by the NATO military and populated by mutants and a mysterious army of elusive beings fighting under the sign of the Black Hand. &nbsp;<br/><br/>It is now 1969. One year has passed since the Reich began its struggle, only to have met a stiffer than anticipated resistance from the Black Hand, their war beasts, and the powerful NATO forces. The German war machine's bold impetus has been bogged down and turned into a fighting withdrawal as men, equipment, and food levels have dwindled to critically low levels. To make matters worse, a somber cloud looms over the Germans as Himmler, the Reich's ruthless commander, has been bedridden by a peculiar illness. Feeling that his time may be nearing, Himmler decides to reveal that the relic recovered from the Holterbeg monastery during the previous year's campaign may represent the vaults' only hope for survival and the answer to Germany's future.<br/><br/>Scholars of the occult-worshiping&nbsp;Arkanum Korps have discovered that the object is actually a map marker, the link to another artifact, a source of unspeakable power amongst the mortals. Mentioned in writings from the Xth century, dating from the birth of the Holy Roman Empire, it is said that the Charred Heart was responsible for the rise and downfall of the great European kingdoms - a true maker of kings. Its trail had been lost sometime during the 1800s, but there may be a glimmer of hope if, according to the Holterberg relic, it were to be found again somewhere in the East and used to restore Germania Magna. The much-feared Arkanum Korps are tasked, once again, to head out for the Magdeburg ruins, far into the unexplored part of the Zone in search of the Charred Heart artifact.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a surprising turn of events, for reasons yet unknown, the Black Hand took on the fight to NATO, deliberately or not, saving the Reich from certain doom. Despite the defeat and subsequent disappearance of their Zealot commander holding the Wunderwaffe blueprints in last year&rsquo;s showdown, seemingly endless swarms of Zealots and Ravagers poured from the crimson woods onto the unsuspecting US and Russian bases, ambushing supply columns and encircling numerous divisions in the war-torn Zone, effectively halting NATO's drive towards the retreating German army.<br/><br/>For NATO there are no options other than to keep going forward. Their political and financial strength can, and must, keep the supply chain intact. Their doctrine dictates that wherever resistance is met, more weight is to be put into the push in order to crush the obstacle; efforts have been made to increase the power, range and overall effectiveness of all their weapon systems. HADES (Heavy Assault and Demolition Expeditionary Squadron) is the newly assembled formation at the tip of NATO's thrust, closely guided by Russian GRU agents rumored to have psychic powers. Fielding machines and weapons built based on Nikola Tesla's works on the power of electricity and automatons; HADES is already trampling its way to the frontline.<br/><br/>Heart of Darkness 2nd Edition is NOT a Complete Game.<br/><br/>You Must own the Nuklear Winter 68 2nd Edition to Play Heart of Darkness 2nd Edition. &quot;<br/><br/>Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/><br/>Solitaire: 7 out of 10<br/><br/>Ages: 12+<br/><br/>Players: 1-2<br/><br/>Time: 60-120 Minutes<br/><br/>",

Each mount is bred and trained for war. Each rider is a lifelong professional warrior or an avowed knight, sworn to a baron&rsquo;s or Free City&rsquo;s service until the rider&rsquo;s final breath. Rider and mount work together on the battlefield in perfect synergy, charging into combat and crushing the enemy in a wave of steel.<br/><br/>With the Oathsworn Cavalry Unit Expansion, you gain four new Oathsworn Cavalry figures&mdash;enough to field a two-tray unit or increase the size of another unit. These fearsome knights are sworn to fight for the Daqan Lords and protect the realm, and they are first introduced in the Runewars Core Set. This unit expansion is a perfect way to quickly increase your cavalry and unlock new options with five new upgrade cards for any army.<br/><br/>",

This design is also a thoughtful nod to the game's designer, Nick Sibicky, who is an avid Go player.<br/><br/>This card may be added to the crafting card deck before playing.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT NOTE: This card was included in the base game, even though that was not the original intention. It bumped out Magic Wand (#52) in the 1st printing of the base game (Magic Wand appears in all subsequent editions of the base game). The promo card handed out at Unpub convention can be identified by the Unpub convention logo in the lower right hand corner. In the base game, that logo is missing.<br/><br/>",

The Cult Cards are meant to be supplemental powers for your Cults during the game.<br/><br/>During set-up, all players must agree to use the Cult Cards. Beginning with the player who will take the last turn and proceeding in reverse turn order, each player will choose whether to use the Cult Card associated with their particular Elder God or choose one of the general, unaffiliated Cult Cards. During the game, players may activate their Cult abilities at any appropriate time as stated on the card. This ability does not have to be activated by The Ceremony like an Elder God&rsquo;s Dark Gift.<br/><br/>[...] We also recommend that you do not include Cult Cards or the Beasts From Beyond expansion in your first games of Fate of the Elder Gods. There are plenty of awesome things to do and explore in just the base game. Once you all know the ropes, you&rsquo;ll be ready to tackle the extra challenges!<br/><br/>",

Technical Readout: 3058 also offers a host of tanks, hovercraft, and other armored vehicles upgraded with the latest weapons and equipment.&quot;<br/><br/>Although this might appear similar to the Classic BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, the 3058 Upgrade is a companion book, not a replacement. This original book covers new Mechs and vehicles generated between 3056 and 3058; the 3058 Upgrade expands the detail on these mechs up to 3070, adds personality entries, many new Mechs, new sections on Battle Armour and generally provides new material for collectors and gamers. This entry doesn't create a precedent, as BGG already has entries for the Technical Readout: 3050 and the 3050 Upgrade, which are the same system of FASA original Tech Readout with expanded, upgraded companion volume issued as an Upgrade by Fanpro later.<br/><br/>",

Gallant dragonslayers armed with swords?&rdquo;<br/>    &ndash;George R.R. Martin, A Feast for Crows<br/><br/>A Hidden Agenda is the sixth and final Chapter Pack in the Kingsroad cycle for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game. Schemes, secrets, and mysteries pervade its sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards), drawing the Kingsroad cycle to its climactic conclusion. As it grants players new means to make their final bids for the Iron Throne in a Westeros forever scarred by the War of the Five Kings, A Hidden Agenda asks the question, &ldquo;Who is truly pulling the strings?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Are the Lords of the Great Houses the powers to watch? Should the Lords be less concerned with each other and more concerned with Daenerys Targaryen and her three growing dragons? Or are the kingdoms&rsquo; advisors the ones who are secretly pulling the strings? All the previous Chapter Packs in the Kingsroad cycle have introduced new cards and tactics to blend into formerly established mechanics. Appropriately, A Hidden Agenda concludes with a wide sampling of these mechanics: the Bannerman trait, Shadows, cards at your command, decks without agendas, and the Maester trait. Each offers a different path to power, but only one House can sit the Iron Throne!<br/><br/>",

The new line profiles famous regions of Germany during the Middle Ages, when Celts, Romans, and Germans intermingled.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Bayern celebrates the state of Bavaria, home to Regensburg, Munich and Passau. Like Die Siedler von N&uuml;rnberg and the other historical expansions, it features a fixed map board. The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. &quot;Harbors&quot; ring the playing field.<br/><br/>The rules of Bavaria cleave closely to those of standard Catan, with a few departures to keep things interesting. Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.<br/><br/>Part of the Catan series.<br/><br/>",

When added to the ferry, a frog can take a value of 1 to 5 based on the player&rsquo;s choice. The only condition is that this move allows for a ferry to leave. Otherwise, the value is 1.<br/><br/>CROCODILE: If you choose to play the crocodile , you must remove from your game the donkeys.<br/><br/>Crocodile Tears: The player who plays a crocodile must move back two squares on the scoring track. It is not possible to have a negative score.<br/><br/>The crocodile&rsquo;s teeth: When the crocodile is added to the ferry, the crocodile frightens another animal. Thus, the first animal to be placed on the ferry flees... Choose an opponent who must add it to their hand. It is only then that the weight limit in the ark is verified.<br/><br/>ROOMATES ON THE ARK: in the Ark, it is impossible to place twice the same animal, whether male or female.<br/><br/>",

Three to eight players take over such roles as the Mad Scientist, the Space Pirate Captain, the Phone Company, or a mystery Alien. Because the format is four way blind, and the players are uncertain of each other's motives, the fog of war is a formidable obstacle in this new gaming genre.<br/><br/>The action takes place on a space warehouse at the edge of an un-navigable region of the Galaxy known as the Coal Sack. The mad scientist in charge of the facility is trying to sell the Artifact, an alien navigational buoy, to  space pirates. The scientist wins if he completes the deal while keeping his illegal activities secret from the Phone Company, who has a couple of agents on board the station somewhere.<br/><br/>Victory for the Phone Company depends upon who their secret employers are. His agents may be just innocent employees here to fix the phone lines, they may be working for a rival Museum, or they may work for the Government or private agencies.<br/><br/>The Pirate Captain's motives are more transparent; he needs to get the Artifact by trade, artifice, or force. Even with his overwhelming firepower, this is not easy. One of his men may be a government informant. The Artifact may not be all it seems. Loss of contact with his men may mean they have turned against him, or alien bugs have laid eggs on their disemboweled remains. A clank outside may signal imminent explosive decompression, or just a sailmaker robot on the outside hull doing its job.<br/><br/>Aliens may or may not be on board; their nature is unknown. The ship's computer may or may not be a sentient character working with its own victory conditions. One's partner may be a trusted companion or a shapeshifting fiend in disguise. The ship's security system, robots, and self-destruct countdown may be puppets for unknown agencies.<br/><br/>The Artifact is a gripping drama, full of surprises and mayhem. No two games are alike, full of sabotage, sneak suits, bluster, kamikaze aliens, EMP and plasma guns, booby traps, hacking, and the prospect of the space station being blown up bit by bit by pirate cannon. The action never falters until the last lifeboat is away, the final alias revealed, and the last storeroom explored.<br/><br/>",

Battlefields introduces two new mechanics: terrain and weather.<br/><br/>Terrain cards may be played before battle to augment your battle card and affect the outcome. Because terrain is played before battle but the effects don't happen until later, other players may guess your intention and act accordingly. Alternatively, terrain may be used as a feint to trick your opponents before you surprise them with an unexpected battle card.<br/><br/>Weather cards are shuffled into the land deck at the start of the game. When a weather card is drawn, its effect continues until a new weather is drawn to replace it. Weather will affect the battles in unpredictable ways, forcing you to adapt your strategy to what the battlefield is giving you. Will you charge your troops through the snow to capture a valuable bridge? Will you send your troops to battle during a severe drought? It is up to you to decide if the risk is worth the reward.<br/><br/>",

They are packed in clear plastic, with a cover/proof of purchase card (40 of the proof of purchase cards can be sent in for a free Supergerm T-shirt).<br/><br/>The new cards are mostly Secrets (20) and Specials (19), with three new sizes of Propaganda, four new sizes of Warhead, and one new Delivery System.<br/><br/>To incorporate this expansion into an existing Nuclear War/Escalation/Proliferation deck while preserving the existing balance of card types and strengths requires using a bunch of the new Propaganda and Warhead cards; to preserve the proportion of delivery systems, you either have to use a lot of the Delta Clipper or scavenge some extra &quot;regular&quot; delivery systems (perhaps a use for the ads/jokers from Nuclear War, or some of the blanks available from Flying Buffalo).<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Nuclear War<br/><br/><br/>Microbadge<br/><br/> Buy It<br/><br/>",

Cunning Merchants buy, exchange, and sell goods to build wealth. When visiting Nomad Camps and after offering gifts for their hosts&rsquo; hospitality, Merchants trade for the goods they desire. When visiting Oases, they may purchase random goods. Ultimately, these Merchants travel to the bazaars in Cities such as Samarkand or Isfahan to sell the goods they have acquired. Merchants must plan which desert paths to use to travel efficiently between the Nomad Camps, Oases, and Cities so they can earn the quickest (and greatest) profit!<br/><br/>In Bazaar, players attempt to gain the right combination of colored cubes through skillful trading to purchase the wares displayed in the Bazaar. Values of the various wares are determined by the number of cubes the purchaser has left over following the transaction. Trading is governed by the current rates posted at the Exchange. When the wares from two stalls have been completely sold, the Bazaar is closed, and the game ends. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

They are shuffled into the Woods deck and when they come up in your hand they are placed in the center of the table. You draw a card to replace it in your hand, just like wolves in 2P. They then affect all players for the rest of the game because no one player can own a Legend.<br/><br/>MOTHER NATURE CARDS - These cards are drafted and played into a players meadow during the plant and populate phase.

New dangers await along new stretches of river. Hungry Grizzly Bears await your arrival while the lure of the fishermen may get you hooked!<br/><br/>The Salmon Run Fishermen Expansion contains 4 new river boards (2 double-sided boards); a custom-made die; 3 new Grizzly Bear Cards; and adds all the components needed to support a 5th player!<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL RULES<br/><br/>Fishermen Hex:<br/>The Fishermen hex is a new obstacle on the river. A salmon may move freely onto the Fishermen Hex. Upon entering the hex marked with a &quot;hook&quot;, the player must roll the die. On an even roll there is no effect. On an odd numbered roll stand the salmon pawn on its tail to show that it is &quot;hooked&quot;. A hooked salmon may not move until it plays two Swim cards to free itself.<br/>No movement results from playing these cards.<br/>Both Swim cards must be played on the same turn.<br/>This counts as 2 card plays for the turn.<br/>A hooked salmon may still play non-swim cards normally.<br/>A hooked salmon is unaffected by the current.<br/>If a current moves a salmon into the fishermen hex, that salmon must roll to see if it is hooked.<br/>Bears may move freely to or from the Fishermen hex and are unaffected by it.<br/><br/>Grizzly Bear:<br/>The Grizzly Bear is considered a Bear card and is used to move the same bear tokens as the original Bear card. The Grizzly Bear does not add fatigue but instead makes players discard two cards from their hand randomly.<br/><br/>",

(Includes the Halfling and Ranger Heroes from the Side Quest expansion.)<br/>2 Legendary dice<br/>An old gaming legend goes that for every Hero, there is a special set of weapons, made especially for their Class, to empower them and bring their natural abilities to the fullest potential. These weapons were said to be long lost, but what do you know, we found them! Buried under giant piles of snacks and dirty coffee mugs, in the darkest corner of the development room in CMON, we have discovered: Legendary Weapons and Armor!<br/><br/>This pack brings to all Classes 4 equipment cards each, bringing them new special powers, in addition to their already pretty cool unique Hero powers. Each Hero gets the right to claim one of their Legendary items once they achieve certain specific levels.<br/><br/>To complete the Legendary Weapons and Armor pack is the Legendary Dice! The Legendary Dice contain all the Munchkin Dungeon symbols you know and love&hellip; sword, shield, the dreadful blank, etc. Except that these dice are bigger. And fancier. AND contain a very special symbol, a (dare we say) Legendary icon. For each Legendary Loot a Hero has, they get the right to roll 1 Legendary die. If they&rsquo;re lucky and manage to roll a Legendary icon, they will activate a super-SUPER special power on their Loot! It's going to be legendary!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the first expansion for Quest: Zeit der Helden, the heroes experience a completely new adventure against a dark cult that holds the land in its grasp.<br/><br/>In Quest: Zeit der Helden - Der dunkle Kult, four new heroes are ready for the adventure, with two of them solving problems in a completely new way &ndash; through cunning and negotiation. Together with the new game mechanism &quot;Dialog&quot;, Quest: Zeit der Helden now offers a much deeper gaming experience. Even the heroes' antagonist, the Questmaster, has four new archenemies at his disposal &ndash; but they all are dwarfed by the gigantic dragon entering the battlefield.<br/><br/>With each adventure, the strength and power of the heroes grow. Players can even use their heroes from Quest: Zeit der Helden - Angriff der Orks and continue their journey. (Quest: Zeit der Helden - Angriff der Orks is required to play Quest: Zeit der Helden - Der dunkle Kult.)<br/><br/>German description on pegasus.de:<br/>Der Kult von Kronmar herrscht seit 1.000 Jahren mit eiserner Faust. Gegr&uuml;ndet als Bollwerk gegen die Heerscharen der H&ouml;lle, ist der Kult heute ein Sinnbild f&uuml;r Unterdr&uuml;ckung und Sklaverei. Doch noch immer lauern die D&auml;monen im Dunkel und zerren an ihren stetig schw&auml;cher werdenden Fesseln. Zeit, dass mutige M&auml;nner und Frauen sich erheben und endlich die Tyrannei beenden.<br/><br/>Abenteuer:<br/>Die tote Stadt, Larissas Schicksal, Freund und Feind, Brennender Fels<br/><br/>Translation:<br/>For a thousand years the Cult of Kronmar ruled with an iron fist. Established as a bastion against the hordes of hell it is now a symbol for oppression and slavery. But the demons still lurk in the darkness and fight against their ever-weakening chains. It is time - time for brave men and women to rise up and end the tyranny.<br/><br/>Contains 4 adventures: The dead city, Larissas destiny, friend and enemy, burning stone<br/><br/>",

Such occurrences are not uncommon in the Warhammer world. However, not all important battles take places between two massive armies clashing over a sweeping battlefield. Some of the most crucial skirmishes are fought on an entirely different scale, one that may never be recorded in history, but are no less meaningful in the grand scheme of things.&quot;<br/><br/>For some reason Warhammer Skirmish was never released outside of the USA and Canada.<br/><br/>",

They have the ability to command their robotic creations to do their bidding and will not hesitate to do so.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, add the Inventor tiles to the bag of Employee tiles.<br/><br/>If you draw an Inventor tile when setting up for a new round, place it along with the other Employee tiles in one of the spaces of the 9. EMPLOYEES location. Immediately place the Robot Employee under the Inventor tile, removing it from the Temp Employee location, which is now unavailable. This still happens even if an event has made the Temp Employee unavailable. If the second Inventor is drawn in the same round, return its tile to the cloth bag and draw another Employee tile.<br/><br/>During the 3. PLANNING phase, a player can reserve an Inventor Employee just like any other, and claim it during the 4. OPERATIONS phase. When claimed, the player also takes the Robot tile and may keep it until the end of the round, as the normal rules allow. This may only happen once per Inventor tile.<br/><br/>When resolving 13. PRODUCTION, an Inventor may be used to fulfill a necessary Engineer position in a Company card.<br/><br/>Just like with other Engineers, an Inventor may also be used as a bonus Engineer Employee, adding +1 to any modifier that a Company card may have.<br/><br/>They were part of the Diesel Demolition Derby Kickstarter campaign as promotional cards (<a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/diesel-demolition-derby?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/diesel-de...</a>).<br/><br/>",

Ninjaclans strike in sudden death operations. The steelfan as a new battletactic merges all of the ancient knowledge of fieldcommanders in one symbol. It will drive your opponents into despair. There are enough components included to add even a sixth player to your gaming group. So bow deep and ready yourself to survive the intrigues in the inner circle of the daymios on their way seeking the ultimate power for their clan.<br/><br/>For the experienced Battlelord are new weapons included. Throwing stars and bows are to be mastered. New rolecards add many new different options to the players. Markers especially in use for the daymio give him the possibility to play specials (hostages, family artefacts, ect.) on certain occasions.<br/><br/>New landtiles with structures allow players to increase the value of their landscapes and to purchase additional abilities. Possible bonuses for provinces can be used to improve their power in defence and put some more reputation to your clan.<br/><br/>To use the expansion you need the components from the corebox and the knowledge of the basicrules. All additions in the expansion are for optional use and should be brought into play step by step into your basic game of bushido. For the experienced gamer the most satisfactory result will be probably a bushidosession with all expansions included.<br/><br/>We have provided an extensive overview on the last pages of these rules, which allow players to see all of the new rules implemented with the corerules.<br/><br/>Please note: the term Samuraihonour was swapped for Warriorhonour! And now have fun to discover Tanin - the Stranger, the first expansion to Bushido.<br/><br/>",

Martin, A Storm of Swords<br/><br/>After two cycles of Chapter Packs that carried A Game of Thrones players far from the shores of Westeros, The Banners Gather and the &quot;Kingsroad&quot; cycle mark a return to the Seven Kingdoms, its Great Houses, their lords, their banners, and their traditional strengths. This is a return to both the game's classic fantasy themes and to several of its established mechanisms. In this Chapter Pack's sixty new cards (three copies each of twenty individual cards), the Lannisters flaunt their wealth, the Greyjoys seize control of rival locations, and the Targaryens march forward with their attachments and Dragons. Likewise, the Baratheons, Starks, and Martells gain new Strongholds, Tactics, and tricks.<br/><br/>Of course, no House is strong when cut off from its supporters, and The Banners Gather takes a look at the many Bannerman characters who swear their fealty and service to their liege lords. Players will find several new characters with the Bannerman trait, all of whom bring powerful new abilities to their Houses and enable new synergies with the game's older Bannerman cards.<br/><br/>",

It also marks a return to some of the prominent themes and mechanisms that have already been developed in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game.<br/><br/>Seasons in Westeros can last for years, Thus, it's only natural that they can drastically reshape the lives of those they impact, and the sixty new cards in Fire and Ice (three copies each of twenty different cards) draw new focus to the game's Summer and Winter mechanisms. They also add a number of intriguing new twists. Not only will you find new characters and locations to grant your deck and House a powerful boost in one season or the other, you'll find two new Seasons agendas that will lead to all-new deck types. These agendas reward decks that combine many season-based effects, and they gain support from other cards in Fire and Ice that help players pull those season-based effects to the forefront, ensuring that the clash between Summer and Winter remains as vital within the game as it is within the Seven Kingdoms.<br/><br/>",

Like many players, I felt the 1-3 player experience felt like tacked on, where each player just plays the role of 2 or more people.<br/><br/>To rectify this situation, I made a new board designed for a 1-3 player experience (similar to the idea of using a different board for smaller games in Small World). I dubbed the ship Little Duckling. Simply print and mount the board (on the back of the Sitting Duck if you really like it).<br/><br/>The rules (with examples and clear diagrams) and a complete set of missions (from tutorials through simulations to missions) are included in the Little Duckling handbook.<br/><br/>This has been play tested and I hope produces a balanced and fun 1-3 player experience for you as well.<br/><br/>Released in the File Section of Space Alert, this expansion has had its graphics updated by paulmond.<br/><br/>",

Packing with forty professionally printed, and glaringly-glossy pages (including cover) and filled with World at War wisdom, the World at War: Gamer's Guide is on pre-order. You'll find a preview of the upcoming World at War boxed game, World at War: Blood and Bridges. Two new scenarios, Clearing Hell's Highway, and Poor Bloody Infantry.  Two battle reports with semi-fictionalized accounts recounts of WaW scenarios (Some of you call these after action reports). A ten page article examining strategy in the World at War series and the specific tactics needed to win all six Eisenbach Gap scenarios.  Even variants for night fighting, and a design your own scenarios &quot;how to&quot; article. And much more... including a unit-by-unit analysis of the platoons of Eisenbach Gap...<br/><br/>World at War has been a pleasant, if mild, surprise for Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing. I designed the game because I wanted to play it. Yes, in the back of my mind, I felt that there might be a market for something depicting the war that never happened, but primarily I created the game because it interests me.<br/><br/>In ten years of writing and designing, that&rsquo;s the only thing I&rsquo;ve found that works. I&rsquo;ve designed and written on spec, and gave those pieces my best shot, but it seems that the games, the writing, that gets my juices flowing are the things other people also enjoy.<br/><br/>I absolutely love playing World at War. I like the combat system, am intrigued by the era, and fascinated by the idea of a series of games that link together to tell a story. So, I&rsquo;m happy that other people enjoy it too.<br/><br/>I also hope that this guide enhances your enjoyment. We have strived to make a guide that is visually appealing, interesting, and diversified. Inside you&rsquo;ll find articles on strategy, the percentages of rolling dice in World at War, battle reports (or after action reports as some of you prefer), and unit analysis. What you won&rsquo;t find are dry as dust articles on the actual forces that lined the West German border or mind-numbing diatribes on Soviet Doctrine. Why? Because that stuff just doesn&rsquo;t interest me.<br/><br/>There are lots of tables comparing the strength and weakness of an M1 Abrams platoon and a T-72 platoon in the World at War system. And we go through the platoons of Eisenbach Gap, unit-by-unit, and even provide a walk through for winning Blind Sided (a Death of the 1st Panzer scenario.)<br/><br/>All this in a beautifully laid out, two-color 40-page glossy magazine. Yeah, this one's printed. You can hold it in your hands.<br/><br/>Not a stand-alone game.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/><br/>    World at War: Eisenbach Gap<br/>    World at War: Death of the 1st Panzer<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lying forgotten in the Desert of Bones, the ruins of the spectacular ancient city Shadespire are brimming with untold riches and power, ripe for the taking. Though it is now a mere skeleton after being put to the torch by Nagash, the city's treasures remain, a morbid hint at the splendour that existed before Shadespire&rsquo;s soul was torn away&hellip;<br/><br/>Take command of a small warband of warriors and put your skill, wit and determination to the test with Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Skirmish: a book containing the information and rules needed to fight Skirmish battles &ndash; including a hard-fought campaign amidst the ruins of Shadespire! Assemble a small warband of single models and take to the gaming table, building renown and adding to your warband with every glorious victory.<br/><br/>Within this 40-page softback book, you&rsquo;ll find:<br/><br/>Skirmish Rules<br/><br/>- A set of simple modifications for the core rules of Warhammer Age of Sigmar that introduce skirmish battles &ndash; small-scale, intense fights between anything from a trio of models to a marauding band of fifteen models and upwards;<br/>- Details of battling in skirmish formation &ndash; models fight as individuals, rather than groups, meaning each model is treated as a single unit. This alters the way certain effects and abilities work in a subtle way, and emphasises fast, aggressive, tactical gameplay;<br/>- The General: each player chooses a general from the Heroes in their warband, who can use a command ability, artefact of power, and three new wizard spells from the tables supplied in the Skirmish rules;<br/>- Battleshock: again, tweaked from the core Warhammer Age of Sigmar rules to encourage fast, brutal gaming, Battleshock can turn the tide of war in a single dice roll &ndash; you better hope your general is stoic in the face of slaughter!<br/>- All-new command abilities, artefacts of power and mysterious terrain rules;<br/>- Clarification regarding summoning and generation of extra attacks and hit rolls in Skirmish games.<br/><br/>The Shadespire Campaign<br/><br/>Included in the book is a linear narrative campaign, pitting two - or with some judicious tweaking, more &ndash; players against each other in a series of brutal skirmishes as your warbands fight bitterly over the incredible treasures of Shadespire. This campaign comprises six Battleplans representing a story from the murky dawn of your warbands&rsquo; first day on the outskirts of Shadespire, through to the climactic battle that decides the outcome of the whole campaign.<br/><br/>Between games, your warbands can earn and spend renown &ndash; the more renown earned, the more glory-seekers will join your general on his quest for treasure &ndash; and discover Rewards of Battle: charms, glyphs and relics that enhance the abilities of your warband in new and interesting ways.<br/><br/>Skirmish Matched Play<br/><br/>The true test of a general&rsquo;s mettle is the meeting of equally-matched warbands, where tactics and strategy outweigh sheer numbers when deciding how the battle ends. This book contains a guide to putting together your own Matched Play Skirmish battles, with included points values allowing you to assemble matched warbands from models representing each of the four Grand Alliances. Any Battleplan from the General&rsquo;s Handbook can be used in a Skirmish Matched Play game.<br/><br/>Please note, you&rsquo;ll need a copy of the Warhammer Age of Sigmar core rules (available as a free download) to use this book.<br/><br/>",

These were packaged together and shipped separate from the base game.<br/><br/>Aquatic expansion<br/><br/>The aquatic expansion (3 cards) lets you fill that lake! The aquatic expansion has fixed numbers for the dinosaurs which are randomised at the beginning of each game. Each card dictates which dice spread is required to build a certain dinosaurs, so some cards may only allow one type of dinosaur to be built with one type of value on the dice, while other cards will allow an even spread of dice for all dinosaurs.<br/><br/>These dinosaurs are scored using a set collection mechanic, with the same, and different dinosaurs scoring (almost) exponentially.<br/><br/>Aviary expansions<br/><br/>Choose from a wide selection of awkward and fixed shapes that you will play with each game. Flying dinosaurs breed, so place them early enough that they can be filled!<br/><br/>Automa deck for solo players<br/><br/>The 1p Automa lets you play solitaire in a brand new way, making some binary decisions for an AI that competes with you for visitors and points.<br/><br/>You will play against a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;hard&quot; automa. The automa has it's own deck with 16 double use cards. 12 can be used with the core game, while 4 can be added if used in conjunction with the aviary and aquatic expansions. The automa also uses an extra die so that each round you will be rolling 4 dice, allocating one to the automa, and the final 3 to yourself.<br/><br/>The automa will have one card drawn from the automa deck at the beginning of each turn. The card will be double use, with each side giving instructions of what the automa would do (and therefore score), if you choose that side. The side you choose will be dependent on the die you allocate to the automa - hence starving yourself of a particular value, and potentially gifting the automa valuable points if allocated without careful consideration<br/><br/>The automa scores by using a set collection mechanic of units written on the cards themselves such as special buildings, dinosaurs and in hard mode, the security and generators. The trick is to allocate a die to the automa with careful consideration!<br/><br/>",
