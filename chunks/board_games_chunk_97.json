In this game you have to choose between english army or scottish army. The two players play face to face and both players have the same number of troops: 7 soldiers of infantry, 2 archers, 2 horse knight riders and the King. There are also, reserve forces. Each army has their own characteristics. In this case, the English have more soldiers (as in the real battle) but the Scottish infantry is stronger, so there is a balance. Careful, try not to lose the King. If your King dies you don't lose automatically the match,but you will lose some soldiers of infantry.<br/>The aim of the game is to destroy the enemy army and win the battle for freedom.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to have least points, and to do that you must play cards from you hand.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>WTF (Whiskey Table Friends) is a card game, played over three rounds, in which players try to avoid getting penalty points. <br/>Each round all cards are distributed to the players. The cards represent a value between 3 and 30. Of each type of cards there are as many cards as 60 divided by the value of the cardtype: e.g. 20 cards of value &quot;3&quot;, 2 cards of value &quot;30&quot;.<br/>In his turn, the starting player plays as many cards (min.1) of the same value as he wishes open on the table. <br/>The next player in turn has the choice: a/ follow = play as many cards (min.1) of the same value as played, and pass this on to the next player; <br/>or b/ counter = play as many cards (min.1) of a different value so that the total amount of the cards is higher than the total amount of the cards played by the starting player. <br/>If the player can't do neither option a nor b, then he has to take all cards as penalty points.<br/>Of course there are some Joker-cards, which allow the players to avoid taking the penalty points. Some examples are: change the direction of play; take a card from the discard pile, take half of the penalty cards and move the rest on to the next player, ...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Back Alley is a variation of bridge, played with a standard deck of 52 cards including jokers.  One joker should be marked 'high' and the other joker 'low'.<br/><br/>In the first round, one card is dealt to each of the four players. In the next round, two cards are dealt to each player, then three, four, etc. all the way up to 13 cards. Then 13 cards are dealt again and you make your way back down to 1.<br/><br/>In each round, remaining cards are set to the side and the topmost card is turned over to reveal the trump suit. After the trump is set, players look at their hand and bid on how many tricks they think they can take. Bidding continues around the table in a clockwise direction until all players have bid. If a player thinks they can take all the tricks, they can board which is worth 13 points. The next player can double-board if they wish, which would be worth 24 points.<br/><br/>Player with the highest bid leads the first trick. All other players must follow suit if possible, or play a trump if unable to follow suit. The highest card, or highest trump cards, wins the trick. The player who won the trick leads the next card and play continues around the table until all players are out of cards.<br/><br/>If you meet your bid, you score three points for each trick bid and taken, plus one point for tricks greater than the bid. If the bid isn't met, it's minus one point for each trick missed. If a player boards and makes it, they score 13 points. If they board and don't get all the tricks, they get -13 points.<br/><br/>At the end of 26 hands, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

(Boys and girls involved in Lewd Enterprises) Henchmen are stealing every romantic and symbolic landmark, building, and natural resource they can grab. The only way to stop Sancarlos and his crew is to get the Chef and the ACNE detectives on the case to cook up a plan to catch them. Join the ACNE detectives and start returning the stolen loot by catching Sancarlos and his Henchmen. To win, be the detective to retrieve the most valuable stolen treasures! This game is not related to any other thieves who travel the world and is designed as a parody.<br/><br/>One player serves as the game's moderator, called The Chef, unless only two people are playing. Players choose one of six ACNE Detective profiles. Players create eight columns of cards by placing one of the eight B.I.L.E. Henchmen at the top of the grid, with four Stolen Location cards under him or her. Extra Location Cards are set aside and not used. After The Chef reads the character background aloud for each of the Henchmen, the Detectives, in turn, pick an Evidence card, which will ask for one of the following: Location, Connection to Jefferson Sancarlos, which B.I.L.E Henchman stole a particular location, and whose ACNE Detective Territory the Location is in. That player then selects one of the Location cards on the bottom row of the grid, and attempts to identify the Evidence point requested for that Location. Each Location card has a number of prison years on the back. If a player guesses the correct answer, he/she keeps the card and notes the prison years collected. Detectives want the highest number of prison years possible, to put Sancarlos' Henchmen away for that many years.<br/><br/>When all four Location cards under a Henchman have been collected, the player taking the last location captures that Henchmen. The game ends when the first player captures his/her third B.I.L.E. Henchman or when all Henchmen have been captured. Each player adds up his/her prison years. For each Henchman captured, the player earns a bonus of 50 prison years. The ACNE Detective with the most total points (prison years) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is based on XII, a Belgian graphic novel about an amnesiac who seeks to discover his past. This game is illustrated by drawings from the graphic novel.<br/><br/>In this card game, one player takes over the role of XIII every turn of the game. Other players receive secret roles based on the major characters of the book. Those secret roles can be allies or enemies of XIII. The player playing XIII will reveal a mission with a number. At their turn, players will play action cards with a positive or negative value. The player who reach the mission number wins the mission and XIII draws the next mission card. A round ends when the card pile empties. Each player then scores as many points as he succeeded missions. If XIII has an ally, they both share their points and the next player around the player takes on the role of XIII. The player with the most points at the end of the last round wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The new edition celebrates Australia&rsquo;s quirky deviations from the English language, adding homegrown flavour with an all-Aussie slang glossary featuring our localised lingo. Mattel took to social media with its mate Jetstar in 2016 to crowd source the best slang words from across the country for potential inclusion into the final glossary. More than 20,000 submissions via the Jetstar Facebook page were put forward, with words such as &lsquo;arvo&rsquo;, &lsquo;crikey&rsquo;, &lsquo;biffo&rsquo;, &lsquo;shonky&rsquo; and &lsquo;cozzie&rsquo; forming the official word glossary.<br/><br/>A fair-dinkum twist on the classic word game, Aussie Scrabble seperates the legends from the drongos with new gameplay and a Lingo List, native to the land down under.

        "description": "The expansion's Player vs Player Scenario recreates Rick and Shane's fight to the death in the classic episode &quot;Better Angels.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Kickstarter summary page:<br/><br/>In the &ldquo;Better Angels&rdquo; Scenario, Rick and Shane start out on opposite sides of a typical 2x2 board, which includes the special Misty Forest Tile. Shane begins the game wounded, with 2 Survivor Cards in his discard pile and a hand of only 3 cards. However, Shane is hiding something from Rick: his Shotgun! The Shotgun Survivor Card is set aside and the player controlling Shane has a Map Card that only he or she can look at. If Shane ever gets to the secret Space indicated on the Map Card, he gets to add the Shotgun directly to his hand, swinging the odds wildly in his favor.<br/><br/>But Rick has some advantages of his own in this one-on-one battle to the death! Rick starts the Scenario with more health and is considered the Leader during the entire Scenario (which may be one of the reasons Shane has such a problem with him!). Just like any regular Scenario of THE WALKING DEAD: NO SANCTUARY, the Leaders draws 2 Event Cards, choosing 1 card to become the Active Event and discarding the other card, causing a penalty for all players. The difference when playing PvP is that a character who is Defiant to the Approach set by the Active Event only hurts his own cause, since he is the only one who earns the resulting Stress.<br/><br/>The Scenario ends when either Rick or Shane is killed by his opponent. However, since this is the world of The Walking Dead, when Shane is &ldquo;killed&rdquo; he rises again as a Walker one turn later, with the regular Shane figure replaced by the Walker Shane figure. The player controlling Shane will also have control of all the other Walkers on the board. Rick will need to put down his former friend a second time to win!<br/><br/>",

Of course, Death is always around, trying to sneak a taste.<br/><br/>Cake or Death is a quick, light game where players collect various types of cake while trying to avoid Death. Slices of cake count against a player in the final scoring, unless a player has the most of a specific type. Collect the most slices of any particular cake, and it won't count against you. Unfortunately, Death is never welcome, and it's worth two slices of cake each time it shows up.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws a hand of cards, depicting various types of cake or Death. A player may secretly discard one and then must display one remaining card face up. The remaining cards remain hidden. The other players then name a type of cake and take all cards depicting the named type (possibly the one displayed face up), adding them to their permanent collection. However, if the player has no cake of the named type, then Death may show up instead.<br/><br/>The game ends when the players run through the entire deck. The player with the most slices of any particular type of cake discards all cards of that type. Death always sticks around. Every remaining slice of cake adds one to your final score, while each Death counts as two. The player with the lowest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Also included is the &quot;true and fascinating history of the Monopoly game.&quot;<br/><br/>The Original, Long-suppressed monopoly game:<br/>This is the genuine Atlantic City monopoly game, from which Monopoly was largely copied, and which was studiously ignored by the producers of Monopoly for forty years. Its existence was brought to light dramatically in a recent lawsuit by the makers of the Anti-Monopoly game. This historic Atlantic City game was created in 1930 by Quaker teachers as an improvement of an already exiting folkgame, which was also called monopoly. The Atlantic City folks, who until now have never gotten credit for inventing the world's most popular board game, played on il cloth board of the same kind supplied in our game- which can be rolled up, and presto, you have travel monopoly. Rid the time warp into the past and play on almost the same type of game equipment created by the real inventors of Monopoly.<br/><br/>Your Original monopoly game:<br/>The forerunner monopoly folkgame had been played in Philadelphia, New York, Boston, and many other American cities since about 1910. The folkgamers enjoyed putting their won street, utility, a d railroad names on their game. We invite you to follow in their footsteps with the second board in our game equipment and the second set of black and white title cards. Pick the names which are most meaningful for you and mark them on your equipment, using either wipeoff or permanent black soft tip markers - or even crayons.

In the first game, you lay out 18 cards on the table so that their black-and-white images and their names (in English and Morse code) are visible on them. After downloading the game app to your phone, one player is chosen as the parent, who then chooses a card and taps out the Morse code repeatedly on the phone app. Whichever child, a term that encompasses everyone else, touches the right card first claims that card and becomes the parent for the next round. If a child touches the wrong card, they're out for the round.<br/><br/>When only five cards remain on the table, the game ends, then players flip over the cards to reveal their colors, and the app then assigns a point value (1-3) to each of the three colors. Players then tally their scores, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>In the other game, you lay out the 18 cards color-side up. Two Morse code player aides are placed on the table as well. The current parent secretly chooses one of the cards, then taps out the Morse code of a word related to that card; for a card depicting the sun, the parent might tap out the Morse code for &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;summer&quot;, &quot;heat&quot;, or another word that seems appropriate. Once again, whoever touches the right card first claims it and becomes the new parent.<br/><br/>",

Technologies such as tanks and combat airplanes razed the european landscape while chemical weapons were unleashed upon the youth that was fighting for their countries. In October 1918, the forces of the alliance and the entente reached a stalemate at the Argonne Forest, when a mysterious mist appeared. A whole american battalion immediately disappeared, it expanded across the Argonne line and consumed most of the american offensive. Attempts to explore the mist, dubbed the Miasma in search for survivors failed and rescuers either disappeared or were driven insane by what they witnessed within. In response to this, an international secret agency known as the Phalanx initiative was formed, with the purpose to assess the threat of Miasma and contain it before it consumes all of the Wounded Earth.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Corporate Times is a financially themed strategic game. The game mechanics are a combination of worker placement and resource management, with a high level of player agency and involvement.   The game gives a unique, behind-the-scenes glimpse of the business world that affects us all by revealing the powers that drive the markets and the whole economy. A dominant element of the business world is buying and selling stocks and assets, but the politic forces, the media and the banks will make this world much more challenging to navigate.<br/><br/>Corporate Times provides a deep yet easy-to-understand, entertaining insight of the modern business world and the powers which control it: politics, the media, and the banks. The media controls the news and decides on the agenda, including what to promote and what to hide from the public. Politics can strengthen the influence of your corporation on the economy. The Banks oversee the monetary flow and transactions and controlling them allows better funding options. Each player builds his/her own corporation, navigating through the economy&rsquo;s rules, and dealing with the 3 forces. The players need to use their assets, money and influence for one goal &ndash; to take over the economy.<br/><br/>Your purpose is to dominate the nation's economy by accumulating 20 influence points. The board game simulates the economy of the state, divided into 11 different markets. Each market is constructed of a few market shares, open for investments by the players&rsquo; corporation. The participants set up a mega corporation that will attempt to dominate the state economy. Points are accumulated by the purchase of market shares and the use of news cards. Every market share has a value in influence points and income and can be purchased in cash by a bank loan, in a bidding war or by striking a deal between players. News cards are opened at the beginning of every turn and influence the game strategy.<br/><br/>The income and the influence points score of each player are marked on score tracks on the game board. After the purchase of a market share, the player will advance on these tracks according to the income and influence points attributed to the specific share. The news cards also have direct influence on the income and might inforce you to change your immediate investment plans and long-term strategy.<br/><br/>",

The other player, the code breaker, makes a series of guesses.

        "description": "Hello, American citizen! Do you have what it takes to achieve the American Dream during America's Golden Age?<br/><br/>A newfound national identity of consumerism during the 1950s and '60s may have made it look easy, but this was a time of war, nuclear weapons, discrimination and violence, and even illegal CIA mind control experiments.<br/><br/>Never fear! Americana: The Card Game makes it easy to try your hand at the American Dream with a historical take on issues such as race, gender, socioeconomics, and more. But of course, even in the land of the free, some of us have advantages over others...<br/><br/>Americana: The Card Game tackles complicated issues such as intersectionality, discrimination, and more with gameplay that is straightforward and easy to pick up. Like our gender, race, social status, and so on, much of Americana: The Card Game comes down to chance, and player skill is not a necessity. Games can include 2-6 players and typically take around 15 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Each of the 108 cards centers on a historical event, popular culture, or some other aspect of mid-20th century life. In addition to a brief description for each card, most cards also include a hand-drawn illustration and a metaphorical in-game action, representing its real-world historical impact.<br/><br/>Almost every card in Americana: The Card Game has a positive or negative effect toward your American Dream, due to the card's numeric value, the action outlined on the card, or both.<br/><br/>Different card categories include various positive- and negative-value cards with different sets of card actions. These categories include: Race, Gender, Socioeconomics, Environment, Government, Queerness, and Consumer. By presenting American history through a variety of lenses, players are encouraged to reflect upon what is and is not fair within a society.<br/><br/>The Race, Gender, Socioeconomics, and Queerness categories offer an additional sub-category of cards known as Demographic cards. These cards are played immediately and provide an advantage over other players for the duration of the game by granting you bonus cards. For example, after drawing the &quot;You Are White&quot; card, you then get to draw bonus cards when you draw Race cards. By giving players who are lucky enough to draw Demographic cards an unfair advantage over the other players, this mechanic illustrates how some members of American society during the 1950s and '60s (and today) benefited from social privilege.<br/><br/>Players start Americana: The Card Game with empty hands. On your turn, draw a card from the deck and add it to your hand, then play a card face-up toward your American Dream. Oftentimes, players are forced to play negative-value cards due to a sparse hand. Once the card has been played, commit any action indicated on the card. These actions typically involve drawing a card, discarding a card, forcing another player to discard a card, and so on.<br/><br/>There is only one deck in Americana: The Card Game. Discarded cards are placed on the bottom of the deck and players with poor hands may have to draw from the bottom of a (literally) stacked deck. Additionally, players lucky enough to draw positive-value or even Demographic cards will find themselves adding more and more cards to their hands, while players drawing mostly negative-value cards will struggle to maintain a hand. Of course, luck can change.<br/><br/>Once the net value of the cards played toward a player's American Dream reaches 10+, that player has won the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is playable with a regular poker deck.<br/><br/>24 cards are distributed evenly among players, and four are dealt face-up to the table. On a player's turn, they play one card from their hand: if it pairs with another card on the table (if the two cards add up to 10, or if the cards are the same rank above 9) the player captures them both. The player then flips the top card of the deck to the table and captures with that if possible. Cards which don't capture stay on the table.<br/><br/>The game continues until all cards have been captured - with some unlikely exceptions, the last card flipped will always capture the one remaining card.<br/><br/>Players score their captured cards: red 2-8 are face value, red 9-K are 10 points each, red aces are 20. Black cards are worthless, except: with 3 or 4 players, the ace of spades is worth 30; with 4 players the ace of clubs is worth 40. Highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The &quot;potato salad&quot; is tainted and everyone is turning into zombies. Be the last player to survive this picnic gone wrong and win the game! This is a card management game in which the key is in the cards and how and when they are used. By carefully managing their cards, a player must aim to wipe out all opponents and become the sole survivor!<br/><br/>Each player starts with a family consisting of five members (four healthy members and one zombie) and a hand of cards. On each turn, a player draws and plays cards. Offensive moves include using *BITE* cards to bite your opponents' family members and turn them into zombies. Players are limited in the number of bites they may play based on the number of zombies they have &mdash; which means you need to keep a few of these ghoulish guys around.<br/><br/>Go on the defensive by playing *FOOD* or *EQUIPMENT* cards that protect players from bites. Watch out for the *PLAY NOW* cards as they impact all players and their cards in someway.<br/><br/>The always healing &quot;GrandMa's Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup&quot; instantly turns one of that player's zombies back into a healthy family member. (Thanks Grandma!) The most lethal and powerful card of all &mdash; &quot;Suspicious Seconds&quot;, a second heaping helping of that tainted potato salad &mdash; instantly turns a player into a zombie with an unblockable biting capacity. The last player with healthy members wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

First to accuse him was Meliagaunt, whom Lancelot challenged in combat to prove the Queen&rsquo;s innocence. During the contest, Lancelot cleaved his opponent&rsquo;s head in half and cleared the Queen of those charges. However, rumors continued to abound and soon other knights became suspicious. Sir Agravain and Sir Mordred gathered twelve knights and stormed Guinevere&rsquo;s chamber, finding Lancelot there with the Queen. Now you, as Sir Lancelot, must try to escape and fight your way out of the castle and prove the innocence of Queen Guinevere before King Arthur has her burned to death for infidelity.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/><br/>You are fighting to escape the perils of the castle and, at the same time, trying to defend the Honor of the Queen you love. You will test your Knightly Virtues against those of the 14 knights standing in your way and fight to emerge victorious. If you can defeat 8 of the 14 knights along your path you will clear the name of your Queen and escape into the night. However, all is not as easy as it may seem. With every failure to defeat a knight, your Knightly Virtues will decrease and the Honor of your Queen will move one step closer to peril. Should you lose to 7 knights, or have two of your Virtues reach a value of 0, Lancelot will be banished from the lands and the Queen will burn for her sins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After long and painful days of sailing towers of a large port town appear in the horizon...<br/><br/>In the game, each participant assumes the role of the owner of the ship, on which he sails around the bay, depicted on the colorful playing field.<br/><br/>Players have quite a lot of different opportunities: buy / sell goods in cities, improve their ships, buy guns, seize cities, invest their money in bills of exchange, build forts, and of course, fight each other.<br/><br/>The rules of the game are very simple (but not primitive) and are intended, rather, for children. In addition, the game does not have a goal as such: we simply sail across the bay, enriching ourselves by trading and looting each other, trying to surpass the wealth of our opponents.<br/><br/>Players usually set their own rules for the game, ether to accumulate a set amount of wealth or fight other players until they don't have money to buy new supplies.<br/><br/>However, this is one of the few Russian-made board games in the 1990s, which will be really interesting for the participants to play: calculate where to swim, how to avoid or impose a battle, and how to protect your savings with promissory notes.<br/><br/>The spirit of sea adventure calls you.<br/><br/>",

A player from one team chooses a scene card that describes what the two actors will be doing, but a word is missing from the card. A member from the opposite team has to fill in the blank for the missing word, which then affects the scene. One person from each team will act out the scene in 90 seconds. One of the actors will select a secret challenge card to use during the scene. When the scene ends, the two teams have to guess the challenge card. Whichever team guesses the challenge card right wins the card. The first team to properly act out and guess all eight types of challenge cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each set of dice and tokens should be in a unique color.  A set of Tenzi dice and some tiddlywinks should do the job.<br/><br/>Setup:  Shuffle the cards and flip one to the dice side, and the other two to the event side.  Place them in a column with the dice on top 10 events showing below.  Choose a player to start.<br/><br/>Choose an event:  The starting player (or the winner of the last event), gets to choose the event that is played.  The numbers below the event shows how many dice are needed.<br/><br/>Winning an event:  When a player wins, they will place their token onto the event space.  In the event of a tie, all winners may place a token onto the event space.<br/><br/>End of the game:  The Dicecathlon ends when all 10 events have been played.  Players will earn a point in each of three categories:<br/><br/>Row: Each row will be checked to see which player has the most wins in a row.<br/><br/>Column: Each column will be checked to see which player has the most wins in the column.<br/><br/>Color: Each color will be checked to see which player has the most wins in that color.<br/><br/>If tied in any category, all tying players will receive a point.<br/><br/>Place the winners on the gold silver and bronze spaces to celebrate the victory!

Flick dice from an arms length away. The player that gets the most of their dice through wins!<br/><br/>Drop Closest To Coin (1)<br/><br/>Place a single coin on the playing surface. Players must hold their die out at eye level and drop it to the table.

If the pile falls, the other players win.<br/><br/>Flick Closest To Coin (1)<br/><br/>Place a single coin on the playing surface. Flick dice from an arms length away. The closest to the coin wins!<br/><br/>Roll Die Closest To Edge (1)<br/><br/>Choose a side of the playing surface. Players must roll their die and try to get close to the edge without going over. If all players go over, restart the event. The player closest to the edge wins!<br/><br/>Flick And Hit (5)<br/><br/>The starting player flicks their die onto the table from the edge. The next player must flick a die from the edge and hit their opponents die. If they hit, their die stays on the table. If they miss, it is removed from play. Once all dice are on the table, players can choose any die of theirs to flick. Knocking an opponent's die off of the edge of the table will remove the opponent's die from play. The last player standing wins!<br/><br/>Yellow Events:<br/><br/>Highest Sum Of Dice (5)<br/><br/>Players roll all of their dice at once and total them up. The highest roll wins!

If incorrect, they are out.

Each incorrect player is removed from the event. Play until there is a single winner.<br/><br/>Guess The Die (1)<br/><br/>Each player places one die onto the table with any face up, but covering up the die faces with their hand. One by one, they will guess which die face is on the player to their left. Each incorrect player is removed from the event. Play until there is a single winner.<br/><br/>Lowest Sum Of Dice (5)<br/><br/>Players roll all of their dice at once and total them up. The lowest roll wins! In the event of a tie, tying players roll again. Play until there is a single winner.<br/><br/>Raise The Bluff (5)<br/><br/>Players will simultaneously roll their 5 dice and cover them. The first player must state a number that they rolled. Any player may challenge their claim. If challenged the roll is revealed and if they lied, they are out. If they were truthful, their accuser is out. They'll re-roll their dice and continue. If nobody challenges, the next player clockwise must say a higher number. Play until one player remains.<br/><br/>Green Events:<br/><br/>First To Stack In Order (5)<br/><br/>Simultaneously, all players roll their dice and then race to stack them in order from low to high. Tying numbers will go on top of each other. If the stack ever falls, the new faces will determine the order they need to be stacked in.

He has a  hidden a different secret code  in each castle, and if you decrypt it, you can destroy it. Maybe it's a genius' eccentricity to hide these deadly weaknesses in the castle that he built.<br/><br/>Each player receives a piece with a color and a piece with a number, creating a castle with a secret password. And when it's your turn, you either ask questions or attack.<br/><br/>You can ask questions only to the player on your left. Choose a color and a number and say, &quot;Do you have red or four?&quot; If the player who was asked has either, they say yes, if they have neither, then the player goes on to say no. Ask questions to get a clue to what the other player's secret password is.<br/><br/>Once you are sure what the other player's secret password is, you can attack your opponent and destroy their castle. However, if you attack your opponent's castle with the wrong secret code, you must be careful because your castle will collapse and you will be eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Chaco War remains the only declared war among South American nations in the 20th Century. In brief, Bolivia wanted access to the Atlantic, and de-manded Paraguay cede territory. The earlier discoveries of minerals and oil by Shell and Standard Oil prompted both companies to pursue these objectives in concordance with the Bolivian government through the Chaco desert area. For Bolivia, access to the Atlantic would allow pro-jected oil pipelines to the Paraguay River to be built and allow for com-merce.<br/><br/>The three day battle ended with the Bolivians surrounding but failing to seize Nanawa due to growing Paraguayan resistance (the Bolivians had no reserves), eventually both sides returned to their starting positions by the end of the third day.

Designed by young professionals in the conservation workspace, the game is designed to mimic real-life stakeholder relationships, introduce some of Malaysia's most iconic marine species, and highlight threats to coral reefs. The game goes along two tracks: nature and development.<br/><br/>To begin, each player chooses one of six roles (conservationist, developer, natural resource manager, tourism operator, politician and fisherman) at random. Each role is assigned three specific missions to achieve in the game which corresponds to priorities in real life. For example, all three of the conservationist's priorities are related to nature while the tourism operator is interested in both nature and development.<br/><br/>Seven cards are distributed to each player. The building up of the game revolves around a &quot;rock&quot; card where players build in either the nature track or the development track (level 1 to level 4). To win the game, players have to play all three specific mission cards (level 5) on the board. However, since some priorities overlap, players have to communicate, work together, or even sabotage to place their best cards on the table.

Otherwise, the ROUND IS LOST, and the bidder has to CRUMPLE the piece of the postcard just received. Players with two crumpled pieces in front of them are ELIMINATED. After a piece has been cut from the postcard, start a new round.<br/>The game GOES ON until the final piece has been cut from the postcard or all players but one have been ELIMINATED.

        "description": "This LGBTQ-themed board game features extensive information about LGBTQ culture and history with opportunities for players to share their own personal accomplishments and milestones. Players begin at the 'Bleak World' and by successfully answering a variety of challenges advance to the &quot;Better, Rainbow world. The game includes the board, writing pads, pencils, pencil sharpener, dice, 8 color pawn options, a deck of approximately 500 prompt cards, and a 90-second sand timer.  Two dice are included, a six-sided die for games without a time limit, and a 12-sided one for players needing to complete the game in 40 minutes or under.<br/><br/>Each roll of the die determines which challenge players will face, and when successful, the player rolls again to advance on their next turn.  If they don't succeed, they remain where they are and try that challenge again.<br/><br/>The 9 different spaces include 7 color-coded challenges, one challenge indicated by the 'lock and key' graphic, and one which includes all the colors so that players are free to choose which challenge they prefer.<br/><br/>All players advance along the path of colored flags toward a better world. The the first to reach the 'better world' is presented with a challenge selected for them by the other players.  If they succeed, they win the game, if not, they move back the number of spaces shown on the die.<br/><br/>The challenges include:<br/>Red: Freehand - The player selects a prompt card and must draw a picture of the prompt. If other players can guess what it is, they succeed and advance. The player who correctly guesses moves forward (For example, draw 'Stonewall.)<br/>Orange: You Can Quote Me - Another player selects the first Orange card in the deck and reads it aloud to the player being challenged.  It will be a quote from a public figure or celebrity, and the player must choose which of the two possible answers provided actually said those words. <br/>Yellow: You've Got Talent - the player selects the first yellow card in the deck and must do a charade of the prompt until someone calls out the correct answer before the timer runs out. (For example, do a charade to communicate &quot;Stonewall.&quot;<br/>Green: Just Between Us - The player selects the first green card and shares as much of a personal anecdote as they are comfortable doing.  For example, &quot;Have you ever had a crush on your health care provider.&quot;<br/>Blue: You Think You Know Me - the player selects the first blue card from the deck and reads the prompt question.  Other players must predict how that player will answer.<br/>Pink: Unpinkable - The player selects the first pink card from the deck and reads it aloud, following the instructions to advance or move back.  For example, &quot;You are out with friends and suggest that you all put your phones away.  Move ahead six spaces.&quot;<br/>Purple: Did You Know That? - Another player reads aloud the multiple-choice question, and selecting the correct answer allows the player to advance on their next turn.<br/>The Closet - Players landing in the closet must tell a coming out story before advancing.  They may 'come out' about whatever issue is safe and relevant to them, it does not have to be about sexual orientation. Some may come out about being vegan, agnostic, or straight.<br/>The Rainbow: Rainbow Choice - The player is allowed to select their preferred challenge.<br/>The Better World: In order to win the game, the player who lands here must succeed at the challenge selected by the other players. If they do, they win, if not, they must move back the number shown on their last toss of the die.<br/><br/>",

The disease is virulent, however, and every cache of food and supplies discovered carries the risk of being overtaken by the undead.<br/><br/>In ZERO SIGNAL Supply Run, you lead a camp of survivors striving to locate supplies in the city and bring them back safely. The zombie threat continues to grow, however, and every discovery carries with it the risk of being attacked and eaten. The object of the game is to collect the most food and supplies before the city streets are overrun completely.<br/><br/>Supply Run is a fun and simple card game. Cards are laid out face down in a 4x4 grid, and players take turns drawing cards to find food, supplies, weapons, or zombies. Food and supplies are point cards that are added to your hoard or your hand respectively, while weapons can be used to control the emerging zombie threat. Once zombie cards claim an entire row or column, the game is over and points are tallied.<br/><br/>Since a player's hoard is face up on the board, and supplies and weapons are kept in a limited hand, strategies involve keeping zombies at bay until you believe you've amassed the most points, then drawing them out to finish the game. Average play time is around 15 to 20 minutes, and the basic game serves 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

(&quot;Hotta Imo Ijinna&quot; is a Japanese sentence which means &quot;Don't tamper with these potatoes harvested.&quot;)<br/><br/>The game has dozens of cards, each of which has some foreign words written in it. Each round, players take one of these cards and hear how the words on the card sound through Google Translator (URL is known from the card). Each player then writes down what they heard in Japanese. They score points if their answer is the same as someone else. After several rounds, the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>Because this game uses Google Translator, internet access with a speaker is required to play it.<br/><br/>The designer chose three languages that are uncommon in Japan: Telugu, Thai, and Urdu. The designer liked the beautiful shape of the characters, and that they are unusual in Japan, so players cannot imagine their pronunciation. The game uses public domain artwork.<br/><br/>user summary<br/><br/>日本語以外の言葉を日本語っぽく聴き間違えることを楽しむパーティーゲームです。<br/>具体的にはカードに書かれた単語をGoogle翻訳の音声機能で聞いて、プレイヤーがどう聞こえたかをお互いに発表し、一致している人に加点。ゲーム終了時に最高得点のプレイヤーが勝利します。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

Explore the Talenticity field with your hero, perform, run shows and conquer the city. And meanwhile: watch out for other artists, they want this city too!<br/><br/>The game starts with random hero and god cards distribution, each player picks a faced down card of a hero and a god.<br/><br/>The players receive their Hero miniatures and their performance miniatures.<br/><br/>Each player rolls the dices, the one with the biggest outcome starts the game. Then the order goes in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>At the beginning of every day, all players take a piece of the Skies in order and use their God's eye to see the hidden image. The first player to take a piece of the Skies changes in a clockwise direction every new day. The Players should take and put the skies back one by one in a clockwise direction as well. Each player puts the Skies part back anywhere they want and tries to remember that location.<br/><br/>It is possible to compete in the sky too! Players can follow who saw which sky and take it to change its position on the next day.<br/><br/>Players' Turn:<br/><br/>The player takes a show card from the deck at the start of his/her turn. Each player can have only 3 show cards in hand. Each turn player can take a show card from the deck or put one show card back under the deck of shows.<br/><br/>The player rolls the dices and uses the Action Points*:<br/><br/>1 AP for movement on the board<br/>2 AP to place a performance mini around the hero miniatures<br/>3 AP to perform a show. <br/>4 AP to knock out another players performance miniature<br/><br/>     - The Players do not have to use all the action points that they have every turn.<br/><br/><br/>The players can offer to trade or sell shows and artifact cards to other players during their turn.<br/><br/>To perform a show, the player has to have 3 performance miniatures around the picked location. Then the player has to show the other players the piece of the skies that gives the blessing to perform a show in this location. If the player fails to show the correct sky piece, the show is canceled. The player takes back all three performance miniatures around that location and receives no Moneye. If the show is successful, then the player receives that location card + Moneye according to the show card + any combos.<br/><br/>For placing a performance miniature on the playing field, the player earns 1 Moneye.<br/><br/>The player doubles double the Moneye earned from a show that matches the player's god.<br/><br/>The player gets +2 extra Moneye if he or she performs the show in a matching location.<br/><br/>After performing a show, if unused action points remain, the player can use them.<br/><br/>To receive an artifact the player must show a combination of 3 Moneye that read the artifact name.<br/><br/>It is not allowed to combo artifacts in one turn. Each artifact can only be used once in the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players performs 5 shows (6 shows for 2&amp;3 players).<br/><br/>The richest player wins the Art-Battle!<br/><br/>",

The players have to move on a map and visit different sights in the city of Ratingen.<br/><br/>At the start of the turn the player perform a dice roll to get action points according to the number of dice pips, which can be used to move their pawn one the map one step per action point. It is possible to save up to 8 action points for the next turn. A player can only visit one of the 12 sights, if they are not more than 3 steps away. On the upper map border is a column for each sight. When the turn ends on one of the sights, the player places a token to the lowermost cell of this sight, if they have not already a token there. For example, on the Protestant Church the first player gets two victory point, the second player one, the third player five and the fourth player eight victory points. However, at the end of the turn, a player can pay six action points to move one their tokens one step higher. Tokens of other players are skipped. For example, if the second cell of the Protestant Church is occupied, a player can jump from two to five victory points. Players also get two bonus points for each different city district they have visited (sights have different colors.) As soon a player reaches the city hall (where also the Ratinger Spieletage took place), they cannot move on the map anymore, they get 4 victory points and place at the start of each of their turns one of their tokens a special cell, which gives one victory point per token.<br/><br/>As soon one player has placed all of their 8 tokens, the current round is played to the end.

You'll have to work together with the other staff if you ever want to serve a customer, but if you cooperate you can end up giving the other players points.<br/><br/>Each round a new customer arrives at the restaurant. Then each player chooses an action card and reveals them simultaneously. Actions are taken from the lowest number up; you can prep food in the kitchen, move food from the kitchen to the burners, or serve cooked food to customers. Each action succeeds only if there's space for the food. You get one point for each action you complete, plus bonus points if you fill up a customer's order. This repeats until all the customers are gone.<br/><br/>There's one big wrinkle in the dough though - each round customers get more impatient, and if they get fed up and leave the player currently in first loses points. This means that if you're behind it's in your best interest to antagonize the leader by filling the kitchen with food nobody ordered, serving customers who just arrived first, or other kinds of bad service. But since you might be the leader next turn you'll have to strike a balance.<br/><br/>What will you cook up in Konamon!?<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Last player with any carrots left wins the game.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to Uno, played over several short rounds. At the start of each round, every player gets a hand of 6 cards. In his turn, a player can discard a card that matches the number or color of the top card in the discard pile. If he is unable to do so, he has to draw a card. When one player has no cards left, the other players have to pay one carrot for each card left in their hands. Then a new round starts.<br/><br/>Special rules: When a player is unable to play a card, he not only has to draw one, but also to stand up. When he plays a card in a later turn, he sits down again. There is a quite large number of special cards that allow to steal one carrot from each player that is currently standing. Other special cards make all other players stand up, or try to steal a carrot from a specific player.<br/><br/>A player without any carrots left is immediately out of the game.

        "description": "A La Huguenotte is bringing the campaigning of Tinker Fox to the continent, and with it some &quot;feel&quot; that is different for the English Civil War. There are more and varied troop types; rules governing Foreign Volunteers and Mercenaries, and a new way of looking at the countryside, enabling players to lay a groundwork of operations before the game begins through &quot;Affiliation Points&quot;.<br/><br/>Like Tinker Fox, players take the role of Governor or Generalissimo of a region. They must plot their campaign to grab key towns and districts to create a strong  base, while keeping their enemies from doing the same. Scenarios can vary victory conditions, like having to raise troops for the main army far away or to knock out a specific town. How to do it is up to you.... slipping a garrison commander some cash to lower a rope over the walls, or blow through them suddenly with a petard when everyone's asleep. Cut a swath through enemy territory, burning and pillaging, or lay siege to his capitol!<br/><br/>Build your own campaign for anything going in Western Europe! Scenarios could easily be made for any of the local fighting between Huguenots and Royalists, or when Henry of Navarre  becomes King, between the Royalists and the League. Other fertile areas would be the Netherlands between Spanish and Dutch forces, or after the Pacification of Ghent, Spanish versus Flemings and Walloons. With some slight backdating you could wow your friends with a campaign from the Schmalkaldic Wars! I can also see how this would work for  border warfare in the Balkans between Imperial and Turkish forces, or in Livonia between Swedes and Poles! Supplements are fun and easy to produce...<br/><br/>Includes THREE HISTORICAL SCENARIOS, three separate campaign games, one set in the Netherlands and two in France, each with the actual leaders present, one including the King of Navarre himself, Henry IV.<br/><br/>Engagements are resolved using 'Spanish Fury, Actions!' rules or 'Duel' for when your two favorite officers meet on the field.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

An unofficial expansion to T2R.<br/>Rules:<br/>Ticket To Ride New York State<br/>Recommended players: 2-4, maybe 5?!<br/>Time: 45-60 minutes<br/>If you are reading how to play this, I assume you know how to play the base Ticket to Ride game. If not, please familiarize yourself with the rules.<br/><br/>Game Setup: Shuffle the 6 long destination tickets (routes with blue lettering) and deal one to each player. Discard the remaining. Then deal 3 regular destination tickets to each player. They must keep at least two. Discard the unwanted routes. Deal 4 train cards to each player.<br/>Drawing destination tickets during the game: Draw 3, keep at least one.<br/>Ferries and Tunnels: Ferry routes are designated by one or more locomotive icons. To build a ferry, you must pay a locomotive card for each locomotive icon on the route. The route between New York and Newark is a tunnel. To build the tunnel, pay one card of any color. Then flip over the top 3 cards of the deck, and pay an extra card of that color for each card of that color you flipped over (including locomotives). Discard the 3 flipped cards.<br/>Bonuses: The player who has the longest train receives the Empire State Express card, and 10 bonus points. The player who completed the most routes receives a Globetrotter bonus of 15 points.<br/>Double routes cannot be claimed in a 2 player game.<br/>Stations: This expansion uses station rules from Ticket To Ride Europe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Silent Army is a fantasy wargame for 2&ndash;4 players (usually played in a 2v2 team) on a cross-shaped board. Each player starts with an army of 5 characters, which they place face-down in their castle on the board. It is played clockwise. In each turn, a player must either move one of their characters (only forwards, after the first duel in any direction, but never backwards),  or attack one orthogonal adjacent (or diagonal adjacent, if the player has only one character left) opposing character. When a player declares an attack, they choose the damage class (magical, weapon or body) and both characters are revealed (and stay revealed). If the attacking character has a higher value in this damage class, the defending character is captured (similar to chess). If both values are equal, the total sum of damage points is decisive. It that sum is still equal, both characters are removed from play. In each other cases (defender wins the duel), nothing happens.<br/><br/>If a character is on the border of the opponent&rsquo;s area, it can be switched-out for another character. If a player has their last character, it is also possible to switch it on the corners fields of the central neutral area.<br/><br/>When an opposing unit is offside, so that it is no longer possible for the other player to attack this character, that player may also move backwards until both characters are on the same line.<br/><br/>The first player who reaches the opposing castle with one of their characters wins. When all characters have been captured (which may happen, if the last duel results in a tie), the game ends with a draw.<br/><br/>",

A high energy, tactile but strategic board game that will see players Kersplatting opponents&rsquo; creative masterpieces in the quest to be the first to get two play pieces home.<br/><br/>First players have to get creative and make their own play pieces with the modelling dough provided, then it is all to play for! Taking it in turns to turn over a card, players try to advance their play pieces as far as they can around the board whilst trying to stop their opponents from reaching their Home square first.<br/><br/>There are three types of card: a Coloured Number Card allows you to advance your play piece to the nearest empty space either matching the colour of the card or the number on the card. A Choice of Two Colours Card allow you to choose the colour that advances you the further around the board. The third type of card is the Kersplatt or Colour Card; with this card you can choose to either advance to the further colour space or take your hand, starting from your own start space, travel along the path until you reach the first opponent&rsquo;s play piece and Kersplatt it! Once a play piece has been Kersplatted it remains on the board making that area a dead space that cannot be landed on.<br/><br/>Kersplatt! is a fantastic 2-4 player family board game where strategy and tactics definitely come into play.  Perfect for players age 6 years and over. (/Description from publisher's website)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In fact, General Mago is staying with a small mercenary force in Syracuse itself&hellip;much to the discomfort of local Syracusans who still hate Carthage.<br/><br/>But secretly Syracusan democrats have appealed to the mother city, Corinth, to release them from the yoke of Tyrants and Carthage. And news has just arrived that Timoleon &ldquo;savior of Syracuse&rdquo; has landed near Leontini!<br/><br/>So, Syracuse is risen against the Hicetas and loyal citizens are blocking all streets as the enraged citizen mob rounds up Tyrant loyalists and the hated Carthaginians to be lynched in the Capitol.<br/><br/>Mago&rsquo;s spy broke in with the alarming news in the nick of time. Or is it too late already. Gathering his personal guards Mago runs through the streets of Syracuse down to the port and a secret barge ready to whisk him out of the city&hellip;but for that he will have to break through the citizen picket lines before the mob reaches him!!!<br/><br/>This is a scenario for solo gaming using CLASH of Spears rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Have you ever wanted to coach a football team in the highly competitive Southeastern Conference (SEC) of college football? With SEC Game Day, you can do just that.<br/><br/>Pick your team- all 14 SEC teams are available- and place its respective magnet in one end zone. Next, draw your hand of cards from one of two specialized card decks (offense and defense) to simulate play calling.<br/><br/>One player will be on offense and the other on defense, and each player selects a play call from their hand of cards. Playing the cards simultaneously, a comparison is done using a chart on each card, with the magnetic football being moved on the board accordingly.<br/><br/>For example, it's 1st and 10 at the offensive player's 40 yard line. The offensive player chooses an option play, while the defensive player selects a pass defense. The chart on the card indicates that the play results in a 10-yard gain. The football is moved forward to the 50 yard line and both players get ready to pick their next play.<br/><br/>",

However, the balance of competitive rulesets does not exist within SKIRMISH: 52C.<br/><br/>Instead, players combat the harsh reflection of the potential realities of warfare. In the face of adversity, you must quite literally play the hand you are dealt and hope for better luck next game.<br/><br/>Number of Players<br/>SKIRMISH: 52C is optimized for play by one to two players. It is possible to accommodate additional players, although it is suggested that players divide control of a team&rsquo;s models as opposed to introducing additional teams. In these situations, model counts greater than 8 per team are recommended. This document also includes a supplement to direct and improve the solo play experience.<br/><br/>Setting<br/>SKIRMISH: 52Chas been designed to reflect abstracted modern infantry combat on Earth. The ruleset can be used to simulate the battles of the 20th century and beyond. Scope: SKIRMISH: 52C is a skirmish-sized miniature wargame. Players assume the role of a squad leader, commanding 4-12 soldiers.<br/><br/>Dimension<br/>The game plays in 2.5 dimensions. There is a degree of abstraction regarding line of sight and terrain features. This abstraction permits--but does not require--playing SKIRMISH: 52C using a two-dimensional surface such as a dry-erase board in combination with coins or similar tokens. This abstraction also provides flexibility in the three-dimension terrain features that can be implemented. For example, the height of terrain features do not need to be appropriately scaled to the soldier proxies used.<br/><br/>Scale &amp; Units<br/>The boundaries of combat operations are often much less than a square mile. 1 inch (25 mm) within the game world approximates 6 feet (2 meters) in the real world&rdquo;. 25-32 mm miniatures or tokens are used as proxies for human soldiers. Terrain feature size and distances described in these rules may be scaled appropriately to accommodate alternate miniatures, terrain, or units of measurement. The primary unit of measurement used in this document is inches. Metric approximations are provided but are not exact conversions.<br/><br/>Time<br/>Each model&rsquo;s &ldquo;turn&rdquo; occupies less than a minute of game world time.

Among the cards, there are also cards that give you the opportunity to take cards from an opponent, roll one more time with the dice, get the opportunity to use the cable car, etc. Every time you move one of the game characters into a building marked with an arrow, you have to draw new cards to your hand.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

A twisted, fun developer board game?  not just for the preschooler age group.<br/><br/>In the game, squirrel children must be fed acorns in a small forest (5 trees, plus a meadow).  The turbidity lies in the fact that the puppy squirrels only eat acorns if their mom is with them on the same tree (of course there should also be a free acorn among the foliage).  The game can be &quot;controlled&quot; with a uniquely assigned dice (squirrel mother's move / acorns on one of the trees / little squirrel on the tree / or a jolly joker option, when we choose from the possible actions).  Luck is needed to win, but that way at least the kids can beat their parents well.<br/><br/>",

Aces can be played to other players' piles but cannot cover greed cards.<br/><br/>Greed cards can only be played to own's one pile, and in this case the player scores the total of the cards showing on the table (i.e., on top of any of the four or five piles) before placing it. Greed cards and aces are worth zero; all other cards are worth their face value, but positive if black and negative if red. Any other player with a greed card on top of their pile scores the same amount as the active player.<br/><br/>After a player has played a greed card they must play on their own pile next turn to cover it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "YOGA BINGO: Relaxing &amp; Restoring is a yoga-inspired game to bring joy and inner peace to children of all ages. While playing, children can release their stress and energy.  They learn different coping tools by playing with parents, family and friends.<br/><br/>24 YOGA POSES <br/>- WITH THE BENEFIT OF RELAXING AND RESTORING<br/>All the poses we selected in this collection have the benefit of restoring the body and relaxing the mind. Children can practice becoming still, focused, and self-aware. Once they have mastered these simple techniques, they can use them in any instance to stay calm and access their inner wisdom.<br/><br/>EASY TO LEARN AND SAFE TO PRACTICE<br/>The back of each instruction card breaks down each pose into four steps. You will see photos of our experienced yoga teacher demonstrating how to safely get into each pose. The names of the poses were inspired by animals and nature to be fun and easy for children to memorize.<br/><br/>How to play the game ? <br/>Each player takes turns drawing a random card, each displaying a different yoga pose. The players do the pose and whoever has that symbol on their bingo board fills in that spot. The first to fill in five spaces in a row either diagonally, vertically, or horizontally wins! The objective is to help children channel their emotions and relieve stress through yoga. This also connects families and encourages healthy parenting methods.<br/><br/>",

Players also receive one set of 8 meeples each, one set in dark green and the other is light green.<br/><br/>Players attempt to surround most areas with their tiles. The player with the highest score wins.<br/> Setup:<br/>The board starts out empty. One player plays as dark green and the other as light green. Decide who moves first.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>The game is played in two phases.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Tile laying<br/><br/>The first player places a tile covering two empty squares. Hereafter turns alternate.<br/><br/>On a turn, place a tile covering two empty squares. This tile must also touch an opponent's tile either at short edge to short edge or set at right angles short edge to the long edge. Also, trees at the end of opposing tiles that share an edge must match in height. Tiles of equal value must be set at right angles short edge to long edge.<br/><br/>A player unable to place a tile must pass. When both players pass in turn, they move into the Scoring Phase.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Scoring<br/>Areas of empty squares, surrounded by tiles or by a combination of tiles and the edge of the board are called glades.<br/><br/>Players look at their tallest trees bordering a glade. The player with the tallest single tree lays claim to the glade. If the tallest trees in either color are of equal height, then the player who has a majority of these tree sizes lays claim to the glade. If players are still tied, they then look at their next tallest trees and so on. A player will then finalize a claim, by placing a meeple in his color within the contested glade. Players finish by adding up the squares from each of their glades and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When troops enter a battle, then, depending on the &quot;combat strength&quot; of the units participating in it, a column is selected in the &quot;Battle Table&quot;, on which players roll a die, which is used as a random number generator. The more the player has gathered strength in battle, the higher his chances of success.<br/><br/>In Battle players will control &quot;armies&quot; roughly corresponding to the troops of France, Russia, Germany and Great Britain in the second half of the 19th century - the opponents will have approximately more or less the same number of chips, However, each army has its own small characteristic national &quot;flavor&quot;. Having become familiar with the game principles, the player can almost easily join the world of the historical tabletop wargame by turning to more complex game developments. In them, already dedicated to specific historical operations, it will be possible to lead &quot;real&quot; armies on historically accurate maps and try to achieve specific military goals that faced the real commanders of that era.<br/><br/>We are confident that as a result, our game will be interesting to everyone. For beginners, it&rsquo;s like getting to know the first wargame, for sophisticated connoisseurs, it&rsquo;s like a simple &ldquo;tournament&rdquo; balanced game that can be played quickly and easily in half an hour.<br/><br/>",

It encourages ethical debate (heated discussion) and a critical examination of future technologies and societies. It's perfect for a rowdy dinner party, pre-drinks with rogue friends or intellectual discourse with your sober Sallys.<br/><br/>Robocalypse is simple, first you read a Judgement card aloud to your Council. This Judgement card contains a question which will be thought provoking, a little weird, and divisive. If you can&rsquo;t all come to a consensus, pick up an Anarchy card which contains a mini drinking game, and let the beverage consuming commence. At the end of your round, the person in your council with the most f*cked up argument is given the Judgement card. Whoever is rewarded the most Judgement cards at the end of the game wins! Find out who shares your morals and who&rsquo;s a little f*cked in the head. Maybe you&rsquo;ll learn a little too...<br/><br/>We want to curate an experience for people to feel comfortable talking about AI, regardless of their technical ability or knowledge. We want to help discern the ethical complexities of machine learning to expose the myths and empower our players to critically evaluate and engage in its social implications in the most fun way possible! This game can also be played without the drinking element by removing the Anarchy cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The argyle pattern dates to and is a slight modification of the Tartan patterns worn in Scotland. In modern times, the diamond patterns can be seen on sweaters, socks, hats, and a multitude of other options for clothing as well as design. There are even argyle prints on furniture and home decor.<br/><br/>The most modern though finds this brand new roll and write game named for the argyle pattern. In Argyle, players are creating effectively a tile-type layout by filling in colors that match their dice rolls. Two of the columns are strictly white as to allow the players a barrier between their colors.<br/><br/>Each round will find the player having to cleverly position their new dice and color they have gained so they continue the pattern on their player sheet. The more readily a pattern can be ascertained, the more points a player will earn.<br/><br/>Unlike other pattern games such as Azul, players are more free to place their colors as they choose. Though such choices can be tricky! In order to have the best pattern by games&rsquo; end, the players will be modifying dice and working through strategies that will put them on top of the heap.<br/><br/>The puzzly nature of this game will be inviting and comfortable for sudoku fans as well as players who enjoy games with spatial elements.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It was included in the Spring 2021 Market Crash pack.<br/><br/>Two players compete in a tabletop game of bocce. Players from the red side and the blue side compete by throwing the ball into the court. First, a white ball called &ldquo;jack&rdquo; is thrown into the court, and then the red and the blue sides both throw a ball toward the jack. The side with the ball farthest from the jack is the side that throws their balls in first. When one team has used up all their balls, the other team throws their remaining balls into the court. When all the balls have been thrown into the court, the side with the ball closest to the jack scores.<br/><br/>The throws are determined via dice rolls, which also determine the initial drop point of the thrown ball, any deflections of the ball if it collides with another, and the final landing space of all balls involved in the throw and resulting collisions. The board is comprised of a matrix of potential die rolls.<br/><br/>And advanced game adds &quot;focus,&quot; which is used to give better direction to the throws.<br/><br/>",

After each turn, they draw cards to replace the cards they spent, so that they always start with a hand of four cards.<br/><br/>There are three types of locations on the map: Destinations, where you stop to pick up a location tag for your backpack. Events, where you stop to get wilderness advise from the expert - depending on which option you choose, you can get ahead, fall behind, or help or hinder your opponent. And finally, Minor locations, where you can just pass through without stopping.<br/><br/>To win, you have to be the first player to get a location tag from all five regions, and collect three event cards with a different animal on the back.<br/><br/>",

The game covers the period of the war from 1942 to 1945 in Europe, when the USA became heavily involved in the war. The game uses the Triangle system, which is very flexible and allows many optional rules to be applied. The mechanics of the game allow simulation of battles with a large number of individual aircraft, with a fluid gameplay.<br/><br/>The game may seem too simple at first sight, as most of the&nbsp;mechanics are numbers (speed, agility, firepower, etc.) which are modified by dice and several factors. However, while being easy to use, the basically simple mechanics form a very realistic set of physics, which simulate velocity, direction changing (both horizontal and vertical) and damage inflicted by firing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Simply shuffle and start. Your aim is to build the most powerful Poker combinations - same values, same suit, or consecutive values.&quot;<br/><br/>The first five cards of the deck are turned over to form a row. Then, the player draws from the deck and decides to add the new card on top of a card in the pre-existing row or use the new card to begin a new row, then draw four more cards to complete the new row of 5. This choice is repeated until the deck runs outs. The better the poker hands created in each row of cards, the better the score.<br/><br/>Played with a standard deck of cards, published in Reiner Knizia's book Blazing Aces!: A Fistful of Family Card Games.<br/><br/>",

Bad luck for the students from the nearby school for magic because it is the only place to buy wonderful delicacies and magical pets. You can even find the rare Vanishing Stars there. Ghosts use them to make themselves invisible. &quot;I would love to make myself invisible too!&quot;, says Anna. Amir has an ingenious idea: &ldquo;We could just dress as ghosts to sneak onto the market and mingle with the visitors!&rdquo; The others think it is a great plan. &ldquo;This way, we won&rsquo;t stand out. Maybe we can get hold of these Vanishing Stars? We can pull a lot of pranks with those!&rdquo; The students create teams of four and off they go.<br/><br/>In Midnight Market each player receives a team marker showing the associated students who have disguised themselves as fake ghosts and the team number. These numbers can be found on the bottom of the ghost figures, but they still secret at the beginning of the game. With the help of a color die, the ghost figures can be moved across the playing fields of the market. If two ghosts meet at a booth, the player who moved the second ghost receives one or two magical chips. In addition, chips are given to those players whose team the ghosts belong to. It is therefore worthwhile to keep in mind all the numbers that are revealed over the course of the game &ndash; not so easy when the ghosts are constantly on the move!<br/><br/>Midnight Market expands the popular wizarding world of Wizardry to the power of three, Fabulantica, Mary Magica and Hexenhochhaus. The ghostly memory game includes a three-part scoring so that more than one person can win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Which country's capital is Berlin?&quot; and so on.<br/><br/>The words are categorized into five classes: around the world, animals and nature, famous people, sports, and history. At the start of the game each team gets a board with squares with category names, which are then filled with tokens of corresponding categories.<br/><br/>Teams then take turns with rotating member as the one who tries to get the team to guess the words of needed categories. They can explain as many words as they manage as long as there is time sand timer. Afterwards the team can flip as many category tokens as they guessed words correctly. First team to flip all of them wins the game.<br/><br/>",

What if you took that RAGE, built it back and made it GREAT? RAID's unique gameplay brings everyone together!<br/><br/>RAID is a fast-paced party game for players of all ages - it's great for adults who love word games and are uber-competitive, as well as more casual players and kids. There's even a second board on the reverse side where it&rsquo;s easier to form words. RAID is perfect to encourage children to have fun with words and you get TWO games in ONE BOX!<br/><br/>One player rolls the dice and takes the number of letters indicated on the dice from the bag and places them face up in the circle for everyone to see. At a quick pace the next player does the same. As soon as any letters are in the circle, it&rsquo;s everyone&rsquo;s turn. To form a word you take letters from the circle. The first player to shout out a word grabs the letters and fits them on their board in one of their rows.<br/><br/>Anyone can steal or RAID any word from another player's board by combining it with one or more letters from the circle to form a new word. Note: the new word has to have a completely new meaning to be a valid RAID. New letters are constantly being added so be sure to look out for new opportunities on your road to victory.<br/><br/>There are several ways to win:<br/>Be the first player to complete three rows in your field.<br/>Be the player with the most points after a pre-agreed time limit.<br/>Be the player with the most points after all the letters tiles have been drawn.<br/><br/>The RAID App is here for everyone and you can download it on your phone, tablet or personal computer right now!<br/><br/>",

The die is used in the beginning of one's turn until the homestretch, the rest of the way is moved forward only by completing the categories or guessing right.

The five categories in full are;<br/>Eten en Drinken (Green) - Eating and Drinking<br/>Geschiedenis (Yellow) - History<br/>Sport, Spel en Vakantie (Orange) - Sport, Games and Holidays<br/>Kunst en Cultuur (Red) - Art and Culture<br/>Stad en Land (Blue) - Cities and Countries<br/><br/>On each card the category questions are in a different order. On the back of each card are the answers. You play in rounds. The Round Card is placed on the bottom of the deck. You start with the first question on the card you have just drawn. If the Round Card is on the top of the deck, you put it back on the bottom and then ask the second question, and so on until 6 rounds have been played. On the question cards there are also commands, recognizable because the icon box is blank. These commands are on the lines of &quot;Change a Souvenir to a different colour, Lose a souvenir, and so on.<br/><br/>The Question reader is the player to the left of the player whose turn it is. If the question is answered correctly, the player receives a souvenir in the same category of the question. If the player answers incorrectly then that player must lose a souvenir (if he has one) in that category. The question card is then placed on the bottom of the stack and the turn passes to the next player in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>Maximum number Souvenirs<br/>The number of souvenirs that a player may have in a category is a a maximum of '2 players - 3', '3 or 4 players - 2'.. If a player gets a question in the category of which he already has reached the maximum, then he can choose a souvenir of any other category if he answers correctly. At the end of your turn you can exchange any 2 matching souvenir cards for one in any other category.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to get souvenirs in all 5 categories<br/><br/>",

The included swear list score pad has 4 columns of 10 offensive four letter words, one column for each player. The words further down the list are more difficult to throw (statistically), C*NT at the bottom, being the hardest to throw.<br/><br/>In turns, each player bids to get control of the dice or passes. A bid consists of a number of throws and a swear word from the swear list. Each subsequent bid must be a fewer number of throws and/or a harder word to throw than the previous bid. When everyone else passes the last bidder wins control of the dice, they are now the Tosser.<br/><br/>The Tosser takes the dice and tries to throw the bid swear word within the stated number of tosses. If the word is thrown then the Tosser can cross off that word (or the first remaining word above it) from their swear list. If they have crossed off all their words, they go out, otherwise they start the next bidding round. If they did not throw their swear word, all the other players cross off their highest remaining swear word above and including the bid word, then the player to the left starts the next bidding round.<br/><br/>If at any time four asterisks are thrown then all the other player go out immediately. The last player &quot;out&quot; is a C*NT, everyone points at the C*NT and shouts &quot;C*NT&quot;. The C*NT buys the next round of drinks, etc.<br/><br/>",

Players earn ring cards at launching pad locations spread across the board. Once at one of these locations, players draw a corresponding ring card and successfully complete all instructions listed on the card. This usually requires players to make one or more successful tiki tosses. A tiki toss consists of a player swinging a metal ring, so that it catches on a hook attached to a tiki pole in the middle of the game board. As players move along paths to and from the different Launching Pads, they will encounter tiki heads that may help or hinder their progress.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Your Village is in trouble with the Tiki Forces that be!

The player who plays the highest number card in the seventh trick wins the round and gets a Heart token. Whoever collects two Heart tokens first wins the game.<br/><br/>Based on the orthodox trick-taking rules, in which you must follow suit, this game is characterized by the changes made to the ranks in the seventh trick. So how would you prepare for it over the six tricks up to that point?<br/><br/>Feel the sensation of outwitting the opponent as well as that of being outwitted. You can experience various emotions in a short gameplay.<br/><br/>&quot;&quot;5本のキュウリに色がついたら&quot;&quot;をテーマに作った２～４人用のトリックテイキング。<br/>１ラウンドは７回の勝負からなっていますが、勝てばいいのは７回目だけ。<br/>７回目の勝負で一番大きい数字を出したプレイヤーがそのラウンドの勝者となり、「ハートトークン」を獲得できます。誰よりも早く「ハートトークン」を２個集めたプレイヤーがゲームの勝者となります。<br/>トリテのオーソドックスなルールであるマストフォローをベースに、ランクが特徴的な本作。７回目のトリックではランクが変わる仕掛けが施された新鮮なトリテ。<br/>６回目までの勝負でどう準備するのか。思惑がはまった時の快感、相手にしてやられた時の悔しさ。短時間でいろんな感情を味わえるゲームに仕上がっています。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Bugs&quot; is a tactical-level wargame with six asymmetrical factions that models episodes in the lives of various insect species. In addition, this game system is designed to include new expansions, where factions of other phyla can be introduced, for example: reptiles.<br/>The rules weight can vary, being suitable to a broad range of ages and war game knowledge, so it can be played by both children who are learning to count (4+) and more experienced wargamers.<br/>In educational terms, this game aims to alert the community to the difficulties that animals face every day, and will increasingly face thanks to global warming. The game has a mechanic that simulates, by increasing the difficulty, possible future scenarios in which food is scarce, and weather conditions will be less favorable.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In reality, Donkey, Dog, Cat and Rooster are the first professional gang of gangsters and are up to mischief in the otherwise quiet Bremen. Luckily, the police stand in their way!<br/><br/>You get three cards in your hand, only whoever plays the first card gets four cards. Then you try to form rows of cards from 0 to 4. To do this, you always place the next highest or next lowest card.<br/><br/>If you have a card in the same color, you may skip values. Since you are not allowed to fill up this gap, rows can remain incomplete.<br/><br/>If you cannot or do not want to play a card, you must pass and take a card from the draw pile into your hand. You may play this card directly. When a row is finished - whether complete or not - or everyone in the round has passed, the round is over. Whoever placed the last card of the row gets the lowest card in his hand and starts the next round. All other cards in the row are discarded.<br/><br/>Once the draw pile is empty, you may only pass if you really can't play. Whichever of you has no card left in his or her hand when he or she would have to play a card, wins the round. The losers then receive one minus point for each card in their hand, two for a policeman. Whoever has collected the fewest minus points at the end of a certain number of rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Skyway, you are a city planner in charge of designing a notoriously convoluted traffic interchange. Over three passes through the deck, you will be drafting stacks of cards from a random market, which you&rsquo;ll place into a 3x3 grid. However, each grid cell may only be stacked three cards high - any more and the bottom cards get discarded. Your aim is to create a path of at least 5 increasing cards for each of the four suits.<br/><br/>Skyway is a solo pattern-building game playable with a deck of regular playing cards, with rules created by Wil Su and made available free online as part of his &quot;Isaludo&quot; series. On each turn, the player deals stacks of cards to a market, and then chooses one stack to build inside a 3x3 grid. Over three passes through the deck, the player tries to construct the grid in such a way as to create a five-card sequence in each suit -- a pathway formed by the cards that can snake around or intersect with the other suits' pathways. The catch is that each square on the grid can only hold a stack of cards three high, and placing the one card needed to complete one pathway may very well cause a card crucial to another pathway to be discarded.<br/><br/>Arranging tiles to create maps is a cornerstone of many great city-building games like Suburbia and Sprawlopolis. However, most games of this genre require more information on each card than a simple rank-and-suit system can provide. Skyway takes its cue from the Decktet game Aucteraden. By allowing a single space to have more than one &ldquo;suit&rdquo; on it, the paths can intersect and weave around each other to create a small, tight puzzle.<br/><br/>As part of the Isaludo collection, the rules can be found in this forum thread.<br/><br/>",

This past weekend George was on a getaway to The Velvet Curtain Casino. The last she heard from him was a voicemail telling her he was in some kind of trouble. Charlotte tried calling the police, but they wrote off her case. She insists that while George may have a gambling problem, he would never abandon his family. The casino has unsurprisingly been completely unhelpful when she called. So, you decide it&rsquo;s best to go undercover and see just how high the stakes are.<br/><br/>As with all Deadbolt Mystery Society games, you step into the role of the detective. Examining the evidence provided, visiting different locations and using the password protected QR mechanic to uncover the truth.<br/><br/>Players win once they catch the killer, find whats missing or whatever else is needed to solve the case at hand.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to take the initial capital and increase the size of the business by buying ingredients from the fluctuating market and producing various types of beers and ales to sell. Logistically, ales are a type of beer, but for the sake of the function of the game, they are separate.  The market prices are determined by dice rolls, which is the only use of dice. You, the player, then choose which ingredients to buy knowing which beer/ale to produce and the sale price of that beer or ale. There is also the company building, which graphically represents the &quot;company building.&quot; The player then uses the in-game coins to buy extra beer/ale producers and storage. Additionally, the storage aspect of the game allows beers/ales to gain monetary benefits by letting them ferment. The bulk of the end-game points tends to focus on the company building, so be wary. The company building is the layout of the objects you buy; a visual representation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ju 87 Stuka Ace allows you to simulate Junker 87 (Stuka) operations throughout the course of World War II, from the beginning of the Blitzkrieg in Poland to the anti-tank operations in the Russian campaign.<br/><br/>What makes Stuka Pilot special is the brand-new game engine, built around what made the Stuka unique, the dive-bombing. This method of attack is very different from the standard bombing operated by other aircraft, and Ju 87 Stuka Pilot fully reflects this uniqueness. This is the attack sequence in JU 87 Stuka Ace: select the bomb release height, proceed with the dive, consider the current formation height and visibility, release the bombs at the set height and then execute the delicate pull phase. Each of these phases will be managed by making optimal use of the action cards in the player's hand, but you must carefully plan your play since you don&rsquo;t immediately draw a new card after playing it.<br/><br/>Ju 87 Stuka Ace will allow you to fly your Ju 87 in almost all the theatres where the Stuka were used: Poland, France, England, Norway, the Mediterranean, North Africa, Italy, and Russia. The missions in the different theatres will have very different objectives: infantry units, artillery positions, tanks, transport ships, battleships are just some of the examples. Terrain and weather conditions will also play an important role in the missions; poor visibility, the scorching heat and the sand of the desert, and the frost and snow in the Russian winters: are elements the player will have to consider to succeed.  Ju 87 Stuka Ace includes even night operations: special rules will allow simulating Ju 87 D-5N attacks in Italy as members of &quot;Night Battle Group&quot; NSG9.<br/><br/>Nine Stuka models will be available to the player depending on the mission or on the progression of the campaign, including Ju 87 A, Ju 87B-1, Ju 87 R-1, Ju 87 D-3, Ju 87 D-5, and Ju 87 G-1. Depending on the capabilities of the aircraft, it will be necessary to select the most appropriate bomb load for the mission objective, evaluating both the number and the type of bombs to be used. And when flying the Ju 87 G-1, your pilot will use the Bordkanone 37 against the Soviet tanks: to better represent the Ju 87G-1 tank-buster role, a specific attack procedure has been introduced, always leveraging the player Action Cards.<br/><br/>If you have just a limited amount of time you can play single missions, choosing your preferred theatre of operations. If you are instead looking for a campaign game, Stuka Pilot has been designed to represent the entire career of the pilot, starting from his role as &quot;rookie&quot;, then moving on to the roles of Kette Leader, Staffel Leader, and finally Gruppe Leader. As squadron or group commander, the player will have to coordinate the operations of his formation, defining the best approach to the attack, while still remaining in command of his aircraft; the outcome of the mission is always based on the result of your individual attack, do not expect to remain an observer while your formation is executing its dive attacks. As the campaign progresses, you will not only be able to climb the ranks of the Luftwaffe, but also improve your skills (customize your deck of Action cards) and get the coveted medals. The Golden Leaves are waiting for you aboard your Ju 87.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Furrow Fields, 2-4 players take on the role of farmers competing to earn the most points and win the Harvest Festival&rsquo;s Grand Champion title. Points are earned by successfully growing and harvesting crops from your field and completing as many villager commissions as you can before the festival begins at the end of the 14th round. Each round consists of a day phase and a night phase.<br/><br/>Each round a different player begins the day by choosing two seeds from a dwindling selection (and thereby limiting the options for others), harvesting grown crops from their field, and deciding whether to spend points on or use farm tools. Once done tending to their field, they then either turn in a completed commission, take on a new one (before another player takes it), or spend the rest of the day exploring the village. The next player then starts their day phase, until everyone has completed their day and night falls. At night, as crops grow closer to harvest, a variety of events may take place ranging from a visit by the hungry local wildlife to a useful item finding its way into a field.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Two hours and forty minutes later, she sunk into the sea, taking 1,496 souls to the bottom of the ocean. <br/>What caused this modern marvel to sink? There are many answers; the responses as vast as the ocean itself.<br/><br/>Travel back to that night of April 14, 1912, and prepare your lifeboat with necessities, save passengers, and discard excess baggage to escape the sinking ship. Learn fascinating facts about passengers who don&rsquo;t often make headlines, collect vital equipment from the early 1900s ocean voyage period, see items from the ship's true manifest, and discover what it was like to sail RMS Titanic &ndash; and how people survived the horror.<br/><br/>The card deck contains 70 cards for 2-4 players. Players receive a Lifeboat card, then play to gather a number of survivor cards and equipment cards while discarding luggage cards. Each card has a point value. There are two ways to win using points and strategy. The game is based on real life incidents (each survivor is correctly matched with their actual lifeboat, for example) and years of research into Titanic's history.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rotten Rampage is a standalone solo game that is included with the Token Terror board game set. The objective of the game is to assume the role of a zombie and conquer the village. As the game progresses, players are given the opportunity to acquire additional zombies to add to their arsenal. However, the task of being a zombie is not easy, as your parts can become detached, and the villagers have an array of weapons at their disposal. The fewer the villagers, the more aggressive they become, requiring players to exhibit great tenacity.<br/><br/>The game comprises several rounds, which continue until either the villagers have destroyed five out of the six zombie parts or all the villagers have become infected. The zombie parts represent the entire army's health tracker, making all infected targets vulnerable to damage, particularly toward the end. Some of the zombie parts are required for actions, such as using the zombie head to infect villagers with a coin toss. While these actions are necessary to win the game, there are spaces where players can regenerate lost parts.<br/><br/>Each zombie part and villager has a number. The villagers move through revealed cards each round, with a battle triggered whenever a villager and a zombie share the same space. Once the battle is resolved, the moving phases come to a halt. During the encounter, a dice is rolled, and if the result falls within the range listed on the attacking villager's tile, the associated number is detached from the zombie. The attack range for each villager's number is clearly printed on each tile, allowing players to develop strategies at a glance. However, the villagers could enter spaces that level up their range, flipping their tile over to give them a wider range of attacks. The tile underneath them also allows for alternative maneuvers or actions, adding to the complexity of the game. Hence, effective positioning is vital for success.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Team up with your favourite pet to create the best winning sets in different point categories. From initial starting hands, players lay three card sets in front of random placed score point cards and then replenish. Deception and bluff occurs as to what sets are placed where. One card in each set is always face down.<br/><br/>But beware, you may be swapped a high point losing hand, or is it a winning hand you swap straight back without realising? Other dilemmas include: Do you play a weak set now to build a better one later? Which initial score points to play sets to?<br/><br/>Which opposite swap to make? Identifying key score point cards. How many sideway swaps do you make that would incur penalties? Whether to make a losing set to use in an opposite swap.<br/><br/>After the pets have completed their hands, the fur revealing showdown decides who will be Top Cat or Top Dog. Which clever pet would you be? A light fun fast paced strategy card game for two players. 8+. 5-8 minutes per round. Up to best of 5.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game Changer is a collection of 15 types of board games designed as an introduction box to modern board games.<br/><br/>Descriptions of the games:<br/><br/>The Action Game:<br/>Summary: Are your reactions fast enough to be the first to snap on cards? Players take turns placing cards on the table as they race to &lsquo;snap&rsquo; on all the correct cards. Similar to the classic game of snap. The game is played in rounds where players compete to be the first to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order (3 resource items).<br/><br/>Objective: Be the first player to snap on all the items that each customer wants in order to collect the active customer card. The first player to collect 3 customer cards wins the game!<br/><br/><br/>The Abstract Game:<br/>Summary: This game is like chess for the modern era. Two players sit on either side of the board and move Player Tokens across. Unlike chess, the board&rsquo;s tiles dictate how the Player Tokens can be moved, not the Player Tokens.<br/><br/>Objective: Win by being the first player to move all 3 of your Player Tokens to the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>The Bidding Game:<br/>Summary: Players are at an auction each with the same amount of money. Can you outsmart your opponents by spending the least to gain the most? The game consists of 10 auctions where players bid on resources, aiming to have the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Objective: Win by having the most points at the end of the game (after 10 auctions).<br/><br/>The Bluffing Game:<br/>Summary: Can you lie without getting caught? Can you tell when others are lying? Each player starts with 5 coins and one animal card, each with its own special ability to earn or remove coins. Players can choose to lie or tell the truth about which animal card they have in order to earn or remove coins from other players.<br/><br/>Objective: Win by being the last player remaining with coins. This is a game of elimination.<br/><br/>The Co-op Game:<br/>Summary: Players must work as a team to find and arrest the 2 Diamond thieves while protecting the innocent bystanders. To do this, each player must choose a card from their hand and perform the actions stated on the card. Winning will take real teamwork.<br/><br/>Objective: When both Diamond thieves are arrested everyone wins, but when 2 innocent bystanders are arrested everyone loses!<br/><br/>The Dice Game:<br/>Summary: Seven animals race around a track while all players watch and bet, aiming to earn the most money by the end of the game. There are multiple ways of earning money including betting on the winners/losers or buying land (like Monopoly) that earns money when animals land on them.<br/><br/>Objective: The player who has the most money when the first animal reaches the finish line wins the game.<br/><br/>The Hidden Identity Game:<br/>Summary: Can you figure out who among you are lying? Players are assigned a secret identity, which will either be on the innocent team or the guilty team. Players close their eyes while listening to an audio recording from Game Changer&rsquo;s website, which instructs certain animals to perform specific actions while everyone else has their eyes closed. In the second phase of the game, all players open their eyes and discuss what happened in order to determine who the guilty team is, while the guilty team lie to try to not get caught!<br/>​<br/>Objective: After 5 minutes of discussion, all players vote on who they think is the guilty team. If the majority vote is correct, the innocent team wins. If the majority vote is incorrect, the guilty team wins.<br/><br/>The Market Game:<br/>Summary: Players visit a bustling market to buy and sell valuable resources in order to earn the most amount of money. Players must decide whether to claim, swap, trade, or sell resources to customers in order to profit the most.<br/><br/>Objective: The first player to reach $40 worth of coins wins the game!<br/><br/>The Memory Game:<br/>Summary: This game combines memory and strategy. Resource Cards are placed face down on the table with players able to peek at any 2 cards to start their turn. The goal is to collect sets of matching Resource Cards by remembering their location on the table. Each player has their own memory bank where they can strategically store up to 2 sets of cards that will help them complete sets and stop other players from collecting them.<br/><br/>Objective: The game ends when there are no more Resource Cards left in the middle of the table. The player with the most cards collected wins.<br/><br/>The Numbers Game:<br/>Summary: Are your reactions fast enough to be the first to snap on cards? Players take turns placing cards on the table as they race to &lsquo;snap&rsquo; on all the correct cards. Similar to the classic game of snap. The game is played in rounds where players compete to be the first to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order (3 resource items).<br/><br/>Objective: Be the first player to snap on all the items that each customer wants in order to collect the active customer card. The first player to collect 3 customer cards wins the game!<br/><br/>The Party Game:<br/>Summary: Are your reactions fast enough to be the first to snap on cards? Players take turns placing cards on the table as they race to &lsquo;snap&rsquo; on all the correct cards. Similar to the classic game of snap. The game is played in rounds where players compete to be the first to fulfill a customer&rsquo;s order (3 resource items).<br/>​<br/>Objective: Be the first player to snap on all the items that each customer wants in order to collect the active customer card. The first player to collect 3 customer cards wins the game!<br/><br/>The Realtime Game:<br/>Summary: This game involves a lot of yelling! Players simultaneously yell out the actions written on their cards to try to find another player yelling out the same action. Once a player has found a match, the matching players both perform that action e.g. &lsquo;Team Spirit&rsquo;, &lsquo;Bro Bump&rsquo; or &lsquo;Pinky Swear&rsquo;. Both players then discard the Action Cards. The goal is to be the first player who finds matches for all their cards, therefore having zero Action Cards remaining in their hand.<br/><br/>Objective: The first player to discard all of the Action Cards in their hand wins.<br/><br/>The Set Collecting Game:<br/>Summary: Players attempt to create the strongest sets to win, like in Poker. However, unlike Poker, there are 7 Resource Cards face up on the table which players compete for. Each resource card states a rule that explains how that card can be won. The player who satisfies the rule at the end of the game wins that resource card, and the player with the most resource card points wins the game.<br/><br/>Objective: The player with the highest total value of resource cards wins the game.<br/><br/>The Storytelling Game:<br/>Summary: Players tell a funny group story using cards from their hand and trying to be the first player to use up all their cards. To use up their cards faster, players may interrupt other players&rsquo; stories using special cards. Each player also has their own pre-written custom ending which they need to use.<br/><br/>Objective: The first player to use up all their cards and end the story with their ending wins the game.<br/><br/>The Tile Game:<br/>Summary: Place tiles on the table next to each other to create a continuous road. Be the first player to collect 3 Treasure Chests. Along the way, you&rsquo;ll need to slow down your opponent(s) by re-routing and blocking their path(s) to ensure you are the first to collect the Treasure Chests.<br/><br/>Objective: The first player to collect 3 Treasure Chests wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this family game Kvantum (Quantum) you become captains of spaceships! Navigate your spaceships with the help of cute aliens to reach the planet Quantum first. You can find your way to it if you put the navigation cards with numbers correctly.<br/><br/>The game will not only help practice tactical thinking, but it also tests basic speed counting.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/>The objective of the game is to use the alien cards to put together the correct numbers (quanta) and reach the planet Quantum first.<br/><br/>PREPARATION OF THE GAME<br/>Place the game board in the middle of the table. You can choose from two track lengths. Shuffle the alien cards and place them face down near the game board.<br/>Each player chooses a piece, places it on the start and takes five alien cards from the refi lling pack into their hand.<br/>Place the shuffled navigation cards with the planets face down next to the game plan.<br/><br/>COURSE OF THE GAME<br/>Select the starting player who becomes the captain. The game is played in rounds, each round has four phases.<br/><br/>1) Course settings<br/>The captain turns over the navigation card with the planet on it.<br/>Each player tries as quickly as possible to find the sum of the numbers on the cards in their hand that will result in the same number as the number on the laid out navigation card.<br/>Once the player finds the correct cards, they lay them out in front of them. If a player cannot make a number, they can lay out just one card of the same colour as the number on the planet navigation card.<br/>The player who laid out the cards as last or cannot lay out anything cannot fly.<br/><br/>2) Flight<br/>If the players have laid out the cards correctly (sum or colour), they may keep the cards laid out and arrange them on the table in front of them. If not, they throw these cards away.<br/>Players who have laid out their cards correctly will move up the game board by the number of fields corresponding to the number of cards they have laid out.<br/><br/>3) Alien technology<br/>The alien cards that players have laid out in front of them have various effects that can be used to advance towards the objective.<br/>If a player uses four cards of the same colour with any values, they move their rocket (figure) three fields forward. Each type (colour) of alien has a different special ability. If you manage to create a sequence of four cards of the same colour (e.g. 3, 4, 5, 6), you can use special alien technology.<br/><br/>4) Energy replenishment<br/>All players may discard any number of cards from their hand to the discard pack. Players then take turns taking cards from the refi lling pack so that they have five in their hand. The player to the left of the captain takes the pack of navigation cards and becomes the captain for the next round.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends on the round when the first player reaches the Quantum planet. The other players fi nish the round. If more players reach the destination during the last round, they all win.<br/><br/>",

As air support for the Anti-Extinction Squad, It's your job to help the ground team rescue the last few stranded animals before a giant asteroid strikes the planet.<br/><br/>With good tactical decisions, great memory and little bit of luck, you must work your way through a deck of beautifully illustrated tarot sized cards, matching animals with their own specific Containment Pods and airlifting them to safety.<br/><br/>There are two fire cards that you pull out of the deck. Shuffle the deck, hold it in your hand with the faces down, then put those fire cards at the back. Flip over the top card and see what it is. This is your view from your vehicle.<br/><br/>Sometimes you will find an animal. It will be an herbivore or a carnivore. Each animal is assigned a rescue pod number, and a displacement number. If the animals rescue pod is nowhere to be seen in the deck near this animal, then you must use the displacement number to push the animal backwards in the deck. But be careful that you don't put her before is in front of carnivores or they will be eaten and discarded.<br/><br/>If you find a rescue pod, you can remove it from the top of the deck and blindly place it anywhere in the deck. This is where some of the memory aspect comes in. You're hoping to get that pod next to its matching animal. And you don't want either of them to end up between the two fire cards which are slowly moving towards the front of the deck, or you will lose them to the fire.<br/><br/>Occasionally you will find a poacher. You have to move them back into the deck, hoping that you get them between the fire cards.<br/><br/>Every time you are able to manipulate the cards so that a carnivore is in front of its matching pod, or an herbivore is behind its matching pod, as those two cards make their way to the front of the deck, you get to remove both cards from the deck because you have saved that animal.<br/><br/>Once the fire cards have made their way to the front of the deck, look to see what's been lost between them, and then move that whole batch of cards to the back of the deck again. Keep going, moving cards around in the deck, until there isn't anything else left that you can do.<br/><br/>Save as many animals as you can, and if you haven't saved them all, try to do better during your next play!<br/><br/>",

When a ballad is completed, players bid their food to claim different parts of the ballad.

The game is calming and promotes mindfulness and nature connection, making it suitable for players aged 8 and up. Flora &amp; Fauna includes 96 Species cards, 40 Food cards, 10 Canopy Structure guides, 1 plot marker, 1 reserve plot marker, 1 player piece, and instructions.

In addition to classic trick-taking mechanics, it involves elements of hand management and turn order management.<br/><br/>In the game, players will try to win tricks in order to win the most points from tricks and be the first to shed all of their cards from their hand. The player who leads the trick plays two cards face-up, representing two tricks. Winning one of the two tricks nets points and allows the player to retain the lead. Losing both tricks will lose them the lead. Winning both will result in negative points, meaning that the ideal outcome for the leader is winning only one of the two tricks.<br/><br/>Scoring is one point per card, -1 point per card for those where the leader won both tricks, and -1 point for any cards remaining in hand.<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of rounds equal to the number of players, or six rounds in a 3P game. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Serengeti Sanctuary is a game for one to four players aged 7+ which takes 30 to 60 minutes to play (about 15 to 20 minutes in solo mode). The game has a wildlife conservation theme, and features beautifully designed cards with wild animals from the Serengeti and a range of African terrain settings. The players seek to expand their wildlife reserves as successfully as possible.<br/><br/>Each turn the players draft cards from the play area following simple rules. They also have park staff members who give extra drafting abilities. The aim is to build sets of animals and therefore accumulate a growing score. Once the drafting is completed, players take turns to choose how many of their cards to play. The score they achieve is added to the victory track, and the points gained that turn are also used to enhance their staff team and gain sanctuary tokens. Players can also use points to hold cards between turns, with the aim of building even better sets. Once a player reaches 50 points or more the game ends, with victory for the highest score.<br/><br/>Serengeti Sanctuary marries a beautifully presented and iconic theme with nicely judged game-play. There are many paths to victory, and the outcome is unclear until the last moment. It works beautifully as a light game for a wide range of ages. Simple to learn, the game-play has surprising depths and re-playability is high.<br/><br/>When playing the game in solo mode you use exactly the same rules. The target of 50 points must be achieved in three rounds for a solo victory.<br/><br/>The game was the leading finalist in the Ravensburger 2023 'Next Big Family Game' Gamefound tie-in competition.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

The front side has a declaration of something, for which the right answer is the number in the backside.<br/><br/>There are two game modes in this game.<br/>In easy mode player in turn tries to put three randomly chosen declarations in the descending order by the number in the backside. After that other players can contest the order. If no-one contests, then player in turn gets one point. If someone contests and the order is right, then the player in turn gets one point and the contester gets minus one point. If  the order was not correct, then contester gets one point and player in turn gets minus one point.<br/><br/>In the more challenging game mode you have a grid of nine cards (3*3), where you place your cards. On your turn you put your card in any place in the grid, so that descending order is maintained in the corresponding line and column. At the start there are no cards in the grid. You can play your card in the open space or on top of previously played card. Points are calculated in the same way as the easy mode.<br/><br/>There are five categories of numbers:<br/>Number of people, number of something, amount in Finnish marks, percentages and other.<br/><br/>This game is a promotive game published by the Finnish construction company HAKA. From the cards in the game you can conclude that game was probably published 1990.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

With perfect information, players must truly outwit their opponent to win.<br/><br/>Characters are composed of 6-card sets featuring a hero card, a health tracker, and action cards. Occasionally a minion or item will replace an action card.<br/><br/>The map is built of 6 cards as well, with the cards randomly placed in a set pattern.<br/><br/>Players take turns maneuvering their characters around the dynamic, and often dangerous map while unleashing powerful attacks.

        "description": "Nosh is the world&rsquo;s first charcuterie board game. In a world where charcuterie boards are ubiquitous (and sometimes don&rsquo;t even contain charcuterie), they have become a staple for any kind of get-together. But how much do we think about the food on the board and the people eating from it as we enjoy a charcuterie board? Nosh was created to encourage intentionality around the charcuterie board as we think about the pieces we pick up and the people around the table with us.<br/><br/>As a unique offering that straddles the line between board games and kitchen products, Nosh is positioned to cover multiple purposes and markets. As a product, it can be used as a board game or as a keepsake charcuterie serving board.<br/><br/>Nosh is a board game - charcuterie display board hybrid. The board itself will be a wooden display board of near-keepsake quality, and will come with high-quality wooden pieces. The NOSH game will include:<br/><br/>Wooden playing / serving board<br/>Wooden pawns<br/>Nosh conversation cards<br/>Plastic die<br/>Nosh playing instructions<br/><br/>Because the game involves eating, it will be up to the players to provide the food that goes on the board, but a list of suggestions will be provided. In markets where we will do hyperlocal marketing, we will also partner with local cheese shops and retailers that sell charcuterie items to encourage local consumption.<br/><br/>The game is collaborative and not particularly competitive - the joy comes in building the board with your friends, sharing your thoughts on the discussion prompts, and enjoying a convivial environment to enjoy good food. As far as gameplay is concerned, comparable games include Chutes and Ladders or Candy Land. It is not intended to be particularly difficult, with the main focus being on the conversation and food rather than the game itself.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be aware that at some point, you'll have to justify yourself. The goal is to get rid of all your cards.&quot; - Unofficial translation of the French description by the publishers<br/><br/>Each player starts with a hand of 6 descriptive cards, each including an adjective or a clause that may qualify someone (e.g. &quot;American&quot;, &quot;is less than 40 years old&quot;, &quot;is a C&eacute;line Dion fan&quot;...). The first player to run out of cards is the winner.<br/>At the beginning of a round, a descriptive card is drawn face up. Then, each player at their turn must complete the face up card(s) with a single card from their hand, so that the description of someone made of all cards at play builds up on the table. When playing a card, each player should think of a character/person that would fit the overall description (including their own added card). They should keep the identity of this character/person secret. Special action cards may also be played, for example to remove some cards played earlier. If they do not wish to play a card from their hand, they may draw cards until they find one to play. After playing a card, their turn ends and the player on their left is next.<br/>Players continue to play cards on their turn until a player confronts the last person who played a card by saying &quot;I don't know who that is&quot;. Then, the person being challenged must reveal the identity of the character/person they were thinking of (or otherwise reveal that they were bluffing!). The challenged player must argue why this character/person suits the description laid out by all the cards at play. If the majority of the players are convinced that the person/character fits the description, or if the explanation of the challenged played makes the challenging player laugh, then the challenged player wins the confrontation (or otherwise the challenging player wins it). The player who lost the confrontation draws new cards to add to their hand, as many as the number of cards played this round divided by 2 (and rounded up).<br/>After resolving a confrontation, a new round begins, starting with the player on the left of the last person who played a card. The game stops whenever a player gets rid of all their cards and thus wins.<br/><br/>",

The white gravekeeper moves vertically in the graveyard, while the black gravekeeper moves left and right.<br/><br/>On a turn, declare &quot;white&quot; or &quot;black&quot;, then move the matching gravekeeper.

Finally, activate the effects on the empty graveyard cards in the row or column where you collected cards.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, calculate your score based on your cards in hand and card effects.

The remaining cards will either be in a face-down deck, known as the Kitchen, or, a face-up row, known as the pantry.<br/><br/>Each morning tea card has a special action which is carried out when it is played.<br/><br/>The cards must be played to a particular postition in the player's spread (row), of cards. Players will usually attempt to play cards that belong in order next to each other. If they do not, more preparation time will have to be used, in order to push one's servants to work even harder.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player plays the Elevenses card. This signifies that it is now 11 o'clock, the hour when guest will begin arriving. The players will then compare the value of thier morning tea cards in front of them. The player with the greatest spread wins the game - and the respect of the whole town - having hosted the finest morning tea of all!<br/><br/>",

In this evolving puzzle, the player must solve the djinns&rsquo; riddles through careful card placement. Each of the 6 double-sided djinns are placed in a loose pyramid shape, with space around each djinn to play a card in each orthogonal direction. The player draws 2 cards and plays them both in sequence each turn. Each djinn shows a specific arrangement of cards around them which must be fulfilled to solve their riddle and earn an immediate one-time bonus. Solved djinns are covered by an adjacent Mysticana card.

In this lightweight game of chance and skill, each player receives 2 cards and hopes to have the best combination for the round. After the initial deal, players may discard 1 of their cards to draw a replacement, then each player decides whether to stay in the play or resign for the round. Once all players have committed, a new card is flipped; this determines scoring for the round and also changes the value of each Avatar (rank ⟐). Players reveal their hands to see who holds the best score. Each round also features one of 12 Artifacts, which offer a bonus to the player's hand who meets their criteria most effectively. Rounds are cumulative, and the first player to win a round and have 30+ points is declared the final victor!<br/><br/><br/>In Arcane Artifacts, compete against your opponents in a test of luck and skill.

And if you like this game, please make a donation to Cheapass Games, and keep checking back constantly for new and wonderful stuff!<br/><br/>Each player uses eleven coins: One quarter, two dimes, three nickels, and five pennies. One player is &ldquo;heads&rdquo; and  the other is &ldquo;tails.&rdquo; Players take turns placing coins in empty areas. When you play a coin, it flips over enemy coins in neighboring areas, if those coins are of lesser value. Areas that touch only on the diagonal are not considered connected. The game ends when both players are out of coins. Each area is worth one point. You will play twice, with each player starting once.<br/><br/>Source: The Publisher's Website<br/><br/>",

But more than the throwing skills, everyone delights in handling the soft, nubby bags stuffed with real beans. This package comes with a navy-blue, plastic game base containing five wells. The two larger wells are only worth 20 points a hit, the two medium-size ones are worth 50 points, and the tiny well in the middle is worth a whopping 100. This age-old game is not as easy as it looks, with concentration and careful release of the bags being the keys. Comes with three red and three yellow beanbags.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     Sturdy plastic game base, <br/>     6 bean bags, <br/>     scoring labels and rules<br/><br/><br/>",

First, players take the role of leaders of a small and emerging tribe in the early Stone Age, collaborating to avoid threats, exploit opportunities, and build the tribe to a position of growth and stability. Then, once a variety of tribes have been created, players take leadership of a city-state that evolved from an original tribe and contest the region with their opponents who are the leaders of city-states of their own. Using Legacy mechanisms, the world evolves as the city-states use exploration, conquest, culture, and religion to out-compete their opponents and try to establish the most enduring enterprise. Not every tribe created in this game will survive to the next...<br/><br/>Each game in the Chronicles Series uses Rob Daviau's Legacy System within the game itself, but will use the new Echo System to allow the world you create in Chronicles 1: Origins to be continued in the second game of the Chronicles Series due out in 2017.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a redesign of the classic game Monopoly by design artist Michael Graves, and distributed exclusively in Target stores.  The game is smaller than a typical Monopoly board, and as such, so are the title deeds, chance and community chest cards, and bank notes,  The houses and hotels are also redesigned in the Michael Graves style, and come in velvet pouches for storage when not in use.  The tokens are based on the designs that Mr. Graves has submitted to Target for different household items (Cup &amp; Saucer, Telephone, Wall Clock, Blender, Tea Kettle, and Toaster).  And this all is enclosed in a very attractive wood box.  The board folds open on the top like the top of a cigar or jewelery box, with side supports that swing out from the back, and there is a drawer on the side to store the tokens, buildings, cards, deeds, and money.  This drawer functions as Money rack when playing the game.<br/><br/>",

Played from 3 to 5 players it is a game that tests both your knowledge and your reflex.<br/><br/>In the first round all the players are obliged to answer questions by pushing a special button before anyone else does. The goal is to score 9 points which takes a player to the second round. The player that didn't reach 9 points when everyone else did is eliminated.<br/><br/>In the second round each remaining player chooses one of four proposed subjects and has to answer questions related to it. The maximum score here is 4 points (for 4 consecutive correct answers). The best two players go through to the final.<br/><br/>In the last round the two remaining players are face to face, having to find the answer for some long questions read by the presenter. The players may score 4, 3, 2 or 1 point, based on the number of information given by the presenter. The first player to score 9 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Once all the answers have been written on the dry-erase speech bubbles, one person holds the speech bubbles over the card reader's head and reads the answers out loud. The card reader will then pick the answer they liked best from the Love It options and the Hate It options. If your answer is picked, you get a chip. The object is to get three Love It chips and three Hate It chips to win.<br/><br/>The game comes with 18 Love It chips, 18 Hate It chips, 294 scenarios on 147 cards, three two-sided blank cards, six dry-erase speech bubbles, six dry-erase markers, a chip bag, a bubble tray, and rules.<br/><br/>",

The Fleet Commander spins a spinner to possibly move one of his three ships (blue pawns). The Sub Commander draws one card per turn hoping to get a card showing the letter and color where a ship is located. If this happens, the ship is sunk. Once the Fleet Commander's last ship makes it to port, players switch sides to see how many ships the new Fleet Commander can get back to port.

        "description": "Rival Den of Thieves is a strategic card game for two to five players. The criminal element of the city is in a race to steal the most -- from the bank or each other. Each player controls one of the dens, and each card in her/his hand represents one of the thieves in his/her den.  Each player chooses which of her/his thieves to make active, knowing which thieves are in every player's den (and knowing that they know which cards s/he is choosing between).  Guessing which thief another player is making active can help block and/or steal from that other player.  Players bluff and back stab their way to victory, using the upper class thieves in the city -- including the Counterfeiter, the Gentleman Burglar, and the Lawyer. The game can be combined with Den of Thieves for richer play. The game can accommodate 2-5 players -- up to 10 with a second deck or Den of Thieves added.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Triple Flips 5 includes Kidnap and Rescue, Spy Against Spy, and Runaway School Bus.<br/><br/><br/>     Kidnap and Rescue is a capture-the-flag game for 2-4 players.  Move to the captive, become the captive, and put your own pawn home.  Everyone else continues to try to get the captive, which is now you.  If someone catches you, they become the captive, and you re-enter from home.  Try to get the captive home!<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Spy Against Spy is another intentionally lopsided 2-player game, but this time the effect is a little more like American football.  The defender merely obstructs the offender as much as possible to minimize her progress over the course of ten turns.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Runaway School Bus is a 1-player timed race, with the interesting twist that the timing is staged.  There are five points along the bus's path where you can intercept it.  You merely need to progress, by die roll of course, along your linear path more quickly than the bus to maximize your score.  This game features a small misprint, since if you don't count the picture of a schoolbus as a space for the bus, getting 5 points is quite literally impossible.  You can't get 14 out of two rolls of a six-sided die - it's low enough odds on three rolls.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "James Bond is a game of speed and frantic simultaneous action that takes under five minutes to play. It is played with a standard poker deck with Jokers removed. Each player tries to be the first to transform the piles of cards they have been dealt into sets of four-of-a-kind. They do this by exchanging cards from their piles with the four face-up cards in the center of the table. A player may only hold and look at one of his piles at a time, and may only exchange one card at a time with the one of the cards on the table. There are no turns; everyone works at once. The four face-up cards on the table are thus constantly changing along with the makeup of the players' piles. The first player to have converted all his piles to four-of-a-kind is the winner.<br/><br/>James Bond is also known as Atlantis or Chanhassen. Players must say the game's name when they've finished in order to win.<br/><br/>Note: The date and origins of the game are unknown, although it seems to be recent, perhaps as recent as 2009.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of Mongolian Goat Rodeo is to grab the goat from one corner of the play area, then carry it down to the opposite corner, around a goat post, and back to the starting location. There's only one goat, so players will tussle over who has control. The object of the game is to get the most victory points. Three points are up for grabs in the rodeo and up to ten points are available from bragging rights afterwards.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls 2d6 for each of his three riders to determine how far they can go. A ruler is used to measure the distance moved.  If a rider ends his move adjacent to the goat, he can tussle for it. To do that, the player must explain how he takes possession of the goat. Based on the quality of the story, another player judges the likelihood on a d6 roll of the active player taking possession.  &quot;Unexpected events&quot; are handled similarly. At any point a player may spend a coin from their hand and declare one. They describe what happens and then another player decides its likelihood.<br/><br/>Once the goat it safely back to the starting point, the players may spend any remaining coins, with each coin granting an argument to try to gain more victory points. These may relate to things that happened during the rodeo or to post-rodeo festivities that would make a team look better in the eyes of the spectators. Once all the coins are gone, the winner is determined.<br/><br/>The first edition of Mongolian Goat Rodeo (2006) was a board game, while the second edition (2013) is a card game in which players need to supply their own dice, ruler and coins in order to play. The designer has also published free &quot;miniatures game&quot; rules that can be played using any mounted figures. See the Community Wiki section, below.<br/><br/>",

When all players have a hidden card in front of them, they turn the cards at the same time. The card in front of each player indicates which combination he/she should make. They have to see how much identical cards are revealed by other players, and how much identical cards they have on their hand.

If they see 5 identical cards, they shout &quot;timbr&eacute;&quot; (=stamped).<br/><br/>Players who tapped rightfully at 2, 3 of 4 can take pieces of a packet. They get 2 cards (showing parts of a postpacket) from the deck, keep 1 and discard the other one. The player who tapped the 3 can make, after choising from two cards, an additional move: steal a card from an other player. The player who could tap the 4 can choose a piece (out of two cards), steal another and gets the mailman. He/she also decides in which direction the cards are given in the next round.

Her very name meant she was gifted in every way by the gods: beautiful, wise, musical, persuasive, confident . . . and curious.  She was given a jar that contained all of the world&rsquo;s evils, and also one good spirit, Hope.  In the end, she chose to open it, and set the course for humanity.<br/><br/>Pandora's Box provides a simple and deep abstract party game for a group of players to analyze how well they know the strategic planning of their friends.  Each player receives a few white and black stones (good and evil spirits) that they drop into a box in the center of the play area.  They may also switch the stones in their hands with other players throughout the game.  When someone drops her last stone into Pandora's Box, the box is opened, its contents revealed and taken by the player who opened it, and each player scores points for white stones in hand and loses a point for black stones in hand.<br/><br/>Though it sounds incredibly simple, the game is fast, deep, thrilling, and offers tremendous psychological fun and unexpected results.  Despite having no random elements, it has plenty of hidden information that makes each game play out differently.<br/><br/>Pandora&rsquo;s Box is offered as an entry to the Thousand Year Game Design Challenge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A variant of the traditional Japanese card game 'Hanafuda', this deck of cards is specifically designed for the Hawaiian Style game known as 'Sakura'. Two to six people can play, either individually or as teams of two.<br/><br/>The 48 cards are divided into twelve 'hiki' or suits, each corresponding to a specific month. The four cards in each hiki have 20, 10, 5, and zero points. The objective of the game is to accumulate the most points by matching cards. The highest possible score is 240 points.<br/><br/>After shuffling and cutting the deck, the 'oya' (dealer) deals cards counter-clockwise to the players; the number of cards dealt differs depending on the number of players. The oya then plays a number of cards in the center of the table, known as the &quot;field&quot;. The remainder of the deck is set nearby as a draw stack.<br/><br/>Play begins with the oya and moves counter-clockwise. The player draws a card from her hand and places it in the field. If the played card matches the hiki (suit) of a card in the field, the player places her card on top of the matching card to show everyone the match. She then picks up both cards and places them face-up in a &quot;points section&quot; in front of her. She discards any cards with no value in the 'kasu' (rubbish) pile behind the draw stack.<br/><br/>Next, the player draws one card from the draw stack. If it matches a card in the field, she must take the pair of cards. Otherwise, the card is left in the field. This ends that player's turn. It is possible that a player may capture as many as four cards per turn.<br/><br/>The player to the right takes the next turn. Play continues in this fashion until all the cards have been used in each player's hand. Points are then totaled.<br/><br/>Advanced play adds a wild card and also 'yaku' (bonus combinations) in special three-card combinations that are scored at the end of the game. Holding one or more yaku causes the other players to deduct points from their score, rather than adding points to the yaku-player's score.<br/><br/>",

In Tilsit's game XIII : Le Complot based on that police/thriller world, you play each of the 27 key characters in turn.  Your goal is to surmount all obstacles (traps, ambushes, plots) thrown in your way.<br/><br/>The board shows 33 of the albums' key locations; by traveling to each, you assemble a team able to complete a maximum of missions.  Each completed mission awards you investigation points which are necessary for victory.  Of course, there aren't enough missions for every player to win...<br/><br/>The combat encounters will be bloody, and the combined strength of your agents and characters won't be enough --you'll also need to plan your moves and play your cards right...<br/><br/>XIII is an amnesiac whose identity is hotly debated throughout the series.  Various agencies (such as the NSA) have tentatively identified him as various notorious hit men / terrorists / secret agents --but XIII isn't an easy man to catch!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Die, Robot, Die! players command an army of 8 robots, represented by dice.  The game is played on a grid, with each player having a &quot;base&quot; on their side of the grid.  The object of the game is to either destroy the opponent's base, destroy the opponent's entire army, or make it so that none of the opponent's army can move on their turn.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, first a player may sabotage the opponent's base (if they have a die alone in the opponent's base), which reduces the health of the base.  If the players destroys the base in this manner, they win.<br/><br/>A player must then move one of their armies according to the pips shown on the dice.  If the player has no legal move, he loses.<br/><br/>Lastly, a player may attack one of the opponent's dice, with the attacker gaining pips, and the defender losing pips according to the pips currently showing on the dice.  If a die is reduced to 0 or less pips in the battle, that army is eliminated from the game.  If a die ends up getting too many pips, that army is &quot;overloaded&quot; and dies as well!<br/><br/>Die, Robot Die! is contained in the centerfold of Spielbox Magazine, Issue #3 of 2012.  You will need to supply your own dice and tokens to play.<br/><br/>",

The active player then rolls two dice to determine two or more fields (such as 31 and 13, for instance - special rules apply for rolling doubles). All dwarves on these fields lose their rings and are kicked out of the cave. The first player who carries two rings out of the cave is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is entirely dice driven, there is no decision-making involved.<br/><br/>",

The southwestern city of Turku is the oldest city in Finland (founded 1229), was the capital before Helsinki until 1812, and still is the 6th largest city and the hub of the 3rd largest metropolitan area in the country, the capital of it's region, and an important seaport with shipyards.<br/><br/>Unlike most games in the series, this one (along with Helsinkipeli) came in two different editions; an earlier edition in a styrofoam box inside a cardboard sleeve fastened by velcro (similar to the concurrent Swedish Lokalspelet series) and a later edition which is similar to most of the other games in the series.<br/><br/>Kaupunkipelit is a series of games, each of which is basically a light version of Monopoly localized to a city/region of Finland. The games promote local companies, councils, educational institutes etc. and were designed as a fund raising effort for local sports clubs.<br/><br/>The main differences between these games and Monopoly are:<br/><br/>-Instead of a &quot;street&quot; each square on the board represents a local business.<br/>-There are no hotels or houses, but each square has two title deeds instead of just one, allowing two players to jointly own any location on the board.<br/>-The majority of the event cards are trivia questions about the locality the game is set in.<br/>-While the effects of the first two corner squares (Go and Jail in Monopoly) remain the same for every edition (Go and Stock Market Crash), the effect of the other two corners varies from edition to edition and is the only real difference between them (except for the trivia content, of course). They are typically also local businesses but without title deeds and thus no rent either, but some special effect instead, such as pass a turn or get an extra throw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CryptidsTV, a new type of party game, challenges players to create new television shows, with them taking part in all aspects of a show's production meetings &ndash; drawing, talking and being creative &ndash; with the aim of getting their show on prime time. Part of the challenge comes from being presented with two separate concepts drawn from separate card decks &ndash; for example, a liquid creature and a fad that appeals to kids &ndash; and figuring out how to merge these concepts creatively into a single creation.<br/><br/>Each player takes one role card and reveals it to indicate his role for the game. The assistant director distributes pens and creation sheets to players.<br/><br/>In each round, the director randomly selects one Cryptids card, such as &quot;vehicle creature&quot;, then everybody must draw a creature representing this category within one minute. The assistant director redistributes the drawings among players (with players not being allowed to look at them), then the director randomly selects one Show card, such as &quot;The creature is able to communicate and converse with humans! What is the secret behind it?&quot; Each player then makes his presentation using the caption and drawing in hand.<br/><br/>Players then vote on the winning presentation by simultaneously pointing to the show they thought best, with the director breaking ties. The winner is selected to air on prime time, with the player who drew the cryptid receiving the prime time tile, and its reporter receiving the prime time host tile. Everyone gives them a round of applause.<br/><br/>Play four rounds total with 3-6 players, and only three rounds with seven or more players. End the game by kibitzing over the suggestions that were botched and didn't merit air time.<br/><br/>Can be combined with the material in the sequel CryptidsTV 2.<br/><br/>",

Each round, players receive three human cards, each numbered 1-3, and one random special character card (Orochi, Susanoo, Oracle, Hermit, etc). They play one card simultaneously. If no one play Orochi, humans are safe and players who played a human with the lowest number score points. If Orochi is in play, humans are dead and the Orochi player scores points, but if both Orochi and Susanoo are in play, Susanoo slays Orochi and saves humans, and the Susanoo player steals points from the Orochi player. The game goes to next round after Orochi was played.<br/>Players should predict opponents' moves to score points and win the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>日本神話の「ヤマタノオロチ伝説」を題材に、人狼系＆バッティングゲーム。7ラウンドで構成されたゲームで1ラウンドは最大4回プレイします。<br/>プレイヤーはラウンド毎に１~３の基本カードとオロチやスサノオ、巫女、山伏など様々な役職を担当のカードを受け取ります。<br/>ラウンド内でも得点が多い日もあれば少ない日もあります。<br/>一番小さな数字のカードを出したプレイヤーが得点を得ます。<br/>でも、オロチと一緒に出されるとオロチに食べられ、得点をオロチに持って行かれます。スサノオとオロチが同時に出るとオロチは倒されスサノオが得点を稼ぎます。このように、他のプレイヤーの動きを読みながら、より多くの得点の獲得を目指すゲームです。<br/><br/>",

For a more challenging game, be the first to reach 7 dogs.<br/><br/>To start a turn, pack owners draw one card from the deck. pack owners may add one Dog into their pack per turn as a free action. During a turn, pack owners may also use an already learned Trick, or use an Alpha Trait. The turn ends when pack owner makes one of the following moves:<br/><br/>     Play a Dog Toy<br/>     Play a Power Card<br/>     Buy or attempt to lure a dog out of The Street or The Shelter<br/>     Use Treats to teach a dog a Trick<br/>     Change the Alpha Dog in their pack<br/>     Discard their hand and draw five new cards<br/>     Voluntarily choose to end the turn<br/><br/><br/>Alpha Traits: Each Dog has a special ability that can only be used when the dog is the Alpha Dog. Alpha traits allow pack owners to bend certain rules, and only become usable once the pack owner has an Alpha Dog and at least one additional dog in their pack. <br/>Tricks and Treats: Each dog can learn a certain numbers of tricks, which is noted on the Dog Card. Tricks give pack owners an extra edge in the game. This can be by defending a pack against other pack owner&rsquo;s moves, giving a pack owner the chance to look at other pack owners&rsquo; cards, take cards from other pack owners, or giving a better chance at rescuing a Dog from The Street or The Shelter.<br/>Rolling Dice: Certain cards require a roll of the die to decide if the card's effect is successful, and some cards increase or decrease the number required for a successful roll. For example, the &ldquo;Rubber Chicken&rdquo; card requires a die roll of 4 or higher to save the Dog from being taken by an opposing pack owner. However, all XL dogs take a -2 to all rolls against the Rubber Chicken. If this card was played against a Great Dane, and the pack owner rolled a 5, this modification would mean the roll counted as a 3. The Great Dane would be taken by the opposing pack owner. Alternatively, the Trick &ldquo;Sit!&rdquo; adds a +1 to any roll. A Great Dane that knows &ldquo;Sit!&rdquo; would be safe from the Rubber Chicken card because the total roll would be a 4.<br/><br/>",

Dandy has gone and used the Aloha Oe's broken warp drive and managed to converge every possible alternate universe into one, causing multiple copies of everyone in the known galaxies to run amok! What does this mean for our intrepid heroes? Will all semblance of civilization fall into disorder and chaos? Will the universe, under the weight of so many simultaneous timelines, implode on itself into a cosmic Big Bang?<br/><br/>Well. Maybe. But for now it means the Alien Registration Center has reset the database and is allowing new registration of all previously registered aliens! That's cold, hard Woolong just out there for the taking, baby!<br/><br/>The Space Dandy: Galactic Deck-Building Game brings the bizarre space-faring antics of the hit anime series seen on ADULT SWIM TOONAMI to the game table. It's similar to other Deck-Builders like Dominion and Ascension&mdash;with an extra helping of phantom space ramen goodness. Each player begins the game with the same rather low-powered starting cards, but through careful play, you can acquire more to expand your options. Which cards you choose to take directly influence the kind of game you play!<br/><br/>Cards can grant new abilities, make it easier to acquire new cards, allow you to take extra turns, or even destroy cards from the game altogether! But the most important cards are the aliens. Not only can they improve your hand just like any other card, they can be played Planetside and directly attack the other Player. Why fiddle around endlessly with your deck when you can stick it to them and mess up their carefully laid plans? That's the Dandy way to play!<br/><br/>Even more importantly, aliens are how you win! When you register aliens, they are removed from play, but you get to score precious, precious Woolong that you need to win the game. But be careful! It can be difficult to decide if an alien is more useful in your hand, on the Planet, or in the Alien Registration Center's bank.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s not to say the other cards aren&rsquo;t important, too! Effect Cards cannot be registered OR played Planetside, but they let you manipulate the game to your advantage. Sick of that really great card the opponent keeps playing? DESTROY IT! Changed your mind about the card you played Planetside? WARP IT BACK! Keep your opponent&rsquo;s on their toes with your carefully constructed (or hazardously haphazard) deck!<br/><br/>You can also fill out your space crew with other humans (and the occasional robot) that can&rsquo;t be registered as aliens (obviously). But never fear! They make up for the lack of Woolong delivery with unique abilities of their own!<br/><br/>So register those aliens, earn all the Woolong you can, and may the Best Dandy Win!<br/><br/>",

The active player draws a card which determines the distance the raven can move (1, 2 or 3 tiles). The player then picks up any blueberries on that tile. If there are none, the player flips over an empty meadow tile instead. If Schnabelgr&uuml;n lands on a lake tile, the active player needs to put down two blueberries on that field to help the raven stay afloat. Some cards also let the player steal a berry from another player. <br/>The game ends when a player runs out of berries. The player with most berries is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to cooperatively complete 10 adventures in order to become Legends. To do so, all the players must work together to defeat Monsters along the way. Each time you play is unique, and the game is enhanced by magnificent fantasy artwork.<br/><br/>To play Legends of Adventure, players become Heroes of different types and go forth to undertake up to 10 adventures. To complete each adventure, the Heroes must defeat a group of Monsters equal in number to the number of players.  The assorted adventures and the Monsters provide circumstances and powers that modify game play. In order to defeat the Monsters and complete each adventure, the players must jointly outscore the Monsters&rsquo; combined level. This is done by rolling unique dice, featuring water, fire, and forest icons, for the levels of Heroes and Treasure Cards played, as well as playing Divine Intervention cards, adding an interesting spin that allows Heroes to request help from the gods. Each successful die roll adds to the overall score of the Heroes; once the Heroes have defeated the Monsters, they receive loot in the form of Treasure Cards that will help them in future adventures. The variety of cards provides different scenarios not only for all adventures but also for each game as a whole.<br/><br/>",

When the first player collects the set amount of winning points or is the last living player, he is declared the winner.<br/><br/>If at any point of the game you get killed, you respawn as a zombie. The gameplay changes a little bit and you must hunt down at least one player to be able to respawn as a living player.

Shuffle these tiles face down, then place five (still face down) around each of thee ten islands while the players start on the central, eleventh island. On a turn, a player first looks at any face-down tile on the board, then moves to any island adjacent to their current location except the one where they just looked at a tile, then they draw and reveal a tile from the island where they just arrived. If the tile shows a land animal, they keep it. (Exception: A player cannot have three tiles of the same type. If they would take one, they instead place it on any empty location on the game board.) If the tile shows a sea animal, they take the special action associated with that animal, then discard the tile.<br/><br/>If you arrive on an island with another player and that player has a duplicate animal that you don't already have, you can give them an animal tile of your choice to take one of the duplicated animals.<br/><br/>Collect six different types of land animals first, and you win! If multiple players complete their sextet the same round, then the player with the most overall animals wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1865. In the U.S., the taming of the West is at its peak. Railway lines are busy building a transcontinental railroad linking the East and West. Competition between the biggest companies is fierce: each is trying to lay down the longest track. <br/> <br/>During this period, pioneers from very different backgrounds were brought together. Their interactions created a new and mythical society in a land of natural beauty. Many of these settlers carved out a place in history.  <br/>  <br/>It is in this legendary world that you must build your own railroad and board as many passengers as possible. However, be aware of the dangers: tribes trying to protect their land, a harsh environment full of surprises, and outlaws prowling the desert in search of riches. Keep an eye on your opponents, and a closer one on your friends, for each person is trying to beat you to the ultimate destination: the Wild West!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Flirt, all the players flirt with each other, until they get married at the end of the game. Who loves whom? And how much?<br/><br/>During the game, each player flirts with all several other players. All the actions &ndash; such as flirting, sending text messages or giving your heart away &ndash; bring in flirting points. Who will flirt the best, gain the most flirting points and become the &quot;best&quot; couple?<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a character (or two characters in a three-player game), two hearts belonging to that character and two relationship tokens, and a pawn, which is placed on the board. Then, each player thinks up a term of endearment for himself. When players address each other, they should use this term of endearment. A player who fails to do so correctly loses a relationship point.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. On his turn, a player rolls two dice, picks one, and move his pawn as many spaces as the die shows. (In a three-player game, the player rolls one die, and selects one of his pawns to move.) After moving the pawn, the player may flirt with one character of the opposite sex whose pawn is on the same space or an adjacent space. If he does so, this strengthens the relationship between the two characters. This is measured by placing flirting points on the &quot;love barometer&quot;. If two characters have four flirting points, they fall in love. After four more points, they get engaged, and after another four points, they get married.<br/><br/>Furthermore, if the pawn has landed on a heart space, the player may either give one of his hearts to another player, or ask for a heart from another player (who then has to give one of his hearts to the asker).<br/><br/>If the pawn has landed on a text message space, the player draws one of the text message cards, reads it out loud and places it face-down in front of him. If no more cards remain in the draw pile, the player can either give one of his cards away or ask to receive a card from another player (who then has to give one of his cards to the asker).<br/><br/>The game ends when a pair of characters have married. Now, each player scores points as follows:<br/><br/>    For the highest relationship status achieved (with any one other character): 4 points for being in love, 8 points for being engaged and 12 points for having married.<br/>    -1 point for each of your own hearts, +2 points for each heart from another player.<br/>    -1 point for each negative text message, +2 points for each positive text message.<br/>    +1 point for each remaining relationship token.<br/><br/><br/>The player who has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Plays similar to &quot;head or tails&quot;, but with different victory scenarios. The game pictures are humorous, they aren't gross, so is suitable for Ages 16 and up.<br/><br/>Although the game is not collectible, there are 4 different sets. Each set is auto playable, and all four play the same, the only difference is in the artwork of the cards. When you buy a game of Teto, you get one random set of the 4 available.<br/><br/><br/>ESPA&Ntilde;OL:<br/>Del libreto de reglas: TETO: el juego de cartas es una adaptaci&oacute;n del popular juego espa&ntilde;ol &quot;Teto&quot; al mundo de los juegos de cartas no coleccionables. Hemos intentado plasmar lo mejor posible la esencia de este tradicional entretenimiento manteniendo intacta su mec&aacute;nica.&quot;<br/><br/>Los componentes son dos cartas, una tercera carta a modo de portada (que no se necesita para jugar) y un librillo de reglas. El juego propone diferentes escenarios de victoria. Las im&aacute;genes del juego son humor&iacute;sticas sin resultar groseras, con lo que Teto es adecuado de 16 a&ntilde;os en adelante.<br/><br/>Aunque el juego en s&iacute; no es coleccionable, existen 4 modelos diferentes. Cada modelo es autojugable y los cuatro se juegan de forma id&eacute;ntica, siendo las ilustraciones de las cartas lo &uacute;nico que cambia. Cuando compras un Teto, obtienes un modelo al azar de los 4 disponibles.<br/><br/>",

Every single strike there's a chance to lose your head, adding a suspenseful life-threatening urgency to every move!<br/><br/>The game is simple.  Like in the classic black knight fight scene from Monty Python and the Holy Grail, each player fights until they lose all their limbs, or lose their head.  Play cards to fight and confuse your opponent.  Roll the dice to charge and retreat.  And draw from the bag o' death to see what body part gets cut off.<br/><br/>The Nobles can be played with two players in a one-on-one duel, or with three to four players in a free-for-all death match, or played with teams (2-on-2 or even 3-on-1).<br/><br/>With a mix of strategy and luck, games can average around 20-30 minutes, or can be over in as little as 60 seconds.  We've played a lot of games and only once witnessed a killing blow in the first turn, but boy was it satisfying.  Boom... head shot!<br/><br/>",

Every turn after that, you have the option to drop out of the round and not play any more cards. The winner of the round can take as many Ponies from the Playing Field as they can hold (max hand size is 5) and then the rest of the cards played in that round are discarded.

Although lighter than those two, there are still interesting decisions and choices to be made in this fast and fun game that takes about five-to-ten minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blitzkrieg in the West was designed by Joseph Miranda. It is the first in our new series of &ldquo;Blitzkrieg Campaigns&rdquo;, two player wargames covering the great mobile campaigns of World War II. Blitzkrieg in the West puts you in command of either the German armed forces, or the Allies, during the epic campaign for the Low Countries and France in 1940. The system uses a combination of counters, maps and cards to give players the full range of options in emerging modern warfare, with a new twist: each player has different operational capabilities, generated by cards picked in secret before start of play.<br/><br/>This allows for tradeoffs between additional mobile capabilities for armor, enhanced fortification effects, specialized types of air missions, and even airborne special operations. This allows for a wide range of game strategies, and ensures that every play of the game will be different. It also allows players to explore the various &ldquo;what if&rdquo; options of the original campaign. Players will be in the position of their historical predecessors, who can exploit new forms of warfare.<br/><br/>Mechanized ground unit are represented as divisions, while infantry are corps level. Headquarters can provide non-divisional support. Air units are different types of groups, differentiated by aircraft models. Special rules include shock effect, national morale, flooding lowland areas, establishing bridgeheads across rivers, open cities, and much more.<br/><br/>The counters are beautifully printed and die cut with full color on both sides. The game box is 9&quot; x 12&quot; x 3&quot;.<br/><br/>The game comes with extensive historical notes, providing some new insights into the climactic campaign of 1940 which changed the fate of Europe.<br/><br/>",

Adjacent cows can protect each other.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play - you can either decide which cow to move on your turn, or select one randomly.<br/><br/>",

It's a party game were you can rhythmically beat the drum.<br/><br/>additional comment <br/>The game comes with a spinner with six holding spaces for counters. There are 6 types of counters: beat (1 hand), beat (2 hands), clap, silence (pause), finger snap and shouting &quot;Ol&eacute;&quot;. Six counters are randomly inserted. The spinner decides where to start the cycle. So 1 cycle could be beat(1)-beat(1)-&quot;Ol&eacute;&quot;-snap-beat(2)-beat(1)-clap. <br/>All the players together now have to perform this. When 1 makes a mistake or doesn't keep the beat with the rest, he's out. The rest continues till 1 is left. He chooses 1 counter, removes it and replaces it with a random new one. <br/>Game ends when 1 player has collected 6 counters.<br/><br/>Players should use the box as drum.

Each one builds on previous discoveries, called prerequisites, and paves the way for new discoveries.<br/><br/>During a game, players will build together the Discovery &quot;&quot;Tech Tree&quot;&quot; by each placing cards in turns. Discovery allows you, with a same deck of cards, to play several different types of games (from beginner level to expert). Depending on the type of game, the goal can be either to be the first to empty your hand (games with no points), or to collect the maxim number of points (you earn points each time you place a card).<br/><br/>In all games, each player starts with 5 cards. During your turn, you can place a card in the discovery tree if all its prerequisites have already been placed, or if it has no prerequisite (starting cards). Once placed, a card benefits all players who can then use it as a prerequisite to place their own cards. The game ends as soon as the stack is empty and a player empties his hand.<br/><br/>Discovery is a semi-collaborative game which, like the evolutionary process, combines both collaboration and competition.<br/><br/>The Prehistory deck can be played as a stand alone game, or as an extension of the Antiquity deck (2019 edition).<br/><br/>Discovery is a game for kids (6 years +) and adults, and ideal to play with the whole family. It can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players. A game can vary from 15 to 60 minutes depending on the type of game and the number of players.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Let's save the kitties!<br/><br/>In the card game CATz in the Town!, players want to gather lost cats before they get into trouble &mdash; how lucky that they have nine lives...<br/><br/>Players collect sequences of four kinds of house cats (blue, yellow, red and green). Each player can have only one sequence of each color (i.e., they cannot have two red sequences at the same time), so they can compile at most four different sequences in front of themselves. Another sequence of the same color can be started only after that sequence is scored. Sequences should consist of exactly three, five or (in special cases) seven cards, possibly of the same color, and if we sum the values of the cards, the last digit of their total value should always be 9 (e.g., 9, 19, 29, etc.).<br/><br/>The cards have only odd numbers on them, and a few have two numbers on them, allowing the player to choose which value to add to their sequence. Of course, to make the object a little more complicated, different kinds of extra cards aggravate or ease cat collecting.<br/><br/>Players earn points &mdash; also known as kitty coins &mdash; for scoring their sequences, which they acquire by turning their cards face down. These cards will depict a kitty coin, worth 1 point. The winner of the game is the one with the most kitty coins.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to collect the most points by assembling the strongest rebel team after two rounds. <br/>44 tiles (4 of each rebel and 8 showing Kylo Ren) are revealed one by one from the middle of the table (where the tiles are laid face-down as the set-up). Players may collect these tiles on their planets (3/4/6 in a 4/3/2-player game) simply by hitting on the rebel symbol when they decide they want the exposed tiles, after which they put the tiles on one of their planets. The process continues until all planets are full or all the tiles are revealed.<br/><br/>9 rebels (valued 1 to 5) and Kylo Ren (valued -5) can be collected by players who have the majority of tiles of the corresponding tile type. Characters with unresolved ties remain in the middle.<br/><br/>A second round is played in a similar fashion; tied characters remain in the middle or at the players who collected them in the first round. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>(The mechanism is a reimplementation of SWAT! but the scoring is completely different.)<br/><br/>",

One of the extra cards is put in the center, face down. The card in the center determines which card is the real culprit: it can be the highest numbered card or the lowest. Each player now has a chance to exchange his/her identity card with another player. This exchange is done by pointing another person (or the card in the center). If there are more than two players wanting the same card, both players simply lose his/her opportunity to exchange. If there is only one player who wants a specific card, he or she just takes it. After this exchange, everyone reveals his/her identity, and depending on the card in the center, one player is declared as the real criminal and eliminated from the game. Play continues this manner, until there is only one player remaining, who becomes the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

They each want to fight for control of the towers and the power they contain. The object of the game is to move your armies in and seize control of a majority of the towers on the island.  Each player takes on the role of one of the five Master Summoners, who each have their own strengths and weaknesses and can summon different combat units to the island.  They do this by managing four magical resources that they have available to them.  As units are summoned onto the island, they are moved about where they have a number of options available to them:  visiting temples where they can be blessed, traveling through four different domains, attacking other players' units, and occupying the different towers to attempt to maintain control over them.<br/><br/>The first player to garrison a unit in the correct number of towers and hold them for a turn against his sieging enemies wins!<br/><br/>Summonaria has been re-released with a new fully illustrated battle board and variant rules to further customize gameplay and this new version is available now.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player has an individual pad of paper with a 6x6 grid, with help areas around. This grid will be filled with letters, and all players will use the same set of letters. The aim is to create as many and as long words as possible, with big increases in points for longer words (number of points equals squared word length).<br/><br/>On your turn you roll 4 x d20 dice (custom ones, with letters + wildcard). You can pick three to roll again, then two out of those three to roll again, and finally a single one out of the last two for a final roll. Each die has a different distribution of letters on the sides (overview included), so if you need an &quot;F&quot; to complete a word, you need to roll the dice that have at least one side with &quot;F&quot;, but might keep a die with a letter you have use for in another spot. After rolling you choose one die, the letter on its top side must immediately be written by each player in their respective grid.<br/><br/>When the grid is full (36 turns, all become full at the same time), calculate points. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Some advanced rules with a timer are also included. The intention is to limit thinking time = waiting time to 30 seconds, and while doing so it adds an extra edge of stress to game. It can be used as much as the players like, from very aggressively for a speedy game to not at all.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.korso.se/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.korso.se/</a><br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s ideal for both family parties and late-night shenanigans. Players must select actions and words to be loud about. The goal is to quickly ACT OUT and SHOUT OUT those actions and words faster than your opponents.<br/><br/>Loud About is a new twist on the classic kid&rsquo;s game Menagerie from the UK.<br/><br/>In each round of Loud About, a Topic Card is drawn, for example &ldquo;Dance Moves&rdquo;. Everyone at the table then chooses a dance move and an action based on that dance move. The key is to remember everyone else&rsquo;s dance move and action.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player flips a card from the top of the deck, if the symbol matches with someone else card, a Face-Off occurs. In the Face-Off, the player who calls out and acts out the &ldquo;dance move&rdquo; of their opponent first, wins the card as a victory point. The player to collect the most victory cards wins the round.<br/><br/>REVIEWS<br/><br/>&ldquo;Your next favorite bar activity or party favor.&rdquo;<br/>&ndash; Ryan Smith (Red Eye Chicago Tribune)<br/><br/>&ldquo;Like Anomia, a cafe favorite, but uses memory and personalization to make it unique!

        "description": "Spell Wars is an intuitive, fast-paced strategy card game that is always entertaining and can be played by 2-4 players. Each player masters the eight schools of magic to defeat their opponents by dealing enough damage to reduce their Hit Points to 0. The deck comprises 64 cards, eight cards for each of the eight schools of magic found in DnD. Each of the eight cards has two different effects that allow for an almost unlimited combination of strategic decisions and outcomes.<br/><br/>You must eliminate your opponents by dealing enough damage to reduce their Hit Points to 0. Some cards deal damage, some help players avoid taking damage, still others heal, but all allow for strategic decisions.<br/><br/>The deck comprises 64 cards, eight from each of the eight schools of magic.<br/><br/>Each player has a number of Hit Points equal to the number of players, but a minimum of 3. A player who is reduced to 0 Hit Points is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>At the start of the game shuffle the cards and place them in a draw pile facedown on the table. All players draw 6 cards from the draw pile. Randomly pick a player to go first.<br/><br/>Players take their turns in clockwise order. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of the following phases:<br/><br/>Spellcasting Phase: A player can play up to 2 cards during their turn and only in the spellcasting phase. Abjuration cards (but not Illusion cards used as Abjuration cards) don&rsquo;t count towards this limit and can also be played during an opponent's spellcasting or monster phases, even interrupting other cards or actions.<br/><br/>Monster Phase: Each summoned monster may attack and deal 1 Hit Point of damage to a target player. A summoned monster can negate an attack by another monster, but both monsters must then be placed in the discard pile.<br/>Draw Phase: The player&rsquo;s turn ends by drawing 2 cards.<br/>Used, discarded, and eliminated players&rsquo; cards are placed facedown in the discard pile. Each player can look at the contents of the discard pile at any time during the game. Reshuffle the discard pile and use it as a new draw pile if the draw pile runs out of cards.<br/><br/>The last player who has Hit Points remaining wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Slime Adventure: The mystical forest is a card game in which one plays the slimes that evolves against all odds.<br/><br/>The Components:<br/><br/>The Slime Adventure: The mystical forest games comes with 97 playing cards and a rulebook in both English and Chinese. Everything is enclosed in a palm-sized box.<br/><br/>The Cards:<br/><br/>The playing cards consist of:<br/><br/>&bull; 1 Naked Gentleman card<br/><br/>&bull; 10 slime cards<br/><br/>&bull; 36 Adventurer cards<br/><br/>&bull; 30 combat cards<br/><br/>&bull; 20 mutation cards.<br/><br/>The slime cards dictates which slime represents the player in the game and give the player unique abilities depending on the types of slimes. The backsides of the slime cards also contain a game flow cheat sheet.<br/><br/>The adventurer cards is the enemy, resource and score counter. Your slime fights them, eats them, digest them and evolve off them !<br/><br/>The combat cards is the bread and butter of this game. There are three types of combat card representing three different types of attacks that are used by the slimes while fighting.<br/><br/>The mutation cards are additional special abilities the slimes may acquire after consuming adventurers.<br/><br/>They make the slime stronger. They are also considered while determining the winner.<br/><br/>Overall, the anime style artwork and JRPG references are quite appeasing.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game comes with a booklet that explains the rules in both Chinese and English. The rules are not too complicated and are well documented in the rulebook with examples and figures.<br/><br/>Box:<br/><br/>The box is of the nicely made and of the right size. It is approximately palm-sized but big enough for sleeved cards should you decide to put sleeves on them.<br/><br/>The Gameplay<br/><br/>In slime adventure, the players play as slimes with the goal of evolving to be the glorious slime that is ever to be.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a random slime card. The adventurer cards are sorted into six decks and ordered according to the numbers on the upper right corner. Each player is dealt 3 combat cards from the shuffled combat deck. The top three cards of the mutation deck are revealed after shuffling the mutation deck.<br/><br/>Phase of Play:<br/><br/>Each player can perform the following during their turn:<br/><br/>&bull; Combat<br/><br/>&bull; Action<br/><br/>&bull; Transformation.<br/><br/>During the combat phase, the player fights the adventurers with combat cards. Should the player win, the adventurer card is \\&quot;consumed\\&quot; and may later be used to purchase mutations. Should the player be defeated, his/her slime is removed from the game and regenerates in the next turn. Other players may also raise the combat difficulties when certain conditions are met.<br/><br/>During the action phase, the player may move his/her own slime, the adventurer decks or purchase the revealed mutation cards by spending adventurer cards.<br/><br/>During the transformation phase, the player may discard and refill the cards in his/her hand.<br/><br/>The game ends whenever<br/><br/>&bull; a player accumulates six mutation cards<br/><br/>&bull; less than 4 adventurers remain at the end of any player\\'s turn.<br/><br/>In the former situation, the player with six mutation cards wins. In the later situation, the winner is<br/><br/>decided based on the mutations each player has and the adventurers they defeated.<br/><br/>The Game Design<br/><br/>The slime adventure is a party game that is easy to learn. However, it also enjoys a satisfactory strategy depth by employing a system where the card placement opens up many different options for the players. Similar to many other games in this genre, one can win either by focusing on progressing toward the victory condition or denying other players. The random components play a huge role in this game, as it should. However, players are not knocked out of the game before the game ends. Hence, \\&quot;poor hands\\&quot; are more bearable. Overall, the slime adventure is quite fun and contains quite some humorous JRPG references. If you like both card games and JRPG, you might want to check this game out.<br/><br/>",

The board consists of four interlocking parts depicting the southern parts of the UK.  Unusually, the board is split into squares rather than the more traditional hexes.  There are resource generating squares, mystical sites and castles.  Players must manage these resources an fight battles to become the king of all England.  The mystical sites contain guardians which must be fought in order to capture the holy grail.  Riddles must also be answered correctly.  Battles are dice and table driven affairs.<br/><br/>The boards are heavy and in keeping with the theme.  The counters are very thin and insubstantial.  There are two dice, 150 knight counters, 150 foot soldier counters, 150 standard counters, 84 gold coin counters, 9 magic tokens, 16 guardian cards, 47 cards of fortune, 36 riddle cards and 6 wipe clean record sheets.<br/><br/>",

The player places one of the points of the divider in the start hole. The divider is then rotated until a hole matching the radius of the divider is found. There are multiple hole at this radius. One of the holes is chosen and the other point of the divider is rotated until another hole is found and chosen. This continues alternating points of the divider until the goal is reached.<br/><br/>An interesting solo game that seems more like a puzzle. Re-playability is somewhat limited as there are only two different boards.<br/><br/>The game could be extended to multiple players by keeping track of the number of times that the divider points are placed in new holes.

Then you'll love playing Anger Management, the subversively humorous board game that encourages players to lighten up and laugh at all the things that drive us all crazy as they whine their way to victory. The fun begins with each player choosing a comically infuriated Rage-O-Meter scorecard character, such as Tina Tantrum or Furious Frank. Next, a player spins the &quot;Spinning Out of Control&quot; spinner to determine one of five Anger Management categories. Soon players are choosing what bugs them most or who's their least favorite or which of their fellow players is the winning whiner. But watch out for &quot;Mood Swings,&quot; a randomizer category that can send Players' temperature levels up or down or even make them switch Rage-O-Meters. Talk about an identity crisis! Talk about fun! Anger Management&mdash;What's your problem?<br/><br/>",

With 2-6 players, each person draws a randomly selected character card with health and damage stats, and a random vehicle card. There are 12 unique Angel, Human and Demon Hunter character cards, each with different stats for health and damage and different benefits based on species<br/><br/>Throughout the game you can collect item cards that modify your health or damage, and collect trunk cards which are like spells that you can save and cast during your turn to help you or hinder other hunters. If you die during the course of a fight, you will have to go to Purgatory until you roll a 3 and return to the start of the game without any of your worldly possessions.<br/><br/>Players travel the game board to hunt down monsters. Monsters are drawn at random along with other Event cards for an element of surprise. The more monsters you kill, the more lives you save. If you kill a particularly dangerous monster, you'll save more lives in the process, and win the game faster. The first hunter to save 10 lives wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Place 1 marker on the <br/>1 Shelving Unit Track space and 1 marker on the $3 space on the <br/>$ Track. 4 of the remaining markers will be used to mark Add-ons purchased. The other 4 markers will be used to mark a player&rsquo;s owned games on the Collections Tracks. The 2 dice are given to the player who was chosen to go first. The first player will be the one who has most recently been to their favorite local gameshop.<br/><br/>Play: Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of three phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1 Upkeep: Pay the listed upkeep fee on each of your Shelving Units. For each Shelving Unit a player cannot pay the fee for they must move a marker back 2 spaces on a Collection Track of their choice. Players do not pay the Upkeep fee on their first turn.<br/><br/>Phase 2 Dice: The player rolls the 2 dice and they may then reroll any die or dice an additional two times.<br/><br/>Dice are then used as follows: <br/>(Note: dice faces 1 (red) and 2 (yellow) do not count as Collection Track colors)<br/><br/>A. Move a marker, adding games to a colored Collection Track matching one die color rolled (3 (orange) 4 (green) 5 (blue) 6 (purple)). The amount moved will be equal to 1/2 the value of the other die, rounded up.<br/><br/>B. Move a marker one space on a Collection Track matching one die color (3 4 5 6), and add the other die&rsquo;s value to your $ Track.<br/><br/>C. Add both die values to your $ Track. Your opponent then moves a marker on any one of your Collection Tracks back 1 space.<br/><br/>For each Shelving Unit a player owns, they may move past the        space (this space shows the first VP scoring amount on each track) on one Collection Track. They may not move past this space on an additional Collection Track until they own an additional Shelving Unit.<br/><br/>Phase 3 Expand: The current player may now purchase 1 Add-on and/or 1 Shelving Unit if they have the money to do so. Pay the listed cost and move the marker down that amount on the $ Track. Place a marker in the space next to the purchased Add-on. The first player to purchase a listed Add-on receives a $1 discount off the purchase price. The dice are then passed to the other player.<br/><br/>Add-ons: 1 Add-on may be purchased by a player each turn. <br/>The first player to purchase a listed add-on receives a $1 discount off the purchase price. Score VP at game end.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends when 1 player purchases all 4 Add-ons or<br/>when a player reaches the maximum VP space on one Collection Track. The player&rsquo;s opponent may then take 1 final turn.<br/><br/>Score each Collection Track you own a Shelving Unit for. Each track shows a VP number in a circle next to certain spaces on that track. Score the highest VP value reached or passed on a Collection Track.<br/><br/>Score additional VP for any purchased Add-ons the player has.<br/><br/>Highest VP score wins!<br/><br/>",

He sits in the centre of the board firing hay bales out of a tractor in the hope of knocking over the pigs and sending them back to the start.<br/><br/>Movement is dice based. The six-sided die has numbers 1-4, with two sides showing both the 2 and the tractor. In a turn, a player rolls a die and either moves a pig forward, or, if s/he rolled a tractor, may shoot the hay at any of the pigs on the field. If a pig gets hit and moves off its space, it is returned to one of the mudpits and has to start again from there. Pigs may ride piggyback on other pigs.<br/><br/>The first player to move his/her three pigs to the feeding place is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The investigator must keep on defeating them until there are not enough (fewer then 4) cultists left to complete the ritual. The investigator must deduce the elder signs connected to each cultist in order to defeat them.<br/><br/>A game consists of several rounds in which the cult leader and the investigator take alternating turns playing their cards.<br/><br/>If there are 4 cultists in play simultaneously, a Great Old One is placed at the end of the row. If the investigator cannot deduce all the remaining face-down ritual cards in his next turn right away (without revealing a card) the dark ritual is complete and the cult leader wins the game.<br/><br/>If the investigator manages to defeat 5 cultists by deducing all the ritual cards allocated to them, the cultists will not have enough power to summon their master and the investigator wins.<br/><br/>Face-2-Face was specifically designed with Essen Spiel &lsquo;19 in mind.<br/><br/>",

Complete a substance naturally (without the use of the ninth wild-card element, Meta) and earn bonus gems that can be used to complete other substances. Earn the most points, and you win!<br/><br/>What actions you take each turn depend on your dice roll. Roll doubles and earn a bonus effect!

Creatures (the picture cards, Jack, Queen &amp; King) represent creatures of the underworld.<br/>   3. Aces represent your finely honed adventuring skills.<br/><br/>If you escape the Dungeon or all of your opponents are dead, then you win!<br/><br/>Download the rules here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/392/dungeon-update\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/392/dungeon-update</a><br/><br/>",

The goal is still world domination, battle resolutions are based on the luck of dice, and the theme remains vaguely Napoleonic.  However, there are significant and interesting differences.  Most important is the use of simultaneous planning and execution of attacks.  Players write down their plans, and once revealed, battles are resolved in a prescribed fashion.  Also of note is the addition of several territories and connection points, changing the values of continents and making them more difficult to hold; yes, gone are the days of establishing an easy bastion in Australia.  The dice rules are significantly different, using 12-sided dice of various strength.  And still, there are other alterations that change the nature of the game, yet it retains the flavor of Risk.  Simply put, you are still playing Risk, but you no longer have to wait an hour between turns before you can play again; now it is always your turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Ogaden War pitted Ethiopia and Somalia against each other for control of a desert plateau, populated by nomadic shepherds, on the border between the two states. Taking advantage of the revolution which has just ousted Ha&iuml;li&eacute; Selassie from power in Ethiopia, Somalia launched two liberation movements supported by it to conquer this territory. Faced with their failure, the government then committed its conventional forces from July 1977 to recover this province. This conflict took place in three phases: an insurrectional phase between May and July 1977, a conventional phase from July 1977 to January 1978, then from this date, an Ethiopian counter-offensive which will recover the ground lost until March 1978.<br/><br/>This conflict doubles as a ballet opposing the Soviet bloc to the Western powers. But it also pits two Soviet allied countries against each other. The USSR will choose Ethiopia against Somalia, which will allow the reversal of the military situation on the ground.<br/><br/>This simulation uses modified and simplified rules from the game Angola 1987-1988 (VaeVictis 154). The game is won on diplomatic terrain. Tipping international organizations (UN, OAU, Arab League) to one&rsquo;s side has a direct impact on victory but the Somali player can achieve military victory before Soviet and Cuban aid tilts the victory to the Ethiopian side.<br/><br/>Better than President Siad Barr&eacute;, will you be able to conquer this irredentist land that constitutes the Ogaden? Or like Colonel Mengistu will you be able to maintain the integrity of the Ethiopian Empire.<br/><br/>",

And it has the mechanism of hidden values for the pieces, just like Stratego.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player places his pieces as he wishes. The value of each piece is hidden from the opponent. The 'Z' piece is placed on the fixed base point, and therefore known to the opponent. The goal is to capture the opponents&rsquo; 'Z' piece.<br/><br/>Each turn a player can move one of his pieces one place, either straight or diagonal. Or a player can use his turn to uncover the value of one of his pieces. He then turns the piece upside down and can play with it according to its true value.<br/><br/>There are null-pieces, an arrow-piece, cross pieces and plus pieces. All have different movement behavior but until they are revealed they all move like the null-piece.<br/><br/>The surprise of the game is that it can move slow and carefully or it has fast and open attacks.<br/><br/>",

Currently, this &quot;magic moment&quot; has not yet been implemented well enough. We have already talked about ideas to have the hats lifted up by a magnet built into the magic wand.

Each turn consists of random events (generated by die rolls), followed by allocating of 8 new &quot;factors&quot; to their nation's attributes, followed by actions on the board.  There are strategic resources (oil, gold, coal, ore, and rare minerals) which affect the allocation of factors and/or movement on the board.  Combat can occur between nations using military factors from the nations' attributes, resolution done by drawing as many numbered chits for losses as there are opposing military factors.  These can be modified by die roll, if desired.  Negotiation between players for resources, military assistance, travel routes, etc., is highly encouraged and virtually required by the design of the game.<br/><br/>From the designer October 24, 2009:<br/>MegaNation continues with Collegiate Edition 3.3 and a simplified &quot;Family Edition&quot; for the &quot;little and older folks&quot;!<br/><br/>",

The Merchant Vessel cards each have a number. When turned in at the Market, the number is announced and each player will mark said number on their BINGO card. The first player to get 5 in a row wins. The introduction of Magic Cards and several spaces on the board with various effects adds a random element to the game.<br/><br/>",

In the former case, players each start with eight chips (1-4 x2) in their color and in the latter case they have 18 chips (1-6 x3). The chips have the reverse color on the other side, and the digit on the opposite side is 7-x, with &quot;x&quot; being the number on the front side.<br/><br/>The board starts with two red chips (1 &amp; 2) and two black chips (3 &amp; 4) in the central square. Red starts, then players alternate turns. On a turn, a player places a chip on the board as long as it sandwiches at least one of the opponent's chips and flips it; to flip a chip, the sum of the sandwiching chips must be higher than the sum of the chip(s) being sandwiched. One tricky aspect, though, is that the sums of the chips are taken mod 10, so if you sandwich one or more chips with a 5 and 6, then your total is actually 1 (1 = 11 mod 10), so you couldn't flip the sandwiched chips unless they summed to 10 (since 10 mod 10 = 0).<br/><br/>If you can't flip a chip, you must pass. The game ends when the board is full or when both players have passed. Whoever has more chips of their color showing wins; if the players are tied, then they sum the digits showing on their chips and the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

Besides the soldiers featured in Lu Zhan Jun Qi, this game also features ships, planes and land features like tanks. The board also features a sea to accommodate the naval pieces.<br/>Like Army Chess, it is a game for two players but requires a third person to act as umpire in resolving battle.

        "description": "Designed to cash in on the popular remake of the classic sci-fi movie Planet of the Apes, the object of this game is to collect a set of items which will allow you to be the first to escape the planet through a time portal.  The playing surface comprises 20 modular board units which are shuffled prior to play and therefore create a randomized labyrinth planet to be explored.  120 push-out cardboard tiles  represent hidden bonuses and hazards and three special dice decide the combat and range of movement. Exploration elements work well and ensure no two games are the same. Dressing the board with the rather fiddly little tiles each time a new part of the maze is uncovered can become tedious. The cumulative effect of collected weapons can render a lucky player almost invincible very quickly, with the chimp warriors soon becoming superfluous and little more than an irritation.<br/><br/>A reasonable strategic exploration game for the younger player.<br/><br/>",

L&ouml;st das R&auml;tsel von Schr&auml;ghausen! now has a portable version of its own: Wer war's? Das 2. Abenteuer - Mitbringspiel.<br/><br/>In this game, a goblin has cast a spell on all the children in town, locking them in their houses and &ndash; more importantly for the game &ndash; making them forget who owns the dog Bronco. Your goal is to find out which child owns Bronco so that the pooch can go home, get something to eat, and perhaps even wrangle a bit a ear-scritchin' from his young owner.<br/><br/>To set up the town, lay out ten houses in a four-row grid, with intersection tiles placed between the houses. Shuffle the children tokens, then set one aside and place one next to each house. Shuffle the ten keys face-down, and place one on each house.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first roll the die, which allows a peek at a key or a free move of Bronco to any house, or forces the clock to advance an hour or the intersections next to Bronco to rotate, possibly cutting off access to nearby houses. The player then moves Bronco to an adjacent house, if desired, then reveals any key on the board. If that key matches the house where Bronco is currently located, that child is freed and the number of suspects as to who owns Bronco drops by one; if the key doesn't match, return it face-down to its previous location and advance the clock by one hour.<br/><br/>The game ends one of two ways: Either the players free all of the children and therefore deduce which child remains as the owner of Bronco, or the clock hits 12; in this latter situation, the children can make one guess as to who owns Bronco, then reveal the hidden child. If correct, they win! If not, Bronco heads to the pound to live out the rest of his life filled with sorrow and self-loathing...<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Wer war's?: Löst das Rätsel von Schräghausen!<br/><br/><br/>",

You will need to switch, shuffle and &quot;pivit&quot; your tiles to place them all and claim the highest scoring stick.<br/><br/><br/>Each tile features one of six different colors and one of six different designs. Every player draws 24 tiles, and then races the other players to complete an interlocking grid with those tiles. A row or column in the grid must contain at least three tiles, and the tiles must feature either all the same design or all the same color. If the designs in a row or column are the same, then all the colors must be different, and vice versa. Players may discard tiles and draw replacements if they have trouble completing their grids. Players score according to the order in which they completed their grids. The first player to 24 points wins.<br/><br/>",

For flavor, each suit represents a different city, and each card is named (Mayor, Chief, Commissioner, Detective, etc.).<br/><br/>Players bid for the right to make trump (in game terms... choice of Police).  The dealer may take the bid, or refuse. If the bid is taken, the first card lead becomes trump for the round.  The game continues until all tricks are played. Players score one point per trick taken, plus an additional five points if they recovered the 'Lost Heir'.  A player loses three points if they recover the 'Wrong Boy'. The player who won the bid for the round gets no points if he did not match his bid.<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of rounds... the first player to 40 points wins.<br/><br/>The game had two major versions in the 19th and early 20th century, the original American edition (with the cities being New York, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia or Buffalo), and the Canadian version (with the cities being Montr&eacute;al, Toronto, Winnipeg and Halifax). The game was reimplemented in Qu&eacute;bec in 1914 as Joffre (aka Shoo le Kaiser) and recently in the Georgian Bay area of Ontario as The Big Buck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the box &amp; introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Knights and Knaves is a game for four or more players. It simulates, in a general way, the intricate relationships of the lords and vassals of a large, loosely organized Empire located somewhere in Central Europe during the High Middle Ages (ca. 1200-1400). The players try to gain wealth, power and rank while building smaller, more cohesive kingdoms within the Empire for themselves. The game contains a complete and fairly simple set of basic rules and a considerable number of optional rules. These permit infinite variations. A game usually takes from one and a half to two hours.&quot;<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/>  Soldiery Payment - players pay the rental for the mercenary companies they control; those he is unable to pay he must auction off; any unowned mercenary companies are auctioned<br/>  Movement and Combat - You must have the permission of a realm's owner in order to move troops through it. Movement into a realm whose owner has refused you permission constitutes an attack on that realm.<br/>  Taxation - players receive taxes from realms they hold; an optional rule allows for tax gouging and revolts<br/>  Election - If either or both the offices of Emperor and Patriarch are vacant, an election is held for each vacant office. Any player who receives at least a third of the votes in an election gains the office; thus there might be as many as three Emperors or Patriarchs; if no player gets at least a third of the votes, the office remains empty.<br/><br/>The map shows only the Empire's political divisions - there is no terrain. It looks like an island, as nothing beyond the Imperial boundaries is shown. The Empire is made up of 68 realms, 60 of which are actually shown on the map (with such colorful names as The Aylemark, The League of Urf Durfal[Gerg Costikyan is listed among the play testers], the Kingdom of Hydanderabad, the Barony of Pfennig-Halfpfennig, the County of Pollenzo-Montenevoso...).  There are six extinct realms; if the player holding the title to an extinct realm gains control of all the realms that make it up, he may revive it, gaining its income, electoral votes and militia.  The two remaining realms are the Empire itself (held by the Emperor) and the Patrimony of Polykarp (held by the Patriarch, head of the Imperial Church). The Emperor can issue the Imperial Ban, and the Patriarch can excommunicate players. The game effect of both of these actions is to force the affected player to make a roll to see whether he can collect some, none or all of his revenues during each taxation period until the ban or excommunication is lifted.<br/><br/>Players perform game actions in order of the precedence of their highest title. The current Emperor goes first, followed by the Patriarch, then Kings and on down through the ranks to the Lord Mayors of free cities. When players' highest ranks are identical, then their second highest ranks are compared, and, if necessary, lesser ranks. Electors have precedence over non-electors, so an Elector-Duke would have precedence over a non-elector Duke.<br/><br/>The basic game has two types of troops: Militia Levies and Mercenary Companies.  Milita are not represented by counters on the map, and only fight in their home realms.  There are 20 mercenary companies, with names like O'Malleys Lancers, The Baratarian Archers, Gustodud's Free Companions, The Titanian Guards and Redmohr's Pikes. All but seven are &quot;venture companies;&quot; they have a home realm, and the current lord of that realm (who isn't necessarily the same person who employs them) may veto their use in combat. The rest are free companies, which may always be used in combat without restriction. There is also an optional rule for Regular Soldiery, which are recruited from realms under a player's control. Like mercenaries, these are represented by counters on the map and may move.<br/><br/>Combat is unusual in that troops are never eliminated. If a player's army is defeated, he must pay ransom for his troops; if unable to play, the opposing player captures and gains control of them. The loser may also be forced to retreat; if unable to retreat, he must pay double the ransom. If the player's noble is present, ransom is also doubled. If a noble is captured (due to being unable to pay ransom), the capturing player &quot;may do as he wishes to the prisoner, including allowing him to be ransomed, selling him to another player, or murdering him.&quot; A noble who dies is succeeded by his heir, who inherits all lands not held as fiefs from other players, all his troops and half his treasury.<br/><br/>Negotiation is encouraged. &quot;The players may negotiate anything and everything within the framework of the rules.&quot; Players may sell, lend or lease their troops, and may sell realms or grant them to other players as fiefs.<br/><br/>Victory is determined in three categories - Most Powerful(most troops), Most Noble(most titles), and Richest - so there can be as many as three winners<br/><br/>Some of the optional rules: single combat, mutinous mercenaries, assassination and conspiracy, plague, special events and even magic.<br/><br/>It is also recommended as being suitable for the background of a miniatures campaign in the medieval or Renaissance period.<br/><br/>",

Turn the cogs gently, don't spin them.&quot; I pleaded.<br/><br/>Now Samuel is a great playtester and since he seemed obsessed with his spinning discovery, and wasn't about to stop any time soon, I decided it was best to follow his lead.<br/><br/>So there we were spinning the cog mechanism harder and faster when suddenly the smallest cog jumped from its hole and spun by itself.  Well that was it, Samuel completely dismantled the wooded mechanism and began spinning each cog individually. Biting my lip, I reluctantly joined in and a game which resembled the classic 'Battling Tops' ensued.<br/><br/>I gradually warmed to the abuse of my cogs, however, our makeshift board was littered with 5mm holes and the spinning cogs would fall as they cross them. Samuel thought this was great and he called them holes of DOOM!<br/><br/>",

A fast-paced competitive card &amp; dice game for 3-6 players ages 10 &amp; up.<br/><br/>Vampsylvania is a card and dice game set in a lighthearted world of monsters and mayhem. In Vampsylvania, you&rsquo;re a newly-risen vampire ready to take the world by the throat. Unfortunately, you&rsquo;ve risen in the most vampire-savvy place on Earth. Hunting here isn&rsquo;t gonna be easy. The villagers are tough, and they&rsquo;re loaded with anti-vamp weapons, skills, and allies. And to make matters worse, your fellow vamps keep trying to sabotage you, too!<br/><br/>Game play is pretty simple. Each round&mdash;which we call a Hunt&mdash;a new Villager is revealed. Players compete to capture the Villager by playing bonuses on themselves to raise their Vamp score, which increases their chances of capturing a Villager. But players can also complicate things for other each other. Spoiler cards can be used to lower a player&rsquo;s Vamp score, or even take a player out completely&hellip;for now, anyway. Some spoilers make Villagers tougher, which makes things harder for everyone, but if you think you alone have the cards to pull it off, it might be just the edge you need.<br/><br/>Once everyone has played their cards, everyone rolls dice and adds the result to their Vamp score; if you get a high enough score, you capture the villager! Capture enough Villagers, and you win the game. Don&rsquo;t get cocky, though. Villagers will often escape the Hunt without being captured, and end up in the Angry Mob pile. If enough Villagers end up in the Angry Mob, all the players lose and the Villagers win! Like we said, winning here isn&rsquo;t gonna be easy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Continent Race by Byron&rsquo;s Games is a world geography board game that features the national flags of countries throughout the world. The game is for 2+ players, ages 7 and up. It&rsquo;s a race, and the first player to collect the required number of country cards from each continent wins the game. Supporting materials include Maps, Mystery Continent cards, Antarctica wild cards with special privileges, and there is an option to do a one-on-one challenge between 2 players to enhance the learning. The game is color-coded for easier access for children and allows for younger players to take part too. Continent Race is a collaborative way to learn world geography and promotes problem solving skills, goal achievement, and focused play. Continent Race is the recipient of 4 game awards.<br/><br/>For the basic level of play, the game is complete once a player collects the necessary number of country cards for three continents. Two cards must be collected from Australia/Oceania and four cards each from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Europe. For the advanced level of the game is complete once a player collects the required number of cards for five continents. At this level, Orange Mystery cards can be shuﬄed into the deck to increase the level of diﬃculty. Players must first determine which continent a Mystery card belongs to (using maps and other players as resources), then use the card as you would any other country card to complete a continent group. Also at the advanced level, Challenge play is an option, where one player invites another player to face oﬀ with cards that feature the Challenge symbol. Each challenger gets to review the Continent List or Map and then, from memory, each player must name as many countries as s/he can recall from that continent by taking turns saying the names of countries aloud, until one player gets stumped. The winner of the challenge gets to draw additional cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay starts with the dealer dealing 7 cards, face down, to each player. On each turn, a player draws one card and discards one card face up. Each time a player discards, s/he must announce the country name and continent of the discarded card. On each turn, a player selects one card from the draw pile and decides if they want to keep it or discard it. If a player picks a country card that matches one of his/her continents and the country card completes one of the continent groups, then the player has successfully completed a continent group and must place the continent group on the table, face up, and announce the names of the countries in the continent group. (You can review phonetic pronunciations on our site.) Next, the player must replace, from the draw pile, the number of cards s/he laid down in order to bring the player&rsquo;s hand back to 7 cards. Then, it&rsquo;s the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>The ﬁrst person to collect the required number of country cards for each continent group is mere steps from winning the game! To fully complete the game, the winner MUST call out and locate on the maps the countries they&rsquo;ve drawn throughout the game. Others may continue playing for 2nd, 3rd, 4th place&hellip; for an enhanced learning experience.<br/><br/>Continent Race was created by young Byron, just 6 years old at the time, during a month-long stay at a children&rsquo;s hospital. Not only was Byron receiving treatment for an unexpected illness, he was receiving something else entirely: The inspiration to help kids like him learn and have fun through their hospital stay and beyond. Byron&rsquo;s dream came to life in December 2018&mdash;with the help of a Kickstarter campaign, we sent Continent Race to over 130 children&rsquo;s hospitals nationwide. NBC covered the story on Byron and his game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Find out when you play Baseball Tycoon!<br/><br/>Signing ballplayers, dealing with free agents, comping with injuries and player suspensions, season ending strikes; in Baseball Tycoon you're faced with the same challenges that modern-day owners tackle as they try to win a championship.   There are six different types of ballplayers you can sign, from Scrubs to Ultrastars.   As you sign players, you draw performance cards to see how well they perform.  You collect money from ticket sales, your TV contracts, and licensing deals.   The amount you collect depends on how good your team is and the quality of your stadium and contracts.  You're in a race against other owners to see who can build a championship team and reach the Winner's Circle first!<br/><br/>",

You win or lose via the seizure of (or failure to seize) key areas on the map. You are cast in the role of US Sixth Army commander Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger. In turn, you&rsquo;re under considerable time pressure from theater commander Gen. Douglas MacArthur (portrayed passive-aggressively by the victory conditions and six-turn limit) to be finished with the major portion of the campaign no later than the end of March.

The end of game card is shuffled into the bottom of the deck, and the deck is then placed face down on the table. The dealer looks at the top card and places the first bid on the item. Each player then in turn may either bid or pass. Once a person passes, they may not re-enter the bidding. The player with the highest bid pays the bank and receives the item - placing it face-up in front of him.<br/><br/>If the card is a 0,4, or 5 and is sold for more than 300,000, the auctioneer receives $100,000 from the bank.<br/><br/>The game then continues with the next player in clockwise order from the auctioneer looking at the next card and beginning the next auction round.<br/><br/>The game ends when the &quot;game end&quot; card is drawn.

Each player drops three plastic balls of their respective color into the closest section; the balls have small holes on their surfaces. Each player is given two small plastic spear-like devices which are used to maneuver the balls over the dividing wall into the opponent's section.<br/><br/>The first person to get their three balls over the dividing wall wins the round. The first person to win three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules also suggest that teams of two can compete, with each player given one plastic spear.<br/><br/>",

On top of all that players must earn money to pay for their trip by competing in various beach style games. Landing on a competition square brings the VCR sequence into play. The tape consists of short clips of various sports that either end well and result in a cash prize or crash and burn and that&rsquo;s not good. The first player to make it to the end with one hundred dollars for a plane ticket home wins the game.<br/>This is a beach bums dream game, but also lots of fun for those landlocked people who have never even seen the ocean.

When a player can form an integer with the cards in their hand, they play the cards and earn points equal to the integer formed multiplied by the number of cards used.<br/><br/>The victory point chips show divisions of eighths on them, and players can earn additional points through combining these fractional points into further integers. (e.g. 2 points and 6 points can be viewed as 2/8 and 6/8 and together make 8/8, so an additional point is earned.)  The game ends when the victory chips or cards are gone, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Then, that player makes the expression on the matching cards, only using their face! Guess correctly to win points. Will you be happy or surprised with your guess?<br/><br/>There are 13 numbered sets of 3 cards each; each set is showing a feeling (happy, said, afraid, etc.). Each player starts with a number of cards and passes one of them on to the next player (simultaneously). All cards are picked up and a player who has a complete set calls &quot;Stop&quot;. Then he or she shows the feeling on the set (only with his or her face, no words or hands). The other players take turns guessing. The first player who guesses correctly gets one of the cards as a point; the player who showed the emotion gets the other two and draws a new card. Then the next card is passed on. Repeat until there are no more cards in the stack and a player has less than 3 hand cards. Whoever collected most cards wins.<br/><br/>A completely different game is described for 2 - 4 players. It is a Memory variant in which cards are flipped over so only the next player can see it and has to show the emotion as above. As in the traditional memory, a player who can flip over two matching cards gets a point, whoever has most points in the end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Adomoc is an abstract strategy board game for two players. Each player has a &quot;breed&quot; of fifteen playing pieces of which there are three types: a foot, a moon, and a sun. The game is played on a circular board with eighty-one spaces arranged in nine concentric cycles. The goal is to move one's prime sun from the outer edge of the board, to the centre.<br/><br/>Adomoc games tend to involve a fair amount of motion. Players may conceptualize strategies that focus on organizing movement as opposed to blocking the opponent's movement. Because both players are aiming for the same goal and can in some situations use an opposing piece to aid a win, the game incorporates a collaborative ebb-and-flow.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns. Each of the three types of playing piece have a particular pattern in which it can move. Feet can move around the cycles or back and forth along columns from cycle-to-cycle. Moons can move in spiral patterns between cycles, and suns can move in any of the directions. The pieces can behave in three different ways. These behaviours are: originating (sending an opponent's or one's own piece back to an origin space), consuming (removing an opponent's piece from play), and attracting (holding a foot in place).<br/><br/>Adomoc was originally invented in 2001 and has evolved such that there are two variants to the official rules. Adomoc rules promote thinking beyond dual polarities. Its design reflects universal symbols that are grounding and expand beyond the concrete immediacy of common human experience. The game's rules and designs are available under both Creative Commons licences and the unique Adomoc Artisan Licence (AAL), which enables other people to produce their own Adomoc sets. Adomoc also has a standard notation, which enables it be played by correspondence.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns to be read one fact from a card, chosen by a die roll, and must decide if that fact is true or false. If they are correct they keep the card used, if they are wrong the card is returned to the bottom of the deck. Confident players may 'bet' 1, 2 or 3 cards on their answer; if they are correct they will receive this many extra cards from the current deck, if they are wrong they must pay that many cards back to the deck.<br/><br/>Once each deck is exhausted, the player with the most cards from that deck in front of them is declared the winner of that deck, and play moves to the next deck. Once all three decks have been worked through, the game ends. If any player was declared the winner of at least two of the three decks, they win the game. Note that this may not be the player who won the most cards over the whole game. If no player was the winner of at least two of the three decks, then whoever has the most cards in front of them wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Every round is completely random, immature, inappropriate, and sometimes shame inducing.<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/><br/>It's easy. The player up draws Subject cards and everyone else has to guess whether that person likes or dislikes each card. The person with the most correct guesses wins, and draws a CoolCat card. The person with the least correct guesses loses, and draws an AssHat card. If there's a tie, a Tiebreaker card is drawn to determine the winner or loser. All you have to do is grab a drink, grab some friends, and enjoy.<br/><br/>",

The contents include: 28 FULL color Printed Sheets (front &amp; back) of the following 4 designs-Clouds, Vampire, Airplane, Pizza Slice; a DIE; 4 Plane templates; 4 Plastic Planes markers; Rules/Folding Instructions; and a colorful mounted 8 inches by 22 inches mapboard. <br/> Players roll a DIE and move their marker along their track and along the way, they have to make paper planes and compete in various tasks, such as LOOPS, Time Aloft, Target, and Distance. There are 4 separate tracks with the name of one of the paper plane designs and a player has to use the type of plane whose track they are on. Some planes are better at a certain Task but depending on the one landed on, each plane has to attempt to perform it.  Object of the game is to reach Finish first(and retain your sanity is a BONUS!) It can be played inside or outdoors, but NOT recommended during High Winds events or adverse Weather conditions.<br/><br/>",

You're in a team of three or more players. Pick a teammate to be the &quot;guesser.&quot; You and the remaining teammates are given a mystery word.

The object is to have more of your color skystones on the grid than your opponent.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 5 skystone cards dealt from a shuffled deck, and players take turns placing one of their cards with their color face up into any open space on the board. When a player places their skystone next to one or more of an opponent's skystones a battle takes place. If the attacking player wins, the defending player must flip their skystone so that it now shows the attacking player's color. Play continues until all 9 spaces are filled. The player with the most skystones of their color is the victor.<br/><br/>",
