        "description": "Carolingian Twilight: Decline of an Empire AD814 is a two to six-player game covering the decline of the Carolingian Empire following the death of Charlemagne (Charles the Great) in AD 814. The Salic Law of the Franks required that at a man&rsquo;s death, his property was divided among all his sons, which led to civil wars among Charlemagne&rsquo;s descendants when the inheritance in question was the Empire itself. From the various wills, wars and treaties dividing and redistributing the Empire during the 800s, emerged the nuclei of the modern states of France, Germany, and Italy.<br/><br/>Each of the 10 scenarios depicts the period following a particular division of the empire, with each player taking on the role of one of the heirs. The object of the game is to reunite the Empire under a single ruler, while fending off not only fraternal Frankish rivals, but also the hostile surrounding foreign powers. Each game turn represents 1 year. The map scale is one inch to 75 miles. Each area is an historical region. Each unit represents 100-5000 soldiers (plus camp followers, etc.).<br/><br/>Components: One 22 x 34-inch game map 280 1/2-inch counters.<br/><br/>Published in S&amp;T #342 Sept-Oct 2023.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sprout is a cooperative adventure strategy game about restoration and landscape creation. Instead of saving a world from the threat of impending destruction, players take on the role of four characters who find an already destroyed world and bring it back to life through peaceful actions such as walking, planting, and clearing away ash. (Well&hellip;. there&rsquo;s also a threat of impending destruction. More on that in a bit.)<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of four &ldquo;lifelings&rdquo;, elemental sprites with the power to create life wherever they walk. When a lifeling pawn moves across the board, they trace their path by placing hexagon tiles that match their element. (Grass, water, soil, or ice) The tiles interact and stack, creating a unique, colorful map on every playthrough. Players must hurry to cover the entire map, called &ldquo;the Barren&rdquo;, with these &ldquo;life tiles&rdquo; before the end of twelve rounds, or else they lose the game by the volcano at the center of the Barren erupting.<br/><br/>Complicating the strategy, four enemy characters called the &ldquo;flamelings&rdquo; move around the board with randomized paths determined by dice rolls. Flamelings remove (&ldquo;burn away&rdquo;) life tiles wherever their tokens move and can also knock out lifelings, cause explosions, and spread ash tiles (which must be removed for the players to win). Players must work together, using their actions, unique special abilities, and tile interactions to avoid, trap, and distract the flamelings, who can respawn even after being knocked out.<br/><br/>The randomness of the enemy&rsquo;s movements, as well as the unique landscapes created by players, necessitates new strategies every playthrough. For experienced players, difficulty can be adjusted by lowering the number of rounds the players have to accomplish their goal.<br/><br/>This game is appropriate for players who enjoy whimsical storytelling, light role playing, ticking-clock challenges, and the satisfaction of placing the last piece of a puzzle.<br/><br/>",

When the ratio of the tile colors matches the requirement of the workshop, you may deliver the tiles to your design card and &quot;carry-over&quot; the remaining tiles to the next workshop.<br/><br/>Choose the tiles wisely, arrange your design cards in the right place, and &quot;recycle&quot; your remaining tiles efficiently are the keys to score the most points and win the game.<br/><br/>Majolica: Revised Edition is the new edition of Majolica@2018.

You will have to bring as many territories to your side as possible by planning a careful strategy or trying to outwit your opponents. But if things get bad, you can always change sides! Set in the Roman provinces, among the Celtic tribes, in the dominions of medieval Italy, in the territories of the Inca Empire, in the Ottoman court, or in pre-industrial England, Dominance is a game of majorities with the outcome always hanging in the balance until the end.<br/><br/>There are three factions that claim dominion over a given territory. Each faction is represented by a metal coin, which, when placed on a territory, indicates its assignment. The game is developed on a variable board, built from hexagons. During setup, each territory is assigned to a faction. Each player represents a Roman Consul, a Celtic chieftain, a medieval lord, an Inca general, an Ottoman noble, or the head of an English noble family. The objective of the game is ultimately to be on the side of the winning faction.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player can carry out two actions of their choice: open a contest, strengthen, move, gain power, or place. Opening a dispute ends the turn in any case, and it works like this: each player secretly bets a certain number of coins, even zero. The coins are revealed, and the faction with the most, both on the territory and in the bets, wins. The territory is permanently assigned to that faction. The leader who led the faction to victory and the player who bet the most coins of that color get loot: new coins and the possibility of building in the territory or adjacent ones. Constructions (villages, cities, bridges, and the capital) increase the value of the territory. Strengthening allows you to add a coin from the game reserve to a territory that already has one (of the same color). Moving allows you to move coins from one territory to an adjacent one. Gaining power allows you to draw the first coin from the coin display. Placing allows you to put your own coin in a territory.<br/><br/>Each player's coin stock is kept secret. When all territories have been awarded (except one), the game ends. Each territory gives 1-5 points depending on the buildings present. The faction with the most points wins. The player with the most coins from that faction wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You then push the choosen tile into the main sliding game board starting from 1 of the 4 arrows. This ejects a tile at the opposite side onto a number (1-4). Place this ejected tile in the matching quadrant on your player board.<br/>With bonus markers you can move a tile on your player board or push two tiles into the sliding game board.<br/>Keep taking turns until everyone has claimed 24 tiles, then count your points based on how well you matched the scoring cards. You gain points for matching tiles and gain bonus points if the tiles match your player board or are precious tiles.<br/><br/>",

Today, we pass that game to you, allowing you to make it your own.<br/><br/>Players use polyhedral dice (d4 through d20, which they must provide), and a coin (or d2), starting with the d20, to attempt to roll successfully under the next die type (under a 12 on a d20 for example) to gain the new dice type. They continue rolling each die type, attempting to add the next lower die until they decide to stop, at which point they can try to get a gem by rolling all of their accumulated dice.<br/><br/>A player wins if they collect the moon token (which they get if they earn the d2/coin and successfully flip heads) and keep it until the start of their next turn, or if they earn 4 gems.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the February 2020 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

He can use it one time during the game like every other &quot;dirty tricks&quot; card.<br/><br/>Using it he can choose between two actions:<br/><br/>- &ldquo;Send to the sharks&rdquo;: The player flips the card of the tavern onto which he has added a die in the same<br/>turn onto its back side. When the cards are distributed, cards of the tavern which are flipped over are<br/>removed from the game regardless of dice added onto them. Nevertheless dice added to a flipped card still<br/>count as tie-breakers for adjacent cards which are not turned over. The &ldquo;dirty tricks&rdquo;-card is removed from<br/>the game after usage.<br/><br/>- &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;: The player takes one of his own dice he has added to a card of the tavern in a previous turn<br/>back to his supply. Then he adds both dice he has rolled in that turn onto the corresponding cards of<br/>the tavern. This action can only be performed if the player has added at least one die to the tavern in a<br/>previous turn.

        "description": "The design has a blank 7x7 map that is randomly covered by 49 tiles which have numbered cities or terrain on them. Players start with the same capital regardless of the number of players. The game adds extra trains and more private companies based on the number of players (similar to 1846). Train availability, tile<br/>availability, and game end work on a fixed schedule, similar to 18CZ except the round also determines train/tile as well as when stock/operating rounds/end game occur.<br/><br/>For the first 3 rounds there is one city available per player to start a company in. It works a lot like the minor companies in 1822 where you can see that cities 4, 8, 12 are available in the first round (for a 3 player game), 1, 11, 20 are available in round 2, and 9, 14, 18 are available in round 3. The starting locations are auctioned by highest bid with the bid being discarded to the bank and then the player chooses the starting share price after winning the bid. Players can only start one company each in each of the first 3 rounds, so once you win a bid for a starting location you cannot compete in the other auctions this round. Thus the last player gets the final starting location for $0 without an auction. After the first 3 stock rounds, new companies can be started in any city with an open station circle (after winning the auction for the starting location) and players can start more than one company in a given stock round.<br/><br/>There is also one randomly picked private company available per player for the first 3 rounds. The private companies are auctioned and count as capital toward starting a company like in 1817. Unlike the starting city locations, players can win more than one bid for the private companies. Some of the private companies produce revenue each round (unlike 1817) so it sometimes make sense to hold a private company for a few rounds before using it to start a company.<br/><br/>The game has multiple train types each in limited supply. You can buy hex trains (which are good for running to multiple cities right by each other), freight trains (which pick up coal and can run to the off map areas), passenger trains (+10 revenue into the company per city), plus trains (get to run one extra time before rusting), or advanced trains (run the turn they are purchased). The price of the older trains drop each round (you can buy a 2 freight train for $120 in the first operating round, $90 in round 2, or $60 in round 3).<br/><br/>You have the 2/5/10 share system similar to 1817, including mergers. Companies can take loans similar to 1817 except the loan market is not shared, instead the loan interest rate is driven based on which operating round it is. You have the option when doing 5 share mergers to add share values together instead of averaging as in 1817 (receiving 3 shares instead of 6) to recapitalize a company.<br/><br/>President shares can be sold to the market and companies then liquidate at the end of the stock round if no other player buys the president share. Trains can only be purchased between companies for full price for a current phase train of 1/2 price for a non current train. The shorting features from 1817 were not included in 1888 for obvious reasons as well as to simply the game.<br/><br/>The game takes in the 4 to 5 hour range and is intended to be a fun &amp; easy game to play. The goal is simply to maximize your net worth at the end by running trains for as much as possible, driving up their share price, and then dumping the companies right before their trains rust. Players can't go bankrupt because they can just dump companies in bad financial health and companies which cannot buy a train will just die (no presidential liability).<br/><br/>",

During a turn, all players choose one card from their hand to play, then handing the remainder to an adjacent player. <br/>After each player has revealed their cards simultaneously, the next turn starts with each player then selecting another card from the deck they were passed.<br/>All cards have different symbols on them which either allow you to play certain other cards or they forbid playing them because you're missing the right symbols on the cards you've already played.<br/><br/>After round two and three, all players sum up the points on their played cards and the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Within a month, the Austro-Germans inflicted over 300,000 Italian casualties at a loss to themselves of only 100,000, and had shifted the front over 100 miles.  But they fell short of a decisive victory.<br/><br/>Caporetto recreates this spectacular offensive.  Modifications to the Great War in the East Standard Rules account for infiltration, naval fire support, changes of command, heroic &quot;last ditch&quot; leadership, and much more.  The game poses different problems for each Player, with the Austro-German player impelled to push his advance as fast and as far as possible and the Italian Player forced to retreat, often in the face of certain losses to his rear-guard units, in order to rebuild his shattered line.  But despite the inherent imbalance of forces, the game is tensely balanced.<br/><br/>Included in the The Great War in the East: Four World War 1 Battles Quadrigame.<br/>Folio edition contains Standard rules, Special rules, 17&quot; x 21&quot; map and 200 counters.<br/><br/>",

The Imperial German Army's successful opening battles of encirclement and destruction of the Imperial Russian 2nd Army at the opening of World War 1.<br/><br/>Contents include a Ziploc baggie, a 17&quot;x22&quot; paper map sheet, 2-page rules folder, die-cut thin paper counters, and a paper sheet with the Combat Results Table/Terrain Effects Chart/Turn Record Track/Reinforcements Schedule. Players must provide their own die.<br/><br/>The map sheet is mostly tan with blue national territory lettering, forest and water features and brown for all other terrain including single &amp; double rail lines, towns/cities, borders, fieldworks, detached and ring forts, and place names. Counters are white with green print (Russians) and green with white print (Germans) and represent Brigade/Divisional level Combat units.<br/><br/>The rules folder has a listing of abbreviations. On the back page are the victory conditions, addenda, design notes and scenarios including some optional set-ups. Additional options include:<br/><br/>A.Stronger German 8th Army; <br/>B.Stronger Russian 2nd Army; <br/>C.Better Russian Mobilization; <br/>D.Better Russian Cavalry.<br/><br/>The game runs from August 17th, 1914 through September 15th, 1914 and each turn represents 1 day while each hex is considered to be 3 miles across from side to side. The playing area covers East Prussian Germany down to north Russian Poland.<br/><br/>The Russian moves first and the Sequence of Play is as follows:<br/><br/>1.Supply Judgement phase; <br/>2.Movement phase; <br/>3.Combat phase,<br/><br/>followed by the German Player's turn. There are Special Rules for Cavalry, Landsturm, Fortifications &amp; Fieldworks, and Hidden (inverted) units.<br/><br/>This is a very concise and easy to learn game as is most of the company's products while being one of the first produced by them to have die-cut counters.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 4 Schlammh&uuml;pfers ('mud hoppers', the pawns), who try to escape from getting eaten by the Schmunzelmonster by throwing 2 dice. The first die determines if players get to move their Schlammh&uuml;pfers or the Schmunzelmonster (⅔ chance). The second die determines how far they must move. <br/>On a player's turn, if they still have a Schlammh&uuml;pfer in the safety of their burrow, they need to move it out before they may move another one on the board. Schlammh&uuml;pfer can cover quite a lot of distance because they skip occupied spots. That is needed, however, to get away from the ravenous monster.<br/><br/>The player with the last Schlammh&uuml;pfer remaining wins the game. Schmunzelmonster is a beautiful and colorful game for ages 6 and up.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s about mad-dog mobsters, crooked cops, and the kind of liquor that can send you blind for weeks. It&rsquo;s about fast cars and faster women, paid-off politicians and basement breweries, private eyes and public enemies. But mostly it&rsquo;s about men with silk suits, snap-brim fedoras and automatic weapons, quarrelling violently.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/>In this game, two to four gangs of mobsters fight against each other. Each figure is assign specific stats according to its category, such as Punk, Slugger or Enforcer. During the game, the order of action is determined by a deck of cards. Each gang is assigned a suit. All the cards from those suits are shuffled, and drawn one-by-one.<br/><br/>Each time a card is drawn, one member of the matching gang is allowed to take to actions, such as move, shoot, aim or recover. When a court card is drawn, all members of that gang are allowed to act.<br/><br/>If a player does not want to perform an action, he can hold the card, and use it to interrupt another player later on in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Waltzing Cat is a two-player game that consists of eleven wooden blocks, with each of those blocks depicting two differently-colored cats on opposite sides. Gold cats show up five times, red and blue four times, and white, black and green three times; no color is repeated on a block with another color that appears the same number of times, e.g., red doesn't share a block with red or blue, but it does with the other four colors.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle the blocks without looking at them, then set them up so that each player can see only one side of each block. The player who sees more gold cats takes the first turn. On a turn, a player pushes a block away from them (so that it falls on the table), pulls a block toward them, or declares the end of the game. If you push a block and the face that lands facing up appears on another face-up block, then you keep the block that you just pushed over. If you pull a block &mdash; thereby revealing a face that you haven't seen &mdash; and the face that lands facing up appears on another face-up block, then you keep both matching blocks.<br/><br/>If you declare the end of the game, the other player takes turns either pushing or pulling blocks (claiming blocks when appropriate) until no further matches can be made; the player who claimed the end of the game then takes all remaining face-up blocks.<br/><br/>Players then tally their scores for the face-up cats in their collection. Each gold cat is worth 2 points, while each non-gold cat is worth 1 point. A pair of one blue and one red cat is worth an additional 3 points (for 5 total points). Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game Maida 1806: Stuart vs. Reynier represents a small battle of the Napoleonic Wars. The British army under Sir John Stuart defeated the French troops of Jean Louis Reynier. Outcome of battle was decided by British infantry attack on bayonets, preceded by effective rifle volley. Rules focus on infantry tactics.<br/>One battalion is represented by 4 counters. The player determines which order to use at any given time. Various types of orders are represented by different icons. After the change of formation, the players put on the board counter with the corresponding icon. The exception is the square - here we use the auxiliary marker.<br/>The battalion can be formed into a column to the bayonet charge or the line to effectively use firepower. The line order is represented by a square and rectangular counters, if a unit was large enough.<br/>The player can detach a company of tirailleurs, which is represented by a separate counter.<br/>The battle of Maida is regarded by historians as an example of the superiority of the British two ranks line over the &quot;classic&quot; three ranks line. This difference is also reflected in the game. Firepower is expressed as a percentage, which depends on the size. In the case of the British army is 100% - all soldiers can shoot. In the French is 66% - efficient fire through two of the three ranks. For the infantry in column formation or square it is always a 20%. In the case of tirailleurs and artillery on counters are given immediately the effect of fire - a morale check and modifiers for distance, if any.<br/>In the battle only two units of the French cavalry took part. They exist in a double-row line and because of the tactics used (rapid charge) can not fire.<br/>Due to the historical course of the battle, the aspect of command is very simplified. One player draws one commander from a pool (common to both players). Units within its range can move, and further order of shooting is determined (inactive player fires first). Of course, in certain situations very big significance is who will be able to move their troops. The drawing is intended to represent a situation where one of the leaders taking the initiative, and another in spite of favorable circumstances behave passively. In fact, all commanders were on the same level and you can not distinguish any leader that was better than the others.<br/>During the movement the enemy can react. Units with high morale have better chance that they fire, and maybe even counterattack. However, there is always a risk that our soldiers leave the battlefield in a panic escape. That's what happened to experienced Reynier&rsquo;s veterans.<br/>During the game, the most common procedure is the fire that causes morale check. Each unit (except for artillery and commanders) has a proper rating on a counter. The test is successful when a modified roll of a 10-sided dice is less than or equal to the rating.<br/>Rule book has 12 pages. Many of the rules describe special situations that can happen during gameplay, for example commander participating in bayonet charge. Basic, most commonly used procedures are very simple. Another advantage is the small amount of counters and a simple overall situation. A challenge for the players is the use of their forces at the right time and in proper order. Experienced players should be enough 3 hours for the entire play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A German-style Trick-taker about building a glorious garden with gnomes!<br/><br/>For centuries, in the thick cover of the woods, gnomes have settled their quarrels over a game of Wunder Garten. These conflicts may be as serious as a disagreement on a property line or as trivial as to who makes the best mushroom stew. In any case, Wunder Garten has been the go-to game of gloating for gnomes for as long as one can remember.<br/><br/>Wunder Garten is a trick-taking game that uses set-collection for scoring. Essentially players take on the role of a gnome attempting to make the most glorious garden of all. You can score points in a number of ways.<br/><br/>1) Bidding. Before a round begins each player must bid, using elderberry tokens, to determine how many tricks they think they will win. If a player guesses exactly the number of tricks, they will gain 3 points. If they under-bid, they lose 1 point for each bid they are off. If they fail to reach their bid, they gain ZERO points!<br/><br/>2) When you win a trick you may choose to keep either the winning card or a card from the meadow (community pool) to add to your personal garden (tableau). The player with the most total points in their garden at the end of the round gains 2 points.<br/><br/>3) There are up to 5 suits being used during play. The lower the value of the card, the more fruit it produces. This rewards players for winning tricks with lower-valued cards because another way to score points is to collect the majority of each suit type. For each majority you have the highest sum in, you gain a bonus point.<br/><br/>4) Finally, a player may gain an additional bonus point for collecting a card from each different suit into their personal garden.<br/><br/>There are other strategic choices to be made as well. When to use a Raven Card is important as it allows you to take two cards into your garden instead of one.<br/><br/>Before bidding takes place, each player must draft a suit to become their trump suit. Once a player has their cards in hand, and have examined them, they must choose a suit that will be most advantageous for them in that round. The suit become their personal trump suit, meaning that if they cannot follow suit during play, they can trump using any card from their chosen suit. No two players can have the same trump suit, making the game both entertaining and balanced.<br/><br/>",

It is a German trick taking game that is best played by 4 (6) players in 2 (3) fixed partnerships, but also works well with two. There are no teams in 3-player games. It is usually played with a 48-card deck with German suits (hearts, bells, leaves, acorns), but can also be played with just the 7s, 10s, Jacks, Queens, Kings, and Aces of each of the 4 suits from 2 French-suited decks. In contrast to many other card games, tricks are played strictly counter-clockwise.<br/><br/>",

Tix has 'active' and 'inactive' cubes. Only active cubes may be moved. Making cubes inactive is done by moving next to or passing an active cube.<br/><br/>Chaining turns is important when trying to win a round of Tix. If a cube that is moved is made inactive at its end position, the player is allowed to do an extra turn if he/she wants to. This means placing an extra cube, moving another cube or removing a cube from the board. But making an inactive cube active again is also an option (if there aren't any other cubes in its neighboring squares).<br/><br/>",

Put the fishing rod on that mob card. During the rest of the game, whenever you fight a mob, you can choose to fight your reserved mob instead of one from the grid. Both the mob card and the fishing rod stay reserved next to your board until you have defeated the mob. When you defeat it, the fishing rod is shuffled back into your weapon pile. Reserved mobs do not provide any bonuses until they are defeated.<br/><br/>Shovel (x2): If you reveal the shovel during a fight, after the fight is over, you may choose a revealed building card from the grid and place it next to your board to &quot;reserve&quot; it. Put the shovel on that building card. During the rest of the game, whenever you execute the &quot;build&quot; action, you can choose to build the reserved structure if you have the resources to do so. Both the building card and the shovel stay reserved next to your board until you build the building. Once it is built, shuffle the shovel back into your weapons pile.

The United States and Great Britain gave great thought to how they would protect their own trade and interrupt that of the other nation, in case the two English-speaking powers ever came to war.<br/><br/>South China Sea is a Great War at Sea supplement based on these plans, which were taken much more seriously by the Americans than by the British. Just like similar supplements for the Panzer Grenadier series, each scenario has its own card in a spiral-bound booklet. Unlike other Great War at Sea games, each scenario also has its own unique set of ship data, gathering all the &quot;hit records&quot; necessary to play on one sheet.<br/><br/>Designer Kevin Canada has crafted ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that could have taken place between American and British forces in the Far East during a potential naval war in the early 1920s &mdash; the same conflict we studied in Great War at Sea: Sea of Troubles. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Sea of Troubles as well as our Jutland and Plan Gold games to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Each game in the system is based on one of the major battles of the 30 Years War. Each battle has its own map, special rules and counters representing the military formations which participated in the original action. The rules model the overall effects of the weapons and tactics of the great era of pike and shot, and include combat, leadership and morale. Players command armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, each with their own special capabilities, as well as the great leaders who took the field in this era. Each hex on the map represents 150-200 meters. Each game turn (GT) represents 45 minutes to one hour. Most cavalry and infantry units represent one or two regiments or battalions. Each combat strength point represents 75 to 150 men, depending on the quality of the army and assignment of light guns to the unit. Each artillery unit represents four to six heavy or medium guns.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters.<br/><br/>S&amp;T #332 Nov-Dec 2021<br/><br/>",

From the same team that bought you the smash hit Swedish Design Prize-winning game Skogen (The Forest).<br/><br/>As well as being filled with forests, Sweden is also covered with lakes: about 100,000 of them, to be exact. You're never more than a short distance away from a large body of water; or the wealth of plants and animals that call it their home.<br/><br/>In Sj&ouml;n, you get to celebrate &ndash; and create &ndash; the Swedish lake ecosystem in all of its feathery, scaly, slippery, spiky, beautiful, frightening, peaceful and predatory glory. As with its predecessor Skogen, you start with a blank canvas &ndash; an empty lake &ndash; and then your job is to fill it, slowly but surely, with life. You do this by selecting the &quot;elements&quot; required for living things and placing them on the lake bed: once a few are in place, you can start populating.<br/><br/>Before long, the full dynamic beauty of the ecosystem will bloom into life, and the interdependence of the species on each other, as well as their environment, comes into play. Your lake will be teeming with leeches and perch, dotted with lilypads and frogs, crewed with ducks and menaced by hawks. Nurture your lake as best you can, gain points for the most exciting and rarest species that you manage to introduce, and be careful of &ndash; and grateful for &ndash; the capricious forces of nature that wreak beautiful chaos on your environment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prospecting is, as might be imagined, a game of prospecting somewhere in the 19th-century American West (the map is not of a real area, although the place names are similar to some found in Montana).<br/><br/>The map is divided into numerous small areas which the players claim and then attempt to find something in.  Every area has a potential number which indicates how likely it is to find something (fertile soil, coal, copper, silver, of gold) there.  Each number has an associated set of outcomes for a 2-dice roll, which in addition to finding something include action cards from the deck, action cards from other players, income, and monetary penalties.  Areas not likely to produce soil, coal, or minerals are more likely to provide cards or income.<br/><br/>Once you find something, you get paid for the claim and that area is done with.  Some things pay better than others, with gold of course paying the most, but this is offset by the fact that making the same strike in an adjacent area will pay double (and a third will double again, etc.), and the less valuable items are easier to find.<br/><br/>Action cards can be used to rob or tax other players, travel faster around the board, squat on someone else's claim, etc.  The &quot;take that&quot; effect is presumably somewhat reduced by the small hand size (2 in a 4-player game).<br/><br/>The attention to usability in the components is somewhat unusual for a self-published game of this vintage.  Each player gets a &quot;calculator&quot; which lets you slide a cardboard strip up and down to get the dice-rolling chart for each claim potential (and robbery attempt) individually, instead of having to look it up in a larger chart.  In addition, each calculator has on it a probability table which shows the total percent chance of each possible outcome for each claim potential, and a list of all the action cards and their uses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Freedom is a two-player abstract strategy board game invented by Veljko Cirovic and Nebojsa Sankovic in 2010. It is played with black and white stones on a square board. The game is related to Go-Moku and Slimetrail. It can be played with a Go set or with pen and paper.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Board: Freedom is played on a 10&times;10 square board. Beginners can try the game on a 8&times;8 board. Other board sizes may be also used.<br/><br/>Objective: The objective of Freedom is to have more &quot;live&quot; stones at the end of the game, than your opponent. A stone is considered to be &quot;live&quot; if it is a part of some horizontal, vertical or diagonal row of exactly 4 stones of the same color.<br/><br/>Play: A game begins with an empty board. Each player has an allocated color: White and Black. White plays first, putting one white stone anywhere on the board. After this move players take turns placing their stones on empty cells adjacent to the last opponent's stone. If all cells adjacent to the last opponent's stone are occupied then the player gets the right (&quot;freedom&quot;) to place his stone on any empty cell of the board. The game ends when the board is filled with stones. The last player has the right to pass on his last turn (and leave the last cell empty) if placing his stone reduces his score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Secret Societies is a social deduction drafting game where player&rsquo;s loyalties are not only hidden, but also ever-shifting in this quick and addicting game of adaptability.<br/><br/>This game features simultaneous play, fast and simple turns, and light social deduction elements that allow those players who get &lsquo;caught&rsquo; to actually be at an advantage. Each turn brings 2 choices with a single action: which faction do you become committed to, but which faction do you help win. You can only be loyal to 1 faction by the end of the game, so you must adapt!<br/><br/>Secret Societies revolves around a single deck that includes different amounts of cards for each of the 3 factions competing for power: The Order, the Chaos faction, and the faction of Secrets. Each turn, players will draw 2 cards from the deck, choosing 1 to keep and 1 to display in front of them. The cards the players keep affect their loyalty based on the majority of symbols of each faction's type in hand. The cards they display not only give a little insight to what that player did not keep, but those displayed cards will also get reshuffled back into the deck at the end of a cycle. Once the deck is depleted, players will discuss and vote for a player that then must reveal cards from their hand. Some cards may get returned back to the deck this way. The currently displayed cards now get gathered into a new, smaller deck and a new cycle begins. After the second cycle and voting session, the displayed cards get gathered 1 final time, and players will complete 1 final draft, keeping 1 card that permanently solidifies their loyalty, and displaying 1 final card. Those final displayed cards determine the winner(s) of the game.<br/><br/>First, if any player ends the game loyal to Secrets, they win, along with anyone else who has Secret cards in their hand. This is not an easy feat, however, for how few Secret cards are in the deck.<br/><br/>Second, within the deck are Bribes, tempting those hungry enough to be willing to do anything to be the sole winner. If all Bribes have been taken, and no Bribe cards are displayed at the end of that final draft, the 1 player with the most Bribe cards in hand will win alone.<br/><br/>Third, The Order wishes to remain in power and they want to keep their Scrolls that are in the deck safe and out of player's hands, even if that means abusing their power to invade player's privacy. So, if there is at least 1 Scroll and at least 1 Order card displayed at the end of that final draft, all players loyal to The Order win.<br/><br/>Last, The Chaos faction wishes to overthrow The Order by stealing all the Scrolls from the deck. So if there are no Scroll cards or no Order cards displayed at the end of that final draft, then all players loyal to Chaos win.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Sculptures, drawings, jewelry, clothes, constructions of different shapes and sizes. The work of Artisans has shaped the history of art and some creations have reached such worldwide fame; they influence even the modern world.<br/><br/>Artisans is a fast and exciting but challenging family card game for 2 to 4 players which lasts 30 to 45 minutes. Players are trying to develop their skills in the use of seven different materials: clay, metal, wood, stone, gold, glass and textiles in such a way so that their level of expertise in these materials grants them the necessary skills to craft beautiful Art objects.<br/><br/>Each player chooses initially one from the nine available Artisan profiles. Each Artisan has a unique ability which helps and defines the strategy of the players. Additionally, each player takes randomly 6 material cards. Finally, 4 Art objects are drawn randomly and become available for crafting. All the material cards are depicting the level of skill (I -&gt; IV) in each of their corners and all the Art objects are depicting the materials and the required level of skill which the players need to have so they can craft them.<br/><br/>A game is played in 12 rounds (the months of a year), where players are trying to craft Art objects and win victory points. Each round has 2 phases.<br/><br/>During the first phase, players are either sequentially trading or collecting material cards from a central market or craft one of the available Art objects. The first phase ends when one player signifies the closing of the market by claiming the first player token. Then all other players have one last chance to visit the market.<br/><br/>In the second phase, players are developing their skills by playing any number of cards of one material type of their choice. Every additional time they play the same material they upgrade their skill to the next level. However, they cannot play more cards than those that they have played on the previous level. Through this smart mechanism the number of cards played in each level matters, because at the end of the game every single material card scores points equal to the said level.<br/> In the end of the 12 rounds players are counting the points from the crafted Art objects plus the points for the material cards and any additional points that their Artisan&rsquo;s profile may score. The player with the most points is declared the winner!<br/><br/>Use the material market to your benefit, claim the first player token in the right time to close the market and smartly manage your material cards in an effective way! The numerous combinations, the great replay ability, the strategic decisions and the challenging competition will leave anyone satisfied! Embrace the role of an Artisan and let the beautiful artwork take you on a journey through art and history!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warband provides all the rules you need to bring great battles between fantasy armies to your tabletop.<br/><br/>Using miniature figures and terrain, you can fight battles from the glorious sword and sorcery epics you've read about.  <br/>Miniatures are based on 10x5cm bases, allowing you to create miniature vignettes or dioramas for each unit.<br/><br/>Warband is designed to be simple to learn and difficult to master, and so it uses a single consistent task resolution method throughout the rules.  Whether you&rsquo;re trying to get a unit of warriors to move, seeing how effective it&rsquo;s shooting or fighting is, or how well it has defended itself, you&rsquo;ll be using the same dice pool mechanism.  You determine the number of dice to roll and each result of 4+ is a success.  The more successes you roll, the better your units will do, and the more likely you are to win.  Simple!<br/><br/>Of course fighting a good tactical battle, getting your units into advantageous situations, and making effective command decisions will mean you&rsquo;ll be far more likely to win.  Coming up with effective tactics for your chosen army to defeat your opponents is what will take you time to master.<br/><br/>So with Warband&rsquo;s intuitive rules you&rsquo;ll be fighting the battle not the rulebook, and hopefully having a lot of fun into the bargain!<br/><br/>You'll be able to decide which of the fantastic races you'd like to command and then construct your force from the lists provided.  <br/>Warband includes complete army lists for twelve armies, with abilities, options, spell lists, and descriptions including; <br/>Barbarian men, Dark elves, Dragon men, Eldritch vampires, Goblins, High elves, Hill dwarves, Lizardmen, Samurai apes, Taurians, Undead, and Wood elves.  Each army is balanced by being constructed from a fixed 500 point cost.  Powerful units cost more so are rarer.  A typical warband will have 10-12 units, representing an army of maybe 3000 warriors.<br/><br/>Army composition and optional upgrades are highly flexible, allowing you to build the force that best fits your style of play.  If you'd like to command a horde of bison riding barbarians, rampaging minotaurs, skirmishing ghouls, or serried ranks of deadly elven archers then you'll find something to suit you in the Warband rules.  This flexibility means that you should be able to play with your favourite fantasy race in a way that suits your personal style and preferences, while your force still retains a unique and interesting character.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The SHOT &amp; SHELL BATTLE SERIES recreates battles fought during the mid-nineteenth century at the brigade level. Each brigade is represented by an ID counter and several Step Counters so as to model the gradual attrition of combat strength over the course of a day's fighting. Divisions are Activated in alternating impulses, with each Activation (or Elimination) degrading its ability to activate and coordinate with your other Divisions. The game is of moderate complexity, with five kinds of combat and three kinds of Intrenchments, but play is quick and relatively streamlined.<br/><br/>The first game in the series, SEVEN PINES; OR, FAIR OAKS, recreates the actions fought on May 31 and June 1 of 1862 during the American Civil War. A complex Confederate battle plan hatched by Joseph E. Johnston that called for coordinated flank attacks devolved into an unsupported frontal assault, resulting in the largest battle of the war up until that time, and one of the bloodiest. Beyond the historical scenario, there are scenarios which allow players to explore the feasibility of Johnston's actual plan, as well as what might have resulted had he been opposed by a more aggressive Union general than George B. McClellan.<br/><br/>There are special rules for crossing a swollen river over a soon-to-be-collapsed bridge, the strange case of General Casey's Division (whose conduct was either heroic or disgraceful, depending on who you were talking to), and the command confusion that beset both sides. But at its heart, it is a simple and straightforward game that provides an excellent opportunity to explore this exciting new system.<br/><br/>The 22x17in hex map is set to a 250-300 yards per hex scale, with turns taking half an hour each.<br/><br/>",

In this game, players must create trade routes connecting two cities by lining up tiles containing images of roads on top of the board while using a rough map for hints. After creating trade routes, you must compare them with more precise maps. If there are specialty goods on the routes you create, you can collect points. However, there are certain goods which can deduct points as well, so you must be careful when constructing routes. In addition, you only have two minutes to create the routes. Within the limited time frame, think of the best possible routes and aim to trade well and efficiently.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. After first using the trade cards to decide the destination city and value of the local goods, the hourglass is then set, and trading begins. You then refer to your personal specialty goods map while you quickly place route tiles to connect cities together. The fastest merchants, and the merchants that have traveled the most routes will be award with bonuses. At the end, answer keys are placed on top, the goods obtained are confirmed, and points are received. After repeating this four times, the traders that have gotten the most points are the winner.<br/><br/>",

Game start for new players is extremely quick and by playing they continue to explore more.<br/>Dragons is the first game in the series. In Pickit Dragons you collect the cards in order to build complete Dragons in your play area which will then provide you with game advantage for the following rounds. <br/>What makes pickit set collection special is that each dragon has different number of cards <br/>Green dragon - 1 card, Red dragon - 2 cards, Yellow dragon - 3 cards, Blue dragon - 4 cards and Purple dragon - 5 cards. <br/>Based on the size of the dragon you gain points and if dragon doesn't contain any jokers you get also the extra power which you can use from next round on.<br/><br/>Game end is triggered when certain number of points is reached by one of the players.<br/><br/>For more challenging game play you can also use mission cards which you can play as private or common objectives.<br/><br/>Art is very appealing and as there are more designs for each colour of the dragon in each game your dragons will look little differently!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The machines have a sensor board which recognizes cards and their placement and movement.<br/><br/>Sangoku Taisen is a real-time battle simulation based on the Chinese novel &quot;The Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.  At the beginning of the game, you place your cards, which represent your units, on the board.  Once the battle begins, you move the cards on the board to attack your opponent's units or fortification.  The sensors in the board are capable of recognizing the cards you place on the board and are very responsive to movement and facing.  The game ends when one player's fortification is destroyed, or when time runs out.<br/><br/>",

Just as in a real ecosystem, each different species occupies its own niche, with different food requirements, fighting ability, speed, and favored habitats. The arrangement of the various habitats changes from game to game. To play the game well, a player must determine which combination of species will be most advantageous on a given board, and place their dinosaurs in locations where they will be able to find food and mates and avoid being eaten.<br/><br/>Game-play: Play is organized into rounds. Each round consists of the players' turns and an End Phase in which the board is adjusted to prepare for the next round. Each player begins with 10 points of dinosaurs on the board, and increases this point total in two ways: (1) by successfully breeding dinosaurs to produce eggs, which hatch into new dinosaurs at the end of the round; (2) by introducing a new species during the End Phase.<br/>During a turn, a player rolls dice to determine the locations of new plant growth on the board, migrates dinosaurs to new locations, and attempts to feed and breed dinosaurs.  For predators, feeding involves hunting other dinosaurs.  Other players become involved with the current player's turn when their dinosaurs are hunted, and they must choose to fight or flee, and when they choose to play a card that impacts the current player's actions.<br/>During the End Phase, fresh kills become rotten carcasses, rotten carcasses rot away entirely, hungry dinosaurs starve, eggs hatch, and players have an opportunity to choose one of four improvements for the following round (various combinations of new dinosaurs, eggs, and cards).<br/><br/>Goal: The game ends when at least one player has reached 40 points at the end of a round.  The player with the highest point total at that time wins.<br/><br/>",

Iraqi units are not included, as the challenges the Allies faced advancing into Iraq and Kuwait are represented by a &quot;C3I&quot; die-roll to move mechanism of increasing difficulty as Allied units advance, reach key phase lines, and attempt to occupy up to 10 objectives on the map within four one-day turns (a fifth turn may be enabled by die-roll). Primarilly designed for solo play, up to three players can seperately maneuver the three main Allied higher commands: XVIII Corps, VII Corps, and the Allied and Marine joint task forces.<br/><br/>Reaching historical objectives will result in an Allied operational victory (taking about 6 objectives).  Players may explore, at the risk of adverse &quot;pol-mil effects&quot; rolls, reaching additional objectives that offer prospects for a strategic victory.  As a quick set-up, quick-playing game, the player can readily replay history to explore chances for a different, historical, better (or worse) outcome to the last great ground offensive of the 20th century.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wargame Rules 1685-1845 (for Miniatures)<br/><br/>The biggest innovation is the introduction of an alternate play system developed from that used in our very successful World War Two and Modern Armour rules instead of the more recently fashionable simultaneous movement in accordance with detailed written orders. Its main advantages are that it saves the time spent order writing, eliminates disputes of the &ldquo;If you do that, I do this&rdquo; type, simplifies interactions between the two sides, places less strain on players honesty, and largely makes umpires redundant once players know the rules thoroughly. The special sequence of play we have devised eliminates the inherent disadvantages of more primitive alternate move as opposed to alternate play systems.<br/><br/>The more innovatory a set of rules is, the more unfamiliar it is going to be to the players. Please dont write in blaming us for departing from accepted methods; after all it WAS us that invented them. It is possible that in spite of our testing anomalies will start to rear their ugly heads as more and trickier players become involved. If so, they will be cleared up with one of our usual free amendment sheets. We are in any case happy to answer rule queries enclosing a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. Our test games have made us confident that the new system is a winner and will probably become the war-gaming standard. Let us know how you get on.<br/><br/>By adopting alternate play and an apparently simple &ldquo;bang you&rsquo;re dead&rdquo; combat system, we have been able to introduce a little more complexity elsewhere in the rules without overburdening the poor players brain too much. This includes a new method of choosing terrain based on actual battlefields, a command structure incorporating brigades, divisions and if you like corps, consideration of the personalities of individual generals, and a simple but very effective method of discouraging telepathic heroism and ensuring realistic conduct by units, including provision for differing national characteristics. The net effect is to give the player the sort of variety in his games previously provided only by ancient wargaming.<br/><br/>We take the RESEARCH part of our name seriously, and it is because of this that you will find many of the basic assumptions in our former set have been changed. In particular, study of contemporary drill books in the Ministry of Defense library has convinced us that the movement rates specified by us (and universally copied by our competitors) were wildly out. This led to changes in ground and time scale that were ultimately of great benefit to the rules. We must also mention Brigadier B.P. Hughes whose two recent books made an excellent starting point for reconsidering the whole question of weapon lethality under combat conditions.<br/><br/>The extension of our period back to 1685 enables us to take in all Marlborough&rsquo;s battles, starting with Sedgemoor, the Highland rebellions, and the early battles of Frederick the Great, in addition to the Seven Years War, War of American Independence, campaigns in India, French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars covered in the previous set. Although at first chary of such an extension, our research discovered no good technical, tactical or organizational reason against it. However, had we gone earlier than 1685 we would have had to contend with half armoured infantry and three quarter armoured cavalry, while to go later than 1845 sees the introduction of the Colt revolver by Texas Rangers in the Mexican War, of the Dreyse breech loading rifle by Prussia against Denmark and of the expanding bullet muzzle loading rifle, together with the replacement of rigid lines by thick skirmish formations, at first unofficial but later recognized by authority.<br/><br/>As for the beginner, do not be overawed by the size of this rule book and its apparent complexity. Start by reading right through it, but remember that all the basics are incorporated in the single thick reminder sheet enclosed, so that you will only need to turn to the main rules when you need fuller explanation. You will find that after a while you can increasingly rely on your memory instead of even the reminder sheet. Try and keep it simple for your first few games, bringing in more troops and more ambitious tactics when you get the feel. The rules are designed so that actual historical tactics will be the ones that work best.<br/><br/>",

Each unique titan has its own special ability and is armed with a deck of maneuver cards for use throughout the game.  But be careful.  While these powerful maneuvers can be the key to victory, they also double as lifeblood of your titans.  Without them, your titan's wounds cannot be healed.<br/><br/>Position your titans.<br/><br/>Manage your maneuvers.<br/><br/>Attack!<br/><br/>Will your titans control the new Empyrean?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the original 1969-70 game show aired on NBC (see below), each round a trivia question is read. The questions are slightly different from most trivia games in that the answers are always numeric (such as &quot;What is the area of Manhattan Island in square miles?&quot;). Each member of each couple (or team), without conferring with their partner, writes down their answer.<br/><br/>When all answers are in, the team compares notes and computes the average of their two answers. The correct answer is then revealed, and the team whose average is the closest wins the round and $100. The first team to reach $1,000 wins.<br/><br/>NBC/Hasbro's &quot;bookshelf&quot; line included several game show-esque board games including The Mating Game, Rhyme Time, Trivia, Chain Letters, and It Takes Two. Of these, only the last was actually based on a game show (albeit one played only by celebrities)...and yet contains no hint of this aside from a slightly similar logo, resulting in a generic-looking game that less-knowledgeable game show fans may inadvertently pass on.<br/><br/>",

You, as a fifth dimension being, must connect the stars and guide &quot;him&quot; to ★.<br/><br/>Across the Universe &mdash; 星を渡る (Hoshi wo Wataru) &mdash; is focused and themed on many musicians who died in the year 2016, especially David Bowie and Prince. The game includes references to many songs and albums, including ★ (Blackstar, Bowie's last album before his death), the Byrds' album &quot;Fifth Dimension&quot;, and the Beatles' song &quot;Across the Universe&quot;.<br/><br/>The game lasts five rounds (years), and at the start of each year, star cards are dealt into the spring/summer/fall/winter slots. The number of star cards dealt to each season varies. The players bid for these star cards to catch them. Each player must decide how much to bid for each season and must place four cards from their hand, one card for each season, at the beginning of the year. Once the resolution starts, the cards used to bid may not be changed. When a player wins a star card, they discard the card they used to bid; for those who don't win, they can re-use their losing bids in different ways. A player can:<br/><br/><br/>     Take it back to their hand to use again in a later year.<br/>     Shift the bid card to the next season, adding this bid's value to what's already there.<br/>     Move the bid card to the player's second tableau. The bid card is multi-purpose and also acts as an upper limit to your star card score.<br/><br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/><br/>１９７２年、地球に落ちてきた「彼」が、とうとう★に還る日がやってきました。5次元人であるあなたは、５年間で星々に「ワタリ」と呼ばれる道筋をつけ、彼を★まで還しましょう！<br/>このゲームは、２０１６年に亡くなったミュージシャンたち、特にデヴィッド・ボウイやプリンスに焦点を当て、テーマを付けました。<br/>手札から4枚のカードをプロットして、星カードを競り落とします。ただし、競り負けると次の解決が有利になったり、優先順位が上がったり、最後に得点化できる星カードが増えます。上手に勝って上手に負ける。しかし、プログラミングのため、そこまでうまくいくかな？<br/><br/>",

Send your gang on jobs by matching their stats to what the job requires and roll some dice to find out if they brought back some loot, earned you some reputation, or got shot in the process. The characters and jobs all come from a communal field, so you'll have to plan ahead and act quickly to get the good stuff. <br/> The player with the most reputation will win the game, and rep only comes from doing jobs, so you won't get ahead by playing it safe.

        "description": "Girl Genius: The Works is a non-collectible card game that consists of several standalone decks of cards. You can play the game with any one of those decks, while also being able to combine some or all of those decks into a single deck for a longer game or a game with more players. Each deck contains many unique cards, but the gameplay is the same in all cases.<br/><br/>Each player gets a five-card hand and twelve cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern. Each card has colored symbols along each side, as well as a point value and special instructions. On your turn, you reveal one face-down card, then spin any face-up card 180&ordm;. After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols. &quot;Popping&quot; a card means that you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful), then (usually) add it to your score pile. Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards. The game is played until one player has 70/50/40/30 points with two/three/four/more than four players.<br/><br/>The Castle Wulfenbach deck has two large groups of unique cards: six J&auml;germonsters and seven Dingbots. The J&auml;gers are troublemakers: They are all Soldiers, and they all pop one Soldier, so if you pop one of them, you just might get them all! But their second effects are not always so great: They include &quot;Let another player draw a card from your score pile&quot;, &quot;Let another player draw three cards from your hand&quot;, and &quot;Put this card in another player's score pile.&quot;<br/><br/>The Dingbots like to clump together &mdash; they are like the Mimmoths from the original edition of Girl Genius: The Works, who are returning in the Circus deck &mdash; but they're not quite as talented as the Mimmoths. Most of them say &quot;Move one Dingbot from another player's score pile into yours&quot;, although Dingbot Prime is as strong as a Mimmoth and able to grab them all.<br/><br/>",

The game mechanics for the sequence of play is: 1.Initiative Determination-Either Player Rolls a DIE and consults the Table to see which player goes first; 2.FIRE phase-BOTH players attempt to recover previously Disrupted Units from an earlier FIRE phase THEN Simultaneous Fire is conducted by BOTH player's eligible Units; 3.MOVEMENT phase-The Phasing Player may move his Undisrupted Units; 4.MELEE phase-BOTH players attempt to recover previously Disrupted Units from an earlier MELEE phase and THEN the Phasing Player may conduct MELEE with eligible adjacent Units; once BOTH players have performed these phases, then a TURN is marked off and play continues until the end of the game is reached.<br/><br/>The RULES folder details the extensive Historical Unit designation abbreviations for the Combat Units.

        "description": "War Games Rules Sixteenth and early Seventeenth Century (1490-1660) are designed for recreating the battles of the Renaissance with 25mm miniatures. They use a figure scale of 1 figure equals 20 men and a ground scale of 1&quot; equals 20 paces.<br/><br/>Units are made up of five or more figures. Units are rated by such things as how they are armed, what kind or armor protection they have, how they are trained, and what level of morale they have.<br/><br/>Shooting and hand to hand combat are done by comparing the weapon of the attacker with the armor of the defender, and then adding tactical factors to get a total factor, which is then cross-referenced with the number of figures in the unit that is shooting or attacking. The result is an actual number of casualties in men, which players have to divide by 20 to see how many figures are removed from the unit. Casualties that are less than 20 are noted and added to further casualties later on. This way of recording casualties, which was unique to the WRG games of the 70s, is a nice way of getting around an all-or-nothing casualty removal system. Even if casualties are few in any single combat event, there is still a cumulative effect that can cause figure removal later on.<br/><br/>The morale of units may need to be checked with a Reaction Test for several reasons throughout the game. There are many variables that can affect the Reaction Test. Each variable adds to or subtracts from a roll of three average dice (2-3-3-4-4-5). The result is cross-referenced with the morale grade of the unit to determine the outcome. As a result of a Reaction Test, a unit may initiate an uncontrolled advance towards the nearest enemy, break and run away, or do something in between (the best result is always &quot;carry on&quot;).<br/><br/>Units are given orders at the start of a game. Units must move and attack according to their orders until they lose their orders through a failed Reaction Test or until the orders are changed. Orders are the only command/control mechanism in the game. Players always have one CinC figure and may have one or more sub-generals. The CinC and sub-generals mostly aid in combat and Reaction Tests.<br/><br/>The rules are complex and require players to use good tactical sense, which includes supporting units with other units (this helps in Reaction Tests) and knowing when and where to attack an opponent's units to get the best possible result. They are much more subtle than the Warhammer games produced by Games Workshop. They aren't designed for a quick &quot;bash 'em up.&quot; They take time to learn, but they reward players who use sound tactics rather than players who are lucky with dice.<br/><br/>The first edition of the rules covers warfare from about the beginning of the Italian Wars to the end of the English Civil Wars. The second edition adds things like handguns (primitive firearms) and plug bayonets that allow for wargaming battles from the latter part of the Hundred Years War, which saw the introduction of firearms, to the Nine Years War in the Low Countries, which was the end of the Pike and Shot era. The second edition also adds siege rules.<br/><br/>Note: The second edition rules are called Wargames Rules for Fifteenth to Seventeenth Centuries (1420-1700).<br/><br/>These wargame rules are based on an earlier set of rules by Dave Millward called Musketeer. They are also heavily based on Wargames Research Group's (WRG) 4th and 5th edition Ancients rules, which pioneered the basic game mechanics.<br/><br/>As with other WRG rules, several Army Lists were separately published that provide guidelines for players to create historical armies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A baseball simulation game (not using actual players) with a 100-card deck for randomization. Defensive player positions players on the field and declares pitch to throw; offensive player turns over top card on deck; players match the batters hitting ability (lefty-righty; .100, .200, or .300 hitter) with pitch. Can be strike, ball, or ball hit into play to a particular square on the gameboard. The amount of squares closest to a positioned fielder and the type of hit determine the result of that batted ball, according to a Results Chart. Result changes on the back of the next card can change the first result (and provide unusual results). Pitch choices include fast, curve, knuckle, screw, off speed, splitter, and slider. Players can decide how many of each type of hitter they want, and can designate a starter, 3 relievers, and a closer to have certain pitcher advantages.<br/><br/>Players can also elect to steal, try a pickoff, hit-and-run, or take an extra base on a hit. Certain pitchers can have a ball-strike advantage, and in two-strike situations, batters can try to outguess the pitcher by taking a pitch. Using a wind direction factor also is optional. When all 100 cards are played, players reshuffle the deck and start over.<br/><br/>Game comes with 4-color game board, 100 result cards, Results Chart, Guidelines, one Hit Ball marker, four pitch-count markers, 14 wooden player pieces for each team including 5 pieces with colored tops representing pinch-hitters, and scoresheets.<br/><br/>",

In the tactical system players control individual ships on a blue grid. In the strategic system, players control squads on an board showing all the Atlantic.<br/><br/>WARNING: All game components are in Spanish!<br/><br/>The tactical game used to recreate the naval battle of Trafalgar uses the following sequence:<br/>1. Determine initiative<br/>2. Combat: First, the player with the initiative fires cannons, and then the player without the initiative (although damage is applied simultaneously)<br/>3. Movement: First the player without the initiative, then the one with it.<br/>4. Crew actions and surrender: Boardings, Sinkings and Surenders are resolved.<br/><br/>The strategic game uses another sequence:<br/>1. Initiative<br/>2. Meteorology: Climate and Wind<br/>3. Strategic Movement: Squad composition, Sightings, Persecutions<br/>4. Tactical Movement<br/>5. Adjustment phase: delay of strategic orders.<br/>6.

The rules are intended for fast play, so that large naval forces may be used with the conflict resolved to a conclusion in a reasonable time frame. Each turn represents 5 minutes. Scale is 1:1200 (60 inches = 1 mile).<br/><br/>Ten-sided dice are needed, as well as a random direction die or spinner. A ruler or tape measure is also required. Turn rate templates are provided, as well as status sheets that can be photocopied and used to record ship abilities.<br/><br/>The rules cover initiative, movement, fire, ramming, boarding parties, morale, fires, and naval versus land combat. Comes with reference charts, ship rosters with their game capabilities, and many ship templates.<br/><br/>",

It includes additional rules that can be applied to the original Age of Iron rules, but is also a stand alone rules set for naval miniatures wargaming in the 1865-1890 period (ie: Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War is NOT required).<br/><br/>One turn represents from 3-5 minutes. Game scale is 1:3000 (1 inch = 22 miles). This miniatures rules set will require ten-sided dice, a ruler or tape measure, and miniature ships. Reference charts, a protractor and turning templates are included, as are templates of each ship with their game characteristics.<br/><br/>The rules themselves are very similar to Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War, different values are used and special rules have been added (some that can be applied to Age of Iron - Naval Combat in the Civil War). The rules include an extensive list of naval vessels from 20 countries, virtually all navies over the world of the time. This rules set covers an obscure, but colorful, period of history that is represented by very few games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A deck of cards that adds missions to Risk 2210 (similar in some ways to the way the Mission Deck does in regular Risk).  Cards are color coded (in red, amber, and green) for difficulty and the deck can be altered accordingly.  Included are rules for various ways of incorporating the 20 card deck into the base game.<br/><br/>Here at last we have something that has been sorely lacking from the new game since its initial release. One of the main difficulties that has arisen in the game is the fact that a single game can go on for a very long time, and even with the introduction of the 5 turn limit a single game can still go on for a number of hours. With this brand new pack of twenty mission cards players are once again put back in charge of the game.<br/><br/>Difficulty Gradings:<br/><br/>     Each mission card has been given a difficulty grade as is highlighted in the top right hand corner on the flip side of each card. The cards are graded green - easy, amber - moderate and red - difficult. What this grading means is that players have more control over the length of time that they&rsquo;ll likely spend playing each game. For example, removing all of the red graded (difficult) mission cards, players can hopefully limit the length of game play. On the other hand, by removing the green graded (easy) mission cards this could theoretically greatly extend the length of play. With the time constraints, it&rsquo;s up to you to choose which cards to keep and which to leave.<br/><br/><br/>When:<br/><br/>     When should the mission cards be chosen? Depending upon the mission itself some could offer an unfair advantage if they were chosen prior to all initial reinforcements (those placed before bidding for turn order) having been placed on the board. To therefore avoid this, the mission cards should be chosen at random after all initial reinforcements have been placed, but before the first turn order bidding process has taken place. One thing to bare in mind prior to mission selection is to remove any irrelevant destroy &lsquo;x&rsquo; cards if not playing with five players.<br/><br/><br/>A Matter of Points:<br/><br/>     Although there are no set rules as to how players should play with this set of missions cards, here are a few suggestions as to how they can be used to enhance game play. <br/><br/><br/>* Players can choose to work on the basis of a one mission win i.e. as soon as one mission is completed then the player completing that mission has won.<br/>    * Alternatively, a game could be played on a points basis with each grade of mission being awarded points i.e red = 3, amber = 2 and green = 1, and each game having a pre-agreed points target. Once that target has been reached through the completion of missions then you have a winner.<br/><br/>Players are actively encouraged to play around with the mission rules as best fits their own situations.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/><br/>     Risk 2210 A.D.<br/><br/><br/>",

You spend money to buy ships, then you can move ships around to attack other ships and enemy Starbases. Also, you can take control of planets and asteroids by moving your ships to their sectors.

But, their own losses were considerable. The Germans constructed 1,162 U-boats and out of them 784 was lost for different reasons.<br/><br/>In terms of human lives, the price that both decrees paid was tremendous. More than 40,900 men were recruited by the U-boat weapon during the war, of which 28,000 lost their life and 5,000 were made prisoners. The allies suffered a similar meatgrinder -- more than 30,000 dead only in the English merchant navy and many thousands more from the merchant navies of other countries. More than 70,000 men and women of the Royal Navy died during the war, of which a great proportion were due to the struggle against the U-boats.<br/><br/>The game has the following components:<br/><br/>- 215 cards<br/>-   4 game boards<br/>-  30 U-boat Sheets <br/>-   1 Campaign Sheet <br/>-   1 rules booklet<br/>-   3 six-sided dice (white, blue and red)<br/><br/>",

One player plays the Kewran Wolfhounds, a company from the Lyran Alliance, while the other plays the Pursuing Peregrines, a binary from the Jade Falcons.  The player forces largely match up with the two packages of BattleForce-scale miniatures to be released by Iron Wind Metals in mid-2011.<br/><br/>Unlike BattleTech Starterbook: Sword and Dragon or BattleTech Starterbooks: Wolf and Blake, this product is a linear campaign.

The goal is to end the game with the most wind blowing into your windmills.<br/><br/>There is a hierarchy to the cards. Wind is lowest, directionals are middle, and windmills are highest. Higher cards can be played on top of lower cards.<br/><br/>Wind blows through the windmills and keeps going, but less 1 wind power that it had when it hit the mill. So if the windmill gets 3 wind from one direction, 2 of those wind continue blowing past it.<br/><br/>These simple rules generate brain-buzzing complexity for fun and interesting gameplay.

        "description": "Szczekociny 1794 depicts one of the battles from the Kościuszko Uprising, an important event in Polish history. This particular battle historically was a Polish defeat suffered at the hands of the allied armies of Russia and Prussia, but players can now recreate this conflict to see if a different outcome would also be possible.<br/><br/>Szczekociny 1794 is a hex and counter wargame with a chit-pull mechanic of activating specific parts of a player's army. Game turn consists therefore of movement, ranged and close combat - but the sequence of activations isn't guaranteed. There are three main types of units available: infantry, cavalry and artillery but they are divided even further, so, for example, players can find in the game grenadiers, Russian Cossack cavalry and Polish irregular infantry armed with scythes, &quot;kosynierzy&quot;.<br/><br/>The game comes with one introductory scenario, showing a preliminary fight for the village of Wywła, and a scenario for the main battle. Victory is decided by victory points, which themselves can be gained by elimination of enemy units, capturing enemy artillery or killing enemy leaders.<br/><br/>Szczekociny 1794 shares the rules of &quot;Raclawice 1794&quot; but due to the fact that bigger forces were involved in the battle of Szczekociny some rules of the game were simplified, for example conditions of withdrawal and victory. Szczekociny 1794 is an independent and complete game and knowledge of the game &quot;Raclawice 1794&quot; is not required.<br/><br/>",

Each player in turn calls out a letter and the other players pick this letter from the central pile and place it in one of the spaces on their tray.  Their goal is to spell out as many 3, 4, or 5 letter words as possible, left-to-right or top-to-bottom.<br/><br/>Play continues until all 25 spaces are filled.  5 letter words score 15 points, 4 letter words score 10, and three letter words score 5.  2 letter words do not score.  Smaller words within larger words also may score their own points, so long as the larger word is not simply a plural of the smaller.  In that case, only the larger plural word scores.  Proper names of people or places do not count unless agreed upon prior to the game's start.  Highest score wins.<br/><br/>The distribution of the letter tiles breaks down for each player in the following manner:<br/><br/>a-3, b-2, c-1, d-2, e-3, f-1, g-1, h-1, i-2, j-1, k-1, l-2, m-1, n-2, o-3, p-2, q-1, r-2, s-2, t-2, u-2, v-1, w-1, x-1, y-1, z-1.<br/><br/>This totals 42 tiles for each player.

        "description": "In a distant future, man has conquered space and the ultimate entertainment is an extremely violent sport called ULTRIUM SPHERE.<br/><br/>In these matches, anything goes. At least two teams oppose each other, competing to score the 3 decisive goals that lead to victory. The teams usually belong to powerful corporations or mere independents, and the players come from the entire Galaxy (human beings, androids, genetic experiments or aliens). ULTRIUM SPHERE has become the most popular game throughout the universe and is watched by hundreds of billions of entities. The players who manage to survive the game and perform outstandingly well are virtually elevated to the rank of Divinities and are named the ULTRAs. <br/> In ULTRIUM SPHERE, each player is the leader of an Ultrium Sphere team, which he/she tries to lead to victory.<br/>Each team consists of two decks:  25 Ultra Cards and 25 Interaction Cards. The Ultra Cards represent the team members and describe their race and various characteristics, offensive (tackling, attack, shot) and defensive (resistance, save, pass). The Interaction cards are the different strategies that the team can apply. <br/>At the beginning of the game, each player draws 4 Interaction Cards and 6 Ultra Cards. The 6 Ultras are to be laid out in two lines, the attack line and the defense line (3 Ultras in each line). The Interaction cards stay in hand. <br/>The Ultras can be used either for their special ability or to carry out various actions according to their place on the field. The strikers can undermine the opponent&rsquo;s defense (tackling, attack) or try to shoot a goal. The defenders can make passes to strikers (a pass must take place prior to every shot at goal) or stop the opponent&rsquo;s shots. The player must activate the Ultras (i.e. turn them at a 90-degree angle) when he/she uses them. Once activated, the Ultras can no longer be used. Therefore, the player must not activate all his/her Ultras during his/her turn, since the activated Ultras will not be able to defend during the opponent&rsquo;s turn. When the player chooses to play an action, he/she must cast a 12-sided die and add the Ultra&rsquo;s personal bonus for the action chosen. To know whether the action succeeds or not, the player compares the total to a success threshold, which must be exceeded or not depending on the type of action.<br/>The Interaction card may be used at any time to strengthen one&rsquo;s own Ultras or weaken the opponent&rsquo;s Ultras. <br/>When the turn begins, the player draws 1 Interaction card and set all his/her Ultras upright. First, he/she can replace Ultras and have 2 Ultras swap place. He/she can then use the Ultras and Interaction cards.<br/>When the player can no longer or does no longer want to carry out any action, or when he/she scores a goal, his/her turn ends and the opponent can begin his/her turn.<br/>The game goes on until one of the players scores 3 goals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lacrosse Blast is an &quot;old-school&quot; card-chart-and-dice simulation of pro lacrosse. Primarily designed as a solitaire game for sports board game hobbyists, it can also be played head-to-head, with each player making decisions for his team.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>We've taken our original lacrosse game, Crash and Scramble, and made it even better by adapting it to the same game engine that powers our popular hockey game, Hockey Blast. The result is a fast-playing, fun board game simulation of this cutting-edge pro sport that captures everything fans love about it: bone-jarring hits, acrobatic passes, rocket-fast shots, and amazing saves. YOU can re-create all the thrilling action of this &quot;ahead-of the curve&quot; sport, right in your own home, with Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse Game!<br/><br/>Lacrosse Blast uses a possession-by-possession system of play that keeps things moving fast. The game uses the same easily-memorized chart structure and no-nonsense method of rating players as our hockey game. Players perform based on the presence--or absence--of various qualities like speed, power and skill. Each player is also rated for his ability in creating and/or taking away scoring opportunities, as well as for shots and assists, penalties, face-offs and injury. That means you'll get table-top performances which echo each player's real-life abilities without a bunch of calculations or math gymnastics. You'll see the great assist guys dishing it off for goals and the powerhouse shooters firing the ball into the net, while the less-talented players defer to someone else. You'll be caught up in the action as you &quot;watch&quot; players use their power, skill and savvy to make plays. Goalies have their own special ratings, designed to make the real-life star net-minders shine on your table top the just way they do on the pro league floor! Easy-to-play, but amazingly detailed--THAT'S Lacrosse Blast Pro Indoor Lacrosse simulation board game!<br/><br/>",

There are numerous event cards which affect the proceedings.<br/><br/>This edition makes some significant changes, among which are:<br/><br/>     The game can be played with up to eight players, although play mats for just six are provided.<br/>     The alternate winning conditions (11 million flock or 117 council votes) have been eliminated.<br/>     The game ends when the creed is complete or when the event deck is exhausted.<br/>     The creed is divided into 13 articles instead of 10, and there are furthermore additional optional articles (designated X, Y, and Z) which the Emperor can choose to vote on at any time. (Consequently, players can have up to 12 articles on their mats instead of 9.)<br/>     All flock cards have the same value.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The night of the summer solstice, all the goblins are on the moor to designate their king. Enter the round and build the most beautiful dolmen to win the title.<br/><br/>Dolmen is a beautiful wooden play on the Celtic theme published in limited series. You play the Goblins, these small Breton goblins, who will build their dolmen picking up the slabs arranged in a circle around the stone table.<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The goal is to have the most points in its own construction at the end of the game. It stops when a player has 7 tiles in its dolmen.<br/><br/>In a turn, players will either move their korrigan AND watch a slab OR try to add a tile to their dolmen AND watch a slab<br/><br/>A korrigan moves from 0 to 3 (without rolling the dice) on the light points around the circle in any direction.<br/><br/>Each tile has a colored light on two of its sides. Arranged on the circle early in the game, the face of each slab has points (2 to 6). These will serve as the final countdown to determine the winner.<br/><br/>To add a stone to the dolmen, the korrigan must be in front of it and one of the colored sides of the stone must be the same color as the ends of the dolmen.<br/><br/>The player rolls the dice and if the result is more than the score of the slab, it can be placed by matching lights. <br/>If the dice score is not enough, you need to consume power points symbolized by colored gems and give the difference on the stone table of the fairy.<br/><br/>To recover its power points, the player must go see the fairy. This will also take the opportunity to replace the stones around the circle.<br/><br/>As soon as a dolmen is finished, each player counts his points (even those with incomplete dolmen) and adds the unused points of powers. The winner is the one with the highest score.<br/><br/>Warning, this is not necessarily the fastest who is the winner ...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Outsider is a card game that combines cooperative and hidden traitor mechanics with set collection and hand management, in an immersive science fiction setting.<br/><br/>Players are each assigned or choose a character, each with unique abilities and a different combination of the four skill icons. Each player is also given a random Loyalty card, which is kept secret from the other players. Most players will be Crew and will work together to complete repairs, represented by Goal cards. Crew members win the game when they have completed more goals than there are players, all Crew have at least one completed Goal, and any Crew member correctly declares victory on their turn.<br/><br/>One or two players will be Outsiders. Outsiders win the game if they declare victory on their turn and all Crew members are Doomed. All players lose if the deck runs out or if everyone becomes Doomed from a single source, which adds a cooperative element. An addendum provides alternate rules for groups that find this too harsh or would prefer a more narrative ending.<br/><br/>The setting is gritty sci-fi with art by James Zark lending a cyberpunk flavor to the characters. The basic concept deals with a future where vessels move between universes to save time on space travel, with the occasional side-effect of crew members becoming murderous and paranoid, called &quot;Outsiders&quot;.<br/><br/>Outsiders are literally castaways from other dimensions. Having shifted between universes too many times, they suddenly find that they no longer recognized things that should be familiar. Torn from a discarded reality, their only option is to seize control of the ship and reverse the shifts in reality, dooming the rest of the crew in the process.<br/><br/>The game lends itself to a wide variety of strategies, and despite a small learning curve the basics come into focus pretty quickly. Multiple playthroughs reveal increasingly complex possibilities, and each game is distinctly different as new combinations of Loyalties and characters are explored.<br/><br/>",

The family, in their quest to control this new power, created 5 different guilds, honoring the ways of their members to provide muscle and protection against any who oppose it.<br/><br/>You play the role of a fast rising street lieutenant in one of these guilds trying to carve out your own slice of the American Dream. Each player constructs a deck of various allies, weapons, trade fronts, and actions. Players can build and expand their arsenal by collecting more cards and trading with their friends to get more powerful allies and tools of the trade. Then you take to the streets and fight other street lieutenants for supremacy. Each lieutenant starts with a set amount of health based on their abilities, but winning requires that you bring the opposing lieutenants health to 0. Players expand their Villium trade by playing and controlling trade fronts. As these fronts bring in Villium, players are able to bring their allies and resources into the fray to battle with their enemies. Fights can be 1 on 1 street brawls, or all out mob wars between multiple players.

As a pirate, mark points by surviving the attacks from the monster; as shark-vampire, gain victory points biting and turning pirates into new sharks. In both roles, just outsmart your opponents to win. It is a strategy game the escape tension is a constant and &quot;backstabbing&quot; among participants ensure laugh. Of course, a little luck can help in difficult situations.<br/><br/>Every turn the pirates can move 1-3 sea spaces swimming away from vampire shark and block the path of another pirates. Blocked pirates are easy to be bitten by vampire sharks that need to move 3 sea spaces straight to the closest pirate. Strategy cards can be played to help pirates avoid bites or by vampire sharks to move freely. At same time a treasure hunt is happening and as a pirate you need to take the treasure map and go to the right island to gain more victory points.<br/><br/>Being the last pirate alive you'll gain victory points so every turn you need to choose run away or block your friends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In City of Outcasts players take a darker path and travel to Rym, the infamous City of Outcasts, a city outside the control of the Empire. Once a peaceful settlement of hopeful pilgrims looking to green the desert, the city was disastrously buried by the desert sands and eventually became a destination for all sorts of neer-do-wells looking to escape the eyes of the authorities - and to set up a little empire of their own. In City of Outcasts players are looking to secure the support of the various characters and factions in the city and build up enough support to reclaim Rym for its down-trodden people. In the micro game tradition of games like Love Letter, but with a little more going on, City of Outcasts looks to provide players with a quick, but in-depth micro game experience.<br/><br/>OVERALL GAMEPLAY: Each player is attempting to play the various powers off each other to assemble allies in a cunning bid to take control of Rym, the City of Outcasts. There are 13 ally cards in the game as well as an Eyes of the People card. One card is dealt to each player face down at the beginning of the game and an equal number of cards are dealt face up on the table as there are players plus one. Each ally cards has an influence number, special ability and a point value. Each player will draw one card from the table clockwise until each player has 2 cards in hand with 1 card remaining. The ally card on the table is the character players are trying to influence. Each player will then simultaneously choose a card from their hand and place it on the table face down. Going clockwise, cards are revealed and if there is an ability with a choice, it must be made upon the reveal. Whoever has the highest revealed influence number after all cards are revealed wins the face up card for the points on the card and takes the Eye of the People card. The Eyes of the People is for the start player of the next round as well as a bonus point at the end of the game. The game ends when there are not enough cards to place on the table and the player with the most points wins and more importantly, usher in a period of justice, peace and prosperity for its down-trodden people.<br/><br/>There is also included in the game 9 Location Cards and 16 Identity Tokens that can be used for a more epic version of the game. Players assign allies that they have influenced to locations for dominance in Rym. These cards have location points which are used to determine who has the most control within the city. Three location cards are used for each game and the winner is determined after 3 games.<br/><br/>",

Most survivors wins!<br/><br/>Apokalypsis combines deduction and take that  mechanisms.  Which tiles that turn into sea are determined by the secret and collective decisions of the players. By choosing the right omens and deducing which omens the other players have seen, you may move your meeples onto safe land and push the others onto unsafe land.

Medicine and food are nearly gone. The group decided that you will make the next run. You thought that you had prepared for this. You weren&rsquo;t ready for them but they were ready for you.<br/><br/>District-Z: The Cult is a stand-alone game and does not require the original District-Z to play. This is a Choose Your Own Adventure-style game that will take you from your first steps outside of your small compound and into a harried run from a mysterious Cult that is always on your trail. You will choose your own path. Will you take down the Cult or will you be converted?<br/><br/>The CULT GAME BOOK: This is the story that you must encounter. You will read a page and attempt to overcome the challenges presented. You may be presented with a choice of which test to perform on the card. The choices will be separated by the keyword &ldquo;OR&rdquo; and this allows you to choose one of the tests to<br/>complete while ignoring the other test (unless the page states otherwise). Once the test has been performed, perform the appropriate SUCCESS or FAILURE result.<br/><br/>DICE<br/>The dice in District-Z: The Cult are customized with symbols representing each of a SURVIVOR&rsquo;S ATTRIBUTES as well as the dreaded AUTO-FAIL result. If you roll an AUTO-FAIL result you may not reroll that die during your reroll attempts.<br/><br/>CULT Cards represent the constant threat of the Cult and are used to change the game causing difficulties for the Player via increased challenges, reduction in stats, and even causing you to perform all tasks on a page.<br/><br/>Items and Companion cards represent the Items and Companions that you may come across during the game. These cards are attached to your character mat and you may use their special abilities to assist you in defeating the challenges.<br/><br/>The Survivor mats are where you will track the changes that your Survivor goes through. You will, through the course of the game, be able to increase the basic stats of your character, gain experience, and earn special abilities which are all tracked on this mat.<br/><br/>The game involves the player reading a scenario in the Cult book and then performing one of the tests on the page by rolling the number of dice equal to the abilities in the test. For example: Let's say that you are on a page that has you testing AGILITY and PERCEPTION. You would look at your mat and see that you have 2 PERCEPTION and 3 AGILITY. You would roll 5 dice and try to gain enough of each symbol to match the test's requirement. Let us assume that the test says AGILITY:2 and PERCEPTION:1. With your 5 dice, you would have to roll 2 AGILITY symbols and 1 PERCEPTION symbol. You do get to reroll your dice twice for a total of 3 rolls (unless an ability or card states otherwise) but you may not reroll the AUTO-FAIL dice.<br/><br/>The game ends when the players reach one of the different endings. Will you escape the Cult or will you fall into the cold embrace of death?<br/><br/>",

A player literally calls &quot;FN BS&quot; when he or she thinks someone is lying.<br/><br/>It takes 5 minutes to learn, 20 minutes to play, and made for 2-6 players.<br/><br/>",

Conjure these creatures and steal the Victory Points for yourself, while the cards curse your enemies with powers that range from stripping the cards in their hand to making their creatures weaker. Beware, for what you reap so may you sew, for the owner can choose to Conjure the creature in their turn and send it right back at you!<br/><br/>Spectral cards are creatures of shadow and gloom. They are cursed and bring only darkness to whoever controls them...<br/><br/>The Spectral cards are the powers of evil, of darkness and malevolence. These ten cards will give you the power to strip your opponents of their abilities, to force players to discard valuable cards, and to reduce the VP of their own creatures.<br/><br/>And then you have Sinistra, the Elemental Dragon God of Shadow. Her trio of powers are alone formidable, but when combined, she can affect all opponents with her powers every turn. Now that's nasty!

The aim of the game is to make the workers of your opponent yours.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 7x7 tile grid. Each player begins with eleven workers (large sized disks), seven managers (medium sized disks) and four executives (small sized disks). Pieces can move independently but managers must always be place on top of a worker and executives must always be placed on top of a manager. The color of the disk on top determines which player owns the piece; the size of the lowest disk moved determines the possible move. Workers move one space orthogonally, managers move one space diagonally, and executives can move one space in any direction.<br/><br/>The first player to control six of the opponent's workers, while still controlling six of their own, controls more than half of the workers on the board and has pulled off a &quot;hostile takeover&quot;.<br/><br/>The game comes with some extra or specially marked components allowing for more different games to be played with the same set.<br/><br/>",

A biome is a community of plants and animals unique to a habitat. In this game you have 4 different habitats in which you start building a biome: the Amazon Rainforest, the Sahara Desert, the Pacific Ocean, and the American Prairie. Each player creates food chains (biomes) in four different environments and banks their biomes for points.<br/><br/>Cards come in four suits (biomes). Each suit has multiple cards numbered one through five. The players manage hands of five cards and have access to a central market of five face-up cards. Players may build two biomes at one time in their play area by playing cards of each biome on top of one another, with each succeeding card greater in value than the prior one, as in Lost Cities. Players also may trade with the market and discard action cards, taking as many actions on their turns as they have cards for. Hands are replenished at turn&rsquo;s end. A biome of at least three cards may be &ldquo;banked&rdquo; at any time, making room in the player&rsquo;s play area for a new biome to begin. Play continues until the deck runs out. Players then add up the values of the cards in their banked biomes and collect a 10-point bonus for each biome that used all numbers 1 through 5.<br/><br/>After going through the entire deck the player with the highest set of banked biomes wins.<br/><br/>Winner of Gold Medal from International Serious Play 2018<br/>2018 Seal of Approval from the National Parenting Center<br/>Best Family Game at 2017 Boston Festival of Independent Games<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On Easter Monday, 24th April 1916, the Irish Volunteer Force, Cumann na mBan, Fianna na h&Eacute;ireann and Irish Citizen Army gathered at their mustering points across Dublin. 1,200 men, women and boy scouts seized control of the city centre, and at noon Patrick Pearce stood on the steps of the GPO and proclaimed the Irish Republic to a stunned crowd. Hopes that the British would be too preoccupied on the Western Front to deal with Ireland were soon dashed. Troops flooded in from Athlone, Belfast, the Curragh and Liverpool. The Rebels were outnumbered by ten to one, but held out for a week as Dublin was reduced to rubble.<br/><br/>The Irish War of Independence (1919-21) ended with the partition of Ireland into North and South. This was accepted by the Provisional Government led by Mike Collins, but rejected by the IRA who wanted to unite all of Ireland in a Republic. Collins was given artillery by the British Army, surrounded the IRA HQ at the Four Courts and fired the first shots of the Irish Civil War on 28th June 1922. The Four Courts fell two days later, but it took another week to drive the IRA out of Dublin.<br/><br/>Storm Over Dublin is an Area/Impulse game of the 1916 Easter Rising and 1922 Battle of Dublin. The Rebel Player must seize strategic buildings across Dublin and hold them against the odds. The Government Player must take back control of the city block by block, using cavalry, infantry, artillery, gunboats, bombers, tanks, and armoured cars, even if the city is reduced to ruins. Each side earns victory points for controlling areas and capturing enemy Leaders and Units. The Government Player needs a substantive lead as the rebels are court-martialled at the end of the game, and their martyrdom may sway the public opinion and give them victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Who will create the most harmonious quilt that satisfies the client's demands?<br/><br/>To set up, each player receives their own 8x8 game board, playing on either the easy or normal side of the board. The board features a 2x2 central space as well as a number of holes and spots for ornamentation. You lay out two main order cards and one secondary order card at random, along with 5-9 pieces of silk cloth in the four colors, adjusting the quantity based on the player count. Additionally, you have high-quality silk patches that cover either a 1x1 or 2x1 space, with these pieces being of a fifth and sixth color. Place one piece of silk of the main four colors on the matching spaces on the market board. Give each player three coins, with the start player taking an additional coin.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can either move the token on the market board to a different color and take the silk piece and any coins from this space, or pay 2 coins to choose any silk piece from the main four colors, whether from the market board or in the reserves. (The start player can place the token on any of the four colors on the first turn.) You then place the silk on your board. Your first piece must cover at least one square in the center of your game board; each subsequent piece must lie orthogonally adjacent to a piece already on your board, and pieces of the same color cannot be adjacent to one another!<br/><br/>If you cover an ornament space on your board, you can pay a coin to take a high-quality silk piece and place it on your board. If you cover another ornament space, you can do this again. To end your turn, (if needed) choose a silk piece from the reserve of the same color that you took and place it on the market board, then place a coin from the bank on any market space that doesn't have the token in it.<br/><br/>Whenever you achieve a secondary order during play, such as covering a hole with high-quality silk or placing a second piece of the same shape, you receive a bonus immediately.<br/><br/>After eight rounds, the game ends. You receive a bonus based on how well you completed the main orders, such as creating a silk-filled square or filling the diagonals of your board. Additionally, each filled vertical or horizontal line is worth 3 points, each uncovered ornament 1 point, each hole -1 point, and each coin 1 point as long as you have at least three coins. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

But disaster struck on their latest adventure, splitting their time machine in two and marooning them each in a different place and time!<br/><br/>In Escape Room in a Box: Time Drifters - Isabel's Story, you take the role of Isabel as she works to repair her half of the time machine and hopefully reconnect with Kira before she is lost forever.<br/><br/>Just like all of the Escape Room in a Box games, the puzzles in Isabel's Story are non-linear, meaning there is always something for everyone to do - just like a real life escape room.<br/><br/>Escape Room in a Box: Time Drifters - Isabel's Story can be combined with Escape Room in a Box: Time Drifters - Kira's Story to unlock a special bonus game, designed to be played remotely via video chat, that allows you to experience the final chapter in their story. Players from both groups will have to work together, share notes, collaborate on puzzles, and hopefully to reunite the two wayward time travelers.<br/><br/>",

It is an expanded version of sishi fen ('40 points') using two or more decks, and is related to zhao pengyou ('looking for friends'). All these games are collectively known as Sheng1 Ji2 (升级), which means &quot;raise level&quot; or &quot;promote&quot;. Tractor is widely popular in China, especially in Shanghai and south of the Yellow River where it has practically displaced the older single deck game.<br/><br/>The scores of the teams are expressed as card ranks. At the start of the game, each partnership has the lowest possible score, which is two. By winning games, a partnership can increase its score to a higher rank: three, four, five and so on. Above ten come jack, queen, king and ace. The objective is to achieve a score higher than ace - the partnership that achieves this wins the game.<br/><br/>In each hand, one team forms the declarers, sometimes known in Chinese as dang1 zhuang1 (当庄), and the other team forms the opponents. In the first hand, either team can be the declarers, depending on who makes trumps. In subsequent hands, the team that won the previous hand is the declarers, and the other team is the opponents.<br/><br/>One member of the declarers' team is the starter, who has the advantage of taking the last cards in the deal, discarding some cards, and leading the first trick. While the declarers try to increase their score, the opponents' objective is to take at least 80 card points, in which case they become the declarers for the next deal.<br/><br/>Source: edited from Pagat, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.pagat.com/kt5/tractor.html</a><br/><br/>",

Each round players collect ingredient cards that can be combined to create different drink orders. There is a &lsquo;lobby&rsquo; of 8 customers waiting for their order, and each customer card displays the type and number of each ingredient needed to craft their drink. Each customer is worth a given dollar amount based on that customers&rsquo; order, which can vary in complexity and size, and this amount counts towards a player&rsquo;s point total at game end. If a player has the required ingredients to fulfill a customer card on their turn they claim that customer towards their total score!<br/><br/>In addition to ingredient cards, players have the chance to draw special cards that may help them, or may disrupt the plans of their opponents. The game ends when any player has claimed a total of 10 customers, and the player with the highest customer points wins!<br/><br/>",

This is a two-player game; One player controls the Central Powers, the other player controls the Allies. The concept of &ldquo;victory points&rdquo; (VP) is central to play of game. Players begin each scenario with a designated number of VP. They gain new VP as a result of achieving objectives; they lose VP when they lose units in combat. They may expend them to gain reinforcements and carry out certain actions. To win the game you must have more VP than your opponent, so play is a balancing act between expending VP and attaining objectives.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of each year, every player chooses which crops he wants to grow on his fields. Then the climate is determined by a dice roll. Each climate has different effects on the yield of the crops.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player rolls a die and moves that number of spaces around the board. The players encounter different events that affect their farming business positively or negatively. Some events affect all players.<br/><br/>At the end of each year, each player calculates his profit or loss and the next round begins. After six rounds, the most profitable farmer wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Napoleon in Italy is a simple two-player strategy game of maneuver and combat that simulates a portion of the campaign in November 1796 between the Austrians and the French in northern Italy.  Players move their forces and have combat across the map in an effort to occupy key areas at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game, published in Issue #3 (Spring 2008) of Panzer Digest, comes with a mapsheet, set of unit counters and markers, and rules (printed within the magazine).  The map represents a portion of northern Italy where the original campaign was conducted.  Movement on the map is regulated via a series of areas, usually representing towns.  Areas that are connected by a line are adjacent to one another.  There are no terrain effects in the game, and any one area is the same as any other, though some areas are designated with a star to represent victory areas.<br/><br/>French and Austrian units represent divisions, and each combat strength point represents approximately 1000 men.  Units take losses in combat by marking off lost strength points from a unit roster.  The overall commanders, Napoleon for the French and Alvinczy for the Austrians, are also represented by counters.  Napoleon has a number of special benefits, to help balance the massive numerical advantage of the Austrian army.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, players bid the number of victory points they claim they can earn playing the Austrians, and the player with the highest bid must earn at least that many to win.  Each turn represents three days of campaigning, and the game lasts six turns.  Playing time is about 20 minutes solitaire, about 45-90 minutes against an opponant.<br/><br/>",

There are two forces of warriors: those chosen by Gods and those forsaken. Normally the most powerful faction in the chosen force is dominant. However, the forsaken force prevails if they outnumber the chosen force in headcount, in which case the most powerful faction in the forsaken force is dominant.<br/><br/>Each player initially has four warrior cards, each of which has a color and strength value printed in its face. During your turn, you place one warrior card face-down on either force. One of the other players has two options: accept your decision, or refuse your decision and send the card to the opposite force face-up.<br/><br/>Each card has partial information about its identity printed on its back, and some cards have a special ability when refused. You should speculate about what card your opponent placed, and whether the opponent wants you to refuse.<br/><br/>The game ends when each player has one card in hand. Determine the dominating faction in the manner described above. The player who has the strongest card of the dominating faction wins the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>プレイヤーは天界の神々となり、最終決戦《ラグナロク》に備えて屈強な戦士たちをスカウトしていくゲームです。最終的に合計値の大きい陣営（色）が勝つという単純明快なルールですが、相手の許可を尋ねる必要があるためそうは思い通りに行きません。<br/>部分的に得られる情報から推理して詰めていく戦略的なゲームです。<br/><br/>",

Not at all!<br/>Because you &quot;know the future!&quot;<br/>Before you start the game, you know the lead suits of all the tricks (what color cards to be played), so compare them with your hand and announce with which cards you're likely to win.<br/><br/>However, note that other players can also predict the future and thus have acquired the same information.

Do a little of each, or all of one, or some other combination to defeat the orc horde.<br/><br/>Orcs on the Horizon is a solo, one card, adventurous, dice based combat game played in two phases.  In phase 1, as Orc hordes march towards your fortress, mine silver to purchase upgrades to your Archers, Knights, or Fortress.  Archers can attack Orcs around the midpoint of their march towards your fortress.  Once the Orcs reach your fortress, flip the card and begin phase 2.  In phase 2, Archers aren't used, only Knights and the defenses of your fortress.  Battle the Orcs to the death to win the game.<br/><br/>The game was created for the 2020 1 Card Print and Play Design Contest.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A new criminal case has complicated everything, and the Chief has ordered you and your fellow police officers to solve it ASAP and arrest the main culprit. You must collect evidence in order to make arrests, whether you intend to capture the leader or another suspect.<br/><br/>To set up ژاندارمری (Gendarmery), create a &quot;wall&quot; of suspect cards in a 3x3 grid that leaves the center empty. Each suspect card features an illustration as well as that individual's characteristics. Underneath each suspect card is a face-down interrogation card that features an arrow pointing in one of the eight compass points or (near the bottom of the deck) a medal. Place one interrogation card face up in the center of the grid; the arrow on this card identifies the main suspect. Additionally, you lay out two face-up decks of evidence cards and a face-down &quot;door&quot; deck of action cards; the &quot;janitor&quot;, for example, lets you take a card from a player's hand and put it in someone else's hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, you take one of four actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Take an evidence card from the top of a deck and add it to your hand.<br/>    Archive 1-2 cards from your hand, removing them from play.<br/>    Reveal the top door card from the deck and carry out its action to hinder someone else or help yourself.<br/>    Report evidence to capture a suspect.<br/><br/><br/>To report, you reveal all of the evidence card in your hand. If the combination of symbols that you reveal are present on exactly one suspect card on the wall, you catalog those evidence cards and that suspect. (If your symbols match two or more suspects, you've wasted the Chief's time and your turn ends.) If that suspect was not the main suspect, place that suspect's interrogation card under the central card, then place a new face-down interrogation card and a new suspect card in the empty space.<br/><br/>If that suspect was the main suspect, then you collect that suspect card and all of the interrogation cards in the center of the grid; you then reveal the interrogation card that was under that suspect. If the card is a medal or an arrow that points to an empty space in the grid, the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The rules use a quasi 3D manoeuvre system, whereby the action is fought out in 2D, but with some representation of 3D air combat manoeuvres.<br/><br/>The Lite version is intended to give you the basics of the game and allow you the opportunity to try out some dogfights using the AirWar: C21 system between US F-14 D Tomcats and Russian Su-27 Flanker B&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>Player notes:<br/><br/>A hexless tabletop miniatures game with each miniature representing a single aircraft. The system breaks game turns into two phases, with each aircraft moving &amp; attempting a manoeuvre in each phase. Turn summary (edited from PDF):<br/><br/>Phase 1<br/>&bull; Select and apply engine power speed changes (unless stalled)<br/>&bull; Roll for initiative, conduct radar/visual spotting<br/>&bull; Move (if turning, move half the aircraft Speed, turn, and move the second half)<br/>&bull; Test for and execute all movement or manoeuvres in order of initiative<br/>&bull; Resolve effects of any missiles launched last phase<br/>&bull; Launch new missiles<br/>&bull; Resolve air-to-air gun or rocket attacks<br/>&bull; Resolve speed changes due to manoeuvre or stall recovery<br/>Phase 2<br/>&bull; identical to Phase 1<br/><br/>Tests for manoeuvres vary in difficulty, making a Barrel Roll easier than an Immelman, etc.<br/><br/>The system uses multiple D6 &amp; D10, single die rolls for tests, detection, etc, multiple for damage. Speed, damage &amp; currently carried weapons are the only variables during play, but each aircraft &amp; weapon has many values to record before starting. Although simplified from the full rules, the system includes a large variety of factors to simulate air warfare, with only the lack of altitude tracking being a notable abstraction.<br/><br/>Only statistics for the F14 Tomcat &amp; Su27 Flanker and their weapons are included in the Lite rules.<br/><br/>",

It incorporates several elements seen either alone or in combination in other action/dexterity games produced around this time - marbles, gravity, a spring.<br/><br/>Players start the game with ten marbles.  Marbles must be placed on a large, plastic centrally-located daisy, which has vague depressions on each 'petal' for the marbles to rest in.  The stem of the daisy is a strong spring.<br/><br/>There are 16 cards, all of which direct the holder to either 'put' or 'take' a given number of marbles from the daisy each turn.  Four are dealt to each player; a turn consists of playing a card &amp; following the directions.  If either the placing or removal of marbles causes the daisy to tip over, the player causing the incident must take all the marbles that fall from the daisy.<br/><br/>When all four cards are used (i.e. when each player has had four turns) the pack is reshuffled and a fresh set of four cards is dealt to each player.  Play continues in this manner until a player is able to place their final marble on one of the daisy's petals without causing any to fall.<br/><br/>The player who achieves this is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

Players represent a battle-ready faction and use their agents to fight for control of a customizable board, which is set up individually each game. To win, agents must occupy valuable tiles worth victory points (VPs) or wipe out enemy agents or do both.<br/><br/>Proxy Wars is a full-fledged strategy card-based board game, and the game mechanisms include tile-placing (the cards form the board) and deck-building elements. You are to decide how to best deploy your faction's power and agents to outwit your opponent with ingenious cutting, positioning and attacking strategies. Each player starts with ten agents (playing pieces) in his headquarters and a set of faction cards. Players alternate turns, choosing one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Play a new card <br/>     Recruit an agent <br/>     Move an agent <br/>     Attack enemy agents <br/>     Take card actions <br/><br/><br/>At the end of the game, players total the number of agents they control, along with any VPs that they have accumulated on their cards. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>To play Proxy Wars, you need at least the two basic sets: GreenEngage and MegaCorp; Proxy Wars: Oath Bound, which contains additional cards for both factions, is recommended.<br/><br/>",

You can choose to embody one side or the other (Darkness or Empire), or alternate roles. Each scenario is independent and constitutes a small battle, but it is also a stage in the story that is told to you.<br/><br/>The units (leaders or combat units) have a movement and combat capability (possibly including firepower) and represent 500 to 1000 or 2000 men, a dozen or twenty monsters, an illustrious character or hero.<br/><br/>The system is based on the initiative conquered by players following a die roll and the impact of leaders and/or other modifiers in the scenario. Scenario speed and ease of understanding are favored. The player starts with basic units, he enriches his pool as the scenario progresses with other units, additional spells and characters.<br/><br/>In THE THREE PORTALS, the system is based on the skills of the units that bring the player's character or armies, and on the development of his main character or armies.<br/><br/>The basic module of the game gives the essential rules and the scenarios are the preamble of the story; the extensions are groupings of scenarios around one or more new features (new race, new characters, additions of objects or various attributes).<br/>A general map in the basic module will be completed as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Usually, extensions include 4 additional battles, a counter board, additional maps, items, spells, the author works on additional locations.<br/><br/>The rulebook<br/>16 pages of illustrated rules, simple concepts and fun play system effectively allowing the simulation of historical dimension of battles.<br/> &mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Participez &agrave; une &eacute;pop&eacute;e fantastique sur la terre d'Alhandra !

Set disruption is also part of the game, and ruining someone's plans will bring you a large chunk of satisfaction.

It was a strange, fascinating campaign by one of the most famous generals of his time, not only in Italy. Garibaldi&rsquo;s red shirts fought and won against a superior, but very dispersed Austrian army, that tried to force Garibaldi to a slow and depressing struggle over mountain passes and cliffs, but was surprised in the decisive battle of Bezzecca that opened the road to victory for the Italian general that was stopped by a direct order of his king (to which he responded simply &ldquo;I obey&rdquo;, giving up a sure victory on the field for a political one for his country).<br/><br/>With a very peculiar chit drawing activation method and a combat system that stresses fatigue over real casualties, I obey is a fascinating study of this neglected campaign, with a see-saw motion of the counters over the splendid map and the chance for both sides to gain an unexpected victory.<br/><br/>Medium complexity, 2/3 hours playing time, both for competitive and solitaire play.<br/><br/>Released as Print-n-Play in June 2007<br/><br/>",

The Gorn ship is designed with four nacelles, and its class configuration is unfamiliar to the Federation prior to the late 2260s.<br/><br/>In 2267, a Gorn starship approached the Earth outpost on Cestus III at space-normal speed using the outpost's regular approach route. Before the outpost knew what hit them, the Gorn ship knocked out the outpost's phaser batteries with its first salvo, leaving the outpost defenseless. The weapon used was described by a survivor as being &quot;like phasers, only worse&quot;. The Gorn ship continued to assault the outpost, until it was obliterated.<br/><br/>The Gorn starship later attacked the USS Enterprise, which had been lured to the colony by false signals. The Enterprise's counterattack with full phaser and photon torpedo banks proved ineffective against the deflector screen of the Gorn ship, which was located just outside visual range.<br/><br/>The Star Trek: Attack Wing &ndash; S'Gorn Expansion Pack is the competitive prize for the &quot;Arena&quot; episode during Star Trek: Attack Wing Organized Play.<br/><br/>",

In doing so, players will plunder islands for valuable loot, pillage loot from other captains using a unique sea battle mechanic, and complete objectives to write shanties that will become their legacy once Davy Jones takes his toll.<br/><br/>Sea Shanties' environmentally friendly design utilizes dynamic board tiles printed on canvas. There are over a duodecillion different configurations of the board, meaning you will never play on the same board twice!<br/><br/>Players start with 15 crew and a ship token on a starting island, selected by a draft. Players have 5 additional crew tokens in Hunter's Tavern.<br/><br/>Every captain's turn has three phases - Actions, then Bury, then Collect (ABC). During the action phase, captains may take up to 5 actions. The five available actions are Sail (Move their ship token to an adjacent square on the board, utilizing wind arrows), Plunder (place crew tokens from your player board onto an island that your ship token occupies), Abandon (remove all of your tokens from an island that your ship token does not occupy and place them in Hunter's Tavern), Recruit (place one crew token from Hunters Tavern onto your player board), and Sea Battle (initiate a battle with another captain's if their ship is in an adjacent square).<br/><br/>After the action phase, captains may Bury their loot that they had on their ship. Buried loot cannot be pillaged in sea battles. Once that phase is done, players may then Collect 1 loot per loot-producing island they control, collect any Ballads if they have buried the most of a particular type of loot, and collect one verse if they completed the specified objective on it.<br/><br/>Sea Battles are an augmented Prisoner's Dilemmah. Captains will secretly select a number on the battle dial between 0 and the number of crew tokens they have on their captain's placards (not on in the tavern or on islands). They will simultaneously reveal their selected numbers. The highest number wins and may pillage loot tokens from the loser equal to the difference of the two selected numbers.

Pieces move and attack each other Stratego-fashion, with the goal being to find your opponent's eggs.<br/><br/>There were two versions of the game produced.  The original 1981 version came in a small box, with a larger box coming out in 1982, and had numbers on the pieces to indicate their strength on land and in water (air being a special case).  The larger version won the &quot;Essener Feder&quot;-prize (prize for the best rules) in 1983. The later (1992) version again came in a much smaller box and did not have numbers on the pieces, instead having a booklet that shows which pieces defeat which others in each kind of terrain (functionally it appears to be similar).  This version also has fewer types of creatures than the first - no crocodile, diplodocus, etc.<br/><br/>In the included booklet of the small edition &quot;How came the idea to Giganten&quot;, Hubert Pinthus talks from an old, well known game with opponents of unknown strength. It's clear that he meant &quot;Stratego&quot; and he admitted that Giganten was heavily inspired by Stratego. The change from military units to dinosaurs is a minor change, but there were more important changes: 1 - small edition: added variable terrain (land, swamp, lakes); the lakes in Stratego were not terrain, but mere obstacles. 2 - large edition: added variable board consisting of 4 parts and added 2 more dinosaurs.<br/><br/>The French version of the game was called &quot;Dinosaures.&quot;<br/><br/>",

This reputation precedes them, as many clans refuse to to travel to their lands out of fear of attack or imprisonment.

He was an extraordinary monarch: being engaged in the publication of laws and economy, poetry and writing, he was also obsessed with stars.<br/>At the very beginning of his reign, Alfonso X invited the best astronomers and asked them to compile detailed astronomical tables with coordinates of celestial objects. The Alfonsine tables laid the foundation for scientific works of Copernicus and revolution in astronomy.<br/>In 1283 under his leadership the translation of the Arabic composition &ldquo;Libro de los Juegos&rdquo; (&ldquo;Book of games&rdquo;) was completed into Spanish and this brought chess and many other board games from East to Europe. Among the translated rules were &ldquo;astronomical games&rdquo;. One of them is right in front of you.<br/><br/>In the game Astrum you will become stargazers who make up the atlas of the starry sky commissioned by Alfonse X Astrologer.<br/><br/>Your goal is to fill your personal playing board with figures of various constellations so as to satisfy the requirements of the enlightened king.<br/>Each board is divided into 4 colored sectors, which corresponds to one of the stacks of constellation figures. By placing a figure on one of colored sectors at your board, you determine the color for figure that the next player will take. However, he is also free to place this figure anywhere on his board.  <br/>Each figure combines several bright stars on the board and has 1 or 2 external connections, allowing you to continue the constellation. When you finish the constellation (it has no longer open external connections), you get victory points by the number of bright stars in it.<br/><br/>When one of figures&rsquo; pile ends, all players lay out a new pack and complete the round.

The other player is &quot;The Godzilla Side&quot;, just Godzilla. Godzilla approaches the coast from the sea in search of Mothra's hidden egg, with lots of chaos and destruction along the way. The Mothra player uses the defense forces and hidden tactics to slow Godzilla long enough to allow the egg to hatch so that the Mothra larva(e) can face Godzilla. The game uses the &quot;city side&quot; of the gameboard.<br/><br/>- Part II: Solo Game - provides rules for solitaire play of the Mothra vs Godzilla scenario. The player plays &quot;The Mothra Side&quot;, with cards and die rolls governing the movement and behavior of Godzilla.<br/><br/>- Part III: Rules for additional scenarios - provides rules for 4 scenarios in which additional monsters face off against one another. Stats for Mothra (adult), Rodan, King Ghidorah, Anguirus, Gigan and Mechagodzilla - as well as aliens controlling the monsters - are included.

Its exact origin is not confirmed, however, it is thought to have originated among the Tagalogs, natives of the island of Luzon in the Philippines, during the country's Spanish period.<br/><br/>Pan is played with a deck of 320 cards (8 standard decks with the 8's, 9's, and 10's removed -- no Jokers).  Each player is dealt a hand of 10 cards.  The winner of the hand is the first person to meld 11 cards (his 10 card hand plus a draw).  Certain melds are called &quot;conditions&quot; and result in the player collecting chips from the other players.  There are rules regarding what is a valid meld, &quot;folding&quot; at the beginning of the hand, and so on.

At least that's the rumor going around. In any case, it's all in fun.<br/><br/>From the Fantasy Gamer review by Scott Haring:<br/><br/>&quot;Let's face it.  If you're seriously concerned that Nuclear War trivializes one of the most important issues of our time, and if you sometimes wonder if fantasy role-playing games are warping the youth of America, then Christians and Lions may not be the game for you. Despite the warning on the cover (it says, 'The Irreverent Strategy Game,' right there in big print), you may not be prepared for what's inside.  Therein lies C&amp;L's first hurdle - can anyone take seriously a game in which dozens of perfectly blameless innocents are ripped to shreds by marauding beasts? ...All this is very important in figuring the best strategy. What? Strategy?  Yes, Virginia, this game is not only borderline tacky and a barrel of laughs, its also a fairly good strategy game.&quot;  (Fantasy Gamer #4, Feb/Mar 1984)<br/><br/>",

The system is akin to many boardgames and once learned flows as quickly as any alternate move system.<br/>This second edition highlights the increasing use of sophisticated fire control systems as well as other electronic aids on the battlefield, the use of many of which are covered by optional rules.<br/>The main difference from the first edition is in the handling of armour penetration, with the increasing use of composite and active armours. Each armour factor on a vehicle is still 25mm of actual armoured effectiveness at QO slope being taken into account in the thickness, but a 0 factor now represents armour upto about 15mm on light vehicles. The penetration value of weapons is however nearer their true value and a new set of penetration tables and effectiveness charts are used. HESH or HEP are not the super round that it appears in some rules, it has a maximum effective engagement range of 800m, after that you need to start lobbing it using the direct area fire rules. Modern infantry fire stresses volume rather than accuracy and I have therefore considered it a form of area fire and combined it on the same effects table as artillery. In this edition I have also taken the opportunity to reduce the infantry scale to that of a section as was done with the companion Firefly WWII rules.<br/>Helicopters are treated as very fast vehicles and are highly effective but fragile anti-tank vehicles, the full range of their capabilities are covered. Aircraft are an important part of the modern battlefield, but I have limited their impact on the game to direct support of ground elements, although with an increased effectiveness over the first edition.<br/><br/>Wargames Research Group 1950-1985 Rules for Armoured Warfare<br/>Not a Challenger Expansion<br/>1980 Ultra Modern Army Lists and Organisations<br/>1982 Ultra Modern Army Lists and Organisations Second Edition<br/><br/>1983 Challenger Revised Edition<br/><br/>1984 Battlezones - Scenarios for the Ultra Modern Period<br/><br/>1985 Ultra Modern Army Lists and Organistation Volume 1<br/>The Central Front <br/>Nato Warpac <br/>European Neutrals<br/><br/>1985 Utlra Modern Army Lists &amp; Organisation Volume 2<br/>Middle East<br/>Africa<br/>Far East<br/>Latin America<br/>Intervention Forces<br/><br/>1986 Digest No. 3 - Challenger / Corps Commander<br/>Engineering Equipment Data<br/>Engineering Lists<br/>Engineering Scenarios<br/>Equipment Data Update<br/>Army List Update<br/>Challenger Rule Amendments<br/>Challenger Close Assault Rules<br/>Coprt Commander OMG Reinforcements<br/>Armoured Recovery Vehicles<br/>The Australian Army<br/><br/>1988 / 1989 Challenger II<br/><br/>1989 Digest 4<br/>Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Rules<br/>The Central Front<br/>NATO<br/>Warpac<br/>European Nuetrals<br/><br/>1989 Digest 5<br/>Ultra Modern Army Lists for Challenger II Ruels<br/>Middle East<br/>Africa<br/>Far East<br/>Latin America<br/>Intervention Forces<br/><br/>1989 Modern Aircraft Handbook - Aircaraft Details &amp; Weapons for Challenger II<br/>1992 Revised Modern Aircraft Handbook - Aircraft Details &amp; Weapons for Challenger II (Ammendments + Challenger 2000 Modificaions).<br/><br/>1992 <br/>Challenger 2000<br/>1994 Challenger 2000 Modern Equipment Second Edition Part One<br/>1998 Challanger 2000 Modern Equipment Second Edition Part Two<br/><br/>",

One player starts to tell a fairy tale that they make up, so that the story includes all the items represented on the cards (figures, landscapes, building and objects). As soon as an item appearing on a card has been named by the story-teller, the players try to grab the card. Whoever is the first to reach it, places it in front of them and the fairy tale continues. With older children whoever grabs the card continues as the storyteller.<br/><br/>",

Ltd, makers of playing cards and printers of English Bank notes.<br/><br/>Stumpz is described as &quot;The Indoor Cricket Game Played by The Australian Test Team, English Teams and Keen Cricketers Everywhere&quot;.<br/><br/>It contains many elements of cricket missing from many cricket board games, including being able to determine line and length, field settings and so on. The game is a small work of art and came in deluxe and budget versions (as far as I can tell). While the budget version has player pieces represented by small wooden tokens and a material play mat, the deluxe version has small, lead figures of cricketers in various poses, and a mounted board.<br/><br/>All in all a lovely little game in the small field of cricket board games.<br/><br/>Note: This game was published circa 1931 for the first time and was designed by Charles Goodall, the great grandson of the founder of playing card company, Goodall &amp; Sons. The game was published by De La Rue following its purchase in 1922 of Goodall &amp; Sons.<br/><br/>",

Houses are built by, first, obtaining a &quot;Licence to Build&quot; and then blue, red and green counters, representing respectively Units of Labour, Units of Material and Units of Power.Players may trade counters to complete their housing estates. Each player is provided with a Playing Board representing a Housing Estate and indicating positions for the various pieces used during the game.<br/><br/>In the 1940's this was a topical subject for a board game as the British government was replacing housing stock destroyed by the Luftwaffe and also trying to provide more 'Homes fit for heroes'<br/><br/>The game is notable for the quality of its components - metal dice, counters, coins, good quality wooden houses and Playing Boards - at a time when rationing was still in place and raw materials were at a premium.<br/><br/>At some time the box was enlarged, and the rules were subsequently enlarged from 2 to 3 pages. Parts of some rules were rewritten, and explanations of some rules expanded. Two new paragraphs were added at the end. One was headed, &quot;Housing Drive, Shorter Version&quot;. The other was headed &quot;Housing Drive, Simplified Version&quot;, described as &quot;a simple game for young children.&quot;<br/><br/>A player who completes the game and has no Government Subsidy debited against him/her is the winner. If two players qualify, the one who has built the most houses wins. If all players have Government Subsidies debited against them, then &quot;the player whose Government Subsidy per House is the lowest is the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>Incidentally, the front of the game describes it as being for 2 to 8 players, although the rules and pieces are clearly for 2 to 6 players (e.g. there are only 6 playing boards). At some time a red sticker was placed on the enlarged box correcting the error.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a monopoly-like game with three kingdom's theme.Roll your dice,buy locations,employ generals to conquer other lords and unite ancient China.<br/><br/>Some rules differences between this and Monopoly:<br/><br/><br/>         Each player starts with a property and their starting space is that starting property rather than the Go space (called the palace in this game). For example, Cao Cao starts the game at Chen Liu and owning that deed.<br/>             In addition, the colored set corresponding to the starting property of that pawn is also free to purchase for that pawn when landing on it. For example, Cao Cao can buy any blue property (including Chen Liu if he ever lost it, Shou Chun, or Xia Pi) for free when landing on it and no one owns it.<br/>        <br/>         No bonus for completing a colored set.<br/>             Unlike monopoly, you can start building &quot;houses&quot; (camps in this game) even w/o collecting a complete colored set.  However, you can only build them when you land on a property and only on that property.<br/>             Only 3 houses before a &quot;hotel&quot; (city [walls] in this game).<br/>        <br/>         Free parking space replaced by a Shrine space where if you land on it, any accumulated money in that space is split between the player that landed on it and the bank at around 50/50.<br/>         Jail/Just visiting space replaced by maintenance space<br/>             Each player pays 200 taels [aka gold] per property owned (doesn't matter about houses).  <br/>             Player who pays the LEAST money from this gets a free camp built on a property of their choice.  Money paid for maintenance goes to the shrine space.<br/>        <br/>         Go to Jail space replaced by a Disaster Aid space. <br/>             Each player pays 10% rounded down to the nearest 100 taels of their current cash on hand to the shrine space.  <br/>             The player that pays the MOST money from this gets a free camp built on a property of their choice.<br/>        <br/>         Community Chest cards are called Secret Pouches (ala Zhuge Liang) and are generally somewhat more powerful than in Monopoly, though some are still weak as well.<br/>         Chance spaces replaced by a Tavern space where you can recruit officers to join you.  <br/>             Only 3 officers are displayed at a time and these 3 are replaced whether or not you recruit one after landing on a Tavern Space.<br/>             Each player can recruit a total of 3 officers, which each officer having a special passive ability specific to that officer.  For example, Diao Chan forces an opponent paying rent to you to pay an additional 1500.  Lu Bu allows you to not pay any rent for landing on a space, but after using him, you must put him back at the bottom of the officer draw deck.  <br/>             There are a total of 30 officers to choose from.<br/>        <br/>         After a player goes bankrupt, that player actually submits to the player that caused the bankruptcy.  <br/>             The bankrupt player is now considered a Subordinate while his master is considered the &quot;New Ruler&quot;.  <br/>             They share resources, officers, and properties. The New Ruler essentially gets to move two pawns per turn instead of one, with the Subordinate rolling his own moves but the results of the space the Subordinate's pawn landing on being resolved by the New Ruler.  <br/>             This keeps the subordinate tied to the game instead of being completely eliminated.  When the ruler wins, the subordinate gets second place.  <br/>             There can be multiple levels of subordinates as a result of cascading bankruptcies etc. <br/>        <br/>         The game is won when only one ruler is left and the rest are his subordinates.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Overall, a more complex game than monopoly, especially cause of the officer cards and the somewhat more powerful community chest.  Also, the free camps from the maintenance and disaster aid spaces promote hoarding of cash while developing only a few properties normally.  Easily expandable to 6, 7, or 8 players, really. Though that'll increase the game length dramatically, of course.<br/><br/>",

This is an epic story of early Irish Literature. It tells of a war against Ulster by the Connacht queen Medb and her husband Ailill, who intend to steal the bull Donn Cuailnge, opposed only by the Ulster hero Cuchulain.<br/><br/>Can Cuchulain hold off an entire army single-handedly or will Medb&rsquo;s warriors win the day?<br/><br/>The Object of the Game<br/>Cuchulain must slay three of Queen Meb&rsquo;s chosen champions to win. If he dies before he does this Queen Medb wins.<br/><br/>Turn Order<br/>Cuchulain begins with 6 Battle Cards in hand, Queen Medb with 5 Battle Cards. The game is played in alternating turns, beginning with Queen Medb. A turn consists of two phases: Support and Combat.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn they will first Support<br/><br/>1. Draw back to 5 or 6 Battle Cards in hand depending upon the player. Shuffle the discard deck if necessary to create a new Draw Deck. If a player has more than their starting number of cards in hand, they do not draw new ones. Players always draw cards to replenish their hand at the start of their turn.<br/><br/>2. The player may then choose to:<br/><br/>Play one Battle Card from hand as an Event, either discarding the card or removing (in this case the card will state it is to be removed)<br/>or<br/>Discard one or more Battle Cards from hand for action points, marking the Action Points (AP) on the respective track.<br/>or<br/>Play one Battle Card from hand as an Attack or Defense Stat Boost. The card is placed horizontally to the right of Cuchulain or Medb&rsquo;s Champion, aligning with their base Attack and Defense values. In subsequent turns, additional cards may also boost these stats. Overlap each card so that the values can be read horizontally.<br/>or<br/>Play one Battle Card from hand to Heal, discarding the card. This option may only be chosen by Cuchulain<br/><br/>3. Then, if the player chooses to, they may Combat as the Attacker<br/><br/>4. When the Combat phase has ended, discard all cards played the Combat Lines to their respective discard decks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Giant war machines duel in the 41st millennium!<br/><br/>Dominating the battlefield with their size and firepower, Imperial Knights are towering bipedal weapons platforms that hold no quarter in eliminating their targets &ndash; but like anything else, they are vulnerable to the dark clutches of Chaos. The Freeblade Knight once known as the Living Litany is an unfortunate example; nobody knows what truly happened to this once-valiant hero, only that it has renamed itself Litany of Destruction, and has been leaving a brutal trail of devastation in its wake. The Imperial Knight Ever-Stalwart has made planetfall on Tellerax Prime with one goal in mind &ndash; hunt down his fallen brother and restore the honour of the knightly houses, or die trying!<br/><br/>In Imperial Knights: Renegade, you take control of an Imperial Knight- a giant, walking, mechanised weapons platform, and try to win scenarios using movement, firepower and close combat. Every game turn is split into two phases- the plan phase and the execute phase. In the plan phase, each player secretly writes down what actions they intend to perform in the execute phase, consulting the action table. Each action has an action point cost with a budget of 3 per turn. When each player has worked out what they intend to do, they move on the execute phase and reveal their actions. Each player carries out their elected actions in the order they appear on the action table. if both players choose the same action, you roll off to see who goes first. The more powerful or useful an action is, the later that actions comes in the order of play, so choose your knight's actions wisely. The goal of each game varies with the scenario chosen and can range from total elimination to reaching an important objective on the board.<br/><br/>Imperial Knights: Renegade is a game of bluff and feint, outwitting your opponent, making clever use of terrain, movement and ion shields to secure victory. The right action at the right time can snatch a glorious victory from the jaws of bitter defeat, and an incautious move can leave your knight's lifeless hulk rusting in the pitiless sun.<br/><br/>",

To pass the days they used the maintenance systems to modify two of the small housekeeping bots to race around the site's reconfigurable service-ways. As they are semi autonomous the 'bots have to receive their directions in burst transmissions.  Now the AI's are happy steering, drifting, and jumping their machines against each other in full on races.<br/><br/>In Microbot Racers players assume the role of one of the two spaceport AI's racing the other.  Each round they select the actions their 'bot can take on the action card before sending them their instructions in a burst transmission.  Players will need to avoid obstacles, hazards and each other in their mad dash round the track, but can make life difficult for one another by triggering the reconfiguration switches that cause sections of track to rotate or flip, changing the course in mid-race.<br/><br/>This game was an entry in the 2016 2 player PnP competition.  A microgame requiring only the 11 cards and a few extra components, its is quick and easy to build and play.<br/><br/>",

To support the powerful but immobile big guns, Finnish strategy called for small, armored coast-defense ships that could slip between the islands and torpedo-armed ships to dart out and sink attacking enemy warships.<br/><br/>That never came to pass: the Finns built two top-heavy armored gunboats which they called &ldquo;battleships,&rdquo; but never funded the third member of the class. A handful of motor torpedo boats would be fielded during the Second World War, but plans to build or buy a group of six small destroyers repeatedly failed to win Parliamentary approval.<br/><br/>The Daylight Savings 2017 Golden Journal comes with 20 new laser-cut and mounted playing pieces representing Finland's Fantasy Fleet composed of these new ships, plus a couple of new Sea of Iron scenarios for their use.<br/><br/>",

Of course, being no-nonsense billionaire tech-bro geniuses, they can only say two words to sum up their solution. One player doesn't know the problem. They are Elon Musk, and can only babble random words (eg if problem is kids stuck in flooded cave - players say things like &quot;robot divers&quot;, &quot;cave drill&quot;, &quot;waterproof bats&quot;. The player who is Elon says &quot;ipod submarine&quot; or &quot;space roadster&quot;.<br/><br/>Once everyone has had a pitch the players try to figure out who - if anyone - is Elon Musk. If they are right - they win... unless Elon Musk has successfully guessed what the problem is. If he has, Elon wins and everyone else loses.<br/><br/>",

Each Player takes part as a Jarl in charge of his own Viking Settlement on the fictional island of Fj&ouml;rnheim.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to regain the Favour of the Gods. To do so you will have to raid towns and villages in order to gather resources to construct new buildings in your settlement, as well as recruiting new warriors and building new ships.<br/><br/>Every game starts with the summer raids, the so called &quot;Vikingfahrt&quot;. All Players pick a village to attack with their starting unit of Nordic Warriors. Afterwards they fight, following the intuitive battle system of fixed attack and defense stats combined with the rolling of D3 dice.<br/>In case of success, the Players get to loot the village for treasures by drawing one of 35 unique loot cards, this is the main income the Players have throughout the &quot;year&quot;.<br/><br/>Back home in their Viking Settlement, the Players make use of their new gained fortune, recruiting more warriors, bringing sacrifices to the Gods and starting to construct more ships and buildings to extend their settlement.<br/>From now on every season will start with the drawing of an event card, there are 60 different ones, and each one of them may bring you joy or pain, or something in between. Every card has it's own story, many of them are inspired by actual mythic stories and events of the viking ages.<br/>Another important part of the game are the ways of the northern Gods. Their will is represented by 60 cards. By bringing sacrifices and certain events, the Gods will grant you their Benevolence. Other events or hostile fellow Players may force you to draw Wrath of the Gods cards. As in the event cards, every single &bdquo;Card of the Gods&ldquo; tells a story, many of them following real Norse mythology. Each card has its unique effect.<br/><br/>The Game ends when one of the Players has collected 7 &bdquo;Favour of the Gods&ldquo; points and therefore reaches the Golden Gates of VALHAL.<br/><br/>About the second print.<br/><br/>The second print features high quality dice and plastic coins instead of cardboard tokens.<br/>The rulebook as well as the cards have been revised and cleaned up.

Ideal for the curious who wish to discover or rediscover History in all or simply or the amateurs who want to consolidate their knowledge.<br/><br/>A simple and clever game principle rewarded with a silver medal at the Concours L&eacute;pine in 2010.<br/><br/>Chroniis a card game where each card depicts a historical event, invention or discovery on both sides, with the year in which that event occurred, invention or discovery was made on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a card is revealed that shows one or two hands and a combination of colored rings. As quickly as you can, move the rings from finger to finger to recreate that pattern before anyone else. The fastest player to do so wins the card, and whoever first collects five cards wins.<br/><br/>Some constraints will make the task harder, such as treating one color as another or forcing you to switch rings without looking at your fingers.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to get the most treasures.<br/><br/>The game has card drafting and set collection mechanism.<br/><br/>Each player has five cards (a piece of map) in their hands. In your turn, you trade cards in your hands with cards in caravans or with other players. When you place your cards in the caravan, you can stack them up to prevent other players from taking them. Or you can play the 'Duel' card to rob other players, but you should always be prepared for counterattacks.<br/><br/>Collect three pieces and complete a map set, and you excavate hidden treasures and jewelry from the game board. Treasures have different effects, which makes interesting changes in the game. When all the treasures are excavated, the player with the most jewels wins.<br/><br/>",

Modern technology is no longer available, and the entirety of the northern hemisphere becomes a desolate hellscape as a result of the ensuing solar storms. <br/>Society&rsquo;s rules and regulations are replaced by anarchy, and every day becomes a struggle for survival.<br/><br/>As gameplay commences, you will become an integral member of one of the few remaining honorable and socially-minded communities. Players will choose between four unique characters (six with expansions), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and will head into the wastelands to ensure the survival of the group and fulfill crucial tasks. The game can be played with a fully-cooperative approach, or to make things extra interesting, there could also be a traitor within the group. <br/>Choose one of the four missions included in the core box, which are varied according to difficulty, play-time, and strategic approach. <br/> Under our Sun has a turn-based gameplay where each round represents a single day divided into different phases (morning, noon, evening, and night). Explore the area, tile by tile, to trigger events scattered throughout the map. Find precious loot and scavenge for resources to craft unique items in an effort to upgrade both your character and shelter. Engage in life or death fights against humans, animals, or something completely unknown. Adapt to ever changing weather conditions where even the most elementary of tasks results in a fight for survival.<br/><br/>To succeed in this harsh land, players must manage resources, maintain their health, and ensure adequate water supply. Only through collaboration and the use of individual skills, will players be able to achieve survival and reach their ultimate goal (whatever that may be). <br/> Dive into the thrilling and complex world of &ldquo;Under our Sun,&rdquo; and become one of earth&rsquo;s final survivors!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In response, all the warring factions are throwing in ever-increasing numbers of fresh troops, including heavier armoured elements and specialists.<br/><br/>With your Urban War strike-team as the core, Metropolis enables you to build much larger battle-forces to pit against your enemies in full-scale warfare.<br/><br/>Game Intro<br/>Metropolis moves the action up a level from the small-scale skirmishes played out in Urban War. It shifts the focus from the individual to the squad. Your armies, or &lsquo;Battle-forces&rsquo;, will largely consist of several squads that vary in size, but normally contain around five to ten troopers. Accompanying them will be various individual models that represent important officers and characters, and larger more powerful war machines and vehicles.<br/><br/>Each faction has a different battle-force structure. Various basic squads form the foundation of their battle-forces, with the mix of support, assault, and elite squads, and the accompanying individuals and war machines, giving each their own unique flavour.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game, played mainly in Quebec, is different enough from Checkers to be called a distinct game. It is played on a 12 x 12 board of 144 squares with 30 pieces on a side.<br/><br/>Un-promoted pieces can capture forward or backward. A promoted piece (queen) moves like a chess bishop, and can capture a piece anywhere along its line of movement.<br/><br/>One of the rules that set it apart from Draughts and Checkers is Compulsory Capturing. Once begun, you must take all the pieces you are able without stopping short. To do so means the forfeiture of your piece. This can be a strategic move but trying it more than once during a tournament is not advisable.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Checkers Family<br/><br/>",

Unusual, because you have to play so that the following players can possibly create as well. And the time is running - either via a conventional timer (kitchen timer or smartphone) or via the Music.<br/><br/>Here's how it works: The cards are face-up and the players have to take down cards in turn - as with Mau Mau you can put the same numbers or colors on top of each other. But you have to rethink: Since all have the same goal - namely, that as many as possible cards are stored within 4 &frac12; minutes - you play as possible so that the other players can also serve. But there are two discard piles - this increases the chances. But the time is running - it means keep your nerves and overview.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

You know what you have to do.&rdquo; As you are handed the machine, your mind immediately goes back to that one event that you always wished that you could have changed.<br/><br/>This is your chance to change it. You see on the readout that the machine is already primed to go to the exact date and time that you were thinking of. As you press the activate button, the other you says, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t screw it up like I did.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Second Most Perfect Moment is a standalone (and combinable) expansion to The Perfect Moment. It's made up of 3 small expansions that were released in 2019.<br/><br/>Players race to rewrite history in their favor using a deck of only 18 cards. Players use equipment, exploit paradoxes in the time-space continuum, and author their own revision of the past. Featuring a clever multi-sided card system, every card is used by both players based on what they can see. Equipping that card for yourself may just give your opponent the ability they were looking for. Every turn, players activate up to two revealed cards, which each have special effects. After the effects are resolved, the player can optionally score a card to earn up to 3 points depending on how closely they match it. The first player to 16 points wins. It takes careful planning and a bit of luck to avoid failing like you have so many times before. This time will be different.<br/><br/>This time...<br/><br/><br/>This can be played on its own or combined with The Perfect Moment and expansions.<br/><br/>Includes 3 previously released expansion sets of the series, and the solo mode rule set:<br/><br/>     1979: A Job Interview Gone Wrong<br/>     1987: A Little Espionage Gone Wrong<br/>     2010: An Escape Plan Gone Wrong<br/>     The Perfect Moment: Echoes (2nd version)<br/><br/><br/>",

In this card-collecting game that will definitely grow on you, forage for the best fungi to be the first player to reach ten points and win the game.<br/><br/>The starting player chooses a mushroom card from their hand to start the round, and the other players must play a card matching the color of this card with a higher or lower value. The card with the highest value of the lead color wins the round, with the winning player getting first pick of one of the cards played that round, the second player then choosing one, and so on. As the game goes on, the aim is to try to collect clusters, or combinations of 2 to 4 different fungi. Each completed cluster has a points value, and the player who reaches ten points first will be crowned champignon!<br/><br/>Be sure to pick your fungi wisely, as some can be toxic and played against other foragers!<br/><br/>A magical mushroom game for fun-gis and fun-girls alike, it's suitable for ages 8+, 2 to 4 players and has an average 30 minute gameplay.

        "description": "THE STORY<br/><br/>Year 2067: global warming is no longer a prophecy but a reality.<br/>The world, as we know it, has changed. Cities, governments, and nationalities got diluted giving way to a single world power, the World Federation. This new order represents few privileged, citizens of former first powers who today live protected from the chaos and misery that invades the planet. The rest of humanity migrates aimlessly on the run from war, hunger, and destruction left behind by climate change.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the new world, driven by state-of-the-art technology, raises its walls seeking isolation from chaos. Set in the form of Smart Cities and defended by machines, the new world order is forced to find a solution to uncover illegal immigrants who manage to cross its borders and disguise among its citizens. Andrana Project, a Nano chip implanted in the nape of its inhabitants is the new identity document. From this moment on, everything involving a person is linked to their nanochip: their identity, bank and medical details, properties, titles... everything.<br/><br/>Project Andrana is well received by the majority of the population, although many are opposed to its potential risks. In this context, an old ideological movement begins to acquire strength and prominence: The Neoluddites.<br/><br/>Convinced that technology has a negative impact on people, their communities and the environment, Neoluddites believe that social and ecological collapse condemns most of the world's population to live in misery. Although this ideology has been alive for years, its followers had just passively abandoned technology until the arrival of Project Andrana, after which they started to get organized to act as a group. Neoluddites are dispersed all over the world and they know no frontiers. There are different factions, some more pacifist, and other more radical ones, determined to end the hegemony of the World Federation, which has taken technological evolution to the extreme. In time, some citizens of the World Federation will join this movement, tearing their nanochip off, becoming exiles and preparing to fight the system.<br/> Constant confrontations between the World Federation and the Neoluddites will shape the fate of humanity.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>This is the plot of Andrana Project, an independent game that will be able to test your strategic ability, emotional intelligence, teamwork capacity and leadership skills.<br/><br/>Andrana Project is a phygital social game, this means that it is a group game, played face to face, supported on your smart phone or tablet.<br/><br/>To play Andrana Project you need a minimum of 4 players with smartphone/tablet and Internet connection. Every player needs to download the game, one of them will start the game and each of them will be assigned a team and a character.<br/><br/>In Andrana Project there are two opposing teams: the Neoluddites and the World Federation. Players from both teams have to discover their opponents to shut them down. The game has different missions that will get upgraded depending on how much it&rsquo;s played.<br/><br/>Each player will be assigned a different character from each team, which means also different abilities and power inside the game.<br/><br/>These are the main powers of each of them (among many others):<br/><br/>The Neoluddites leader: As the Leader, he can recruit citizens. If he recruits a citizen he/she will become a Neoluddite and will fight for his team.<br/><br/>Neoluddites Doctor: As a Doctor, she can heal herself or any player she wants, so she can prevent that person of dying.<br/><br/>Neoluddites Citizen: As a citizen, they can save someone&rsquo; life, giving theirs instead. If they save someone from their team will result in a lot of points.<br/><br/>All Neoluddites have to be careful when stealing the access. If they steal the wrong person their identity will be revealed to that player.<br/><br/>Cybersecurity: As Cybersecurity, they can spy on one player to know his/her identity. They have the module, the Andrana server&rsquo;s access. The Neoluddites want to steal them. The Agent knows who this person is and he will try to protect him.<br/><br/>DCS Agent: A DCS Agent can arrest other players to disable them in the next round. They are the only one who can recharge their weapon and attack more than once.<br/>They must protect Cybersecurity, being aware of shooting him, if they kill him their team loses the game.<br/><br/>CITIZEN: As a citizen, they can save someone&rsquo;s life, giving theirs instead. If they save someone from their team will result in a lot of points.<br/><br/>Each player needs to hide its identity from the rest, and at the same time observe their opponents to uncover theirs.<br/><br/>",

The attack is done as follows: the player rolls the five d6, after which he can re-roll the dice he wants (however, each time he must keep at least one die, so that the attack will be composed at most of five rolls).<br/><br/>The goal is to try to damage the opponent, with each &ldquo;6&rdquo; being a possible damage.<br/><br/>When the attacker has completed his throws, the defender must try to parry: he chooses one of the numbers shown by the dice and throws all the dice that show that number. But beware!: with a single roll now he has to obtain at least one die with a higher number, and he has only one possibility.<br/><br/>If he fails, he suffers one damage for each &ldquo;6&rdquo; that the attacker has rolled, plus an additional damage. If he succeeds, instead, the attacker suffers as many damages as the difference between the thrown number and the lower among the attack dice.<br/><br/>The Roulette is very simple and each game lasts from two to three minutes. Even though, attacker and defender have often strategy doubts.<br/><br/>Also a more-than-two player version exists.<br/><br/>",

How have they changed from their cousins who remained behind in the Inner Sphere? In the tradition of the Clan Wolf and Jade Falcon sourcebooks, Invading Clans details the history, culture and military might of the remaining invading Clans.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This book is a companion volume to the two more specific Clan volumes produced for the Wolf and Jade Falcon Clans, and details the other five Clans that invaded the Inner Sphere, to varying degrees of detail. Expanding on the background detail are details and in-game stats for 10 new BattleMechs, two for each of the Clans. These were later reproduced in the BattleTech: Technical Readout 3058, so if you own that sourcebook already you won't get any new equipment out of this one, but the background is useful when constructing games that feature the Clans, as protagonists or antagonists.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the editor's website:<br/><br/>To reinvigorate their stalled Italian campaign, the Allies landed a reinforced corps at the small coastal town of Anzio, just 30 miles from Rome and the German supply arteries. A hesitant advance and a rapid German reaction set the stage for a nip-and-tuck battle for the beachhead.<br/> This classic campaign is covered using the Fire &amp; Movement system at one kilometer per hex and one day per turn. The standard unit is the infantry battalion, which can be strengthened by a multitude of tanks and other heavy weapons, plus fire support markers rated for different weapon types up to and including a massive heavy bomber strike.<br/> Each player has several strategic options, kept secret from his opponent, to use the fight for the beachhead to further the larger campaign. All strategies and operations are constrained by limited logistics; players must balance carefully his expenditures for reinforcements, replacements, and fire support. The player who strikes the best balance, and who best utilizes the various weapons at his disposal, has the chance to achieve a war-changing victory.<br/><br/>Components: One 22 x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trig is the root form of a suite of three games collectively entitled The Summer-House Floor.<br/><br/>It's a centrifugal connection game played on the Colour A and Colour B pathways of a regular, 127-cell hex-hex board coloured non-contiguously in Colour A, Colour B and Colour C (Colour C at the corners), with a single black cell - known as the Pillar - at its centre. The board is empty at start of play.<br/><br/>Two players, Black and White, take turns occupying with pieces of their own colour exactly one vacant cell which must be adjacent to the Pillar and/or to at least one occupied cell.  If a placement completes an equilateral triangle of any size whose other two vertices are friendly pieces already in place AND whose centre is occupied by an enemy piece, the latter is removed from the board and replaced with one of the mover's own colour. (Where a placement enables multiple captures just one of these must be chosen, and 'cascade' capture is never permitted.) Victory is achieved by completing a continuous string of one's own pieces which, however circuitously, links the Pillar to the edge of the board or forms a loop enclosing the Pillar somewhere within it.<br/><br/>Although demonstrably not undrawable, Trig has never produced a draw in actual play.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guards Armoured Division: Part of The Famous Divisions series by Decision Games, started with Gross Deutschland Panzer (World at War magazine #20) and continuing with British Guards Armour, uses a system that represents a new evolution in design that brings tactical elements to an otherwise operational simulation. Recreating four battles of the British Guards Armour Division in 1944 and 1945, this game includes four battles: Operation Goodwood, Operation Veritable, Bonninghardt Ridge, and Joe&rsquo;s Bridge. It was designed by John Schettler and developed by Eric Harvey and Ty Bomba.<br/><br/>The Famous Divisions Series offers a new concept: game play is governed by the drawing of &quot;Event Chits&quot; during combat. Combat is not simply resolved by comparing the attack strengths and defense strengths of units, but is modified by a random chit-draw of over 140 possible &quot;events&quot; that introduce the elements of chaos and unpredictability to combat resolution. Event Chits can be nullified by other Event Chits; so players never know how an attack may be resolved based solely on odds ratios.<br/><br/>Each hex represents approximately 500 meters from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents approximately six hours; however, the game turns aren't divided into separate friendly and enemy turns. Rather, each is comprised of numerous individual HQ activations. All of the HQ activation chits are placed into a cup, and each is drawn one at a time to initiate the activation (movement and combat) of a particular headquarters and its associated companies. When that HQ&rsquo;s activation is finished, a new HQ is drawn from the cup, and then its activation begins.<br/><br/>Famous Divisions: Guards Armour is a special edition game that includes two counter sheets (560 counters) and four maps (on two 22 x 34 inch sheets) of the various battlefields where the division fought. Combat units are individual companies featuring distinct vehicles and weapons, shown as icons along with the unique capabilities of the vehicle or weapon portrayed. At company level the game play is tactical in many respects: units have individual range values, different movement capabilities depending on type (wheeled, tracked and leg), and the rules cover such things as demolishing bridges, pontoon bridges, weather, overrun, supply, infantry riding tanks, direct ranged fire, artillery barrages, opportunity fire, night, fortifications (bunkers, trenches, mines, dragon&rsquo;s teeth), engineers, armor recovery vehicles, airpower and anti-aircraft.<br/><br/>While not a purpose-designed solitaire system, the Event Chit mechanism makes the series easily adapted to such play, since the player won't know what chits may be drawn that could alter combat, or what order the HQ activations will take place. Some examples of the 140 Event Chits are: Sniper, Good Commander, Ambush, Experienced NCO, Caught in Crossfire, Fanatic, Radio Out, Critical Hit, Frontal Assault, Elite Troops, Outflanked, Hand-to-Hand Combat, and Friendly Fire.<br/><br/>The game includes two maps (22x34&rdquo;) and two counter sheets containing 560 counters.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6 hours<br/>Hex: 601 yards / 550 meters<br/>Units: Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15<br/><br/>",

Unlike other race games where players can drift far to the rear and out of the action, Machinas uses a &quot;pack&quot; mechanic where players are always in the action. Instead of tracking your position on the track we track your position in the &quot;pack&quot;.<br/><br/>Machinas is our first card driven game that can be played by itself or added to any existing miniatures or RPG. Machinas is a stand alone game that can be used with any Post Apocalyptic rules, such as our own After the Horsemen.<br/><br/>All you need to play Machinas comes in one deck of cards and the rules. No track is needed and all you need to know to play the game is on the cards! You will have to provide a couple of everyday six-sided dice, but that's it.<br/><br/>Players customize their drivers and cars then race around the track. If you want you can race along highways and roadways in your favorite post apocalyptic setting, it's up to you.<br/><br/>Each driver has three Attributes - Savvy, Tech, and Speed and there's a wide variety of ways to customize your car. When the race starts each player keeps his cards out of sight until needed. Once played the cards are laid out for all to see. This keeps the customization of your car a secret until it is revealed.<br/><br/>But customizing your car and driver is just the beginning.<br/><br/>During the race you have to plan your strategy and tactics. When do you sit back and when do you make your move? Do you try and shoot up your opponents or make dramatic two car passes? Machinas is much more than rolling dice and the drivers with the the right strategy and good tactics will win.<br/><br/>Machinas is a perfect one-off pickup game, easy to learn and fun to play. For the serious gamers you can choose to play the Campaign Game where your cars and drivers get better as you gain experience.<br/><br/>",

Cosima is one of the most brilliant engineering minds in Europe and worked hard to live up to both her parents' legacies. But her parents had to go into hiding after LEGION targeted her father's work, which drove Cosima to join MAYHEM.<br/>Joule can deplay a Turret which attacks LEGION to draw their fire away from her. Her main Beam Weapon can either damage LEGION troopers or heal her Turret.<br/><br/>Red Card, aka Ingo Rotkapp, made it his job to be the #1 Ultra-Fan for German soccer club FC R&uuml;desheim. By the time LEGION had started targeting sporting events, Ingo had earned his notoriety as a brutal hooligan. After inciting a riot against LEGION during a championship game, MAYHEM decided that even a loose cannon like him could be the perfect weapon at the right time.<br/>Red Card is a tank on legs, that just charges into battle. He has a harness that releases an explosion damaging nearby enemies. The longer he waits, the more powerful the explosion, but the more susceptible he becomes to enemy attacks!<br/><br/>Rama, aka Pranati Malhotra, is a distinguished immunologist that fought to contain a Dark Matter Plague that spread like wildfire across her country. Now she pursues a cure for the disease and vengeance upon those who unleashed it.<br/>Rama fires an Energy BOW. The longer she charges a shot, the more damage the strike inflicts. Rama also has a special Mayhem ability that allows her to fire a shot that is tainted with a modified dark matter plague. A hit enemy is infected, suffering Damage over Time. When they die, a cloud of poisonous gas spreads the infection to other enemies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is largely based on the rules of 1830, but has a number of new elements that make it a standalone game.<br/><br/>First, the 6 private companies, all of which have a specific function, will be auctioned among the 3 to 6 players. Then the 8 railway companies can be opened. The special feature of 18BL are the rail buses, which are available as an alternative to the normal locomotives. The rail busses reflect passenger transport by rail in rural areas of the Bergisch Land, which was not attractive enough for the use of normal passenger trains. The challenge for 18BL is to find the right mix of locomotives and rail busses according to the available rail network and the connected cities and towns.<br/><br/>",

You will campaign to become the leader of the continent&rsquo;s territories and then create a new infrastructure by building developments in the territories, like citadels and universities.<br/><br/>In your turn you have two actions which can be any combination of: campaign for a territory by playing campaign cards or your hard won influence so the people side with you rather than any other player; progress, where you develop your territories so they produce more or help to defend them from other players; support, where you call on your followers and patrons to provide you with more influence and cards to play; and enlighten where you can play ideology cards like liberalism, utilitarianism and pioneering or even nihilism.<br/><br/>The combination of the ideologies you play shows what form your new government style takes they also give you advantages which will help you to win over the people. Territories and ideologies both give you points which represent the support of the peoples of Ilyenashae. The winner is the one who reaches the tipping point of territories held and ideologies played that convinces the whole continent to follow them.<br/><br/>Legacy gameplay is a mix of strategy, resource management and civilisation building driven by area control and card play.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>&quot;This was already our second chance. We do not dare hope for a third but we must try, or else accept the end of everything. In our desperation we have rid ourselves of all self-serving princes, casting them down the mountain. We now look to those men and women who rise from the flame and ash still flying banners of hope, still urging us on despite the pain and devastation. We now turn to these heroes for new leadership and new ideas on how we should live and rule ourselves for the betterment of all. One of them will forge a new society that will unite all the peoples of Ilyenashae to stand and face our trials together. Our future will be their... Legacy.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guderian's War: The German Advance on Moscow, 1941 is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic simulation (with operational undertones) of the German drive on Moscow during Operation Barbarossa, a crucial part of their attempt to overrun the western Soviet Union in 1941. The German player is mainly on the offensive, attempting to win by seizing key areas on map faster than was done historically. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires he prosecute almost continuous counteroffensives throughout the game.<br/><br/>Game play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their invasion on 22 June and ends on 1 September of the same year. The main thrust of the design is to test Guderian's oft-repeated claim he could've led Army Group Center into Moscow during that time, had he only been allowed by Hitler to run a true blitzkrieg.<br/><br/>The game may end sooner than the historic termination time, if the German player is able to do significantly better than his historic counterpart by advancing so quickly he causes the overall political, social, economic and military collapse of the Soviet Union. Alternatively, if the German player doesn't do well enough soon enough, he may lose the game in that it's then assumed Hitler loses faith in the idea of taking Moscow and instead turns AGC's panzers south to Kiev, just as occurred historically.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 16 miles (26 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with a few units of other sizes. Most German divisions have four steps, while most Soviet units are one-step with unknown strengths upon entry. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout this campaign are built into the movement and combat rules. Each of the nine turns represents one week. The game is easily adaptable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/>- Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>- Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10<br/>- Time Scale: nine one-week turns<br/>- Map Scale: 16 (26 km) miles per hex<br/>- Unit of Maneuver: primarily divisions for both sides<br/>- Players: one or two<br/>- Playing Time: two to four hours<br/><br/>Projected Contents<br/>- One 34x22&quot; large-hex mounted map board<br/>- Two countersheets of 5/8&quot; size units (352 total), mounted and die-cut<br/>- One rule-book<br/>- Charts &amp; Tables<br/>- Dice<br/>- Game Box<br/><br/>",

As the Chief Honeyscout of your team, uncover locations of fields of flowers and get worker bees to swarm to treasure troves of nectar you have discovered. Get ready for the buzz of your life!<br/><br/>In HoneyScouts, you place hex tiles to match colors (essentially building the hive), and every time you match a color, you draft a card that gives the location of a flower, with the number indicating the distance between you (the bee) and the flower. When you match colors on the hive to create a complete hexagon of one color, you attract a bee to your swarm.<br/><br/>Why do the numbers on the cards matter? Because the game contains a trick-taking mechanism in which you can win bee battles and attract all the bees from an opponent, poaching them to your side. Special tiles and event cards can throw you off balance or be used to your advantage.<br/><br/>In the end, the player who attracts the most bees wins.<br/><br/>",

Well, we are sure a lot of you might be feeling impatient (in a good way, we hope) about Age of Rome's delivery, so here is a little gift to ease your waiting. We thought it would be cool to design a small spinoff pnp game while Age of Rome is moving into production. And we present to you, Prefect.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>In the game, one or more players take the role of Prefect, an administrator of a Roman province managing religion, politics, farming, trade, and military. During each round, players roll three dice and select one to grow the province and two to apply as waste. Players balance growth and waste as well as carefully prioritize their choices to earn the most glory points.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

States are awarded using a Hols der Geier/Raj-like system, wherein players choose a card from their hand and the high card wins, with tied states carried over to the next turn.  Play with 3 or 4 is individual, rather than partnership, with the player carrying the largest number of electoral votes winning.<br/><br/>Even within this edition, there are two versions, with one using a chalkboard and the other a dial scoreboard for tracking electoral votes. These versions also have somewhat different rules:<br/><br/><br/>     The 1965 edition has rules for a short game, a long game, and a nominee game. In the latter two games are played. In the first the players of each party compete against each other to determine which is the presidential candidate. In the second the parties compete in the general election, with the cards played summed by party.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The 1966 edition keeps the short and long game but removes the nominee game. Instead it offers the option of scoring by popular votes instead of electoral votes.<br/><br/><br/>",

(ie. she advances it 3 players if she bet 3.) The player seated to his/her left then moves the card by the number of players corresponding to his/her bet, even if the card is not in front of him/her, and so on, until all bets have been played, or two Zeroes have been played.<br/><br/><br/>The first Zero activates the bomb without moving it. (flip the card on its Uh-Oh side). <br/>The second zero makes it explode! (the player in front of whom the card is is eliminated).<br/><br/>If the card has been moved by the total number bet by all players without exploding, 2 possibilities:<br/>a. Its Yay! side is showing : Nothing happens. Start a new round.<br/><br/>b. Its Uh-Oh side is showing: The bomb explodes and eliminates the player in front of whom it is.<br/>Flip it back on its Yay! side and start a new round.<br/><br/>When a player is eliminated, place the card in front of the player to their left, and start a new round.<br/><br/>If three rounds end without a single explosion, then the bomb becomes a Supernova and obliterates the entire planet. Everyone loses.<br/>That&rsquo;ll teach you to play safely.<br/><br/>When there are only two players left, the round begins with the card on its Uh-Oh side, and cannot be deactivated.<br/><br/>The winner is the last one to survive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But who, exactly, is on your side?<br/><br/>Tradecraft is a hidden role card game where 3-6 players take on the roles of either Soviet or American spies during the Cold War era. Rather than using social deduction, players will have to carefully watch to see which cards are drafted and how they are played to decipher friend from foe. Players may never willingly show their role to another player, but may say whatever they want about it, even the truth if necessary. The game is played over the course of several rounds and can usually be finished in less than 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Each round has 3 phases:<br/><br/>1. Deal Cards - Roles and tradecraft cards will be shuffled and dealt randomly.  <br/>2. Choose Cards - Players will pass a portion of their cards to the left 3 times to draft the cards they want.  <br/>3. Play Cards - Cards are then executed in descending order, information flows, and bullets fly.<br/><br/>Scoring is based on the side winning the round (1 point) and completing a public or secret missions (usually 1 or 2 points).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher's summary<br/>GoRoGo is new Go variant game for two players played with each 10 ordinary black and white pieces and 5 additional  neutral ones. Each player has two of the neutral pieces, and one starts on the game board.<br/><br/>Like Go, the game is played on a grid, but the board has only a 5x5 grid with 25 intersections and 40 paths. The purpose of the game is to obtain more of your opponent's pieces, not to claim an area majority.<br/><br/>Since there are only 25 pieces, the game is over after 24 moves at most. A player cannot pass, nor play a neutral piece last. If they don't have a legal move, they lose.<br/><br/>The neutral pieces are both black and white. That is, on Black's turn, a neutral piece is a black piece. Then on White's turn, it is a white piece. This allows moves that are normally prohibited in Go, such as 'Kou'. A player can attack into an area that in Go would be protected.<br/><br/>GoRoGo is a GO game but not GO. It means that the tactics are GO tactics but the strategy isn't GO.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "<br/>         SET UP<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Each player takes one shield. Fold the wings of the shield and stand it in front of you.<br/>After putting all the tiles in the pocket, mix them well and split them equally among the players.(22 pieces each for 4 people)<br/>When playing with 3 players, each player takes 29 tiles and leave the remaining 1 tile in the pocket. The tiles taken from the pocket are taken inside the shield. Cover the tiles well and turn them all over so other players can't see them. <br/>If the game is played by 2 players, place all 5 colored &ldquo;1&rdquo; tiles in the center of the table and put all remaining tiles in the pocket and mix well. Each person takes 30 tiles from the pocket. Leave the remaining tiles in the pocket and do not use them. Then, hide all the tiles in the shield so that other players can&rsquo;t see them and turn them all over.<br/>If you put the tiles of the same color together, it will be helpful for you to play the game.<br/><br/><br/>         STARTING SETTING<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>- 4 Players : 22 Tiles<br/>- 3 Players : 29 Tiles<br/>- 4 Players : 30 Tiles<br/><br/><br/>        GOAL OF THE GAME<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Every tile you own is your negative score. The goal of Sixteen is to put down all the tiles you own first, or leave the fewest number of tiles. Tiles can be placed one color per turn, and must be placed in a higher number (in ascending order) than the number of tiles placed at the very end. You can also create an opportunity to remove remaining tiles by using 16END and 16RESTART tiles and special tiles such as scissors and trash cans. Make strategies by predicting other player&rsquo;s remaining tiles.<br/><br/><br/>         SPECIAL TILES<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>- 16 RESTART(5 : 1 per color) : You can restart the row by resetting the row of that color to the number '1'. Place a tile and pass the turn to the next player.<br/>- 16 END(5 : 1 per color) : You can finish the row of that color. 16END tiles can be removed with scissors or trash bin tiles, but you cannot place 16RESTART tiles.<br/>- Scissor tile(2) : You can remove one of the last tiles in a row. After removing it, you can place the tile one more time. You can only place the tile on the row that you used scissor tiles, or you can use scissor tiles only. Place the removed tiles and used scissor tiles separately next to the table.<br/>- Trash Bin Tiles(1) : You can discard as many tiles as you like, except for tile '1' in a row. You can place the tile one more time after discarding it. You can only place the tile once more on the line where you used the trash can tile, or you can use the trash can tile only. Put the discarded tiles and the used trash can tiles separately next to the table.<br/><br/><br/>         PLAYING THE GAME<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>If there is a tile with the number '1', place it all in the center of the table. The game is played clockwise starting with the player with the red number '1' tile. In the case of 2 players, a random player will be selected to start the game.<br/>When it's your turn, you can place down a tile once. Only tiles of one color can be placed down at a time. Each color of tiles with a number greater than the number of tiles placed at the end (in ascending order) can be placed. You cannot place a tile with a number smaller than the number of tiles placed at the end.<br/>If the ascending order conditions are satisfied, tiles can be laid down in two ways.<br/>(Default) : Place a larger number of tiles than the one placed at the end<br/>(Group) : Lay down a group of consecutive tiles<br/><br/><br/>         END OF THE GAME<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>There are two ways to end a game. If either of them applies, the game ends immediately.<br/>First, if a player has laid down all of their tiles, the game ends immediately and that player wins.<br/>Second, if all players yell &lsquo;PASS&rsquo; in one round, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>[How to calculate points]<br/>All the player remove theirs shield and add the number of tiles they have left.<br/>For any remaining 16 END and 16RESTART tiles, add 16 points. For scissors and trash bin tiles add 20 points each.<br/>Consecutive tiles must be in ascending order. If there is no break in the middle, the number of tiles can be placed down at once without a limit. 16END and 16RESTART can also be put down in groups. However, you can't lay down two 16 tiles at once. (Yes. You cannot put down 16END after 16RESTART in one turn)<br/><br/>After putting down the 16END and 16RESTART tiles, hand over the turn to the next player. After using scissors and trash can tiles, you can place down tiles of the corresponding color one more time, and this action is optional and not required. Scissors and trash can must be used until the game ends. If you don't use them and keep them till the end of the game, you get -20 points.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Pass&rdquo; if there are no tiles that can be put down in your turn. When your turn comes back, if there's a tile you can put down, put the tile down again and hand over the turn to the next player. The game continues until all players yell PASS or one player has put down all of the tiles they had.<br/><br/>If  the calculation is over, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>If there is a tie, compare the number of tiles and the one with fewer tiles wins.<br/>Ex) When 2 people are tied for the 1st place (19 points), the number of their tiles is compared. The 1PLAYER has 3 tiles, and the 2PLAYER has 2 tiles. Therefore, the 2PLAYER who has 1 less tile wins.<br/><br/><br/>         Contact Publisher<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>MAGICBEANGAMES(Republic of Korea)<br/>e-mail : magicbean@magicbeangame.com<br/><br/>",

The sequence of play is based on deliveries in an over which commence with the Bowler secretly selecting their bowl to deliver. The batter then marks on the field their attempted stroke, before the bowler reveals the bowl type. A rolling advantage is set based on various outcomes in gameplay, that may favour the batter or bowler. Next an Over Deck card is revealed that can affect the batter or bowler with different advantages or disadvantages.<br/><br/>Both teams then roll dice to determine the strength of the delivery and stroke, which may result in a strike, miss, or block. If struck, the ball enters the field where the batter rolls additional dice to determine the distance and bounce of the ball.<br/>As per the sport, the winning team either finishes with the most runs, or bowls the other team out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Vultures are nice, since they score either cards from the discard or from the forest which helps pivot when that card you really wanted for your hand ends up locked down elsewhere. Mockingbirds provide wild abilities to let them count as another bird type or value. And Nests score bonus points if you have exactly two birds of the same type in your chosen forest.

        "description": "(from ATO website:)<br/><br/>World War Two history has a pattern in both the European and Pacific Theaters. Constant Axis expansion, followed by steady Axis contraction, as the Allies recapture lost territory. In Europe, it is hard to pinpoint the transition point (a good barroom discussion any time!). In the Pacific, it is a little easier to focus precisely at the campaign where the Japanese tide of conquest began to ebb-- their unsuccessful campaign to take Port Moresby, the &quot;step too far.&quot;<br/><br/>What then represents the &quot;high tide&quot; of the Japanese Empire? That would be their successful conquest of the Dutch East Indies, one of their most strategically vital targets for the oil and rubber it could provide. A broad look at the record suggest the Japanese mostly had things their own way against the hasty &quot;ABDA&quot; alliance (American, British, Dutch, Australian), with its varied mix of modern and obsolete weapons and widely differing priorities. But a closer look shows that this was a much closer campaign, stretching the Japanese to complete. With a few breaks, the Allies might have held on.<br/><br/>Can you do better? Find out for yourself.<br/><br/>Forlorn Hopes covers the entire two-month campaign for the region, using a system that fully integrates air/sea/land operations. Derived from the popular titles &quot;Chennault's First Fight&quot; and &quot;Operation Cartwheel&quot; (both published by ATO), this game give both sides difficult choices in facing their different challenges.<br/><br/>The Allies are spread thin and facing multiple routes by which the enemy can attack. They know the maxim that &quot;those who defend everything defend nothing&quot; but deciding what NOT to hold is difficult. You must make the Japanese pay for every gain...<br/><br/>The Japanese face an enemy already in control of much of the battlefield and fighting with their backs to the wall. They have a schedule crunch and must weigh to benefits of using high cost assets to gain objectives. The cost of success at too high a price is long term failure (and who will tell the Emperor?).<br/><br/>BOTH players can choose to increase their available forces, representing greater emphasis in overall planning. But the reinforcements come at a cost in victory points that could tip the scales to the enemy. Both sides are charged with using assets as effectively as possible. This is not an easy win for either side.<br/><br/>Forlorn Hopes, the 2012 Annual, delivers the extra size and contents you expect from ATO. Full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; map. 288 die-cut, full color large 5/8&quot; counters provide players with the air, ground, and naval units which actually fought in the campaign, plus some which could have been there.<br/><br/>Maps - One full color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet<br/>Counters - 288 full color die-cut 5/8&quot; pieces<br/>Rules length - 16 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 4 pages<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Solitaire suitability - Average<br/>Playing time - Up to 2 to 3 hours for the smaller scenarios, 12 to 15 hours for the full campaign game<br/><br/>Design - Paul Rohrbaugh<br/>Development - Lembit Tohver<br/>Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Roll Saga Baseball is a tabletop fantasy role-playing game that brings the excitement of big league strategic action and the realism of the ballpark to the table.<br/><br/>You'll be acting as Owner, General Manager, and Manager (OGM) and playing your games on a large 28 x 28 inch premium game mat that is not only a replica with precise dimensions, but also convertible: it converts into any one of the 30 major league ballparks in two simple and quick steps. Your game mat rolls up after each use to be stored nicely in its own box and carrying case along with all other game components.<br/><br/>On the field, you'll be using real replica scoreboards and full teams consisting of 40-man rosters. You won't have to refer to a lot of charts, either, as we've printed most of what you need right there on the player tokens themselves.<br/><br/>How Games Are Played - A General Overview:<br/><br/>Games in Roll Saga Baseball are played just like games in true-life baseball. Game players act as Owners, General Managers, and Managers (OGMs) of baseball teams that consist of a full team roster of 40 players.<br/><br/>Each OGM (Owner/General Manager/Manager) selects his team and places all of the individual player tokens (each player token represents one team player) onto the field's dugout - the large white box on each side of the field. Each OGM then performs the necessary pre-game preparations like selecting a batting line-up (batting order) and choosing what starting, relief, and closing pitchers that they want to have in the game.<br/><br/>As each player comes up to bat, his player token is placed into the batter's box at home plate. The next batter in line after that batter would be placed in the on-deck circle.<br/><br/>With a batter in the batter's box, the opposing team's OGM would then control his pitcher on the mound by selecting certain types of pitches to throw, targeting the locations of those pitches (according to each individual pitches movement), and rolling 3 six sided dice to determine the success of failure of the pitching action. Each roll is augmented by that particular pitcher's pitching ability (PIT), like '+3' for example, that would be added to the roll to increase the overall sum of the total. Pitchers, just like all other players, can have special skill-sets (like Pitching Under Pressure, or Endurance, for example) that can further augment plays and increase the pitcher's overall game performance.<br/><br/>The batter (the OGM playing with the team at-bat) decides to swing, let it go (not swing) or bunt. If he decides to swing, 3 six sided dice are rolled to determine the hit success or failure and, if hit, what type of hit (grounder, hot grounder, line drive, hard line drive, or fly ball results). If a hit is made, another roll is enacted using 3 six sided dice to determine the direction and speed (power) of the hit. Just as pitchers have a PIT ability that is added to their pitch roll, batters use their batting ability (BAT) which is expressed as a 'plus' to augment their 'to hit' roll. Additionally, batters have power ratings (POW) that are used to determine how much extra a hit can travel in feet (like, +50', for example). And just as pitchers, and all other player positions, there are many different skill-sets that can be possessed by a batter (like Clutch Hitting or Place Hitting).<br/><br/>As each play is played out, all of the things that are performed in a true-life baseball game are enacted by the opposing OGMs (Owner/General Manager/Manager) like fielding the ball, throwing the ball, running the bases, stealing, playing off base, sliding into base, picking off, etc. Every single action, bar none, of baseball is accurately replicated in Roll Saga Baseball through a precise and fluid game mechanic true to the game of baseball as we know it to be.<br/><br/>As the game continues, the player tokens are moved around the game mat/field just as players in a real baseball game would move in the course of a game: coming to bat, running the bases, running in the outfield to catch hits, and throwing the ball to get the opposing team's runners out.<br/><br/>Scoring and Winning - A General Overview:<br/><br/>Each team scores points just as in baseball - by bringing a base runner into, and across, home plate.<br/><br/>To keep score, authentic replica scoreboards are used. The scoreboards are erasable (marker included) and have places to record runs, hits, errors, balls, strikes, and outs - among other things. The team with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Levels of Play:<br/><br/>Roll Saga has been designed to be very flexible in levels of play in order to ensure that those who don't know a lot about baseball can play at a level that does not require much knowledge. And, conversely, those that are baseball enthusiasts can replicate true baseball strategy and action without error.<br/><br/>It has been designed for 1 (solitaire) or two players.<br/><br/>Additionally, these levels of play can be mixed during any game so that any action or series of actions (like an inning) can be simulated and other actions can be played out. A full game can be played in as little as 30-40 minutes, or as long as it takes for a normal major league baseball game (2-3 hours) depending on what the OGMs decide during the course of game play.<br/><br/>",

All sales are final, but you may find items you worked hard to obtain being sold in another rogue's display! You'll have to find the right balance between choosing items to add to your own display and sabotaging what your rivals stole fair and square!<br/><br/>Thieves' Market is a drafting microgame for 2 to 4 players. Each player is a world-class thief who will be attending an underground international auction. The sneak who brings the best goods earns bragging rights for the year. First, they'll be choosing their targets and building their collection. Afterwards, the auction provides them the opportunity to ply their trade against one another.<br/><br/>Each player gets a hand of potential targets for them to rob. All players select a card, and at the same time they decide whether to put that card into their Display or their Stash. Cards in the display are face-up on the table and are worth the value in the top right corner. Cards in the Stash can be used for the action on the card later on. After players have allocated their cards, they pass their hands around the table and repeat this process until there are no more cards.<br/><br/>After drafting, everybody has the chance to use the cards in their stash to affect the outcome. Players will go around the table stealing, breaking, or switching out items in an effort to be victorious. Card effects range from very strong to practically useless, but so do their value in your display. Figuring out the best cards and whether they belong in your display or in your stash will determine the outcome.<br/><br/>Once both phases are complete, players will add up the value of their display and any relevant set bonuses. The player with the best display wins the round and is the most lauded at this year's auction.<br/><br/>",

Starting at opposite corners of the board, white attempts to capture black. Each player moves his knight according to standard Chess rules but also places two markers on his previous location as well as on another location of his choice. When all 30 markers have been placed, white has ten more moves in which to capture black. If he is unable to do so successfully, black wins by avoiding capture.<br/><br/>There are two more rules:<br/>1) If either knight is unable to move, the game ends and black wins because he avoided capture.<br/>2) If your opponent's knight only has one remaining place to move, you may not put a marker there.<br/><br/><br/>     Re-developed as Pferdeäppel <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion for Magic: The Gathering returns to the gothic horror world of Innistrad. Since we last visited Innistrad in Eldritch Moon, Emrakul's lingering presence has been causing the days to become shorter and shorter, and if nothing is done to stop it, an eternal night will soon fall across the land, leaving nothing to stop the werewolves and vampires from overrunning what's left of humanity. At the Harvesttide Festival, a group of witches has gathered all the defenders of the day together at the Celestus for a last-ditch ritual to bring back the sun&mdash;but the werewolf leader Tovolar and his Dire Pack are ready to lay siege to the festival to stop them.<br/><br/>Innistrad: Midnight Hunt features the return of the ghosts, zombies, vampires, werewolves, and humans of previous Innistrad sets, but with a special spotlight on werewolves. The set contains more werewolves than any other expansion in Magic history, and all of the werewolves (as well as the witches) have a special alt-art &quot;equinox&quot; showcase version that appears about half as often as the normal version. The flagship mechanic is Day and Night, a revamp of the original werewolf mechanic from Innistrad. Other new mechanics include Disturb, Decayed, and Coven.<br/><br/>The set contains 277 cards (100 commons, 83 uncommons, 64 rares, 20 mythic rares, and 10 full-art &quot;Eternal Night&quot; basic lands) and is sold in draft boosters, set boosters, collector boosters, theme boosters, and bundles. Two tie-in Commander decks were also released alongside the main set: Coven Counters, a green-white deck themed around the Coven mechanic, and Undead Unleashed, a blue-black zombie deck based on the Decayed mechanic.<br/><br/>",

The board is 19x19 with a center square called the Falcon's Keep.  The center square is where a scepter is placed when it is captured.<br/><br/>Each player has 100 small gemstones to place on the board and which allow their scepter to land on that square.

It is possible to cross over empty spaces<br/><br/>Players then roll the dice and may choose to move their Scepter or place additional gemstones.  The Hop move can also be used to capture an opponent's Scepter.<br/><br/>The Scepter moves in a hop move to adjacent gemstones to a max number rolled on one die.  (The other die is then used to place a gemstone.)<br/><br/>Placing gemstones depends upon the number rolled on the dice and opponent gemstones can block placement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer's description on Web-Grognard's (slightly edited):<br/><br/>Game Auction is a satirical look at the wargaming hobby and the games, people, and companies that make up the hobby. With tongue firmly planted in cheek, I have designed a game that simulates all the fun and craziness of a live wargame auction. Based on MODERN ART, the game adds event cards that may be played on yourself or on an opponent during the course of an auction (and includes such cards as &quot;buying frenzy&quot; where your emotions take over and you want to buy anything that has cardboard and dice, or the ever popular &quot;Paranoid&quot; where a player has come to the conclusion that a person is bidding against him not for the game but to out bid him--it has become personal). The game also adds condition cards that are played after a round of auctions is completed. It simulates that moment when you finally open the box that you've just purchased. With condition cards, you can find anything from a designer's autograph to mildew. The game also comes with a complete description of the companies and games that are up for sale. You will run into companies like EGO Games, &quot;considered by many including themselves to produce the ultimate wargames, this company features some of the most famous personalities in the hobby. Renowned for their use (some would say abuse) of color, their games feature everything a wargame should have and a lot that isn't necessary. Their motto is 'If you can't understand our games, we are not surprised.'&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from thr MGDG website:<br/><br/>By the beginning of 1954, both French and Viet Minh realized that the war in Indochina was nearing an end. Ho Chi Minh had requested cease-fire negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and the French government was looking for a way out that would give them peace with honor. Both sides felt that a &quot;big win&quot; on the battlefield would finally secure at the peace table what they had been unable to obtain in six and a half years of war.<br/><br/>The site of this battle would be near a village called, in Vietnamese, &quot;Seat of the Border County Prefecture&quot; located in a distant valley of north-western Vietnam near the Laotian border. The French high command, under General Henri Navarre, reasoned that such remote location could not be successfully attacked. General Vo Nguyen Giap thought the position was nearly impossible to defend. The siege of Dien Bien Phu would be the result.<br/><br/>Vall&eacute;e de la mort is a simulation of this epic siege that ended the French colonial presence in Asia and marked the beginning of a 21-year struggle for national unification. The game is designed for 2 players, one taking the role of the French commander of the fortress complex at Dien Bien Phu, the other of General Giap commanding the Viet-Minh forces laying siege. The game and scenarios are small enough to be played solitaire, however.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PIG OUT is a party game in which players take a pig character (including Burnt out Boaris the drunken lout, Lady Gammon Steak a toffee nosed sow ...) and place them at the start which is at the center of a playing board that spirals outwards to the finish.<br/><br/>Players move from start to finish, based on dice rolls attempting to collect a total of six donuts on the way.<br/><br/>Donuts are earned on pink squares through successfully answering a &quot;Squealer&quot; question.  Each card provides a subject and a number (5 Bad Habits, 6 Pizza Toppings etc.) which the player must &quot;name&quot;.  Failure to complete the task earns players a penalty in the form of a Pig Out card.<br/><br/>The other coloured squares - blue, green and yellow involve the initiation of three different types of word games (memory, connections and opposites) that all players participate in until one of the players slips up and is punished by being awarded a Pig Out card.<br/><br/>Whenever a player fails to complete a task then he/she draws a Pig Out card and follows the instructions - which normally result in some kind of forfeit.<br/><br/>The first player to get to the &quot;Home&quot; space with 6 donuts, having survived the hazards arising from the Pig Outs, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to discard all of your tokens by seamlessly continuing the story using phrases on your Snippet Card. The player ahead of you just described a basement full of severed heads that moan for the return of their bodies. Now it&rsquo;s your turn. You draw a card that says, &ldquo;She ran screaming through the night into the woods.&rdquo; How will you weave that phrase into your tale? Be quick and make sense! Take it to summer camp&hellip; take it on family outings&hellip; take it anywhere you want to send people scurrying into their sleeping bags! Includes 50 cards, 25 punch-out tokens and instructions. For 2 to 10 players.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>All the picture tokens (axe, noose, ghost, skull, etc.) are passed out and everyone draws a story snippet card. One person reads an intro card, and then players continue the tale incorporating the story snippets on their cards. If they mention an object on a picture token, they get to discard it. Other people can discard more than one token named during the storyteller's turn. If the storyteller doesn't make sense or takes too long, they must take a token from the discard pile. The first player to get rid of all their tokens is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Playing Politics<br/>Seven games that bring out the politician in all of us.<br/><br/>From the back cover:<br/>&quot;This is a book of games and a book about politics. It is for anyone interested in politics, or who likes playing games - or who thinks the two are synonymous anyway. It is intended also as a useful adjunct for both teachers and students of politics, adding a practical, constructive but enjoyable dimension to their studies.<br/>It is about getting your own way, seizing power, making money, reneging on your promises. Players can be politicians, form parties, fight elections, overthrow governments and make all kinds of deals. From 'Primitive Politics' to 'Rolling Logs' and from 'Elections' to 'Agenda', each game is an attempt to capture the cut and thrust of political double-dealing.&quot;<br/><br/>The author hopes that the games in this book will be fun to play and can be enjoyed by people who don't care about politics. However, the games are intended to show some aspect of the political process. Ten fundamental laws of nature that apply to all the games are set out in the first chapter of the book. Each subsequent chapter gives the rules of a new game and includes a discussion on strategy and how the game relates to reality.<br/><br/>The games in this book are:<br/>1) Primitive Politics (number of players 2 to 2,000,000,000)<br/>2) Entrepreneurs<br/>3) Elections<br/>4) Coalitions<br/>5) Coelections<br/>6) Rolling Logs<br/>7) Agenda<br/><br/>The games can be played with a minimum of equipment - pencils, paper, money, playing cards.<br/><br/>The book was originally published be Pelican in 1979.  A revised edition was published by OUP in 1997.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of 3 different &eacute;tappes or stages.<br/><br/>Each player controls one cyclist with 3 stars in one specialty, either climbing, descending or riding on a flat terrain. The stars (3, 2 and 1 respectively) determine how fast a cyclist can go on each type of terrain. To speed up, there are two ways to attack, either a risky or normal attack. A risky attack means that the energy of the cyclist will decrease. A cyclist can also follow the slipstream of another player, which will cost the cyclist in front 1 energy point. Winner is the player who gets the best overall result in the 3 stages.<br/><br/>The &quot;Maillot Jaune, Le Jeu de Bernard Hinault&quot; version is based upon Tour de France legend Bernard Hinault, five time winner of the Tour.<br/><br/>",

This means each player&rsquo;s cumulative selection for the special movement category (energy bursts for breakaway and sprint actions) must fit within a maximum budget restriction.<br/><br/>Note that the current written version of the rules relies upon a prior understanding of the standard game (most importantly regarding rules of movement). It does not provide a stand-alone description.<br/><br/>Dice are not used, here. Each player controls a deck of 48 cards for all movement, and each card contains information to serve multiple purposes. Players can divide the cards as they wish, selecting some for special movement skills (bidding for breakaway and sprint) while the remainder constitutes a random-draw stack that will be used for basic movement (ordinary counts of zero through 4).<br/><br/>",

But Athene will not let these acts go unanswered and marshals the storm clouds as they have never been marshaled before, and nor will they be again. As the storm rises, and the currents take a greater and greater hold of your ship, can you steer your way home, or will you be swept into an inescapable whirlpool, or off the edge of the world?<br/><br/>Athene is a game for 3-6 players. The game is played on a grid of tiles. The tiles start off as calm seas, and players play cards to control the movement of their ship. But as the game progresses, the tiles are turned over to reveal the currents, and the players have less and less control of where their ship goes. The longer a ship stays at sea, the more valour the captain will earn, but ultimately you have to get home before the seas become unsurvivable and your ship is lost.<br/><br/>Due to lack of interest, JKLM have decided not to produce this game.<br/><br/>",

Balancing the risky but high-valued scrapping bots and the safer but less rewarding upgrading bots, keeping in mind the values and types in your deck's makeup, is central to the game.

Before long, you are forced to realize all your bank is left with is worthless paper. Your only option is to undermine, outsmart and devour the competition and make it to Bailout Bank before they do.<br/><br/>This game has the appearance of a classic railroad style game with strategic and competitive game play.  Bailout! The Game is anything but an ordinary ride along the tracks. The banks must obtain a continual flow of debt and have greatest unsustainable losses in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Banks bombard each other with sales and acquisitions.  The transactions are a vital part of the game; every decision a bank makes can affect every other bank.  Banks try desperately to manipulate their stock holdings for their own benefit. If they are not careful there stock may fall into the hands of a rival or vise versa.  The continued interaction drastically changes the outcome of the game right up until the end.<br/><br/>Bailout!

Each player is dealt 9 cards, and after that they bid how much tricks they can take. The highest bidder plays then against the two other players.<br/><br/>The game represents a battle of the 17 th. with it's officers and troops, so it can be said it is the first card wargame.<br/><br/>It's a game original from Spain known firstly as &quot;Triunfos Hisp&aacute;nicos&quot; later circa 1700 it was known as &quot;Juego del Hombre&quot; or &quot;Mediator&quot;. Again circa 1800 changed his name into &quot;Tresillo&quot;, and from that time is known as &quot;Rocambor&quot; in the former spanish colonies of latin america where today is still played.<br/><br/>In Spain almost no one plays it any longer, as before was a gentelmen game and became unpopular in the 20 th. century, but it carries to be played in Lima.<br/><br/>Funny enought there are as well clubs in Dennmark were it is known as &quot;L'Hombre&quot;. It is my personal opinion that the spanish ocupation army of Dennmark in the age of Napoleon comanded by the Marquis de la Romana have something to do with the expansion of this game in Jutland!!<br/><br/>Tenshō karuta, Unsun karuta and Sunkun karuta are all rooted in Ombre<br/><br/>",

Of course, every polar bear tries to catch the most fish and eagerly jump from float to float. But wind and waves move the ice. The voracity of the other bears also reduces the number of fish rapidly. And sometimes even an Inuit or a cheeky seal steals a fish already caught. Who in this icy environment first collects ten fish is the winner. A memory game for children were the fish are fastened to the ice-floats with magnets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules: In this game you play the part of a hero that goes into a dangerous maze to look for a great treasure. The maze is full of monsters called Maziacs who will try their best to kill the hero. Fortunately they're not very intelligent, but can be deadly if you're caught off guard...<br/><br/>The game uses tiles to build a new random maze each play and mechanics to create a unique path towards the treasure. This path is slowly uncovered by the player by asking prisoners that can be found randomly through the maze. Also, the Maziacs will appear randomly and try to kill the hero, but as long as he has a sword, he'll be safe. There's also a mechanic that will adjust the chance of a new Maziac appearing based on the number of Maziacs already on the board and the distance from the exit.<br/><br/>In the end, it's all about beating the game system, either as a solo or cooperative game, trying to maneuver through the tight corridors fooling Maziacs into dead ends and finding the correct path to the treasure.<br/><br/>The game is based on the great ZX Spectrum game &quot;Maziacs&quot; programmed by Don Priestley. He was kind enough to allow the designer of this game to use the same name.<br/><br/>",

To put myself in the right frame of mind for creating the rune game I first concentrated on Odin and Chess.  In Nordic mythology Odin is a wise god who brought the runes to mankind, something akin to Prometheus bringing fire to men.  I then thoroughly shuffled and mixed a set of rune cards and randomly selected six... I was surprised by the results...&quot;<br/><br/>This 10x10 chess variant takes inspiration from its theme and converts some of the standard chesspieces into their Norse equivalents. All the non-royal pieces retain their moves and capturing abilities. The queen becomes a valkyrie, with the additional power of transporting a king to safety by taking its place on the board. Knights become Forest oxen, with great horns that can kill in a neighboring square. Pawns become minor pieces, giving up their promotion ability to do so. And kings must &quot;consult&quot; before doing anything. The king moves and captures like any friendly piece it starts the turn next to. Each player has 2 of each type of piece, including kings, and 10 pawns. The game is won by capturing both enemy kings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme: <br/>Arena of Heroes puts the players against each other in a fighting arena as they battle to the death.  The artwork is reminiscent of an arena filled with gladiators being cheered on by thousands of fans.<br/><br/>Game-play:<br/>The game board consists of a 5&quot; by 5&quot; grid, players start in the corners, are given 10 life tokens, and dealt 5 cards each.  There are 3 different types of cards in the full deck of 126 cards: black Movement Cards, red Combat Cards, and full color Item Cards.  The players draw back up to a full hand of 5 cards at the beginning of each turn, allowing the player to use all their cards on their turn or hold some back to defend against attacks on the other players' turns.  Each successful attack causes the defender to lose a life token.<br/><br/>The Center Square:<br/>The center square of the 5&quot; by 5&quot; grid has special properties for both attackers and defenders.  If an attacker is occupying the center square and successfully lands an attack on the defender, the defender loses 2 life tokens.  If the defender is in the center square and the attacker successfully lands an attack, the attack has the choice of the defender taking the hit (and losing one life token) or knocking the attacker out of the center square and into any available adjacent square.  This can setup the attacker for various combinations for dealing additional damage on a second attack on the defender by first occupying the now available center square.<br/><br/>Movement Cards:<br/>Movement Cards allow the players to move their miniature one square either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.<br/><br/>Combat Cards:<br/>The Combat Cards are used to attack opponents either diagonal or orthogonal as denoted by the image on the card.  The strength of the attack is determined by the number in the corner of the card.  Combat Cards are also used to defend against attacks and are successful if the defender's card is equal to or greater than the number on the attacker's card.  Combat cards can only be played against another player if their miniatures are adjacent, unless using the throwing axe (see Item Cards below).<br/><br/>Item Cards:<br/>The Item Cards include various weapons, armor, and other items to modify the numbers on the Combat Cards.  If a player has the two handed axe equipped (+4 to attack) and plays a Combat Card with a 7, the defender must counter the attack with an 11 or higher.

The informant selects one card from the 18 control cards and copies the face onto a piece of paper secretly The card is returned to the pack and the paper hidden from the detective. One of the colours, red, yellow or white is also written on the paper.<br/>The detective then attempts to deduce the features of the face by presenting a tile. The informant places a red infomation counter  for each correct feature; eyes, nose, mouth, colour. This continues until the detective knows the selected identity. Twice per round the informant can refuse to give any information and indicates this by placing a white counter. At the end of the round players reverse roles. The winner is the player who, as detective, collected the fewest information counters.<br/><br/>",

There are four factions, but cooperation between them: Gaia (red) and Coeurl (green) versus Empire (yellow) and Alien (blue). Figures are stacked onto chips that reflect their level of power and life. The chips can also be spent to execute special moves--found under the figure bases. The round is basically split into 4 phases, and battles are resolved with a combination of movement (including flight), special moves, and dice rolls.<br/><br/>Packaging:<br/>As of April 2011, four factions have been released in encounter boxes, the red/green Keruberosu Reckless Plan, and the yellow/blue Kuresento (Crescent) Ambition Platoon. Each preconstructed starter includes a team-up of two factions (4 figs), a battle mat, a rulebook, 4 castle coins, 5 gaia coins, 5 kail coins and one battle die. One encouter box has only enough material for 1 player--and the castle coins are required to play. Also available are randomized booster boxes--from which capsule vending machines are also stocked. Larger figures must be assembled, and all boosters come with an additional battle coin. All figures are pre-painted.<br/><br/>Series 2 was released June of 2011.<br/>Series 3 was released August of 2011.<br/><br/>",

Players assume the role of the 18th player and move the football to images of the 17 other players on the board. The player retains possession as long as the football is &quot;kicked&quot; to an image of their player who is deemed to have caught or &quot;marked&quot; the ball. If the football falls on the picture of an opposing player or in an open field, the opponent takes control of the ball. Wooden goalposts at each end signify the goalposts and a player can either secure a goal (6 points) or behind (1 point), depending on the accuracy of their aim.<br/><br/>The football has a red and blue side, and if the ball goes off the board (&quot;out of bounds&quot;), it is flipped and whatever colour lands face-up gains possession. When a football equally sits on a red and blue player, the colour that is face-up determines which player has possession. Flipping is also used to determine who kicks the ball first at the commencement of the game or after a goal is scored.<br/><br/>The winner can be determined by the first to reach a pre-determined number of points, or using an elapsed amount of time.<br/><br/>The game first came out during the late 1960s.<br/><br/>",

One piece is lighter the other heavier. Once in a while (the length of this while is determined by a random element), there are scoring breaks. The players then check the positions of their pieces and multiply the number of levels one piece is up with the number of levels the other piece is hanging over the edge of the board.

        "description": "Throne Wars is a kingdom battle game for two to four players. Each player starts the game with a Strong Hold card in play, which represents the center of their kingdom. Each player takes turns playing each phase of the game. During each turn players roll dice to represent sending out their peasants to do work for the kingdom. Sometimes these peasants comply and other times they do not. Once the dice are rolled, they are assigned to the corresponding decks. There are 5 decks in all; Fortification (deck 2), Assault (deck 3), Development (deck 4), Devine (deck 5), and Siege (deck 6), there is no deck for 1. If the players have rolled a 1, this peasant decided to slack off and did nothing, so it is assigned to no deck. Players are then able to draw a card for each die they rolled.<br/>Players may draw a card from whatever deck the die was assigned to or any deck below that one in number. For example, if a player rolled a 5, this die is assigned to the 5 deck and the player may choose to draw from the 5 deck or any deck below that one in descending order. In this way, players are able to choose cards from decks strategically.<br/><br/>Once players have drawn their cards, play then moves into the Fortification phase. During this phase, players may play any fortification cards they drew. Fortification cards build up the player&rsquo;s kingdom; they provide a buffer for the Strong Hold. These cards represent towers, walls, and gatehouses. Once each player has done this, play moves on to the Siege phase. During this phase, players play and fire siege equipment such as ballista and catapults. These cards directly target the fortifications of the opposing player.<br/>Players then move on to the Assault phase of the game. During this phase, players play any Assault cards they drew. These cards make up the troops that will be played to attack an opposing player&rsquo;s Strong Hold. These cards have Footmen, Archers, etc. These Assault cards then are able to attack an opposing player&rsquo;s Strong Hold. However, the total power of an assault force is only able to damage a Strong Hold if it is greater than the total amount of Fortification the opposing player possesses.<br/><br/>Throughout all the phases, players are able to build developments and use divine powers (draw from those respective decks) to support their tactics. These cards can be a devastating and tide turning strategy to employ. These cards include; Hand of God, Sapper Bomb, Siege Ladder, Blacksmith, etc. Play continues through these phases until a player&rsquo;s Strong Hold has been reduced to (0).<br/><br/>This is a fast paced game of strategy and luck. The theme is fantasy medieval combat and focuses on divine catholic inspired societal norms of the day. Throughout the game, players feel as though they are in charge of a kingdom and are working to overtake their opponent&rsquo;s kingdom through force of arms and smart planning.<br/><br/>",

It's a pun in polish language, because it's a combination of words &quot;pompki&quot; (push-ups) and &quot;poker&quot;.<br/><br/>The entire gameplay is similar to Texas Hold'em but there are some exceptions. The players do not have any starting amount of &quot;money&quot;. Instead of money they bid with push-ups. During the game they can bid how much they want but bidding too much is a risk of losing. After finishing the round there is a winner who does not have to do the push-ups that he bid. All other players have to do the push-up according to how much they bid. The winning player gains as many points as all other players did push-ups in that round.<br/><br/>Each loosing player gains the points too (unless he passes and bids 0). He gains as many points as he did push-ups in that round.<br/><br/>If any player is not able to do the push-ups that he bid, he is out of the game and he scores minus points for the push-ups that he was supposed to do (e.g. if he bid 50 and he does 40, he gets  -10 points).<br/><br/>The game end when all players but one are eliminated. The winner is not the last player in the game, but the player who scored the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Picture an ancient legend....<br/><br/>The long ago a group of greedy villagers attempted to steal powerful magic and treasures from a long abandon temple. For their crimes, the unnamed God of the temple cursed them to transform, one by one, night after night, into a hideous beast that hunted the other Villagers and devour them. The curse was only ended when a single Villager remained to tell the cautionary tale. (Ancient legends don't have happy endings!)<br/><br/>Cursed is a quick, casual game for 3 to 8 player, ages 5 and up. The game focuses on heavily on Bluffing and features a unique cooperative/competitive gameplay style, in which players take turns becoming the &quot;Monster&quot;, well the other players battle against the Monster as a group in an attempt to fend it off for the night. The next night, the next player in line becomes the Monster and the battle begins again. The game ends when the Monster eats the last 2 Villagers and the Curse is broken.<br/><br/>The game revolves around dice rolls and a small amount of card playing. Each &quot;Villager&quot; rolls a single die in the open, for all to see, well the &quot;Monster&quot; rolls an equal number of dice privately. The Monster knows if they can beat the Villagers at a glance, but must decide if he/she want to Bluff the Villagers into fleeing, tempt Villagers into a hopeless and costly battle, or simply flee if the Villagers are clearly too strong.<br/><br/>Add into this mix Ward Cards, magic powers that aid or hinder either side, or even disrupt the battle completely in some strange way, and which can be played be either side to keep the game endlessly unpredictable. These cards are costly though, and beyond the 3 you get at the start of the game, must be paid for WITH YOUR LIFE!<br/><br/>",

So, if at the start of your turn, an enemy piece is next to one of yours, you move away from it in a straight line to capture it.<br/><br/>Winning: the person who gets a counter onto the enemy's Camp wins.

        "description": "To Je Fotbal (This Is Football) is a true simulation of a football match, a strategic board game that brings football action to your table by combining football rules and game strategy.<br/><br/>To Je Fotbal is a game for two football managers. Each team consists of the basic eleven players and five substitutes. The players are marked with a colored base corresponding to their role on the pitch. The forwards, midfielders, defenders, goalkeeper and captain all perform different functions. The basic skills can be enhanced by using special cards according to the manager's chosen strategy. During one turn, the manager can move three players in any direction according to their attributes and kick the ball if it is in possession of the team. Playing time is 2 x 45 turns (and maybe extra time).<br/><br/>The basic rules make it easy to get into the game for those aged 10 and up, and they cover situations such as passing, shooting, goal kick, saves, offside, posts, tacking for ball and position, extra time, substitutions and (of course) goals. The extended rules contain special situations such as corner kick, throw-in, free kicks and penalty kicks, fouls, yellow and red cards and even diving.<br/><br/>The game pieces are miniatures of football players in team jerseys with names, numbers and even sponsors' logos. The atmosphere of a football stadium is completed not only by a full-colored 82x55 cm game board with goals, flags and advertising panels, but also by an imitation of a scoreboard. All components (special cards, scoreboard) are in English, with the printed rules in the box coming in six languages.<br/><br/>The first edition, &quot;10th Czech vs Slovakia derby&quot;, is supported by the Czech and Slovak national teams. You will find such football greats as Petr Cech, Tomas Rosicky, Marek Hamsik and Martin Skrtel in the teams.<br/><br/>",

Many have special abilities such as poison, regeneration, causing disease, and/or use of magic.<br/><br/>- Flight Some heroes may be mounted on flying steeds, and many creatures and even some units of troops may fly above the fantasy battlefield, raining missiles down upon their land bound foes, and/or swooping down from above to wreak destruction with weapons, teeth, and/or claws.<br/><br/>- Starter Army Lists (18) These include many popular armies from other fantasy miniatures wargames and common fantasy tropes to help novice players get started immediately.

Some of us may forget that of all the Allies it was the Australian soldiers who first broke the spell of the invincibility of the Japanese Army.&quot; &mdash;Field Marshall Sir William Slim<br/><br/>Defeated at sea in the battle of the Coral Sea in May and then distracted by the US Marine Corps landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese High Command was forced to change its plans for New Guinea. After diverting the previously allocated Army regiment to reinforce Guadacanal, it fell to the Navy to gather a scratch force to capture the &quot;lightly defended&quot; airfield on the eastern tip of New Guinea.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Japanese plans, those months of delays allowed Australia to finish assembling a brigade of Militia at Milne Bay during July, then rush a veteran AIF brigade there shortly before the Japanese landings commenced on August 25th, 1942.<br/><br/>Several scenarios are included in Milne Bay to allow players to explore different Australian and Japanese plans.<br/><br/>",

If a player ever has three of the same number or color showing, that player's turn ends and she scores nothing &mdash; unless she also has a die face that shows &quot;Free (number)&quot; or &quot;Free (color)&quot;, in which case that number or color can't bust her for the turn. If a player has used all 18 dice in the bag, she must stop.<br/><br/>To determine a score for the round, first remove all of the &quot;Free ____&quot; dice, then sum the digits on the dice that remain. If, however, you've rolled one or both of the lucky dice in the bag, your score might be boosted (or halved). A &quot;1:5&quot; on a lucky die, for example, means that 1s give you five points instead of one. A &quot;1/2&quot; means that your sum is halved, but if you roll both &quot;1/2&quot; symbols, then your score is doubled instead.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score after five rounds wins!<br/><br/>",

Thirty-six scenarios track the operations and battles that took place or could have taken place between the fleets and air forces of Germany, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, the Soviet Union, Finland and Sweden. In addition to their complete Baltic Sea orders of battle, the Soviets, Swedes and Finns all have additional ships they planned or began to construct but did not complete. And of course the game includes scenarios for their use.<br/><br/>There are 140 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 420 standard-sized square ones representing smaller warships, transports, aircraft (many, many aircraft) and a handful of markers. This is a big game, at least in terms of pieces. The map is not so big: the Baltic Sea is pretty small and almost completely land-locked, with ports and airfields in abundance. Aircraft are very potent in this theater, and ships have very little room to hide. The map by Guy Riessen shows the full Baltic on a single 11x17-inch panel.<br/><br/>The scenarios cover all of the action from the Polish &ldquo;Operation Peking&rdquo; in which three destroyers escaped to England just before the war began, to the planned Swedish invasion of German-held Denmark in May 1945.<br/><br/>",

As the game only uses dice, there is no need to measure yards or mark a line of scrimmage. Think of the game as a highlights package of your team on the offense drive. They either score or your opponent takes over on offense.<br/><br/>The Quarterback die will be the central die. Rolling this will choose the play 'called' by the QB. The subsequent die rolled next will be one of the other passing/running positions.<br/><br/>The WR , TE , &amp; RB all have different plays on each die face with an 'intensity' value that the DEFENSE must match to prevent the play being successful. There are Field Goal options, Flags for penalties, Sacks, Intercepts, Fumbles and an Audible Play option (for PRO MODE)<br/><br/>The game includes 5 team cards to be used for an optional PRO MODE.<br/><br/>Light, compact and portable.<br/><br/>",

When two or more of these elements are in-sync, advancement is possible. However, Portia has periods of time when her work always suffers, and work within those hours causes a regression. Regress often enough and despair sets in. Advance to the top of the technology tree, and you have invented Portia Forthwright&rsquo;s Celebrated Steam Driven Velocipede.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Civitas is a fast-paced hand management card game about different government forms. Become the President, General, or even King while you try to be the first to empty your hand of cards. Customize each game by mixing and matching the eight different government types (Monarchy, Military, Democracy, Communism, Theocracy, Plutocracy, Republic, and Anarchy).<br/><br/>Before starting the game, players choose which forms of government they want to use. Each governmental form features its own deck of color-coded number cards, event cards, law cards, wild cards, and government change cards. Combine the decks together and then deal each player 7 cards. The top card of the deck determines the starting government, and then on your turn, you play one card out of your hand that matches the color of the government in play. If it's a number card, play continues. If it's an event card, resolve the action on the card. Law cards have special actions that must be resolved according to the government in play (voting in a democracy or the first player deciding in a monarchy, for example). And government change cards force a shift to a new form of government. If you don't have a card to play, draw a new card and play passes to the next player. The game continues until one player has gotten rid of all his or her cards. You then score according to the number of cards left in your hand modified by the governments you led during the game.<br/><br/>Be sure to chose wisely when changing the governments because each one has special effects that can make it easier for you, or harder for your opponents, to win. Use the power of Communism to slow down the leader as you redistribute cards, or declare a Plutocracy and watch your lead get bigger with every turn. Move cards around in the deck in a Theocracy, and decide events together in a democracy. Build up other players' decks in a Military government, make other players lose turns in a Monarchy, and build coalitions in a Republic. But watch out for descent into Anarchy, where government leaders lose their power, and anything goes as wild cards take over game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kitsune Switch, a.k.a. きつねスイッチ, is an UNO-like card game with hidden identity mechanism.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a role card which is human, fox, or the fox spirit, and a battle is fought between humans and the fox spirit. Foxes are fluid; they ally with the fox spirit if it exists, otherwise they ally with humans. The game is played like UNO; players take turns playing a card which has the same color or number as the top card of discard pile. Each time a card is played, its effect is activated. Players could be forced to change their roles or even eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player gets rid of all cards in their hand, in which case that player wins the game. All of that player's allies win together, but only if there is an opposing side of the winner. The game also ends when the deck runs out, in which case the side with the lower total value in their hands wins the game if there are two sides. Otherwise the player with the lowest total value in their hand wins the game.<br/><br/>Sometimes you are required to co-operate to win as a team, but you win anyway if you go out. It is an effective strategy to focus on winning alone.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>基本的にUNO／ウノです。陣営戦要素とカードに特殊効果があります。陣営を示す正体カードは『人間』、『狐』、『九尾の狐』の３種類で、人間陣営と九尾陣営の２つに分かれています。<br/>ウノ同様、手札を出し切れば自分の陣営ごと勝ちますし、その前に山札が切れた場合は、陣営ごとにカードの合計値を比べ合う判定戦になります。<br/>陣営戦なので協力要素がありますが、陣営はゲーム中、流動的に変化し、いっそ一人勝ちを狙いに行くのも有効な戦略です。<br/><br/>",

Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.<br/><br/>Ultimate Odyssey is not collectible or random. Players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.<br/><br/>The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.<br/><br/>",

You will also have the choice of playing them as heroes, allying with the orcs, and you risk seeing them kill each other at the slightest misunderstanding.<br/><br/>As enemies of orcs, the Porks have a mission to hunt down and kill any green skin they encounter. The Pork Trackers will have their own Patrols instead of the normal Patrols. Except that here, the Porks &quot;feel&quot; the presence of orcs, thanks to their highly developed sense of smell. They will go directly to the heroes to try and exterminate them.<br/><br/>In addition, Pork Trackers are not the only ones who resent greenskins. Three Pork bounty hunters prowl the area and may arrive at any time to do carnage, even if it means slaughtering everyone between them and their target.<br/><br/>The Porks can also be used as heroes alongside the orcs and as a band of adventurers who have sworn to help the greenskins in their quest, provided they leave them the found treasures.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Era of Traveling Merchant, a.k.a. 行商の時代, is a pick-up-and-deliver game of merchants peddling their wares.<br/><br/>A peddler who travels through various cities and sells goods was indispensable to running the economy. Players go around each city to buy goods and fulfill their orders. Getting the goods sold by other players will help a player become the best peddler. Become one of the world's richest and prestigious merchants by successfully managing your products in multiple cities.<br/><br/>To set up the game, nine city tiles are arranged in one of the suggested ways, with each tile being divided into colored zones to match the player colors. Six order cards are dealt from a deck, which show various demands from these nine cities.<br/><br/>Players get two actions on a turn from a move action, a cargo action, or a shipping action. Players can move to cities; can pick up cargo from a city and place the goods in their wagon (but not goods they dropped previously); or ship goods to their storehouse in the city with the demand. By fulfilling demands, players collect order cards, gaining victory points. By taking the most prominent order cards, players receive jewel bonuses. By building up sets of order cards, players can increase the capacity of their wagons and build trading houses in cities; trading houses give the player a third action each round, which gives the player an advantage and is one of the endgame conditions.<br/><br/>The game ends either when the decks are exhausted, the special cards (difficult orders) are lost, or when a player has four trading houses.<br/><br/>All players get the same number of turns, then a final score is taken, most points wins. Points come from order cards, jewels, and from getting the last wagon card (marked fin).<br/><br/>",

Cavalry is allowed to perform charges that doubles or triples it's strength, but it needs enough terrain to do so. Muslims have quite a number of horse archers that allows them to carry a number of distance attacks on the enemy.

We&rsquo;ll travel through the dense jungle of Amazonia, the scorching desert of Tenere, the icy mountains of Makalu and the fiery skies of Shangri La to collect mystical treasures. But beware, perils lie everywhere. Anyone can enter but only a few can escape&hellip;<br/><br/>Trailblazers is an exciting memory drawing game that your family will not get enough of. The goal is simple: see a map, spot the treasures and obstacles, remember them and then draw your own way out of it using memory and some basic rules. Then, spin away and maximise your points! Sounds simple but is a laughing riot when opponents take a wrong turn. <br/>Enjoy as your kids use principles of geometry, memory and strategy to draw their way through various adventure worlds. See them master basic concepts of lines and angles, decision making and motor skills right before your eyes!<br/><br/>In Trail Blazers, players travel through four different adventures, collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. The goal is to draw your way out of each maze in the adventure region. Everybody starts with a Path Map, and a sketch pen. Place the adventure book in the centre. Choose an adventure region, and start with Maze 1. Cover the maze with the Spin-A-Round spinner. Keep your sand timer ready.<br/>VIEWING ROUND (30 secs) - When the timer begins, all players must visualise and remember a path in the maze from Start to Finish. <br/>During this time, players are not allowed to draw anything. All pens must be down!<br/>At the end of 30 seconds, the maze is covered again with the Spin-A-Round spinner.<br/>DRAWING ROUND (60 secs) - All players draw their paths on their Path Maps from Start to Finish. They must try to score maximum points by collecting coins and avoiding obstacles. All players must enter with a Ray at the Start point and exit with a Ray at the Finish point. You can enter or exit horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. All paths must be individual line segments, connecting the dots on the path maps from Start to Finish. All paths must be horizontal or vertical and not diagonal. At the end of the drawing round, each player counts their score by placing their path map on the maze in the adventure book. Each coin you collect in your path, you get the points mentioned on it. Each obstacle you hit, you lose points as mentioned on the left hand pages. Add all points for the coins collected, subtract all points for the obstacles hit, add 2 points for entering with a ray at the correct Start point and add 2 points for exiting with a ray at the correct Finish point. This is your score for the drawing round. <br/>SPINNING ROUND - The player with the highest score for this maze, spins the spinner. Now, choose either your entry or exit Ray as the reference Ray. If you get a Parallel, then you count all lines parallel to the reference Ray. If you get a Perpendicular, then you count all lines perpendicular to the reference Ray. Then you multiply the number above by either x1 or x2 as per what they have spun. This is your score for the spinning round. <br/>Add the scores of the Drawing and Spinning round as the final score for maze 1. Repeat  the same for Mazes 2 and 3 in the adventure region. The person with the highest total of all three mazes, wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Althingi is a quick set-up, fast-play game of strength and influence for 2-4 players based in Viking-Age Iceland. Each player takes on the role of a powerful Chieftain and tries to take control of the annual gathering known as the Althingi through good old-fashioned bribery, coercion, and intimidation.<br/><br/>The game takes place over a series of days each with three rounds: Morning, Afternoon, and Evening. In the morning Chieftains gather Loot which has value both in bribing Vikings and in equipping them for holmgang (a duel). In the afternoon phase Chieftains strategically bribe the new Vikings that arrive that round to join their camp using their Loot cards while retaining enough resources to defend themselves in the Evening phase. During the Evening, Chieftains can use Vikings in their camp to challenge holmgang (a duel) against Vikings from other camps. The aim of the game is to gain the most influence, which is acquired by having Vikings join your camp and by winning holmgangs (duels). The player with the most influence at the end of the game controls the Althingi and wins!<br/><br/>The aesthetic of this game is gritty and raw, with striking original illustrations by Lada Shustova. Special attention was paid to historical details such as clothing, weapons, and bartering goods, so rest assured that there are no horned helmets in this game! If you&rsquo;ve visited Iceland, then you&rsquo;ll recognize the landscape art as the fields of Thingvellir. And Viking history buffs might recognize the meaning of the two runes used in the game, symbols for Strength and for Influence.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In each round, players take two turns by drafting dice. Additionally, each player may take one reaction per round. With their actions and reactions, players gain elements, transmute them, perform experiments, and prepare for their publications. During the game, players receive and track victory points (VPs) from experiments. At the end of the game, these are added to VPs gained from a player's Philosopher's Stone, their elements, and completed publications.<br/><br/>In addition to the print-and-play materials themselves, you need ten dice from Trismegistus: The Ultimate Formula. If you do not have Trismegistus dice, you can make your own using regular dice and a sticker sheet provided with the print-and-play materials for Trismegistus: Roll &amp; Write.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The rat&rsquo;s lair is the first adventure in a series of mini solitaire card games. Each adventure is a stand-alone game that requires you to collect various items to help you defeat the evil Lord Zadorf in the final adventure.<br/><br/>The rat&rsquo;s lair is a tile placement game where you must venture into the foul smelling, rat infested sewers in search of five artefacts lost long ago in the great floods.<br/><br/>Explore the vast sewer network by connecting stepping stones and search for the five missing artefacts whilst avoiding the killer rats which infuriatingly block your path.<br/><br/>Find torches to help you progress through the pitch black tunnels, poisons to help you avoid the rats, and collect as many artefacts as you can before making your way back to the sewer entry point &ndash; easier said than done!<br/><br/>Just making it out of the sewers with your life could be seen as a success, but you are going to need at least one or two artefacts to help you in your quest against the evil Lord Zadorf. Three or four would be preferable and escaping with all five should be your ultimate goal, but may be a step too far!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game covers the crucial decades from 1970s to 1990s as opposing forces faced each other down in a game of nuclear brinkmanship, with featured aircraft including the MiG-29 Fulcrum, MiG-23/27 Flogger, MiG-21 Fishbed, MiG-25 Foxbat, Su-27 Flanker, Su-24 Fencer and Su-17 Fitter.<br/><br/>In Fulcrum Leader, you will need to select the right combination of aircraft in your regiment in order to successfully carry out the different missions which your pilots will execute. You will be faced with the same type of decision-making and risk-taking experienced by Soviet air regimental commanders.<br/><br/>This game adds new aspects of Soviet air operations such as enhanced radio-electric combat, ground controlled intercepts (GCI), and the ever-present political officer watching over your shoulders, the Zampolit. You will need to manage the capability of your pilots, weigh the advantages and disadvantages of your aircraft, use your zampolit to manage your superiors, and avoid the ignoble fate of being sent off to a re-education facility in Kamchatka.<br/><br/>The core game contains 336 cards and 704 counters, including:<br/><br/><br/>     207 x Aircraft cards<br/>         MiG-21bis Fishbed-N<br/>         MiG-23ML Flogger-G<br/>         MiG-27 Flogger-J<br/>         MiG-29 Fulcrum-A (USSR / Bulgaria / Czechoslovakia / DDR / Poland / Romania)<br/>         MiG-29 Fulcrum-C<br/>         Su-17M Fitter<br/>         Su-24 Fencer<br/>         Su-27 Flanker<br/>    <br/>     5 x Squadron Asset cards<br/>         MiG-25RB/RBV Foxbat-B<br/>         MiG-25RBSh Foxbat-D<br/>         MiG-25BM Foxbat-F<br/>         Su-25 Frogfoot<br/>    <br/>     18 x Support Aircraft cards<br/>         Yak-28PP Brewer-E<br/>         Tu-126 Moss<br/>         A-50 Mainstay<br/>    <br/>     9 x Ground Control Intercept cards<br/>     45 x Target cards<br/>     36 x Event cards<br/>     16 x Zampolit cards<br/><br/><br/>In addition, the core box includes:<br/><br/><br/>     11 x Campaign sheets<br/>     3 x Player Help sheets<br/>     1 x Airbase Squadron Control sheet<br/>     1 x Player Log sheet<br/>     1 x Tactical Display board<br/>     1 x Rulebook<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the game, you are a young, up-and-coming gamestormer in the futuristic land of Fjerogard who must impress the Elder Gamestormer with a great new game idea. The object of the game is to design and pitch a great game idea to the rest of the players.<br/><br/>During the game, players fill out their game tableaus using a variety of actions, such as taking Item cards from the market, drafting Storyline and Mechanic cards, designing custom cards using dice with images, or entering the Arena. All of the actions allow the player to acquire new cards for the game they are designing or earn victory points.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win the game - either create a game that is worth the most victory points, or receive the most votes for best overall game from your fellow players. The game you create consists of a Storyline card, two Mechanic cards, and two Items cards, each of which you will use to create a cohesive game narrative. Each card in your game tableau earns you points, as well as other bonuses you can activate by reaching certain objectives.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Great Battles of Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine is the sixth expansion to Amabel Holland's Table Battles, taking as its subject the not-exactly illustrious career of its namesake. Oh, the six battles in this set are &quot;great&quot; battles, including some of the most famous engagements of the eighteenth century. But they're not famous because of Charles, who is widely regarded as one of the worst commanders in history. They're famous because of guys like Frederick the Great and Maurice de Saxe, who ran circles around our boy Chuck, inflicting one humiliating defeat after another. Of course, the battles didn't have to end the way they did, and perhaps with your skill and a little luck, the outcomes might be very different!<br/><br/>This builds on some of the layers added in the last two expansions, and adds some new wrinkles of its own! Linked formations support one another, and tactical victory conditions allow you to win by attrition when a more decisive outcome is out of your grasp. Cards are demarcated as Infantry or Cavalry formations (with illustrations!), and the new Shift mechanic allows you to move forces of a certain type from one card to another. This not only can shore up places where your lines are weak, but if you concentrate enough force in one area, the resulting Oblique Attack can inflict heavier casualties on the enemy.<br/><br/>",

As legend has it, the mine that descends deep below the mountain has magical properties: no matter how many sacks of precious gemstones you procure from its tunnels, the mine will always be full to the brim with treasures. The best jewellers in the land decided to take advantage of this wondrous source to craft the most amazing jewelry pieces. They compete against each other to prove that they are worthy of the highest reward possible, the magic anvil.<br/><br/>Gem Forge is a versatile family game with a unique 3D pop-up game board and magical illustrations. Procure rare gemstones from the magical mine and store them in your gem box. Then, set exquisite jewelry pieces with the collected gem stones. Finally, receive victory points for finished pieces and jewelry sets!<br/><br/>Playing the game<br/><br/>Before the start, set everything up according the rules: players will have the magic mountain with the gems in random, player pawns and the reminder cards of the same color, player boards or minecarts, 3 jewelry cards, special cards. Set up the market of jewelries with 4 cards to choose. Special cards deck should be placed face down.<br/><br/>The first player can be chosen randomly. At their turn, players have to perform 2 of 5 possible actions: <br/><br/>     Take a gemstone from the mountain. The new gem must be placed to the player's minecarts. There are 3 spaces for gems.<br/>     Set a gemstone to jewelry. <br/>     Discard a gemstone from your minecart. Players may free the space for the new gems.<br/>     Draw a special card.<br/>     Play a special card. The special cards which should be played during other players turn do not spend your actions. <br/><br/><br/>Players get points for the jewelries they make. The number of points is shown at the bottom of jewelry cards. <br/>There are gold (ordinary)  and blue (for collections/sets) jewerly cards. Sometimes players may create a collection of jewerlies with the gemstones of the same color and get even more points.<br/>After a jewelry has all the required gems, it is ready. <br/>Return the gems to the mountain, discard the card, and take a new one from the market. Move the pawn on the scoring track.<br/><br/>When a player gets to the highlighted spaces of 5,10,15,20 scores, all the players having less points get a special card. <br/>Special cards have various effects affecting either you or other players. A player should not have more than 4 special cards. If a player has 4 cards and is required to take the new one, they discard one at their choice and then take he new card.<br/>The player who gets to the final spot on the scoring track first wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players roll dice to collect food and drink cards by matching the correct ingredients to the dishes they want to make.

Each food card collected earns points, with bonus points for completing a whole meal. The winner is the player with the highest-scoring cards in their pile. Taco Party is suitable for friends, families, and anyone who loves tacos. It comes with 32 food cards, 12 drink cards, 8 ingredient dice, and instructions, and has an average gameplay time of 30 minutes.

The &ldquo;Swallows of Death&rdquo; already carried a fearsome fighting reputation from the trenches of the First World War, and they would only add to their black swallow insignia&rsquo;s legend in the Second.<br/><br/>1940: Swallows of Death is an expansion book for our Panzer Grenadier: 1940 The Fall of France, focused on the exploits of Moroccan troops in the 1940 campaign. You get 30 new scenarios for 1940: The Fall of France, plus 88 new die-cut, silky smooth pieces showing the Moroccans in their own special color scheme plus elite French recon troops, horsed machine-gun units and the unusual WT15 tank destroyer. The crack horsed cavalry of the Spahis Marocains get their own pieces and scenarios, too.<br/><br/>Scenario design is by Philippe L&eacute;onard, with the book organized into six chapters with battle games for each to link them together. And as you expect in an Avalanche Press book, plenty of historical background. You&rsquo;ll need 1940 The Fall of France and Road to Dunkirk to play the scenarios.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the muddy waters of politics, there are some surprisingly simple rules. First, follow the policy of your own party unconditionally. Second, oppose the policy of the opposing party. But today's friends can be tomorrow's enemies, and it's always more fun to betray than to be betrayed. So remember, you have nothing to rely on but your own political power.<br/><br/>Politrickers differs from the usual trick-taking game in that it's a mix of must-follow and must-not-follow. There are two political parties in the game. You must follow the suit of your own party, and must not follow that of the opposing party. You earn points for contributing to your party's victory without upsetting the political balance symbolized by the Libra.<br/><br/>Wield your limited political power skillfully to extend your influence, sometimes switching parties out of patriotic determination, sometimes declaring innovations that will turn the political world upside down. The path you walk is one of commitment and trust, or one of betrayal and intrigue. Either way, result says everything.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The major obstacle for the Red Army was the Dniepr river, especially since south of Kiev only one bridge was left - the railway one near Kanev.<br/>Expecting an attack of Kiev, the German forces were unprepared for a Soviet attack aimed at siezing the bridge. Combined Armoured Corps and airborne units soon threatened to have the German forces cut off from the Western bank of the river. The situation was to be rescued by reinforcements of 19th and 7th Panzer Divisions but they come to late -  the Dniepr was taken by Red Army.<br/><br/>The game uses rules of the  B35 (Battles of World War II 1943-1945) system designed for dealing with medium battles of World War II. Counters represent battalions (Germans) or regiments (Russians), one hex represents 1500m, one turn represents 12 hours.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A bloody war between two mighty kingdoms has reached an impasse. Each ruler now turns to the northern tribes in an attempt to form an alliance, and turn the tides. Will you be able to capture the favor of the Four Tribes?<br/><br/>In Four Tribes, you and one other player will be placing cards, according to the rules, to either side of a row of six village cards. Most of these cards you are placing represent provisions that each village is lacking. Your goal is to appease the elder of each village more than your opponent by giving them higher ranked goods.<br/><br/>In addition to provisions, there are a host of special cards that you may employ that might be defensive in nature, or be a devastating blow to your opponent. Hand-management and timing is the key!<br/><br/>Four Tribes is a game of strategy and tactics that is balanced with a bit of luck. Each player draws from their own deck of cards, but each player has the same deck, so while you may draw on the weak-side early on, you will know that powerful cards are coming up that you can capitalize on.<br/><br/>Four Tribes can be setup, played, and put away in about 30 minutes, making it a great lunchtime or filler game. I specifically designed this game to be a game that I can play with my wife and since then have heard from dozens of couples who play Four Tribes regularly.<br/><br/>This newest edition takes everything that was loved about the original version, that was very successful on KickStarter, and boils it down and redevelops it into something that feels much like the original, but is new at the same time.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>28 Card Orange Army Deck 28 Card Purple Army Deck 6 Double-sided Standard Village Cards 6 Double-sided Winter Village Cards 6 Fire Expansion Cards 6 Flood Expansion Cards 3 Longhouse Cards 1 Blizzard Token 12 Village Elder Pawns 42 Wooden Houses (10 each of Blue, Green, Red, &amp; Yellow, and 2 Black) 1 drawstring bag Instruction Booklet<br/><br/>",

The game is for 2-6 players and has 18 cards: nine dune cards and nine lagoon cards, with different text on each of them. Among the dune cards is a chest and among the lagoon cards a key, and whoever has both cards simultaneously wins &mdash; but if you have the key and a thunderstorm in hand, you lose and leave the game.<br/><br/>To play, six cards are placed face down on the table, and each player starts with two cards in hand. On your turn, take two actions &mdash; draw a card and play a card &mdash; in the order you wish. When playing a card, carry out the effect printed on it. At the end of each turn, the wind blows and all the cards on the board revolve around the center.<br/><br/>Len&ccedil;&oacute;is is a game of strategy and memory, but with a good dose of about faces and attacks!<br/><br/>",

Players race against each other over eight rounds to solve little tile-placement problems.   In every round, the first person to solve their puzzle yells &quot;Ubongo!&quot; then counts to some mutually-agreed number of seconds (the rules suggest 20 or 30; but allow that other variations are possible).  All players that complete their puzzle before time runs out keep the puzzle tile (a Pok&eacute;mon ball!) as a scoring reminder, and those that fail give their tile to the first solver.<br/><br/>So far, that sounds a lot like Ubongo Mini.  (That has a &quot;Don't bother counting; first to solve keeps their tile, and everyone else just stops.&quot; alternate rule, too; and while that rule could easily be used in this version, it's not mentioned.)<br/><br/>But: the puzzles in ウボンゴ ポケモン are notably harder.  Each puzzle tile has two sides: one that can be completed with three pieces, and one that requires four.  More, the puzzles don't disclose which pieces are required!  Players have eight possible tiles, and need to figure out which subset works.  (In contrast, Ubongo Mini's puzzles are two or three pre-specified pieces.)<br/><br/>Additionally, the rules specify that it's possible to complete all puzzles without the simplest (1x3 rectangle) piece.  And that using that piece or not could be an additional scaling factor.<br/><br/>",

This game explores the first month of this never-run plan, set in September 1943 (instead of the historical landings at Salerno in Italy).  Allied forces are not the mighty invasion armada of 1944 lacking both the armored &quot;funnies&quot; and Mulberries that worked so well in Normandy.  For the Germans at this time their &quot;Atlantic Wall&quot; and panzer arm are more promises of what is to come than actual impenetrable defenses.<br/><br/>Yet the game remains highly re-playable time after time as, at start, neither player knows Hitler&rsquo;s reaction to the invasion until it is rolled for during the first turn of the game. Will he give orders to: (1) Strip the East of as many divisions as possible transferring them to this new front so as to attempt to annihilate the landing, or merely try to contain it as a &ldquo;self-sustaining POW camp&rdquo;? OR (2) Redeploy the as-yet-unbroken Reich Air Defense fighter force to temporarily give up the war against the Allied strategic bombing campaign and switch to combat air support over the battlefield? OR (3) Mobilize the II Parachute Corps (standing by at air bases in southern France) to drop directly into the Allied beachhead? Depending on how many of them survive, they might prove decisive in upsetting the whole Allied plan. Or trigger powerful Allied countermeasures?<br/><br/>The map area covers the French coast from around Dunkirk south to the mouth of the Somme and inland to Lille and Arras. Operation Roundup uses a standard 34&quot; x 22&quot; large-hex (19mm) map and 216 medium (16mm) counters. The game is scaled at 2 miles (3.25 km) per hex, with 10 three-day game turns, and uses regiments and brigades (and a few battalions) as units of maneuver. The game system is an evolution of the classic old-SPI Cobra, simple enough to allow for a game to be completed in one sitting, and can also easily be adapted for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Operation Roundup is published in the Against The Odds (ATO) Annual 2021.<br/><br/>Contents and Information<br/><br/>Maps - One full color 22&quot; x 34&quot; hex mapsheet<br/>Counters - 216 full color 9/16&quot; die-cut counters<br/>Rules length - 12 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Playing time - Up to 3 to 4 hours<br/>How challenging is it solitaire? - Average.<br/><br/>",

At each move the object is to take the lead and end up with at least one more tile on the board then one&rsquo;s opponent.

Whenever a player is able to change both the form and the meaning of an opponent&rsquo;s word, by substituting one or more letters in the word and/or by adding letters to either end, that player may steal it by turning over all its letters, so a previously blue word becomes a red one, or vice-versa.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player is unable to take the lead on his turn and over-steps the time-limit.<br/><br/>",

You can either try for the big red one that's worth the most points, or try a smaller one that may be easier to pick.<br/><br/>Reach for the stem and lift the apple up, but be careful!  If you pick it without disturbing any other apples, you get to keep it and score points.

        "description": "K.O ! is a wacky action / dexterity game. Two gadgets are set in a groove in a heavy duty plastic board. Each gadget has a handle, a hammer (which can be operated through a button on the handle) and a tube filled with 5 discs. The tube has two horizontal slits at the bottom. By sliding your gadget along the groove you try to strike with your hammer through one slit, thereby hitting a disc of your opponent and send it flying. When you lose your last disc you're knocked out.<br/><br/>It's a matter of speed and reaction. Even when sliding your gadget all the way forward, your hammer may not reach the tube of your opponent. So you've got to feint, lure your opponent forward, strike fast and be quick to retreat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Who Shit In My Cat is a game for 3 - 10 players Ages 18 and up.<br/><br/>The game centers around a plush cat sitting in the middle of the table. It is a Schr&ouml;dinger's cat of sorts. It is everyone&rsquo;s cat and nobody&rsquo;s cat at the same time. It may or may not have been shit in. All of this and more will be worked out by the end of this ridiculous game.<br/><br/>Say hello to Albert Kittensworth. You can tell by the expression on his face that he is not looking forward to playing this game. But you should be. Albert may not be very good a catching mice or playing with string, but there is one skill that makes him as unique as he is precious - his ability to hold an almost limitless number of objects in his ample rear compartment. You can put anything and everything in there, and by the end of the game, you will. Well, everything but one thing, that is. There is one thing that simply will not be tolerated, so let's make this perfectly clear, DO NOT SHIT IN MY CAT.<br/><br/>Players start the game with a hand of cards that will contain some very unusual objects as well as a freshly-baked loaf that most definitely did not come from a bakery. On their turn, Albert will spin around to face them with his best side forward and they will draw a card and add it to their hand. They will then randomly select one of their face down cards, look at it and announce to the table what they are placing inside of the cat. If the card the player selected was their poo card, they should lie and claim it is a different item. After all, you wouldn't want the other players to know you just shit in the cat. It will be our little secret. Keep in mind there a few additional poo cards that you can pick up out of the draw pile and you might even start the game with more then one poo card. During each round players will draw cards, place cards and sometimes even discard each other's cards.<br/> Eventually someone will become suspicious of a fellow player and will point across the table and demand an answer to that age old question &ldquo;Did you shit in my cat?&rdquo; Once accused, the player will need to show if they still have a poo in their hand of cards. Because they cannot view their hand of cards during play, they may not know if their poo has been removed and placed inside the cat. One by one they begin to reveal their cards. If they do not have a poo card, then they indeed were the offending party member that committed this heinous act. And even though only one person was actually caught brown-handed, they were probably not the only one to leave a poo in you know who. When you set up for the next game you get the joy of seeing who else did the deed and got away with it.<br/><br/>",

If you see that the necessary Finds appeared, Flip over the Dinosaur card!<br/><br/>The cards will be played in rounds, and whoever has the best score will win. But be careful, if you incorrectly cover a card, you get penalty tokens! Which subtract your final score.<br/><br/>PatagoSaurios was worked in conjunction with the Paleovertebrate Laboratory of the National University of Patagonia San Juan Bosco, for which it has an educational brochure on the different species that appear throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player has an army of 12 pieces (one General, two Knights, two Cannons, two Chariots, and five Soldiers);  unlike the parent game, there are no Guards or Elephants.  The rules are the same as XiangQi except that soldiers may move and capture one space to the side from their first move.  There is no river to cross and no promotion. In addition, except for the General, no pieces are restricted to the fortress.<br/><br/>In the Leopard variant of Mini XiangQi, each player also has two leopards.  Leopards move one space orthagonally or two spaces diagonally.  They are allowed to capture only when making the two-space move. When making the two-space move, the leopard may jump over a piece (friendly or enemy) on the intervening point, although the jumped piece is not captured.  Leopards are stronger pieces than elephants in standard XiangQi because they are capable of reaching any space on the board.<br/><br/>",

As little as possible without getting fired.<br/><br/>Walking Doggos is a trick-taking game, where the goal is to take fewer tricks than your opponents while still at least winning one trick. There are six suits of cards: Great Danes, Labradors, Shiba Inus, Beagles, Corgis, and Pugs ranked by size of the breed. Each suit has a card numbered 1 through 8 representing the number of that breed that need to be walked.<br/><br/>Players each have a hand of 5 cards held face out, so that only other players can see what cards are being held. Players take turns giving clues to other players as to what cards are in their hand. Once every player has 3 clues, players take turns betting how many tricks they are going to take. After all players have made their bets, players take turns playing a card face up into a pack to be walked. The player who played the highest ranked doggo wins the pack. Players get points based on the number of packs they take compared to what they bet. The winner is the player who did the least amount of work necessary without being fired.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

That suit will be their bug suit. <br/>You also have the possibility to choose the (currently unknown) suit of the undealt card, for double points, or to announce that you will not take any card of your bug suit, also for double points, but if you cannot make it, you score nothing.<br/>Then tricks are played (they are taken by the highest card of the suit led).<br/>You each count 10 points for each trick you won, and divide this total by the number of bugs they contain, ignoring fractions. If there are no bugs, each trick counts double instead.<br/>The first player to reach 500 points (after several deals), is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>     Re-implements: Bugami<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Strategos (Greek for 'General') is a simple but realistic set of wargame rules descended from the designer's previous Society of Ancients games, 'Phalanx' and 'Legion'. It focuses firmly on the grand-tactical level of generalship, and includes full scenarios for 48 Greek and Roman land battles (from Marathon to Philippi), based on extensive study of both Ancient and Modern sources.  The 2nd edition (2006) only includes 36 battles, as the designer felt there was insufficient information on the others to create a truly representative scenario.<br/><br/>Strategos makes use of a gridded battle area which makes it well-suited to being played as a boardgame, but it can be also be played on a normal, ungridded tabletop with any number, or scale, of miniature models figures, using any basing arrangement. A comprehensive 5-page example of play (a refight of Cannae) in the 28 page manual (of which 8 pages are the scenarios, and 12 pages are rules) makes it easy to grasp the principles of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chess In The 3rd Dimension offers a challenge not to be found in standard chess games. Here, you play in three dimensions instead of two. Consequently, each player must &quot;see&quot; the game in terms of left and right, forward and back, as well as vertical up and down, as though the men on the field are suspended along three planes of space. You must be wary, as should your opponent, of being attacked from either above or below, as well as the other two dimensions.'<br/><br/>This chess game differs from a regular chess game in that it has three transparent boards stacked on top of each other. One player will start with his pieces on the top board, the other will have his pieces on the bottom board.<br/><br/>After their initial move, a piece automatically moves to the middle plane (with a few exceptions: a king or rook may remain on the same plane, as can a piece needed to prevent checkmate). From there on, each player can make a regular move or ascent or descent a single level (moving to the same square on a different level). When moving up or down, it is not possible to capture opposing pieces.<br/><br/>",

This feature leads to great variety and depth of play.<br/><br/>The game is also a generalization of the the game of Hex, which means that the set of all possible ways that a game of Hex can play out is a subset of the set of all the possible ways a game of Mind Ninja can play out.  Mind Ninja is a generalization of many other games as well, including Go-moku (5-in-a-row), Havannah, One-Capture Go, Y, Poly-Y, and *Star, among others.<br/><br/>It can be played with stones of two (or more) colors on any tiled surface. It can also be played with paper and colored markers. A version of the rules is available here.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sploof is a four-in-a-row style game for two players with a Series: Shibumi set. Players have limited resources available and are faced with a choice between positioning balls for strategic effect; or stockpiling them to avoid forced moves later in the game.<br/><br/>Aim: The player who manages to create a string of 4 touching balls at any level visible as a straight line from directly above the board wins the game. In addition, if a player has no balls remaining in their stock and cannot legally remove a red ball they lose the game.<br/><br/>Rules: The board starts with twelve red balls placed around the perimeter of the board. Two players, White and Black, start the game with two balls of their colour in their &lsquo;stock&rsquo;, the remaining balls are kept in a central &lsquo;supply&rsquo;. A player's stock must not be hidden from their opponent.<br/><br/>Randomly determine a start player. On their turn a player must either:<br/><br/>- Place a ball on either an empty board hole or stack it on any 2x2 platform of existing balls, or<br/><br/>- Remove a red ball from the board returning it to the supply and move two balls of their colour from the supply to their stock.<br/><br/>The removal of red balls and placement of black and white balls follows Shibumi stacking in that balls may only stack on 2x2 platforms of existing balls and if a red ball is removed then any others that it supports will drop. A red ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed.<br/><br/>Managing the numbers of balls in your stock is vital for ensuring your opponent does not force you into making moves that do not improve your position. Running out of balls in your stock will force you to remove a red ball and give the opponent two consecutive placements: this becomes a progressively riskier tactic as the game develops.<br/><br/>THE SHIBUMI CHALLENGE<br/><br/>Sploof was created as part of the Shibumi Challenge and was judged to be the winning entry.<br/><br/>The Shibumi Challenge geeklist: Winners announced!<br/><br/>Included in the Shibumi Rule Book<br/><br/>Soft cover:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...</a><br/><br/>Downloadable PDF:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf</a><br/><br/>",

Unfortunately for you, your free-spirited sprites frequently switch teams and help your opponent accumulate bliss points instead of you! By maintaining a well-staffed team, complete tasks and accumulate bliss to win the game.<br/><br/>Each round, players place at least 1 gnome card face-down from their hand. Simultaneously reveal gnomes and determine who will resolve their cards first. Use your gnomes to fulfill requirements depicted by the current task cards. Doing so will score bliss and sometimes recruit loyal enchanted animals who will help you in future rounds. Finally, both players pass played gnomes to the opponent for use in the next round, while also keeping their own unplayed gnomes. Win by gaining 77 bliss.<br/><br/>Distinctive mechanics include (1) gaining your opponent's expended cards, (2) a sliding card system to generate fresh tasks that you can slightly foresee, and (3) an automa to support solo play.<br/><br/>Distinctive theming includes (1) garden gnomes, (2) silly illustrations, and (3) an unrepuntant love of puns in the flavor text.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you slide one of the opponent's stones into one of the outer hexagons of the board. If necessary, you push one or more stones already on the board to make room for the new one. By pushing stones into new positions, you can drastically change the situation on the board, hopefully to your advantage.<br/><br/>The board is non-symmetric, and the shape balances the disadvantage of starting, making Avverso a well-balanced game in addition to being quick and dramatic and requiring deep thought.<br/><br/>",

If you&rsquo;re attacked at the wrong moment, prepare to taste cold steel!<br/><br/>Each turn the active player will draw a hand of cards, arming themselves with new items and/or restoring their Poise in preparation for the upcoming duel. That player will then begin an Exchange with a player of their choosing by using an Attack card. The way their opponent chooses to defend themselves (or not) may result in a flurry of attacks and counter attacks between the two players, exhausting their Poise in a flurry of flashing thrusts, slashes and lunges. If either player gets hit with an attack while they are at No Poise, they are eliminated from the game!<br/><br/>Be the last player standing after a series of ferocious duels and you win!<br/><br/>",

Each player controls 8 Towers and 3 Strongholds.  Players control the spaces their Towers occupy, as well as the unoccupied spaces that are orthogonally adjacent to their Strongholds.<br/><br/>Controlled Desert spaces determine priority.  Forest spaces grant them strength and the ability to remove or replace opposing Towers.  Mountains grant gold, which players spend to keep their pieces in play at the end of the Year.<br/><br/>Each Year, each player receives 2 actions, chosen from 3 different options: Tower Action, Stronghold Action, or Ability Action, with each of these options offering 2 choices.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds, and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.<br/><br/>Although Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools, and even favors &mdash; if there is truly honor among chemists!<br/><br/>In the ten years since Compounded debuted, designer Darrell Louder and publisher Greater Than Games have developed and refined the design to streamline gameplay, increase player interaction, and include more real-world facts. Compounded: The Peer-Reviewed Edition is a game about scientists grappling for recognition on the edge of known chemistry and getting credit for their discoveries, all while competing for limited resources and striking deals with the competition to ensure their work gets done.<br/><br/>Compounded: The Peer-Reviewed Edition features new compounds, new tool tiles and rules, revised lab fire interaction, redesigned lab benches, and more. Everything in this new build of Compounded has been tweaked in some way.<br/><br/>",
