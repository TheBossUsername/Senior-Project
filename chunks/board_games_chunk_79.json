        "description": "More commonly known as the Hetzer, this pocket sized tank destroyer provides a low cost option for the points conscious commander. If you have points to spare though then there are plenty of options to customise it&rsquo;s performance on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The Jagdpanzer 38(T) Hetzer is a crowd favourite. It combines a solid set of stats, a deceptively small size and a relatively low cost that makes it an affordable Tank Destroyer for a platoon commander on a budget. Left alone at the back of the battlefield sniping enemies it will quickly earn it&rsquo;s keep, but with a few small upgrades you can really enhance the ability of the Hetzer to be a threat on the table as well as improving it&rsquo;s chances of surviving. First up an Improved Rotation Mechanism will give your tank a nice improvement to its initiative, increasing your chances of being in the right place to get your shots off. Adding Wilhelm Lindemann to your crew will also improve your initiative in the movement phase whilst also increasing your chances of avoiding critical hits. Last but not least, a crew member with the Concealment ability will stack with the inherent Tank Destroyer special rule and keep your tank safe whilst in cover.<br/><br/>",

Players can shed more cards -- and force other players to take cards, by making combinations of six using the colors and numbers on the cards. Hexxed is fast moving and easy to learn. The deck features six colors in nine suits of eight cards each, or 72 cards in a Standard Deck.<br/><br/>Each Hexxed card has two colors and two numbers from 1-6. To play, match either of the colors on one of your cards with a color on the discard. Zero cards let you change the color for the next play.<br/><br/>Special combos of six let you play again, or hex another player and make them take three cards. But, be careful. Your curse can come right back to you! The first player to empty their hand wins.<br/><br/>The Spectrum Back design adds color and variety to the deck without revealing your cards. Try a Hexxed deck for your original games, magic tricks, and cardistry.<br/><br/>",

Now, a potent new FTL advancement, which rumors say emerged from the cryptic galactic core, grants humanity the hope of travel to the farthest stars in a single lifetime. You are one of the few with the mettle to give up your planet-bound life and become a STAR CHARTER.<br/><br/>Star Charter is a card-driven solitaire game where you play a star charter, striking out from your home planet to travel the space lanes and the vast void, discovering long-lost worlds of a densely inhabited galaxy. When you have discovered three new worlds, you have won the game, but it is possible to become adrift in space and lose. Whether you win or lose, the known galaxy has the potential to grow with each new game.<br/><br/>This is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with a few materials (a map, paper, index cards, and colored cubes) and the remaining components will be generated as needed during play. Each game will see the addition of new cards, which represent the worlds in the galaxy.<br/><br/>The game rules include tables and guidelines for making new cards as needed, and this makes every copy of Star Charter an evolving galaxy. In addition, it means that each game inherits all components added or changed in the previous games. The galaxy&rsquo;s worlds can grow endlessly over a connected campaign as players return to see what each new era holds for the future of humanity.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Due to a malfunction in your spaceship engine, you need to make an emergency landing on an asteroid. However, upon landing, your navigation system alerts you to lethal levels of radiation from the asteroid's soil. Your spaceship's shields are not strong enough to protect you for long: you must leave the asteroid before the radiation poisoning overwhelms you. The main frame calculates that you just need 51% of your &laquo;EVA Engine&raquo; power to take off from the asteroid and save yourself. <br/>In order to achieve that, you will have to install 4 engine components in the correct order. If you succeed, you will be able to leave the asteroid and win the game. Unfortunately, the components are damaged. Before reassembling the engine, you will need to fix the pieces and put them back in the right order before it's too late!<br/>And despite the nonnrequired opinions of those who judge a game before it is even released, this game uses &quot;time track&quot; mechanics.<br/><br/>",

Annipanni rolls the die and decides which direction she wants to go. The other player also rolls and decides the direction and which of their tiles they want to move. This way vou jump from card to card and flip one in each round. If Annipanni finds Boribon she wins. If there are no more cards face up Boribon wins.<br/><br/>In the cooperative version you all control together the animals and try to protect Boribon from Annipanni catching him. You start with the cards face down and if you can name the card you jump to with any character you can flip it. If you flip all the cards you win. You can use the dog and cat to stop Annipanni in her round and help Boribon to get away. If Annipanni catches Boribon you loose.<br/><br/>",

Live a new experience of the first global economy in the world.<br/><br/>China experienced the greatest economic expansion in its history during the Ming dynasty (1368&ndash;1644). The silver trade between the Americas and Europe and onward to China had a profound effect on the world economy &ndash; it may be considered the beginning of a global economy.<br/><br/>In China, social mobility led to the growing of cities, especially in the lower Yangtze area, which was at that time responsible for the main production of wheat for the whole country. In addition to wheat and rice, other crops like tea, fruits, and sugarcane were grown on a large scale. Immigrating peasants changed their profession to become merchants and artisans. Many people from the countryside were employed in private or state run factories, producing commodities like paper, porcelain, refined sugar, or silk textiles.<br/><br/>Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy and was aided by the construction of canals, roads, and bridges by the Ming government. Ming China saw the rise of several merchant clans, who owned large amounts of wealth.<br/><br/>In Yinzi &mdash; &quot;y&iacute;nzi&quot; meaning &quot;silver&quot; &mdash; the players represent merchant clans developing parts of China in the late Ming period in the early 17th century along the last 200 km of the Yangtze river before it reaches the China Sea.<br/><br/>The players plant crops, sell goods to the rural or urban markets, develop raw materials, build and upgrade factories, and sell their goods to ships already waiting in the port. In order to reach the port, the players need to improve their river transport capabilities along the Yangtze.<br/><br/>",

Make the right choices to solve these three investigations, because you are the hero!<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes: T&eacute;n&egrave;bres sur Londres is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &quot;The comic in which you are the hero&quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points.

As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!<br/><br/>-description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Most cards move your cat and cats move a different way for each experiment. If you reach the end of a bench, take a party hat. First to get 4 hats wins.<br/><br/>Blackbody Radiation Experiment. Includes die with faces 0/black, 2 red/1, 2 green/2, and 1 blue/3. Roll the dice to see what color photon comes out of the blackbody oven. The rarer the photon, the more your cat advances.<br/><br/>Rutherford Gold Foil Experiment. Includes spinner w/4 spaces: red/1 (takes up half of circumference), 2 gold/2 spaces (each takes up 1/6 of the circumference), and blue/3 (takes up 1/6 of the circumference). Spin the spinner to see in what direction your alpha particle scattered. The rarer the outcome, the farther you can advance.<br/><br/>Double-Slit experiment. Includes 2 dice each w/3 white (0/1/2) and 3 black (0/1/2) faces. Roll both to see if your electron ends up in a region of constructive or destructive interference. If faces are same color (constructive interference), add them. If different, subtract the smaller from the larger.<br/><br/>Photoelectric Effect. Includes 3 dice w/faces: red/1000 Kelvin (move 1 space), green/3000K (move 2 spaces), and blue/200k (move 3 spaces). Roll the dice to see what color lamp your can has chosen. Some colors of light will eject electrons from the metal at higher velocity, meaning your cat can advance further.<br/><br/>Each deck consists of 10 &ldquo;Run the Experiment&rdquo; cards (if you draw one, run the experiment as above) plus a number of special cards. If you draw the Wolfgang Pauli card, Pauli shows up to observe and breaks your experiment. &ldquo;Save this Card&rdquo; allows you to place a note on the door to direct auli to another room. &ldquo;Ummm???&rdquo; &ndash; someone measure the momentum of your cat so precisely that its position is uncertain. Roll 1 double-slit die and move forward if you roll white and backward if you roll black. &ldquo;Rawr!&rdquo; &ndash; you encounter a potential energy barrier and have a 50% chance to quantum tunnel through it (by rolling double-slit die as above). &ldquo;Yikes!&rdquo;: your cat ruins the experiment so you don&rsquo;t move. &ldquo;Hooray&rdquo;: your cat did something to help you &ndash; move again.<br/><br/>",

There are two players: the Bosnian government (BiH) player and the Bosnian Serb (VRS) player. The Bosnian Government player controls the units of the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) although certain game events allow the Serb player to control the HVO units. The Serb player can also control the units of the Krajina Serb Army (SKV) through random events or NATO intervention. The Bosnian Government player can also control units of the Croatian Army (HV) under certain conditions. In this game, the enemy population is not a victim of collateral damage, rather it is a target, so conquering towns and cities is a key aspect of the game.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents three months of time. Each hex represents 12 km (7.5 miles). Each combat unit represents a task force ranging in size from a regiment to a division.<br/><br/>22 x 34-inch game map, 176 5/8-inch counters<br/>Included in Strategy &amp; Tactics #351, January 2025.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Must-follow trick-taking rules apply and Aces are normally the highest card in a suit. Try to win as many tricks as possible, but as few penalty cards as possible. The game ends after either four rounds, or when someone reaches 250 points. The game is best at 4 players, but also includes variations for 2, 3, and 5 player counts.<br/><br/>SCORING:<br/><br/>Scoring occurs at the end of each 13-trick round. You score 10 points per trick divided by the number of penalty cards you took, rounding down to the nearest whole number. If you took no penalty cards, instead of dividing you add a bonus of 10 points. For taking no tricks, you score a flat 25 points.<br/><br/>The fourth player cannot get the 10 point bonus, and instead chooses one of the three scoring &quot;privileges&quot; or conditions under which to play:<br/>        Immunity - You will score a flat 5 points per trick, regardless of any penalty cards they contain.<br/>        Warranty - You will score a flat 25 points regardless of how many tricks or penalty cards you win.<br/>        Poverty - Instead of scoring for the number of tricks you win, you will score for the number you win less than five - in other words, 1 trick counts as 4, 2 as 3, and so on<br/><br/>",

Through his contacts, he must manage to obtain the right suspect to be the one with the most progress in his case.<br/><br/>The game is fast and dynamic and uses card control and player choices to advance your case. The object of the game is at the last turn to compare the symbol on the card remaining in the player's hand with the symbols on the player's case card. The player whose symbol has the most points is considered the winner. Another way to win is to be the only player left during the round, some cards allow this.<br/><br/>The game has mechanics similar to other pocket games like Love Letter and Lost Legacy. Players accustomed to this type of game will feel familiar with the rules. Not so experienced players will be able to quickly learn the rules of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ひよころ (Hiyokoro) is a dexterity game from Japan. Hiyokoro means 'chick', and in the game, the players are manipulating glass marbles in the open palms of their hands, is if they were newly hatched chicks.<br/><br/>The game has a set of marbles, 8 yellow and 8 blue marbles, and 4 red and 4 green marbles. There is a deck on cards showing how the player must arrange the marbles, at the start and the finish.<br/><br/>For example, on a turn, a player will have three yellow marbles in their right palm and two yellow and one blue marble in their left palm. The goal is to finish with all the marbles in their left palm, with the yellow marbles surrounding the blue marble in the centre, like a flower. The opposing player would do the same, but surrounding a yellow marble with five blue marbles.<br/><br/>Players can only manipulate the marbles by cupping, flexing and turning their open palms and fingers. A player cannot trap a marble in one finger by curling the finger over the marble, not between two fingers, and so on. Only by freely flowing the marbles around, can they complete each challenge.<br/><br/>When a player completes the challenge successfully, they call out 'Hiyokoro!'. The player who completes the most challenges first is the winner. But the designer emphasises the benefit of play for children and for rehabilitation.<br/><br/>The game can be played solo as the player is trying to beat each challenge.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Basically, try not to be the winner, but only get sweets at the right time!<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Each player will choose one Play card from their hand to play <br/>faceup to the table. If you have a card that matches the suit of the lead card, you must play it. The player who played the strongest Play card wins the trick and gets the score card. The score cards have positive and negative scores! <br/>Also, there are special cards within the Play cards that reverse the strength of the numbers on the card. Be wary of special cards and think carefully before issuing Play cards!<br/><br/>A &quot;DEATH&quot; card is placed at the bottom of the score card deck, and the player who has taken the &quot;DEATH&quot; card will not be eligible to score for the game regardless of the points obtained so far.

Be careful though, because if you make too many mistakes, the dragon will wake up... and he's always hungry after his nap!<br/><br/>",

Wandering around a new city or falling in love? How about the feeling of losing track of time, being out in nature, or listening to music that moves you? We all have special things that make us feel alive and connected to the world, and playing Cloud Nine was made to share them with each other.<br/><br/>In Cloud Nine, players choose from over 300 Cloud Cards to build their personalized collection of nine treasured things, with 50 Action Cards to mix up gameplay.<br/>The Cloud Cards represent a wide assortment of things and experiences, big and small, that bring out a range of emotions from joy and happiness to wonder and amazement, as well as simple pleasures like favorite foods.<br/>Each Cloud Card also includes questions that players can use as conversation prompts to learn more about why we love the things we do.<br/><br/>How to play: To start the game, draw nine random Cloud Cards from the deck and place them face up in a 3x3 grid, known as &ldquo;the Sky.&rdquo; The Sky is shared by all players, and must always be filled as cards are taken.<br/>On each turn, players can choose from one of two options:<br/>Take a Cloud Card from the Sky. If you see something you love in the Sky, take the Cloud Card and add it to your own collection. Replace the card you took with a new card from the deck.<br/>Remove a row of Cloud Cards from the Sky. If you don&rsquo;t love any of the Cloud Cards, you can discard an entire row in any direction, replacing it with three new cards from the deck to choose from. If you still don&rsquo;t love any of the cards, your turn ends without adding a new card to your collection.<br/>If any card you&rsquo;ve drawn from the deck is an Action Card, you must use it immediately, following its instructions before ending your turn.<br/>The first player to collect nine Cloud Cards is the winner! Now try spinning all nine cards into a story about how you&rsquo;d love to spend one beautiful day packed full with things you love.

All eggs appear to look the same but they actually differ slightly. The faster you locate the right egg token, the more likely you are to reach it before anyone else.<br/><br/>The game comes with both a basic and an advanced variant.<br/><br/>In the basic variant (children's variant) you will also need luck with the roll the dice and choose smart paths to be successful.<br/><br/>In the advanced variant (family variant) you need to find the shortest path AND count the correct number of steps, before anyone else, to be successful. Do not forget that you can &quot;warp&quot; by leaving the game board at one end and enter it at the other side.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the egg gets to loot it by drawing a candy token from the bag. The player with most candy win (as in real life).<br/><br/>The perfect game to play during Easter, or on any other day of the year.<br/><br/>",

Each space of the path shows a drawing of a fist extending 0 to 5 fingers.  When you land on a space, you gain back the number of fingers shown and reveal all spaces up to that point.<br/><br/>However, if you land on a space while your fist shows 0 fingers (rock) or 2 fingers (scissors), you play rock-paper-scissors against the space you land on (if applicable). If you win, take another turn immediately; if you lose, you lose your next turn.  If there is a tie, you resolve as normal.<br/><br/>After the first round, remove the tiles showing 3 fingers and play another round. Then, remove the tiles showing 1 finger and play another round.<br/><br/>The person with the most points after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Office War is a fast-paced card game that lets you take out your aggressions without losing your day job.  Players attempt to get each other's employees &quot;fired&quot; in a war of staplers, spitballs and wet mops.  Stay low, and whatever you do... Don't Get Caught!  The last player to retain control over any employees is the winner.<br/><br/>You will need to manage the amount of attention your employees gather in the office war.  Attention counters are small paperclips, and the game comes with a package of colorful paperclips.<br/><br/>To win, arm your employees with office weapons and play action cards that influence the office war. Office weapons include items like rulers, tacks, coffee creamers, and even &quot;The Bark of Authority&quot; (usable only by Executives).  Action cards are modifiers.  They include events like &quot;Lunch with the Boss,&quot; &quot;Reorganization,&quot; &quot;Promotion&quot; and &quot;No Toilet Paper.&quot;<br/><br/>Using an office weapon comes with its own risk and reward.  For example, if a Maintenance employee uses their wet mop, they will dish out three attention counters to their target, but take three counters themselves.  Whenever an employee receives attention counters, the employee's controller must roll two dice.  If the dice roll is equal to or less than their number of attention counters, the employee is fired and escorted to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Each turn a player draws a card, may play an action card, equip a weapon, engage in employee v. employee office warfare, then redraws cards to the hand size.  Play passes until only one player remains, because as everyone knows, office wars are ruthless.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Part of the Gravity Games &quot;Balance&quot; series from 2013, consisting of two of their titles in one box: Hungry Higgs and Gravity Gammon.<br/><br/>Hungry Higgs is played with two dice with sides 1, 2 and 3, and pieces on a balancing board. Every one of the play pieces has got a certain weight that can have decisive influence on the game. The main strategy is to balance between caution (don&rsquo;t be knocked out by your opponents game piece) and greed (capture as much prey as possible).<br/><br/>Gravity Gammon is a backgammon-like gravity game. The board has a few shortcuts. You can win either by getting your pieces home first, or by your opponent tilting the board.<br/><br/>",

To make matters worse, the Wicked Slumber spell that the defenders of Eldraine used to repel the Phyrexians didn't end when the invaders were routed, and it continues to spread. Meanwhile, Will and Rowan Kenrith, the heirs to the throne, are at odds with each other over how to repair the realm, and a young hero named Kellan is taking his first steps on an epic journey...<br/><br/>Wilds of Eldraine is sold in draft boosters, set boosters, collector boosters, and bundles. Two preconstructed commander decks, &quot;Fae Dominion&quot; and &quot;Virtue and Valor&quot;, were also released alongside the main set. The set features the return of the popular Adventure mechanic from Throne of Eldraine, alongside the new mechanics of Role Tokens, Bargain, and Celebration.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Or a &quot;reason for separation&quot;? What about a &quot;city abroad&quot;? Can you quickly think of a &quot;Famous Dead Person&quot; or a &quot;Famous Actor&quot; for your letter cards?<br/><br/>Important now: The FASTEST player wins each round and at the end the player who first got rid of all letter cards wins the game.

Oder einen &ldquo;Trennungsgrund&rdquo;? Was ist mit einer &ldquo;Stadt im Ausland&rdquo;? F&auml;llt dir zu deinen Buchstaben-Karten schnell ein &ldquo;Ber&uuml;hmter Toter&rdquo; ein bzw. kommt Dir sofort ein &ldquo;bekannter Schauspieler&rdquo; in den Sinn?<br/><br/>Wichtig nun: Der SCHNELLSTE Spieler gewinnt jeweils die Runde und am Ende gewinnt der Spieler das Spiel, der zuerst alle Buchstaben-Karten losgeworden ist.

All the dice have the same motifs printed on them: dice fish, starfish, crab, seahorse, octopus and a submarine. Each player places their three dice in front of them so that the submarine is facing upwards. Another die is now rolled and placed in the middle of the table. This one shows a starfish, for example. Now all the players call out together &quot;3...2...1... Dive!&quot; and the action starts.<br/>The first thing each player tries to do is to roll the three dice to get the animal from the centre of the table, but only one dice may be in the cup at a time. So the dice are rolled one by one! Once someone has hit the animal they are looking for with all of their dice, they shout out loud &quot;Show up!&quot; and everyone finishes their roll. The calling player then gets the die from the centre of the table and adds it to his own. If a player still has submarines in front of him, he must give up one cube. The first player to have five or six dice wins.<br/><br/>The dice game for children and families &quot;W&uuml;rfelfisch&quot; is suitable for 2-5 players aged 5 and up.

        "description": "Desert War: Area 88 is a Japanese doujin (fan-made) game that was produced for sale only at game shows in Japan, such as Tokyo Game Market. To get one you would place an order in advance, the game would be made and brought to the show for you to pick up. It was not for sale to the general public.<br/><br/>This game is based on the anime series Area 88, and deals with mercenary fight pilots fighting for a fictitious kingdom called Aslan.<br/><br/>This particular title uses the &quot;Commando&quot; system from Decision Games. It is a solitaire game where you are trying to earn enough money to end your contract with the Asland Defense Forces and return back to Japan.  Each mission you complete brings you closer to your goal.<br/><br/>Game comes with rules, map, event sheet, and counters.  Assembly is required.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Completing rows and columns in a quilt unlock Beeline Bonuses that grant players special abilities and enable valuable dice mitigation.

Rules are available on a second page so that each copy of the game can be printed double sided with the game on one side and the instructions on the other.

For players without a printer, the game can also be played digitally on a computer or tablet using a JPG file.<br/><br/>The game can be played with one or more players, and is infinitely scalable.<br/><br/>The solo game comes with three levels of difficulty as you face off against master quilters with increasing levels of skill.<br/><br/>How will you ensure that the quilt you plan is the most Quiltable?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As a princess, you have to avoid marriage proposals and remain single and independent after the celebrations.<br/><br/>Rebel Princess takes place over five rounds, representing the five days of a party, and each round has a special rule that makes each game totally different. The general mechanisms are those of trick-taking games, in which each player plays a numbered card into each trick, following one of the four suits in the game. The player with the highest number of the suit that started the trick takes all the cards of that trick &mdash; but that's not necessarily good as players want to avoid taking cards with prince charmings, who each bring one marriage proposal, aside from the enchanted frog who brings five proposals. The player with the fewest marriage proposals after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>Importantly, each player assumes the role of a different fairy tale princess and has a special ability that they can use once per round.<br/><br/>Compared to the 1st (2023) edition, Rebel Princess Second Edition features:<br/>Balance tweaks to existing rules, rounds, and princesses<br/>A new &quot;Rebel of the Ball&quot; mechanism to allow players to catch up if they are falling too far behind<br/>Changes to the suited cards, adding an additional number in the lower right of each card<br/> (all of these changes are also included in the Deluxe Edition)<br/><br/>",

Each player takes heist cards matching these banks.<br/><br/>The leader for the round lays out one face-up loot card on each bank, with loot showing an item or a value from $1-9,000. Each player places a heist card face down matching the bank they want to rob, then the leader names either the color of the bank they will rob or a color that they won't rob. All other players can then change their heist card if they wish. Finally, reveal all the heist cards. If a color has been chosen only once, that player takes all of the cards from that bank. Everyone takes back their heist cards.<br/><br/>Pass the loot deck, and start a new round. If at the end of a round, four cards remain in a bank, the police arrive, returning all of these cards to the bottom of the deck. Additionally, whoever has the most cards must return their most valuable card to the bottom of the deck.<br/><br/>When not enough loot cards remain to place a card in every bank, the game ends. Players tally their holdings, with items varying depending on how many you have; a single item is worth only $1,000, while two are $10,000 and five are $60,000. Whoever has the highest sum wins.<br/><br/>",

The mechanic of finger flicking the players remains the same.<br/><br/>Subbuteo is a classic finger-flicking soccer-simulation action game. It is played on a large cloth playing field called a &quot;pitch&quot;, with teams of players that are represented by miniature men mounted on smooth round bases. The men are made to kick the ball by flicking their bases, which causes the men to slide around on the pitch, hitting the ball. The rules simulate nearly all details of a soccer game including ball possession and passing, throw-ins, goal kicks and corner kicks. There is even a large section in the rules devoted to fouling.<br/><br/>Two editions were produced. One with a folding pitch, the other with a solid pitch.

This game uses the same rules system as Sedan: The Decisive Battle for France, May 1940 (W24), Tobruk: Operation Crusader, Nov-Dec, 1941 (ST278) and Duel on the Steppe (ST285), albeit with some occasional modifications appropriate to the scale and theater portrayed.<br/><br/>The map area portrays the Leningrad region of the Soviet Union, encompassing about 600 miles from east to west; each hexagon is about 12.5 miles. The various game pieces represent the historic combat units, as well as all necessary chits to facilitate game play. Soviet combat units are primarily divisions, the German units are divisions and Kampfgruppen and are color-coded by nationality and command affiliation. Combat units may represent from 2,000 to 14,000 men, and 50-400 armored vehicles.<br/><br/>World at War #48 April-May 2016<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 6 days<br/>Hex: 12.5 miles / 20 kilometers<br/>Units: Kampgruppe to Army<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15<br/><br/>This counter set includes one errata counter (the blue 4-6-6 mechanized division) for the game Red Tide West (Modern War #15).<br/><br/>",

My goal for this express version design was to condense set up and playtime while distilling all the things i really liked about Notre Dame down and still providing some good strategic decisions and player choices.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>The goal of the game is the same as in Notre Dame, to have as many prestige points after the end of six rounds. This game can be played with 2-5 players. I think 3 is optimal for playtime.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>Each of the six rounds is divided into 4 phases, and is played by rolling dice.<br/><br/>Phase 1: the Plague die is rolled to determine the plague count<br/><br/>Phase 2: three Action dice are rolled to determine actions for the phase (similar to the choosing and passing of cards in the boardgame version). Actions performed are similar to the boardgame and marked on a player card. Of the three dice rolled, one is chosen, one is passed to the next player and one is discarded.<br/><br/>Phase 3: one of three Person dice (depending on the period) is rolled and the player may choose to hire that person for the round performing that ability.<br/><br/>Phase 4: the plague check is determined for all players and the Notre Dame bonus is taken.<br/><br/>Files:<br/>Downloadable files include artwork for all dice faces, player cards and instructions for play. Everything is sized for 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper. You will need nine 1&quot; wooden cubes for the dice which can be readily found at craft stores.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prairie Aflame!<br/>The Northwest Rebellion of 1885<br/><br/>This game is an operational treatment of Canada's Northwest Rebellion of 1885. The Metis (half Native and half European) set up a provisional government to try and get recognition of their concerns with the federal government in Ottawa.<br/><br/>The federal government orders a detachment of Mounties to confiscate any weapons located at the Metis settlement of Duck Lake. The Mounties were met by a force of Metis and Natives and initially there was just talk. However, during the course of the discussion a gun was discharged and within minutes, the battle was on! The Mounties retreated, having taken 25% casualties - the rebellion was on.<br/><br/>To prevent the rebellion from spreading, the government in Ottawa quickly dispatches a military force which would grow to 5,000 troops, most transported by the nearly complete Canadian Pacific Railway. After 4 months and several battles later, the government had successfully suppressed the rebellion - if they had not, and this was their worst fear, the whole Northwest might have erupted in rebellion, keeping the government busy for years.<br/><br/>The basic military unit in the game is the battalion. All the battalions that participated in the campaign are represented, as are the various Northwest Mounted Police detachments, local militias, artillery, and Gatling guns. They are faced by the Metis, the Woods Cree, and the Plains Cree. Units can remain together as battalions, or they can break down. Morale is better as a battalion, while mobility is better as a breakdown unit. Each strength point represents 50 men. The main rebel and government leaders are represented and they have an important effect on the game.<br/><br/>The map shows the area of the Prairies in Canada from Edmonton and Calgary in the west to Qu&iacute;Appelle in the east. Map scale is 11 miles to the hex, and each turn represents one week. The map is 22 x 34. There is also a 24 page rulebook, and a number of charts, tables, and organizational sheets as well.<br/> Game scale<br/>Unit sizes:<br/>Battalion<br/>1 Strength Point = 50 men<br/>Each hex equals 11 Miles across.<br/>Each game turn represents one week.<br/><br/>",

It's a fast-paced, satirical game where reality collides with absurdity.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first person to be able to be able to spell V-O-T-E from the lettered quote cards they collected during the game.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of ten phrase cards and will draw back up to ten after each round.  A player is selected to be the CEO for the round and they draw a quote card and read it to the players.  The quote is missing a phrase that will be filled in with a phrase card from each player.  Players select the &quot;best&quot; phrase card from their hands for the current quote card and place the chosen phrase cards face down in a pile.  The CEO shuffles the submitted phrase cards and then reads the quote filled in with each phrase.  The CEO then decides which phrase &quot;won&quot; the round and the player that played the winning phrase collects the quote card.  Rotate the CEO position after each round.<br/><br/>There are special phrase cards called Trump cards that give a player special powers and are usually played in combination with a phrase card.<br/><br/>A &quot;lightweight&quot; ending is optional and occurs when a majority of the players grow so depressed at the prospect of a real Trump presidency that they just start quietly sobbing.  When this happens, the player with the most quote cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to occupy as large an area as possible on the game board using the blocks that you receive as rewards for making accurate guesses. Blocks are available in three different lengths and the better your guess, the longer the block you receive. Questions belong to three categories: Market, Technology and Brainteaser.<br/><br/>Playing the Game <br/>Each round starts with the question category being determined by a roll of the die.<br/><br/>One of the players reads the question aloud and when all players understand the question, the timer is started and all players have 90 seconds to make educated guesses and estimate as good a guess as possible. The players&rsquo; answers must be recorded in the block before the 90 seconds is out.<br/><br/>0, 1, 2 or 3 points then are distributed<br/><br/>The players put their points out on the board according to the rules below. The player with the least number of playing squares covered with points places theirs first, followed by the player with the second smallest number of covered playing squares, and so on. If two players have the same number of covered playing squares, then the player who is next to read a question places their points first.<br/><br/>The turn then goes to the next player and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Distributing the points<br/><br/>A correct answer within &plusmn; 25% gives 2 points.<br/><br/>If the answer is further away than &plusmn; 25% but within the range (10 x correct answer) to (1 / 10 x correct answer), the player receives 1 point.<br/><br/>The player who comes closest to the correct answer receives +1 point regardless of whether any points are obtained as described above.<br/><br/>Placing the points and winning the game<br/><br/>When new points are placed on the game board, they must be positioned adjacent to a previously played point of the same color.<br/><br/>In addition to the points themselves, players also get points for empty playing squares contained within a border of their lines of points, so it is tactically advantageous to build outwards to the edge of the game board.<br/><br/>When any player has a point that cannot be placed on the board, the game is over. The number of playing squares contained within each players&rsquo; delimited fields is calculated and added to their number of covered playing fields &ndash; the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

A number of cards is dealt, depending on the version played, and players either discard to three cards, or make more hands, each containing three cards. One round of betting is follows. Every player has to bet at least as much, as the previous player, or fold. This continues until only one player remains, or two players are left, and one of them decides to &quot;see&quot;. He has to pay twice as much as the previous bet, and the opponent shows his cards. The player who paid can (but does not have to) show his cards now; if they are better, he wins, with worse cards or in case of equality he loses.<br/><br/>",

Wok&rsquo;up!<br/><br/>On the signal, all players simultaneously throw an Ingredient token so that it spins a couple of times and falls in the Wok.<br/><br/>     If no Recipe card is completed, the players must simultaneously throw in another token. A Recipe card is complete when its conditions are met using one or more of the Ingredient tokens inside the Wok.<br/>     Once a Recipe has been completed, the first player to cover the card with their hand wins it, and then places it in front of themselves. Next, the player turns over a new card from a different stack so that there are always 3 cards visible on the 5 decks. The players all take back an equal number of tokens (it doesn&rsquo;t matter which ones), placing them at the bottom of their respective piles, and then the next round begins. It is possible to complete several Recipes with the same throw. If players cover different Recipe cards simultaneously, they each win their respective card. It is also possible for a player to win two completed Recipe cards at once, by covering them simultaneously.<br/><br/><br/>3. If a player mistakenly covers an incomplete Recipe card, they won&rsquo;t be able to play for the rest of that round. The Ingredient tokens and Recipe cards stay where they are, and the other players continue to play the round, by throwing their next token.<br/><br/>",

Only one part of the island is available at a time. The game has three phases, after each of which a scoring takes place. Each phase consists of a variable number of turns, until every area on the island part is occupied. Each turn begins by randomly setting up the market for the turn. On the market players take turns purchasing three different DNA that is coloured glass beads and dinosaur tiles, which show the type and amount of DNA needed to rescurrect the dinosaur. Anytime a player has everything he needs for resurrection he pays the DNA and places a dinosaur of his colour on an empty area.<br/><br/>Players score points for not only the dinosaurs they rescurrected, but also by having their dinosaurs on adjacent areas.

The succession of events is known, after a few games: but the trick is that what the professor describes happens in the same area where the spaceship pawn is at the moment, so the strategy is to get near to it (or to move it in the most advantageous spot).<br/>The game sold about 32.000 copies in the first year. Authors are Andrea Angiolino, Fabrizio Casa, Luca Giuliano, Massimo Casa, Stefano Giusti and Marco Bardella of the C.UnS.A., or Cooperativa Un Sacco Alternativa: a Roman group of designers. When the game went into print, the publisher cut the names to three since he thought they were too many and erased the name of the team because a company could not be considered an author under its standards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Daimyo's Fall - Dice Tuners is a fast-paced anime combat game for 2-4 players. Recruit the best warriors and fight in close quarter battles against multiple opponents.<br/><br/>Choose your guard and counter the attacks that will come from each direction. The position of players around the table actually matters, like in a real melee fight you have to raise your guard against your fearful opponents, choosing a parry maneuver&nbsp;for each incoming attack.<br/><br/>A round is divided in 3 turns, in each turn dice are rolled by the first player. There are 3 types of dice, each type representing a guard (high&gt;mid&gt;low&gt;high) and a type of action (attack, defense, sheathe).<br/><br/>Players can choose only one die per turn and they place it in one of the three directions, determining how they will parry the incoming attacks and strike back from each direction that turn.<br/><br/>The leftover die  determines the type of card that can be played that turn, but be careful: you'll need those cards to recruit new heroes in the next round, so carefully choose which ones to keep in your hand and which to play.<br/><br/>When a hero suffers a wound, the player who inflicted it gains a point. The game ends in 3 rounds. At the end of the game, the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Amallian was an amazing kingdom, with lush forests, amazing coasts, cuddly martial artists, and the best Emperor known. The one downside of living there was the constant infighting of the clans. They not only disagreed about the way the empire was built, but the way they traded with their neighbors, too.<br/><br/>The clans didn't agree on much, but the Emperor decreed that there was to be no open fighting amongst them. This &quot;peace&quot; lasted for many years. Then came the storm of all storms. Sweeping many clans away, the Emperor was lost for solutions &mdash; but then in the Osae Valley, a mist had appeared, and those who entered it were transported to a new land. The Emperor decreed that all clans should venture forth and settle their new empire.<br/><br/>As they did, the oversight was little to none...which lead to the clans competing for the favor of the Emperor by any means necessary. Now the clans of Amallian race to win the favor of the Emperor by building her Empire, trading goods, and showing the most strength on the other side!<br/><br/>In Legends of the Mist, you take on the role of a legend from one of the four clans. By rolling dice from your pool, you can work to build the Emperor's new kingdom with new plots, fight to control them, produce goods from them, and gain wealth for your clan and the kingdom. Each die type has a different frequency of letting you perform these actions. The other clans will work to undermine you every now and again and since dice are assigned in secret, your planning and foresight are important.<br/><br/>Should you complete the objectives that the Empress gave you better than anyone else, you will be rewarded as the winner of her favor!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TP Baseball gives you the opportunity to step into the shoes of your favorite team's manager and general manager and guide your team into the post-season and beyond.  Not only do you handle the on-field duties as the manager, using TP Baseball league rules lets you sign major league free agents, draft promising prospects, and make late season trades.<br/><br/>TP Baseball uses three ten-sided dice, and will be quickly picked up by the experienced tabletop manager.  For those of you new to the experience, the game can be easily understood by just sitting down and playing a few games.  Nothing beats the hands-on experience.  The dice create a three digit number from 000 to 999.   Review the two players cards after the roll.  Results of 000-499 are read on the hitter's card and 500-999 are read on the pitcher's card.  Most results are explained easily right on the card.  A few may need the use of an outside chart, but after playing the game a couple times, most of the results should become second nature.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "40 Overs is a simple card game that pits two players against each other as Sunday League cricket teams.<br/><br/>First one player bats for 40 overs, or until 10 wickets are lost, trying to score as many runs as possible.  The opponent attempts to take those 10 wickets and otherwise limit the scoring.  Players then switch roles and the player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>Each over consists of the bowling team selecting a card (from a hand of 4) then the batting team responding with a card (initially from a hand of 5, but decreasing as wickets fall).  Each card can be read either as a Batting or Bowling card, but can often only be used in a certain range of overs.<br/><br/>Bowling cards are either Fielding (cards which reduce the number of runs scored this over) or Special (cards which, for example, produce wickets or allow a player to discard and replace a hand).<br/><br/>Batting cards are similarly Runs Scored (which add runs, minus any Feilding card) or Special (which, for example, defeat wicket appeals).<br/><br/>Card distribution (44 cards total):<br/><br/>Fielding cards: 15<br/>Special Bowling cards:  29<br/><br/>Runs Scored cards:  25<br/>Special Batting cards:  19<br/><br/>",

Embrace your dark side and play the part of a monstrous Demon or join a desperate band of Exorcists attempting to banish it. Either side can win.<br/><br/>The Exorcists must resolve all Ritual cards in play to banish the Demon. This is done by playing cards to match Ritual components. They may alternatively choose to use their cards for effects to buy time and protection, but this sacrifices their action in the process.<br/><br/>They must manage their resources carefully, as their cards can be played to satisfy the requirements of Rituals, but are also needed to defend themselves against Demonic attack.<br/><br/>The Demon wins when their Demon Dice reaches 10, and each turn that passes brings them closer to their moment of victory. The Demon is more powerful than the Exorcists, taking more actions and  disrupting the Exorcists on multiple fronts.<br/><br/>Banishment is highly interactive and almost every aspect of the game can be manipulated with the right cards.<br/><br/>The Cult War expansion set adds powerful new relics to the Exorcists' arsenal, as well as foul magicks that favour the Demon.<br/><br/>If you have two copies of the Banishment base game as well as the expansion cards, you can play the Cult War variant, a 6-player game where two teams called Cults attempt to be the first to summon the dreaded Dark One.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1871, the Treaty of Versailles was signed between France and the newly established German Empire, badly shaking the balance of power which had kept Europe relatively stable since Napoleon&rsquo;s defeat in 1815. France longed for revenge against Germany. So did Austria-Hungary; yet the weakening Ottoman Empire seemed a much easier target for recovering the honour which she had so recently lost to the ascendant Germans. But Russia, too, longed to see the subject peoples of the Balkans take refuge under her own wings; and every attempt by a European power to spread her influence into the Sick Man of Europe was watched with grave concern by all. Russia, with its huge army, was also being closely monitored by Britain in central Asia, where the latter wondered what schemes this eastern giant might have planned. Had Russia intentions towards Britain&rsquo;s treasure of India? And was this new German Empire friend or foe? Would she attempt the herculean task of building a large navy to rival Britain&rsquo;s? Ultimately, Germany would abandon the less expansionist and more diplomatic realpolitik of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, and chose instead to follow the path of Bernhard von B&uuml;low&rsquo;s weltpolitik, a policy intended to establish the national honour of the German Empire across the globe. As von B&uuml;low said a quarter-century later, &ldquo;We wish to throw no one into the shade, but we demand our own place in the sun.&rdquo; This struggle for a place in the sun would ultimately lead to the catastrophe of World War One, drawing all five powers into its maelstrom and destroying three of them in the process.<br/><br/>Weltpolitik portrays the rising tensions and dwindling war-fuse which burned among the European powers from 1871 until the time of the First World War. However, a world war is not necessarily your objective. Your goal is simple: outrank your rivals in national honour with or without the Great War breaking out. To do so, you must spread your influence into the four areas over which the European powers were quarreling during this time: the declining Ottoman Empire, central Asia, the Far East, and Africa. You must also build sizeable armies and navies in the event that war does break out. If you are leading in national honour, then this might be the right opportunity for you to initiate the catastrophic conflagration. But if your ambitious schemes isolate you diplomatically, you just might find yourself friendless when war begins, and subsequently witness the collapse of your empire. Perhaps you should play the honest broker, and try to prevent the Great War. Have you the wisdom of a Bismarck, or the incompetence of a Kaiser Wilhelm II?<br/><br/>Weltpolitik is a card-driven game inspired by the award-winning two-player game Twilight Struggle, but playable with up to five players. Given the radically different settings of the two games, you will find familiar mechanics considerably transformed, as well as some completely new ones. Naturally, the events portrayed on the cards are very different: the German Fleet Acts, the Boer War, the Boxer Rebellion, the founding of the Indian National Congress and the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand are all here, as well as many, many more. Players can even form alliances and host European Congresses to both lessen tensions and deal with matters they&rsquo;d very much like to avoid.<br/><br/>Weltpolitik can be played in a variety of ways. Given that new players will have no familiarity with the cards, each Decade can be played as a One-Decade mini-game simply to learn about the cards available for that Decade (for novices, such a game might take a little more than an hour). Once players are comfortable with the cards for the first two Decades, they may want to try a two-Decade game consisting of Decades One and Two; and when Decade Three is mastered, a three Decade game, and so on. With experienced players of Weltpolitik, a full five-Decade campaign game can be anticipated to last from potentially three to three and a half hours. The five Decade game will last much longer for players who don&rsquo;t know the cards! Alternatively, players may play a multi-Decade game beginning in a Decade other than Decade One; and there are two shorter one-region scenarios available as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Defiance - The Battle of Xuan Loc (11 April 1975) - Combat Series No. 2 - A Vietnam War Game (designer Perry Moore) by Swedish Game Production.<br/><br/>Defiance - The Battle of Xuan Loc includes a three-color map, 130 die cut counters, typeset rules and charts, and ziplock bags for counter storage. The game achieves accurate simulation by means of special rules like: Close Assault, Cluster Bombs, Off-Board Artillery, ARVN desertion, CRT shifts for Leader and Armor units, Optional 'what if' Order of Battle, Air Support, Artillery Barrages. Also included are a Historical Background and Designer's Notes for full playing enjoyment of this unusual battle of the Vietnam War.<br/><br/>During the closing days of the 1975 North Vietnamese Offensive, four NVA divisions were pitted against a small ARVN force, dug-in astride the rugged hills near Xuan Loc - a town of 30,000 people located along one of the key roads into the capital, Saigon. Advancing in strength down the coastal highway were the NVA 5th, 6th, 7th and 341st Divisions, massed with artillery and T-54 tanks. Defiantly blocking their way were the ARVN 18th Divisions and 3rd Tank Brigade. The battle which followed was unique in many respects for the Vietnam War, involving units of divisional size, devastatingly effective ARVN airpower and sophisticated US-made CBU-55 Cluster Bombs. For nearly 2 weeks, the ARVN held Xuan Loc and counterattacked against impossible odds. It was an engagement describable only as 'heroic and gallant' on the part of the South Vietnamese defenders, being one of the few places where the ARVN, though outnumbered, stood and fought with a tenacity which stunned their opponents. So epic was the stand of the ARVN that the entire South Vietnamese Army, previously routed, grew confident again. News reporters were flown in from around the world to witness the battlefield strewn with NVA corpeses, repelled in assault after assault with heavy losses. Game Rating (Based on independent test group results): Complexity - Moderate, Balance - 50% - 50%, Realism - 7, Excitement - 9, Overall - 6.5, Play Time - 3-4 hours.<br/><br/>The end of the Vietnam War - April 1975. The US have pulled out and the South's armies are crumbling before the North's advance.<br/>The components are functional with a 17&quot; by 12&quot; map and about 100 counters. The map is in 4 colours and shows the area around Xuan Loc including Bien Hoa Airbase. The counters are light green for ARVN and dark green for NVA. each counter is a Regiment or Brigade.<br/>The rules are detailed and cover most aspects of modern war without getting too complicated. Special rules include Leaders, Headquarters, Fortifications, ARVN Desertions, Cluster Bombs etc. <br/>From the Designer's Notes: the game &quot;is truly a slugfest.

        "description": "Boots uses an interactive game turn in which both players command an overall force made up of several sub-commands. During each turn, players alternate picking &quot;command markers,&quot; which designate the sub-command within their force they may then use to conduct operations. The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, may conduct attacks with the units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &quot;heroism markers&quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.<br/><br/>In this game, each turn represents one month, and each hexagon on the map represents 10 miles across. US Army units, as well as those of the Mexican Federales forces, are battalions, regiments and brigades. Pancho Villa's units each represent correspondingly sized groups of combatants, with about 80 to 120 individuals per strength point.<br/><br/>Low complexity, 280 counters.<br/><br/>Published in S&amp;T 242 - May 2007<br/><br/>",

Twelve market tokens worth 4-8 are placed at random on the empty rectangular area representing Amsterdam. A single canal rings the city.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player draws one of their influence tokens at random, then either:<br/><br/><br/>    Places it on an empty space on the board, or<br/>    Discards it, then places as many canals (wooden sticks) on the board as the number on that token.<br/><br/><br/>When an area is enclosed that contains one or two market tokens, whoever has the most influence in this area gains all of the tokens as well as wealth (VP tokens) equal to the number of spaces in this area. If players are tied for influence, then they sum the market tokens and area wealth and split this, rounding down.<br/><br/>When all markets are controlled, or all players are out of tiles, or all canals have been placed, the game ends and the wealthiest player wins.<br/><br/>Canals of Amsterdam includes two variants, one in which each player starts with a single canal in reserve that can be used at any time on their turn and another in which players each have a hand of three influence tokens.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/><br/>世界遺産アムステルダムの運河を建築し、街を分割して支配するゲーム。分割されたエリア内で市場マスが１～２マスになればエリアが確定し、その段階でより大きな影響力をエリア内に及ぼしていればエリア内市場と土地を支配できる。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Best estimates today have it that the war in Europe most likely would have continued for about 24 months after February 1944 had it not been for the cumulative effects of the Allied strategic aerial offensive against the Germans. That means the war was most likely shortened somewhere between 13 and 15 months by the effects of that campaign. We say &quot;most likely&quot; and &quot;somewhere between&quot; because we can't be more certain. That is, starting at the end of 1944, the Western Allied and Soviet ground advances began to add their resource-denying effects to the successes being scored by the bombers. Where precisely the effects of the one effort picked up and the other left off is, and will likely always remain, a matter of debate.<br/><br/>We can, however, use that December 1944 cut off date to our advantage in this game. We know for certain that prior to that time any collapse of the German war effort would mostly certainly have been due to the bombings' effects. If the &quot;Bomber Barons&quot; were to prove they could win a war with their planes alone, we can now see they had to do it by that date. Thus the would-be Bomber Barons in today's wargame hobby must also bring their efforts to fruition by that time in the game in order to win.<br/><br/>In general, each &quot;game turn&quot; represents the cumulative effects of one month of aerial operations. Note, though, Game Turn 3 represents two calendar months. That's because a large portion of US aircraft strength was drawn away from this campaign during that time in order to assist in the battlefield preparation for the D-Day landings. There are a maximum of 10 game turns to each campaign.<br/><br/>The large-size, fully iconic, counters included with the game (176 total), are by famed artist Nicolas Eskubi. They represent air groups and wings, along with German FLAK brigades and divisions. Aside from all the formations historically involved in the campaign, an extended German Me-262 order of battle is included. That will allows players to determine, once and for all, exactly how many of those remarkable planes it would've taken to have finally and fully stopped the American onslaught.<br/><br/>Each large hex on the map represents 33.33 miles (54 Km) from side to opposite side. The game is of intermediate complexity, is intended for two players, and takes about six hours to complete.<br/><br/>",

This is the perfect chance to raid the kitchen! Help Big Pig and friends eat all of the delicious food! If the family comes back before the food is eaten, they&rsquo;ll surely stop the feast. Got to make it quick!<br/><br/>Each player picks a character to play as and puts the character card in front of them. Then the team of players pick a meal based on difficulty (breakfast for easy, lunch for medium, and dinner for hard). Each meal is a different board with four foods displayed that the players must consume. Each of the foods has 16 tiles that are placed on top of them and each tile has a value. When playing the game, players will munch the foods and be able to remove a total value of tiles equal to their character's hunger value.<br/><br/>Each round a &quot;bad things&quot; card is played. These are events that make the food harder to eat either by having a one time effect or an effect that lasts the whole round. Then the players take their turns, taking one action at a time, and going clockwise. Each character card has 4 actions. To take an action, place a &quot;snack token&quot; on one of the four available actions that does not already have a snack token, and take the action described in that spot. These actions can involve things like munching the food, obtaining an item card for a bonus, or playing a card. When munching a food, remove the tiles from the food board and place them on your character card. The food tiles munched can be used to boost your action cards later. Each action card has a unique effect if it is boosted. After a player takes their turn by performing an action, that player draws action cards up to their hand size.<br/><br/>Play continues until each player has performed their four actions for the turn. Then the car moves forward one space on the game board. If the car reaches the house, the family has returned and stops the feast! All of the players lose. If the car didn't reach the house, players play another round. If at any point the players consume all of the food tiles off of one food, they receive a bonus card that effects each player and gives them a boost. If The players consume every food tile on each of the foods on the whole board, the players immediately win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

You play a cast-off thesis project from Franken State University, left to fend for yourself in the Dark Woods. Upgrade your appendages by Scavenging from the woods or Attacking your fellow monsters, learning language as you go. Once you&rsquo;re strong enough, attack the Abomination to win! Words optional.<br/><br/>You start with five cards, a head, torso, legs and two arms.  Each round you&rsquo;ll choose whether to spend the Stitches you&rsquo;ve earned to Scavenge a new part from a common pot, or to Attack your fellow monsters and take one of their limbs instead. As you attack each other you&rsquo;ll learn new words, giving you more options than just growling and grunting to communicate.  Once your monster is strong enough, attack the Abomination to try and win the game, pulling in any other players who have words in common. But beware! The King will fight back&hellip;<br/><br/>Stitches uses a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic for combat that is easy to understand but can lead to some surprisingly deep decisions. Players decide whether to Scavenge or Attack simultaneously, then resolve their chosen action in turn order.  The semi-co-op mechanic of teams building as the game continues sets a natural limit to how each game lasts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The young farmers in Tic Tac Moo have their hands full driving the farm animals onto the meadow. On top of that, the animals are very status-conscious as to who is allowed to enter the grassland next to them, and if too many animals of one kind stand together, it can easily happen that some will go astray. Under these circumstances, how are you supposed to gather enough of them?<br/><br/>In more detail, each player has a set of 24 animal tokens that are shuffled at the start of the game. The game board is an 8x8 grid with the corners cut off; the outer rows on all sides are neutral space, while the inner section has four 3x3 fields, two each in the color of one of the players. To start the game, players place two of their animal tokens face up on their farmhand spaces and a third animal token in their barn. They then take turns placing four starting animal tokens on the board, one in each of their colored fields.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must place both tokens held by farmhands onto empty spaces in the grid &mdash; whether in their color, the opponent's color, or neutral territory &mdash; and they must place them adjacent to tokens showing the same animal as the one in their barn. If their barn has a pig token, for example, then they must place both tokens next to pig tokens already on the board, whether orthogonally or diagonally. If while doing so they create a line of three or more of the same animal tokens, they remove all of these animal tokens from the board and keep them except for the token that they just placed.<br/><br/>If a player manages to fill one of their colored 3x3 grids with two pairs of each of the four animals (and a third animal of some type), then they immediately win. Alternatively, a player can win immediately by capturing at least twelve animals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "About Map Maker:<br/>In the fantasy world of sword and sorcery, every adventurer knows that what they need when they are adventuring in the overworlds and exploring the dungeons below, is a detailed map that helps them navigate the area and points out all the dangers they may Encounter. In this game, you are a Map Maker, exploring the depths of the area&rsquo;s most dangerous dungeons in the pursuit of documenting every creature and dungeon boss you meet, and hopefully defeat, along the way. Then, when you are safe and sound back at your humble abode, you will fill in the details on the included Wild Map for future adventurers to reference. Be careful out there! This is not an easy task.<br/><br/>Map Maker is divided into two phases; dungeon delving and boss fighting. In the dungeon delving phase, you will choose and resolve a variety of Encounters according to your Hero's stats for each level you descend, as you venture deeper into the dungeons, until you meet the boss. During the boss fighting phase, you will fight the dungeon boss following special instructions on each boss sheet. Each boss has unique features, skills and actions that you have to use different strategies to overcome, if you want to prevail.<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/>Map Maker is for you and up to three of your friends to become the Heroes of the story, and to delve deep into a dungeon until you discover the final boss.

Each map marks six dungeons with Roman numerals. Once you have defeated all six dungeons and recorded all the details on the Wild Map, your quest is complete. And remember, the brave Hero who delivers the final blow to the dungeon boss gets to put their name on the Wild Map to be remembered for all eternity. So, fight hard, intrepid adventurers!<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>This game has three versions. They are the physical version, a full color PDF version, and printer friendly PDF version.

In Merchants of the Federation, players take control of the businesses on the frontier who work to develop their enterprise and profit margins. They must decide where to build and invest, and how to profit from their ventures. Rewards come with great risks as fortunes are made and lost along the Federation border.<br/><br/>Each player manages a Federation company in the Star Fleet Universe in Y102 immediately following the border declaration by the Federation Council. The map represents the region between the Federation Starbase and the Klingon border. At the start of the game the locations and resources of the map are unknown and must be surveyed before they can be exploited and colonized.<br/><br/>The goal is to grow these companies by selling newly found resources, establishing colonies, and managing production on distant worlds. During the course of the game tension with the Klingon Empire increases, and players must learn to manage risk for their companies under the cloud of looming conflict between the two juggernauts. As war produces danger, it also presents opportunity.<br/><br/>Companies have starships which are used to explore and reveal the resources of the board, and players need to determine where the money from the frontier is best made. As the board develops players will build facilities to produce additional resources for sale in the constantly fluctuating market, to fulfill contracts available from the Federation, or plant new Federation colonies.<br/><br/>In the current playtest format the game contains a map, resource market, tension track, a variety of starships (Standard Freighter, Large Freighter, Heavy Freighter, Prime Trader, Priority Transport), an encounter deck (for ships exploring the furthest reaches of the border), a Federation Contract Deck (which controls market changes and available Federation work), and a number of resource cubes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In ツクルテン (Tsukuruten), you score points in the round if you can add up the eight cards in front of you to sum to 10. This challenge is complicated by the deck containing eight cards each of numbers 1-7, with half the cards being red and half blue &mdash; which means almost every set of eight cards will sum to more than 10!<br/><br/>The trick is that certain combinations of cards are worth less than their face value:<br/><br/><br/>    Three cards of the same color and number = 0<br/>    Three red cards in sequence are worth only the highest number in the sequence, so a red 345 = 5.<br/>    Three blue cards in sequence are worth only the lowest number in the sequence, so a blue 345 = 3.<br/><br/><br/>Each player starts with a hand of eight cards. On a turn, draw a card from the deck, then (if you don't have a sum of 10) discard a card in a row in front of you; alternatively, you can pick up the discarded card of the player before you, add two cards from your hand to this card, play it beside you as a special sequence (a &quot;get&quot;), then discard a card. The cards in that &quot;get&quot; cannot be altered for the remainder of this deal, but they still count as being in your hand toward the desired sum of 10.<br/><br/>When someone does reach a sum of 10, whether by drawing a card or picking up a discarded card, the round ends, with players scoring points based on the combinations they've made and certain conditions in their hand. Having only one 7 in hand is worth 1 point, for example, as is having four red and four blue cards, whereas having all cards of one color or two triples are each worth 3 points. You also score points for being the one to end the round.<br/><br/>Play enough rounds so that each player starts a hand twice, then whoever has the most points wins. Alternatively, if a player collects a &quot;God Ten&quot; &mdash; that is, all eight 2s or all eight 5s, each of which sums to 10 &mdash; they win the game instantly!<br/><br/>",

Try to get food from the same family and with the most flies, and pass your inedible trashes to the opposite gang.<br/><br/>You can play as Birds of anarchy, Rocket Racoon, Kitty Blinders or Bloody Rats gang. Each gang is composed with 3 characters: a petty thief, a collector and a scout ; they have different distribution of actions, in those: dig (return/move a trash in the dumpster), collect (take a trash, visible or not, in the dumpster), give a trash to a player, steal a trash from a player.<br/><br/>Trashes are cards with trash bags drawn on the back, they are all spread hidden in an unorganized mountain of garbage, and you can only interact with the one where the bags are not covered by other cards. So you may dig a card and move it on top of a nice trash to block opponents from taking it.<br/><br/>Every character comes with 4 cards numbered between 1 and 12, with two different sets of actions. At every round, each player get to choose one of them and put it hidden on the table. Then the boss (the player with most trashes in their hand) get to call every number in ascending order, then players called (starting from the left of the boss, if many) choose one of the two sets of actions to play.<br/><br/>At the end of every round, when everybody played, teammates can exchange up to 3 trashes (to assemble families, or muddy the waters), then the boss and the rookie (the player with the least trashes) are defined for the next round.<br/><br/>At every moment, players can communicate freely and openly, but might feel the need to get some common codes to avoid disclosing strategic information to the opponents gangs. The two forbidden actions are: showing your cards, and whisper to a player.<br/><br/>At the end of the 4 rounds, players reveal their collected trashes and count their points individually (number of flies, plus 2 for each item in a family, starting from the second) then sum them up to have team score.<br/><br/>",

Pawns are moved clockwise along the track according to the value of the card played, unless the card allows you to do something else (move backwards, split the value, swap spaces, put another pawn into play, etc.) Players are dealt 4 cards, and then have to swap one of the cards with their opponent (instead of their partner). The winner is the player who first get all his pawns (two set of three) placed in the target area.<br/><br/>Differences from the original edition include:<br/>1) You do not play as a pair, but only 1-vs-1<br/>2) You swap a card with your opponent instead of your partner. This is very different, since your choice directly influence what your opponent can do, and your opponent also knows one of your cards.<br/>3) You have to get 2 sets of 3 pawns around the track (instead of one set of 4 pawns.<br/>4) Many of the cards have changed, now the highest card is 10 instead of a 14, and there are new abilities on some of the cards.<br/>5) The track is a bit smaller, 40 space around instead of 56 spaces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If Dragons Fight: China vs. Taiwan in the Near Future (IDF), is a &quot;what if&quot; simulation of the fighting that could occur across that island, within the timeframe of the next five or so years, if the mainlanders decide political or geostrategic conditions have evolved to where they must resolve the issue finally and by force. Such a situation would most likely occur if either or both the following two developments took place: 1) the Taiwanese officially declared their independence; and/or 2) the mainland Chinese learned the islanders had gotten, or were about to get, nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>This is a two-player wargame of low-intermediate complexity that posits the critical ground-phase of this might-be war as lasting no longer than about two weeks. Such a campaign would most likely have to be preceded by a roughly equal period during which the mainlanders would use aero-naval bombardment to neutralize the ships and planes of the defenders--a long established prerequisite for oceanic invasions of this type.<br/><br/>At the start of the game that preliminary step is presumed to have been completed. The follow-on ground war would likely be supremely violent in regard to how wars have recently been judged, but would have to be limited as to its duration. After a total crisis--aero-naval and ground--of about a month, it's most likely some kind of negotiated settlement would have to be put in place (barring the complete conquest of Taiwan) due to the inescapable economic, political and social disarray both sides would be put through by such a supreme effort.<br/><br/>In sum, then, the Chinese player is attempting to seize as much of the urban area of Taiwan as he can, while his opponent is seeking to contain the invaders' beachhead in as small an area as possible. The operational goal of the Chinese is to seize enough territory to render Taiwan inoperable as an independent polity or, failing that, at least create a lodgment large enough to force the islanders to grant major concessions in order to get them to leave.<br/><br/>Though designed for two-player use, the game is easily adapted for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Both sides orders of battle are drawn from the most recent and complete unclassified sources available. Of course, the overall Chinese ground force goes way beyond the units included in the game. For this invasion, however, about the most that could be supplied would be their airborne divisions, their special forces groups, their marine brigades, their purpose-organized amphibious regular army units, and the line units of the Nanjing Military District. (Due to its proximate geographic location in relation to Taiwan, the NMD would be the higher-level headquarters most likely to be directing this operation.) The entire Taiwanese ground force order of battle--when represented at this scale within these system parameters--is included.<br/><br/>Players will quickly notice there's no possibility for non-Chinese intervention into the air or ground war in the game. That's because it's not reasonable to believe the PRC would risk a wider war by launching this operation unless they'd first managed to diplomatically isolate Taiwan, at least temporarily, while the rest of the world judged whether any aid effort was worthwhile or even viable.<br/><br/>The exception to that is in the cyberwarfare rules. In that arena of &quot;war in the cloud,&quot; it seems likely the Taiwanese would have major (though certainly still clandestine) support of many of the world's democratic governments as well as hordes of politically unaffiliated techies. Whether such efforts can prove decisive remains one of the great unanswered questions of 21st century warfare.<br/><br/>Another overarching characteristic of the game is its unforgiving combat resolution subsystem. That is, there's no possibility of retreat from battle: all combat results are sustained as strength losses. That's to reflect the fact we have here two well armed forces, both highly motivated to achieve their objectives, and both armed to the teeth with the most lethal modern weaponry available. At the same time, both militaries would be new to warfare of this intensity.<br/><br/>We're also assuming the invasion isn't being made during the monsoon season, so there are no rules for severe weather.<br/><br/>Projected Contents:<br/>One 22x34&quot; map/playing surface<br/>One sheet of 5/8&quot; mounted, die-cut playing pieces<br/>One rules book<br/>Charts and tables<br/>Dice<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>",

There are two types cards, dice cards and leprechaun cards.  The dice cards have combinations that each player must roll in order to obtain coins, such as 2 pair of a run of 4.  More coins are received if the player rolls dice combinations in one roll instead of having to roll additional times in order to obtain the desired combination.  Upon completing a dice card the player will place this card face up in front of them.  The game ends when any player completes 5 dice cards.  The first player to complete 5 dice cards also gets a bonus which makes it advantageous to complete dice cards the quickest.  The winner of the game is the person with the most coins.<br/><br/>Leprechaun cards allow players to inhibit their opponent's play or to advance their own.  These cards are played at the beginning of a player's turn.  An example is the Slicer card which allows a player to reduce the number of dice a selected opponent can roll on their next turn.  Every leprechaun card relies on the dice, so player's are never assured of their effectiveness.<br/><br/>This game truly revolves around the use of dice and a player's luck can change with just one roll!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Every year the grand arenas of Championland overflow with hopeful athletes and excited crowds. Pin your opponent three times to become a true Champion!<br/><br/>Wrestling is one of the purest competitions in Championland. This head-to-head test of each athlete's physical and mental acumen draws huge crowds who analyze every move to see who'll come out on top. The best wrestlers spend their time doing the same, knowing that even the slightest advantage might keep them on their feet.<br/><br/>In Championland: Wrestling, players take turns placing cards and guessing at their opponent&rsquo;s cards to score knockdowns. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they&rsquo;ll play a card from their hand face-up. The opponent plays a card face-down. Now the active player must guess whether the face-down card is higher than, lower than, or equal to the face-up card. Get it right and they&rsquo;ll earn a knockdown; get it wrong and their opponent takes control, playing a new card face-down and comparing it to the previously revealed card.<br/><br/>Each round continues until one player wins by either getting two knockdowns in a row OR getting a guess of &ldquo;equal&rdquo; correct. The first player to win three rounds takes the match.<br/><br/><br/>Championland is a series of standalone 18-card games which uses a single rules system for all entries, then adds individual rules for each specific game to capture the experience of that sport.<br/><br/>Every Championland game includes two 9-card decks numbered 1-9. Each player takes a deck, shuffles it, and fans it out in their hand. On a turn, they&rsquo;ll play only a single card and the card played MUST come from the furthest edge of their hand on either side. Players cannot reorder their hand, so they must make the best of the choices they have available!<br/><br/>",

The items include orange carrots, white eggs, green peas, blue fish, yellow pasta, and purple chopsticks.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns rolling a special die.  On each face of the die are two colors. The player selects one of their food items that matches one of the rolled colors, and carefully places the item into the unstable wok.  If any items fall out of the wok, the player must take those items (up to two pieces) and place them back into the wok on subsequent turns.<br/><br/>A number of &quot;tofu&quot; cubes are included that may be placed into the wok at the beginning of the game to adjust the difficulty level or compensate for the number of players.<br/><br/>",

The operation, however, hung on a slender thread: the lone supply line for the breakout ran through Avranches. Hitler and his generals recognized the weakness; the generals thought the German army in Normandy lacked the strength to take Avranches, but Hitler ordered the attack. Four panzer divisions were gathered near the ancient village of Mortain, intending to take the town and the nearby Hill 317 before driving west. In their way stood the US 30th Infantry Division. The Germans needed a rapid breakthrough, while the Americans had to buy time for reinforcements to arrive.<br/><br/>Mortain Counterattack uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>Skills:<br/>&bull; Level: Batallion<br/>&bull; Hex: 0.5 miles (0.8 km)<br/><br/>",

It's time for you to travel around the island to explore the spectacular scenery, experience the interesting traditional activities, and taste all kinds of delicious food! By careful planning, you can have your friends to pay the bills for you.<br/><br/>In Hello! Taiwan players are traveling around Taiwan by playing cards in 4 directions starting from the centered card number 8). Each card shows a destination and a serial number (from 1 to 15), which is to be placed following the ascending or descending orders. If you can't play a card with an appropriate number, then you must collect all cards in that direction and pay for the bills shown on each card. The one who spends the least travel expenses is the winner of this fruitful trip.<br/><br/>This game is inspired by the dazzling sights the designer has observed during his bicycle trip around Taiwan.

However, in the second edition the rules and game sets for 1 player will be presented.<br/><br/>The War of Races takes place in Ithilion world and 12 different races and 1 neutral race take part in it. The goal is to conquer the opponent&rsquo;s residence or to eliminate his leader from the battlefield. The game also becomes more strategic as you play on two fronts.<br/><br/>Racial Wars in not a collectible card game but thanks to random additions, the player can make his own, exclusive card deck. Each card has its own unique abilities and unrepeatable pictures.<br/><br/>Players start with only leader in front of them and build plateau of cards in front of them - some cards generate resources - different for different races - which are then used to put more powerful creatures into the table. Then, each turn the battle takes place - player who is currently attacking chooses units to attack and defending blocks their attacks with his own to protect his leader. The purpose of the game is to kill enemy leader.<br/><br/>The game is based on a fantasy world of Ithilion, which arose in author&rsquo;s and his coworkers&rsquo; minds. If you want to know the new world and characters living in it, or make a new era in Ithilion world and fight at one of the races&rsquo; side, join the Racial Wars community and create with us new days of Ithilion world.<br/><br/>&quot;Flight over the desert&quot; is a battle set for Racial Wars game, in which there are two 55-card decks of Savands and Dragons races.

There are no complicated rules to memorize; no plethora of numbers, tables and charts to study, analyze and confuse the players. Instead, players must concentrate their energies on implementing the sound military principles of maneuver and attack to defeat their opponent. Emphasis is placed on decision making ability and on the players' skill in properly coordinating the actions of their various units. There are no &quot;tricks&quot; to be learned in this game.<br/><br/>SQUARES - The Civil War Battle Game contains no luck or chance element s; no dice, no spinners, no chance cards. All results are based purely on the individual player's decisions made throughout the course of the game. Players will win or lose based on their ability to outwit their opponent. You won't get lucky in this game; unless your opponent makes a mistake.......(first).<br/><br/>",

Some robots fly, some explode, some push, some create clones, etc. For three rounds each player will simultaneously select up to three robots to charge onto the game board from a dock that attaches to one edge of a game board.  The robots are given a power token which specifies how many spaces it can move and a priority token which specifies when a robot will move.  If you've successfully outguessed your opponent, you'll be able to claim the center of the board and score more points.  The team that has scored the most points at the end of three rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/>By the year 2534, inefficient, unreliable human players of team sports have been replaced by machines, maximizing enjoyment for all.  To take advantage of the machines&rsquo; capabilities, new Robosports have been invented.<br/><br/>The third most popular sport on planet Earth after SPACECAR racing and Clone Professional Wrestling is RoboUltimateMechaBattleLeague, where the controllers try to program their team of robots to seize the middle of the playing field in three rounds of exciting robotic combat. To win a RUMBL, you must carefully choose among the special abilities of your robots, place them for maximum impact, anticipate your opponent&rsquo;s moves, and ration your team&rsquo;s power strategically.

Each word has a number, from 1 to 6. Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;).<br/><br/>Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &quot;explainer&quot; must change every turn. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this Decktet trick-taking game, you're a hermit who tries to avoid having people follow you home. So are all of your opponents.<br/><br/>The daily life of the hermits is represented by tricks of cards, and there will typically be more than one trick in play at a time. The goal is to avoid taking tricks with personality cards in them. Tricks that don't have personalities in them don't matter one way or the other.<br/><br/>The above description is from the Decktet Book, where the game first appeared.<br/><br/>Hermit is a game akin to Hearts where players are attempting to avoid taking cards that are worth points. Rather than a single suit being avoided, Hermit requires that you do not win tricks which contain &quot;personality&quot; cards, one of the three sub-types of cards in the Decktet, which represent a person following you home and thus ruining your perfect life of solitude.<br/><br/>Regardless of the number of players, tricks are played open to the table. On a player's turn they must add a card from their hand to a trick with the requirement that the card being played shares at least one suit with the last played card on that trick. If they cannot meet that requirement they must use a card to start a new trick. If the card they play is the highest rank in the trick the entire trick moves in front of them. Thus any new tricks always start in front of the player opening them.<br/><br/>When a fourth card is added to a trick it is &quot;closed&quot; and the cards are captured by whomever the trick is in front of. If on a player's turn there are no available tricks, including the first turn of the game, each player simultaneously starts a new trick and that player then takes their turn, in effect allowing them to play two cards in a row. When the last player places their last card any unclosed tricks are discarded and each personality card taken counts its rank for scoring with Crowns being rank 10.<br/><br/>When one player reaches a predetermined score, typically 66 or 100, or a certain number of deals are completed the game is over and the player with the fewest points is the loneliest and thus the winner.<br/><br/>Special rules exist regarding Aces and Crowns as well as a Shoot the Moons/Suns variant, a &quot;House Party&quot; variant, and rules for 2-player Hermit games which incorporates a &quot;Cottage&quot; and laying off throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

To conquer North Africa, Italian and German troops would have to take the island. To hold on in Africa and turn back the rising tide of evil, the British-Maltese garrison would have to hold out against overwhelming odds.<br/><br/>Island of Death is a game based on German and Italian plans to capture the strategic island, a battle that never actually took place. Now Fortress Malta extends the game to look at other alternative plans and defenses. It is not playable by itself; Island of Death is required to enjoy the scenarios presented in Fortress Malta.<br/><br/>New variations include:<br/><br/>The 1940 Italian plan to invade Malta. With a single division and a handful of Libyan paratroopers, Air Marshal Italo Balbo proposed a radical strike at the outbreak of war. While the invading force was slender, so was the defense.<br/><br/>Mercury over Malta. The German plan to strike Malta instead of Crete in May 1941, with 7th Flieger Division.<br/><br/>Alternate Defenders. The attackers did not have a complete idea of the defenders awaiting them on Malta; we give you variable defenses to re-create this uncertainty.<br/><br/>Alternate Attackers. Axis planners had numerous options available to them, and you get to try them out: additional German paratroopers, another Italian division, captured Soviet tanks in German service, and more.<br/><br/>Plus the book includes looks at Italian and German planning for the Malta invasion, the British garrison and Malta's place in World War II history as well as historical background and design notes. With 420 (!) new laser-cut playing pieces, this turns a small game into a major study of the invasion of Malta, with vast re-play opportunities.<br/><br/>",

In the game, you will control the Persian forces and must fight the small band of Spartans warriors who are blocking your path at the Thermopylae pass in 480 BC. All units on the board are represented by dice which are rotated to show their current strength. You goal is to eliminate all the Spartan units so that Xerxes army can use the pass and continue their invasion of Greece.<br/><br/>The game uses a simplified Command and Colors system similar to C&amp;C Ancients or The Great War. Each turn you will draw two cards and choose one to use to command certain troops on the board and one to use for its tactical event. Each card also has a Spartan Event, which will modify the way they fight and give them advantages against your troops.<br/><br/>The game is played using a total of 9 cards, 16 dice, and 2 cubes. One card contains the map for the game, another the turn and status tracks, and the other seven cards contain the game's activations and events. Each of those card has three sections on it 1.) Persian Command 2.) Persian Tactics and 3.) Spartan Event. You will only need to look at the relevant event for the current phase of the game.<br/><br/>Each turn is played out in a series of phases.<br/>1. Card Draw Phase<br/>2. Spartan Event Phase<br/>3. Tactics Phase<br/>4. Command Phase<br/>5. Spartan Attack Phase<br/>6. Victory or Loss Check Phase<br/>7. End of Day Phase<br/><br/>Despite the small number of components and short playing time, the game presents a challenging experience and interesting historical narrative for this famous battle. Can you beat the historical result and lead your Persian soldiers to victory over the Greeks with minimal Persian casualties? Or will your soldiers get massacred by the Spartan war machine?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Farm fresh produce is in higher demand than ever! There&rsquo;s just one problem. Well, several. Higher demand means more yay-hoos trying their hand at the soiled science. There are also rampant dust storms, errant robotic threshers, and...FrankenCrops? No worry. As they say, the early bird gets the worm, and any taters attached to that worm.<br/><br/>Farmageddon is a game of skillful hand management for 2-4 players that takes 30 minutes to play. Choose when to plant, what to fertilize, and with a little luck, you'll be the master of the farmers' markets when the dust settles.<br/><br/>The Farm Fresh Edition of Farmageddon brings several changes to the farm and is the best way yet to get your hands dirty. In addition to beautiful new illustrations and a brand-new layout for the cards, we've used our years of experience to make this the best looking and playing version of Farmageddon ever. For veteran Farmageddon players, the gameplay updates include removing fields, which allows players to stay involved in every turn, and allows for more planting strategies. The FrankenCrops and Farmer cards have been revised or completely re-imagined to be more to be more balanced, more interesting, and to allow for more creative play.<br/><br/>There's never been a better time to have a weird day at the farm.<br/><br/>-Publisher&rsquo;s Description<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This pure abstract strategy game is a relatively unknown work by Sid Sackson. Similar in some ways to his 1981 Spiel des Jahres winner, Focus, it is available commercially in a German edition, but can be played with materials improvised from a chessboard and checkers.<br/><br/>From the translation: The players take alternate turns of up to five segments, trying to move game pieces from their home squares over the opposing goal line, in order to score points. After the first segment of a turn, only towers made of two game pieces may be moved. Each tower is broken down during its move, and one of its pieces may be used to build a new tower on another square. Intelligent use of this move technique can lead to &quot;nuclear chain reactions&quot;, in which up to five towers are involved. There must never be more than one tower on the board at one time. Any tower on the board must be moved during the following turn segment by the player whose piece is on top. The game ends with the achievement of an agreed-upon number of points.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1989 in a tiny cardboard box by Ferdinand de Cassan. In 1990 it was published by Hexagames in their &quot;Exklusiv&quot; series, and later (1993?) by Abacus in their very similar Abacus wood box series.<br/><br/>",

Now it is 1948 and Germany and Japan are about to fight it out for control of the Indian subcontinent. The USA is on Japan&rsquo;s side in the conflict.<br/><br/>The maps go from Turkey and Egypt to Burma. Ground units are divisions, capital ships are shown individually, and air units are about 30 planes each. The rules state that all three types of combat (air, land, naval) are represented equally and there is a form of programmed instruction here in that there is a separate naval and ground game, with the relevant air rules being included in each.<br/><br/>One of the more innovative rules that I remember reading was that combat was preformed in-hex.

The Wordmeister reads a Faux&bull;Cabulary card out loud, e.g., &quot;The compulsion to pop bubblewrap&quot;, then each player creates a word using 1-3 of his cubes &ndash; perhaps &quot;Bust-O-Ific&quot; &ndash; and conceals the word in a plastic holder. The Wordmeister mixes the words in their plastic holders (so that she doesn't know who created which word), reveals them one-by-one, then awards the card to whoever submitted the word that (in her mind) best matches the definition.

Many brave warriors and the heroic knights are trying to dash out the terrifying beast, alas, with no result! A clever plan is needed for such a monster. Shoemaker Skub just came up with this one.<br/><br/>Place the cardboard dragon in the middle of the table, then place the cardboard knights on his tail. Now, the goal of the game is to tilt the figurine to the surface the game is played on. The model works like a two-arm lever. Under certain load on the head side it plummets to the table.<br/><br/>Go on and help the artful craftsman to implement his plan! On your turn:<br/><br/>1. Roll the dice.<br/>2. The result of the roll allows you to take off one knight from the dragon&rsquo;s tail or to put an artificial domestic animal (like cow or sheep stuffed with tar and sulfur) into the dragon&rsquo;s mouth.<br/>3. By adding or removing figurines, you attempt to plummet the dragon to the table. If you managed to do so, you win! You may imagine that the monster &mdash; like in the legend &mdash; begins to drink water from the Vistula river&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Light Fires! Burn Stuff! Mess With Your pals!<br/><br/>Hot Garbage is a strategic, punchy card game for people who like burning stuff and causing mayhem. Ignite your burn pits and torch cards for points, but watch out: your opponent will try to stop you by any means necessary!<br/><br/>The goal in Hot Garbage is to be the first player to score 10 points - primarily by playing wood to your burn slots, lighting fires, and burning cards over a timed countdown until they can be scored. Card abilities also throw chaos into the mix, as players seek to improve their chances of scoring while also hampering their opponents through mischievous counter abilities.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn, during the Fire Upkeep phase, you rotate any active fire cards you control 90 degrees clockwise, reducing their burn time by one. When a fire burns out successfully AND a card has been placed on that fire (following specific rules), that fire burns out and the burning card is discarded and scored.<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, you have 3 action points that can be spent to draw cards, or play cards. Every card can be played in one of four different ways:<br/><br/>     To add wood to a burn slot or existing fire.<br/>     To ignite a fire in a burn slot containing wood.<br/>     To be added to a burning fire to begin burning it for points.<br/>     To trigger the card's ability.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of your turn, you'll draw back up to five cards.<br/><br/>The game heats up quickly, however, as opponents play counter abilities to try to stop you (and volleys of interrupts and counters fly back and forth in delightful chaos).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of one of the 5 space agencies, and in his turn can perform two of the 9 possible actions, such as developing the agency on the technology tree, launching a rocket, conducting research, placing buildings, or sabotage.<br/><br/>The game board is a model of the Solar System, consisting of 5 movable rings. On each ring there are successive objects of the Solar System, and the rings are divided into such numbers of squares, that rotating each of the rings by 1 square per round, the speed of planets and rockets on their orbits around the Sun is maintained according to Kepler's law!<br/><br/>Once all players have made their move, we rotate each ring and the positions of the planets and rockets change. This means that players, in order to optimize their missions and not waste valuable time, must learn to predict the future position of planets and start planning rocket launches in advance, just like real space agencies.<br/><br/>Development tree is divided into three branches: space tourism, base construction and sabotage. Players have to manage their budget on an ongoing basis, so they don't run out of funds at the crucial moment of the space race. In addition, each of the space agencies: USA, Russia, Europe, China and Japan, has its own unique bonus.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Sengoku Domino (戦国ドミノ), you want to dominate two regions of the battlefield to win. Each region of the battlefield is resolved in turn, so you must fight in them one at a time by placing domino tiles that represent your army's strength.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player shuffles their colored domino army tiles face down, then draws a hand of five tiles, keeping them behind their screen. On a turn, each player reveals one domino, with the strength of a domino equalling the summed numbers on it. Whoever played the weakest domino places it into the region first, then the player of the next weakest domino places that, etc. In the case of a tie, the tied dominos are placed after all other dominoes that turn.<br/><br/>The region under question is a 5x5 space on the playing area, with the central square being occupied by a castle. No domino can be placed over the castle. The first domino placed in a region must be placed adjacent to a castle, and each subsequent domino placed can be placed adjacent to the castle or next to any other domino as long as they have the same number in at least one adjacent edge. For example, a 2|5 tile could be placed next to a 4|5 tile, or the tiles could be placed perpendicular to one another as long as the 5s are adjacent.<br/><br/>Once all the dominoes are placed, the next turn begins with players refilling their hands, then playing another domino. A player cannot play outside the 5x5 area unless it's impossible to play all of the domino inside it.<br/><br/>Once the region is filled, you consider the total strength of each player in each row and column in the region, using colored markers to indicate who has the highest total. If two colors are tied for highest, then they're ignored and the next highest color wins the row or column. If the totals are completely tied, then no one wins that row or column. Whoever wins the most rows and columns wins the region, placing a marker of their color on the castle. Again, in the case of a tie, they're ignored and the next highest color wins the region!<br/><br/>Whoever first wins two regions wins the game. If in a four-player game each player wins one region, then the tie is broken by whoever won the most rows and columns.<br/><br/>",

After rolling the color-die, a player can move any of the two trains to halt on the color shown. The fun is to jump the pieces into the wagons as trains pass by your start point, and after a round trip to get them off at the home point.  Only one passenger per compartment is allowed. There are also bypasses on the board. The unlucky passengers stopping there, must get off the train and wait for the next free wagon available which passes the loading point. Although it is luck-driven, players must decide which of the 2 trains to move in order to get closer to their homes or to hinder opponents.

        "description": "1864 was truly the year of decision in the War of Secession. While the North needed only one more year to break the South's back and end the rebellion, at the time the military situation did not appear to be so promising. After three years of war the Union had not subdued much of the rebellious South. The Union held enclaves along the coast, all of Tennessee and some other scattered holdings, and it controlled the Mississippi River. However, the bulk of Southern territory, especially the deep South, was untouched. The principal Southern armies in Georgia and Virginia were as strong as ever. The South had shown its ability to wage war in spite of military reverses and blockade.<br/><br/>1864 - Year of Decision is a board game simulation of the decisive campaigns that brought the American Civil War to its violent conclusion. Players assume the roles of Abraham Lincoln or Jefferson Davis and their senior military advisors. Players operate armies, corps and divisions in military regions that reflect the maneuver limitations experienced by the belligerents. The combat units are rated for troop quality, leaders' tactical abilities, leaders' initiative and command span. The game compels players to focus on the interrelationship between military operations and their political consequences. Victory is determined by political points resulting from military successes and failures.<br/><br/>Each game turn of 1864 - Year of Decision represents five days of the campaign. Move your playing pieces representing Union and Confederate corps and headquarters from region to region accurately recreating maneuver during the Civil War. Each region consists of two districts. Assign missions to your forces by placing the units in the Attack or Defend box in each district. Units which Defend in a district can improve their defensive positions. Send your cavalry forces on raids against enemy targets. Attack to defeat your opponent's forces and capture key objectives. Headquarters can lead attacks or individual corps can attempt to attack on their own. A die roll determines if each unit succeeds in at-tacking. Resolve combat based on the sizes of the attacking and defending forces, the quality of the troops involved, the tactical rating of the commanders, supply and morale conditions, defensive positions and weather. Battle will yield casualties and prisoner losses on each side and may force a withdrawal by the loser.<br/><br/>Trace supply for your forces along rail lines to supply depots or, for the Union, to an occupied port. Units can operate away from their supply lines for short periods, but need to re-establish supply after combat. Break rail lines or devastate regions on the map to cut enemy supply. Both sides also face monthly losses due to attrition. Several optional rules allow players to increase the game's realism. Five scenarios allow players to recreate the struggle in either theater from two different starting points or to play the entire campaign.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>        Rules of Play Booklet in our easy-to-read bullet paragraph format<br/>        Player Reference Booklet with notes on the historical situation and the game's design<br/>        280 Die-Cut Playing Pieces<br/>        2 Mapsheets featuring the Eastern and Western Theaters<br/>        2 Small Mapsheets covering the approaches to Savannah and Mobile<br/>        11 Color Play Aid Cards<br/>        1 Die<br/><br/><br/>(description from Omega website)<br/><br/>",

Twelve of these conflicts ended in Burmese victory. The 1767 siege of Ayutthaya ended in the great capital&rsquo;s total destruction.

        "description": "Queen Victoria's Navy is a nautical combat war game for two players which simulates the period from 1880-1906.  The game scale is 500 meters per hex and about 5 minutes per turn.  Capital ships are modeled individually.  Complexity is medium.  Time to learn is from 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Players take the role of squadron commanders, the principal tactical leaders in the battle fleet.  As such, they are in charge of a manageable force of capital ships, generally 3-12.  Designed for 2 players, Queen Victoria's Navy is also suitable for solitaire or multiple players, each scenario taking about 1 hour to complete.<br/><br/>This game manages to blend three often contradictory goals together seamlessly: affordability, game-play, and authenticity.  The focus of the game is to recreate the conditions of a capital ship battle.  Torpedo boats, gunboats and sundry other smaller vessels have been left out of the game as they were not critical components of the Battle Fleet concept, and their inclusion would have added complexity and cost to the game.  However, thanks to the simplicity of the rules, it is an easy task to design these craft for your own games.<br/><br/>",

The block is a &quot;top-down&quot; design inspired by Greek mythology.<br/><br/>The third set of the block, Journey into Nyx, was released on May 2, 2014. It is a small set consisting of 165 cards. The set completed the cycle of ten dual-colored &quot;demigod&quot; cards that debuted in Born of the Gods, as well as the cycle of ten &quot;scry lands&quot; that premiered in the first set of Theros. The set also includes the first green/white Planeswalker, &quot;Ajani, Mentor of Heroes.&quot;<br/><br/>In addition to the block-wide mechanics, Journey Into Nyx features two new mechanics.<br/><br/>Constellation: This ability triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield under your control, providing whatever bonus is specified on the card. To make room for it, Bestow and Devotion have both been scaled back, appearing on only five cards each; per Mark Rosewater, the dilution of those mechanics also represents the storyline's conflict between gods and mortals, and the latter's disillusionment with the former.[13]<br/>Strive: this ability only appears on Instant and Sorcery spells that have targeting effects. Strive cards can have &quot;any number&quot; of targets, but the caster must pay an additional specified cost for each target beyond the first.<br/>The Monstrous ability returns, last seen in the first set of Theros, replacing Born of the Gods' Tribute.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tripods! is a competitive, strategy survival game set during a Martian invasion of Victorian London. Two to four players take control of a number of playing pieces representing the populace of the city and are trying to score as many points as possible by the end of the game. Points are awarded for helping citizens escape, keeping them alive until the Martians are destroyed and killing the Martian war machines.<br/><br/>The inhabitants of London have no say over the greater workings of the Martian invasion or the government's response to it, relying on garbled rumours and reports to keep them informed. Game plays out over a fixed narrative of eight 'Headlines', which reveal the next stage of the invasion and events within the narrative are controlled by a 'Tidings' deck which instructs the players how to manipulate the invaders and the military who are trying to counter the threat. The Tidings deck also contains the Red Creeper, which spread across the board as the game progresses. Once consumed by the alien plant a space is no longer safe from the Martian's terrible Death Ray. These Tidings can be manipulated by players through the use of five Character cards, each of which has a special ability and each of which can be used only once per game so timing must be chosen carefully.<br/><br/>Escape from London is achieved by leaving the board from one of five stations or the docks. As Headlines are revealed these escape routes begin closing and as the Martians grow more prolific, the Red Creeper spreads, the available military units dwindle and escape routes shut so the tensions build and players begin to turn on each other to compete for the few remaining avenues of exodus.<br/><br/>",

Pink allows them to kiss dead fairies rather than eat them, vampirically soaking up the corpse's powerful fairy essences.  This addictive cosmetic gives them a much-needed edge on the battlefield, but it carries a terrible price; with the deadly risk of Overkiss, every kiss might be your last...<br/><br/>Sugar and Vice includes:<br/>Rules and background for musical Moon-Fairy bands, Pixie mercenaries &amp; gangs, and reality-warping Glamour Chunks!<br/>More weapons, Twinkle spells, wands , and (yes) magic items!<br/>Tasty new full-color counters!<br/><br/>Sugar &amp; Vice provides more equipment, troops, spells and game options to all Fairy Meat players, expanding the game while keeping gameplay as swift and bloody as you've come to expect.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Fairy Meat<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unlike the Classic Battle Tech: Starter Books, the Jihad series of scenario books is for players with experience with the Battle Tech system.<br/><br/>Each book includes the historical background and fiction that describes the sitiuations described in the book.  The series of events presented in these books unfold in a rolling format, allowing readers to immerse themselves more directly into the action than ever before.  Each book includes scenarios to cover each of these situations.  Additionally the books include a campaign system that can be used for the Battletech Boardgame or Roleplaying game to tie each of the individual situations together.<br/><br/>The situations are designed to be easily scalable, which allows them to be used for any sized group of players, regardless of what type of equipment used (since not all units are created equal).<br/><br/>The Books in this series<br/><br/>     Classic Battletech: Blake Ascending: A Jihad Compilation.  This was originally two seperate books:<br/>         Battletech: Dawn of the Jihad, covers the period when the Jihad began (Nov 3067) through approximately 3069<br/>         Battletech: Jihad Hot Spots covers the period of 3070 and 3071.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Classic Battletech: Jihad Hot Spots - 3072 covers the period of 3072 and 3073 and includes new technical readouts of new units, including 6 Word of Blake Mechs.<br/>     Classic Battletech: Jihad Hot Spots - 3076 is listed as &quot;coming soon&quot; (as of 1/09).<br/><br/><br/>More books in this series are planned, since the storyline is planned to cover two decades of 'history' in the Battletech universe.<br/><br/>",

Thankfully you and your fellow players can lend a hand, but the sorting challenge won't be easy. When you're the active player, you must wear glasses that cover your eyes; the player to your left then draws a task card and places the animal pictured on it in your hand. You try to identify the animal by touch and announce what animal you think you hold. The player then explains your task and you try to perform it, such as placing the animal in the correct location (as marked on the gameboard that game). You can feel the gameboard and other animals already in place, but knock any of them over and your turn ends immediately.<br/><br/>Other tasks include removing the proper animal from the gameboard and stating how many are currently on the board.

One after another, they build sentences to create the most consistent criminal story they can tell. A player who tells the sentence is called an AUTHOR. If  the AUTHOR speaks out loudly sentence containing a word present on a card in other player's hand, the AUTHOR takes that card and puts it face up in front of him. This card gives him 1 point at the end of the game. A player who has the most points at the end of the game is a winner so during the game you should try to lead the story in a way that will protect cards that you have at your hand. Also be careful! There is a murderer among you. He tries to outrun others by getting additional points. Can you tell the best story and meanwhile hunt down the murderer?<br/><br/>",

With a roar of engines the motor torpedo boats would surge forward, opening up with tracer fire from an arsenal of machine guns and autocannons. If the enemy vessel was a large enough target, torpedoes would also be loosed to deal a devastating blow to their prey.<br/><br/>The game covers six major nationalities - the British Royal Navy, German Kriegsmarine, US Navy, Imperial Japanese Navy, Soviet Navy, and Italian Regia Marina - each having their own character and play style. This rulebook explains how to organize your chosen fleet and take the fight to your opponent as you seek to rule the waves. The vessels vary in size and shape - from fast, sleek killers to slower but more heavily armed ships. Do you prefer a swarm of small but fast boats, fewer larger ships with heavy weaponry to bring to bear, or a combination of these two categories? Cruel Seas provides a multitude of ship and aircraft options and plenty of options to customize your boats' weaponry, making each game different.<br/><br/>Cruel Seas is scenario-driven providing a strong narrative element to your games. From easy-to-play introductory scenarios to more demanding operations that will provide a test of both your skills and nerves!<br/><br/>",

While in most connection games players try to make a chain built of their pieces, in Talpa players remove pieces to make a path of empty spaces.<br/><br/>Initially the board is filled with black and white pieces, forming a checkerboard pattern. A player moves by picking up one of his pieces and capturing a horizontally or vertically adjacent opponent's piece. The captured piece is removed from the board and replaced by the capturing piece. The capture is mandatory if possible. When capturing becomes impossible, players remove one of their stones per turn.<br/><br/>The goal is to &quot;dig&quot; a &quot;tunnel&quot; of orthogonally adjacent empty spaces connecting player's sides of the board.<br/><br/>No draws are possible in Talpa.<br/><br/>",

Get the most pastures for your cattle! With smart tactics, avoiding storms, using your golds well, with the Indians in peace, you will surely be the king of the prairie.<br/><br/>Objective of the game:<br/>With the help of farms occupy areas and all five cows should be placed on occupied pastures. The first player places his fifth cow on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>During the game, players must use pasture-shaped triangular cards for the game so that they can build farms in their corners. If one player is in the majority on a pasture - his own farm is in the two corners of the front leg - that player can place one of its cows on this pasture so can take it. The figure remains in the game until the end of the game, regardless of whether the player may have it the majority of the area around the area disappears on the way. Only one cow can be placed on a pasture.<br/><br/>The youngest player starts. From the 4 cards in his hand he can play as much as cards he can or want. There is only one limit: You can only play one card type in one turn (for example, there is a player holding two farm cards, only one of them can be placed in one turn). Exception is possible with golds.<br/><br/>",

Coincidently, though, more than one team is trying to pull this off at the same time - and maybe even with the same specialists!<br/><br/>Yes, the meeples are not trustworthy and might be working for other parties (also know as other players). So, while trying to advance their own plan, players must take the challenge to discover which meeple works for whom, utilizing cunning, deduction and a bit of luck (yes, this is a dice game after all). The idea is to control your team with maximum efficiency, positioning them at the right place at the right time to execute your big plan and get away with as much money as possible from the Casino.<br/><br/>You will lead a charming but unreliable team of specialists: The Brain, The Face, The Muscle, The Eye, The Feet and The Fingers. In the end will you grab just a few coins or can ou pull off the most ambitious heist of all time?<br/><br/>In any case, just remember: don't trust the meeples!<br/><br/>",

It is for those who wish to employ for themselves the techniques of Surrealist inquiry and discovery; it sets out the rules and directions for playing the games. There has been nothing like it: much of the material gathered here has been previously documented only in obscure journals, or in magazines long since defunct and difficult to come by.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Surrealists initiated the most radically liberating critique of reason of the century. Their brilliant investigations were conducted through art and polemic, manifesto and demonstration, love and politics. But most specially and remarkably, it was through games, play, techniques of surprise and methodologies of the fantastic that they subverted academic modes of inquiry, and undermined the complacent certainties of the reasonable and respectable. Playful procedures and systematic stratagems provided keys to unlock the door to the unconscious and to release the visual and verbal poetry of collective creativity.&quot;<br/><br/>A small format book details numerous games that involve automatism, simulation, role playing, story creation, randomness, and dadaist poetics. The hardcover version also includes a full-color, fold-out gameboard for a game called &quot;The Goose Game&quot; with nonsensical rules, designed and produced by noted surrealist Andre Breton. A surrealist dictionary and a removable tattoo are also included with the hardcover edition.<br/><br/>",

Not only do you have to make each gummy bear by hand, you have to watch out that your sneaky coworkers don't try to build off your labors and take credit for your work!<br/><br/>Gummy Bear Factory is a fast-paced card game of trading and set collection for 1-5 players, playable from ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>The game uses unique cards composed of heads, middles or legs gummy bears in different colors.  On your turn, you take or trade for gummy bear parts and try to lay down complete gummy bears of three matching cards.  Players build new gummy bears or onto existing gummy bears.  The game is won by the player who created the most gummy bears and scores the most bonus points for having majority control on a row.  The game is easy to learn, but it takes strategy and cunning to win.<br/><br/>The game is inspired from European boardgame design.  It emphasizes easy to teach rules, no player elimination, no language, and game mechanics that emphasize strategy and paying attention to the gameplay rather than completely luck.<br/><br/>Gummy Bear Factory is the only game that you can use real gummy bears in place of the included scoring winks and increase your fun!  You provide your own.  Symbols allow easy play for color blind players.  There's also a challenging solitaire variant and special two player rules.<br/><br/>",

The Game Instructions (a seperate rulebook from the assembly instructions) include rules for handling all normal soccer rules plus games modes such as Kick and Rush and One - Two.<br/>The goal is to score more goals than the other player, and the rulebook allows for a pre-determined number of a set time limit (as in real soccer) to determine the winner.<br/>The game plays well, with the pitch divided into light and dark green stripes. A team is allocated to each colour and when the ball lands in your colour, you can move your two players and kick the ball. No more than two passes area allowed before a shot at goal must be taken. Goalkeepers are controlled via a stick mechanism with a spring, that allows lateral movement but also sideways dives.<br/>The kit includes 4 players (2 per side) with kicking action, 2 balls, and a 97cm x 67cm playing surface with surrounds and a scoreboard. The kicking action is surprisingly good, and by experimenting with positioning your player around the ball, different shot strengths and aerial shots are very possible.<br/>All in all, Playmobil has done a great job converting soccer into a fast and fun game for the whole family.<br/><br/>",

With Momentum Football you'll be able to track the following team and individual stats:Passing Attempts, Passing Completions, Total Passing yardage, Interceptions, Fumbles Lost, Sacks, Rushing Attempts, Rushing Yardage, and all scoring.<br/><br/>Momentum Football uses a drive-by-drive approach to resolve games. But, don&rsquo;t let the simplicity fool you. Over 254 variables are used to create each team&rsquo;s chart making them highly accurate for both team performance and individual player performance. And best of all, we&rsquo;ve designed the game so that there is little to no set-up time involved. As you become comfortable with the rules, you&rsquo;ll be able to grab two team sheets, a score sheet and four dice and begin play immediately.<br/><br/>Games are resolved drive-by-drive, rather than play-by-play. But, again, don&rsquo;t let that fool you into thinking that individual contributions aren&rsquo;t important. You&rsquo;ll quickly see the impact of great rushers, passers and receivers on offense and pass rushers, cover men and big hitters on defense. So, while the game is resolved by drives, individual player contributions are the difference between winning and losing.<br/>Don&rsquo;t fret; special teams, penalties, turnovers, home field advantage, and a team&rsquo;s momentum are all captured within the game. You&rsquo;ll be amazed as you watch everything unfold on your tabletop just as it does in real life.<br/><br/>As the name of the game implies, capturing the momentum as it swings from one team to the other is a big part of the game. Our system is unique in that it doesn&rsquo;t overly dominate the game mechanics nor is it over stated.

        "description": "Timeline: Cannes &amp; Cinema is a card game played using 55 cards. Each card depicts a Movie on both sides, with the year in which that movie was selected at the Cannes Film Festival occurred on only one side. Players take turns placing a card from their hand in a row on the table. After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>Timeline: Cannes &amp; Cinema can be combined with any other title in the Timeline series.<br/><br/>Contains 55 cards in French and 55 cards (the same) in English.<br/><br/>",

You play as Luke Rider who is a quiet stranger that roams the lands looking for fuel and other items to upgrade his car, bolster his defense, and survive. Along the way, Luke encounters many foes, be it a convoy of looters, a gang of hoodlums, or a person selling some upgrade parts. Money is a thing of the past. Gasoline is the now the currency.<br/><br/>Luke Ryder is solo deck builder. It's you against the deck. Contained in the deck are support cards, enemy, attack, defense, and deck manipulation cards.<br/><br/>The game was designed from the ground up to played as a solo game. That means you do not need worry about rule exceptions or solo variants in order to play the game. The game contains a deck of 54 cards. 39 of the cards in the deck are unique and 3 have multiple copies.<br/><br/>Luke Ryder is unique from other card games in that it contains the &quot;The Ultimate Geek DiceDeck&quot; system. This allows for a random enemy attack between 3 and 6 each turn and blends dice with cards without the necessity of custom dice.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with 7 barrels full of atomic waste and has to put them to one of the final storages on the playing schedule. The player that gets rid of all his barrels at first, wins the game. The clue is, that the players can either put a barrel to one of the hidden final storages or they can look if a final storage is safe or note safe. During the game each players knows some safe and some unsafe storages. After a player put a barrel with atomic waste to one of the final storage-cards, the other players can say that they don't believe that this final storage is safe. If they are right, the player has to take all the barrels on this card (up to three). If he was honest, he gives one of his barrels to the player that distrusted him.<br/><br/>Flavor text:<br/>&quot;Die Gesch&auml;fte laufen wie geschmiert, doch die Chefs der gro&szlig;en Atomkonzerne haben ein Problem: Sie wissen nicht wohin mit dem ganzen Atomm&uuml;ll.

        "description": "Japan, the old capital Kamakura. Here, in this age, you are an apprentice patissier, making traditional japanese pastries.<br/>One day, the master gathered all his apprentices and proclaimed:<br/>&quot;I will employ the one who most beautifully can decorate these pastries&quot;<br/>Will that person be you? Can you line up the pastries prettier than everyone else?<br/>This is an abstract open information strategy game, where you exchange places of pastries of four different colours, in order to line them up orthogonally and diagonally, and score the corresponding points.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Place the board in the play area.<br/>Give each player a summary.<br/>Place a cake tile on each of the 16 squares on the board, according to colour.<br/>Put the 40 point tiles on the board edge, according to colour, with the point side face up. See to that the 10 chits in each colour are shuffled.<br/>Choose the starting player in any suitable fashion.<br/>Turn goes clockwise around the table; everyone takes their corresponding order chit and places before them. Everyone but the start player flips their order chit so that the special effect is face up (this effect is usable from each player's first turn)<br/><br/>Flow of the game<br/>Turn goes clockwise around the table. Each turn consists of the two steps below, in order.<br/><br/>1: Optional: Exchange places of 2 adjacent cake tiles<br/>Choose two orthogonally adjacent cake tiles, and swap their places.<br/>Cake tiles are not adjacent diagonally.<br/><br/>2: Gain point chit<br/>If the number of icons on a point chit matches the number of cake tiles of the chit's colour, in that row, then you gain that point chit.<br/><br/>You can only gain 1 point chit per turn (unless a special effect allows you otherwise).<br/>The point chit you gain doesn't have to be related to the tiles you moved (if any)<br/>However, if you cannot gain a point chit (or cannot see how you would be able to), regardless of whether you move cake tiles or not, you must pass your turn, without moving any cake tiles and may not take another turn until the game ends.<br/><br/>When you gain a point chit, put it face down to show the special effect. You cannot use a power the very turn you gained it.<br/><br/>Special effects of turn chits and point chits<br/>You may use the effects of turn chits and point chits at any time during your own turn. You may use several on the same turn, but each chit is a one-time use. Once used, flip the chit to face up, so that it shows the number instead.<br/><br/>Explanation of the special effects<br/>You may use the effect up to many times as the number indicates.<br/><br/>Turn order thics, red point chits:<br/>You may do extra move actions<br/><br/>Yellow point chits:<br/>You may gain extra point chits. However, all point chits you gain must be from the same row, and all of them have to fulfill their conditions. You may use several yellow point chits on the same turn, but all chits you gain must come from the same row.<br/><br/>Green point chits:<br/>When you want to gain a point chit, you may lower the number of necessary cake tiles.<br/>Each green point chit can only be valid for gaining one point chit. If you use several green point chits on the same turn, they have to be used for different point chits (i.e. in combination with yellow point chits)<br/><br/>Blue point chits have no special effect. Instead, they are worth double the points of normal point chits. Their full total points are noted on their back sides.<br/><br/><br/>     For all point chits, the power of the special effect is higher, the rarer the chit is.<br/><br/><br/>Game and and victor<br/>The game ends when either all point chits have been gained, or when all players have passed their turn due to not being able to gain a point chit.<br/><br/>The player with the highest total points wins the game. Blue point chits have the value printed on their back side (the front side doesn't count).<br/><br/>In case of a tie, the last player to go breaks the tie.<br/><br/><br/>     Tricks and tips<br/><br/><br/>If you round the total points to be gained as 100, and try to aim for exceeding your player's share of those points (33 points on 3 players, 25 points on 4 players), you'll have an easier time to judge whether you're doing well or not.<br/><br/>",

Each monster has an ability such as triggering the top card of your discard pile. You don't play cards from your hand; you take cards from a 4-card pool and trigger the card as you take it.

Neutralizers then destroy their corresponding monsters, and the player with the best surviving combination of cards wins.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>End the game with the highest combined point total between your final 2 cards.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Shuffle all cards and deal 4 face-up into the center row (the Pool), and one face- down into each player&rsquo;s personal discard pile. At any time, players may look at (but not rearrange) their discard pile. Choose a random &ldquo;start player&rdquo; to begin.<br/><br/>EACH PLAYER&rsquo;S TURN (proceed clockwise)<br/>Draw a card from the Pool, say its name and number aloud, and trigger/resolve  its primary ability. (If another card gets triggered, reveal it and resolve it.) Fill the Pool back to 4 from the face-down deck.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, if you exceed your hand limit (3 cards), discard excess cards face-down to your discard pile. When the draw deck is empty, continue taking turns until everyone has had an equal number. Then Resolution begins.<br/><br/>NEUTRALIZER CARDS<br/>These do nothing when drawn/triggered; instead they are used during Resolution. Most Neutralizers negate the points granted by 2 specific Monsters (in any players&rsquo; hands). Neutralizers are not Monsters; their points can&rsquo;t be negated.<br/><br/>RESOLUTION (combine / score your 2 cards)<br/>All players discard down to just 2 cards. In turn order, each player dramatically reveals their highest-number card. Then they reveal their other card. Resolve all Neutralizers. The player with the highest total score wins the game. If there is a tie, the tied player with the highest-value surviving Monster is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal is to score the most points among several rounds of play by wearing certain costumes.<br/><br/>Each round, players have a hand of three cards and can play one of five corny costumes -- Vampire, Mummy, Robot, Ghost, Zombie, or one half of a Horse costume -- and each costume works a little differently. For example, you win 6 points if you and another player can coordinate a Horse costume... but lose 3 points if you go as just a Horse's bottom.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pope Joan is a card game of the &quot;Stops&quot; type, named after a legendary female Pope of the 9th century. An ordinary pack is used, from which the eight of diamonds has been removed, and a special round board in the form of eight compartments, named respectively Pope-Joan, Matrimony, Intrigue, Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game (King, Queen and Knave are sometimes omitted).<br/><br/>Each player &ndash; any number can play &ndash; contributes a stake, of which one counter is put into the divisions Ace, King, Queen, Knave and Game, two into Matrimony and Intrigue, and the rest into Pope-Joan. This is called &quot;dressing the board.&quot; The cards are dealt round, with an extra hand for &quot;stops,&quot; i.e. cards which stop, by their absence, the completion of a suit; thus the absence of the nine of spades stops the playing of the ten. The last card is turned up for trumps.<br/><br/>Cards in excess may be dealt to &quot;stops,&quot; or an agreed number may be left for the purpose, so that all players may have an equal number of cards. If an honor or &quot;Pope&quot; (nine of diamonds) is turned up, the dealer takes the counters in the compartment so marked. Sometimes the turning-up of Pope settles the hand, the dealer taking the whole pool. The Ace is the lowest card, the King the highest. The player on the dealer's left plays a card and names it, the player who has the next highest then plays it, till a stop is played, i.e. a card of which no one holds the next highest. All Kings are of course stops, also the seven of diamonds; also the cards next below the dealt stops, and the cards next below the played cards. After a stop the played cards are turned over, and the player of the stop (the card last played) leads again.<br/><br/>The player who gets rid of all his cards first takes the counters in &quot;Game,&quot; and receives a counter from each player for every card left in his hand, except from the player who may hold Pope but has not played it. The player of Ace, King, Queen or Knave of trumps takes the counters from that compartment. If King and Queen of trumps are in one hand, the holder takes the counters in &quot;Matrimony&quot;, if a Queen and Knave, those in &quot;Intrigue&quot;, if all three, those in the two compartments; if they are in different hands these counters are sometimes divided. Unclaimed stakes are left for the next pool. Pope is sometimes considered a universal &quot;stop.&quot;<br/><br/>Re-implements: Jeu du Nain Jaune<br/><br/>",

Enthusiasts, get on the search boat to discover Nessie's True Identity! Will the truth be uncovered? Or will the mystery deepen?<br/><br/>To play the game, place the Nessie figure on one end of the table and the ship on the other end, with the five characters W H A T ? lying down between them. If you are the lead player, think of any noun to serve as Nessie's true identity. (Proper nouns are discouraged.) The other players &mdash; the Nessie fanatics &mdash; now try to guess this identity.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, you give a one-word hint to the hidden identity. Each fanatic then makes one guess about this identity in whatever order they want. If none of the guesses are close to Nessie's identity, move the ship farther away from Nessie and stand up one of the letters; if any guesses are close but not correct, move the ship closer to Nessie, then stand up one of the letters.<br/><br/>If one of the guesses matches the identity, don't reveal this when the player guesses. Instead, at the end of the round after all players have guessed, move the ship adjacent to Nessie. On the count of 3, each fanatic must point to the person who they think gave the correct answer, which might be themselves. If more than half the fanatics identify the correct guess, they win; if not, then you win. If five rounds pass and no one has guessed the correct answer, then you'll all be staring at WHAT? and realizing that the clue giver didn't do a good job.<br/><br/>Nessie's True Identity includes a scoring system in case you want to have everyone be the clue giver once and keep track of points earned over multiple games.<br/><br/>The second edition of Nessie's True Identity features larger components and reorganized rules, along with a new sighting information card, coverage board, and pen.<br/><br/>",

There is also a twelve-sided die with &quot;GENI&quot; on some of the faces. If a player rolls that and gets &quot;GENI&quot;, he gets to choose what category question to answer.

Fremen units which stay in the space will also be destroyed. Can't be played if a worm appears.<br/>Juice of Sapho: After a player has committed their cards to a battle, look at the entirety of their remaining hand before making your own choice.<br/>Imperial Conditioning: For one battle only, before players have committed cards to a battle, your leader cannot turn traitor.<br/>Break Imperial Conditioning: Cancel Imperial Conditioning when it is played in your battle.<br/>Weirding Way: Before any part of a battle occurs, play to double the casualties that battle inflicts on your opponent.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSuggested UseFive cards without effects are included in the base game, and two more 'useless' cards are added in Dune: Spice Harvest and Dune: The Duel. This variant suggests replacing those seven cards with the first seven of the variant cards, and to, once someone has blown the Shield Wall, replace the Family Atomics card with Weirding Way and/or have that card function as Weirding Way.<br/><br/>An alternate method suggested is to buy an additional full set of Treachery cards and overwrite the normal effects with the variant card effects (pasting the new image onto the card, or for a more modern audience, using sleeves and inserts).<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tInteraction with other ExpansionsThe 'Reviving the Ghola'/Bene Tleilax expansion adds additional uses for the 'useless' Treachery cards. If the variant cards replace useless cards and that variant is also in use, they should be marked to indicate that they also count as 'useless' cards for the Tleilaxu's purposes. The alternate method is probably preferable if these are used together.<br/><br/>",

The campaign system is an empire-level economic war game where the player starts with an alien race on a single world and attempts to conquer the galaxy. Battles from the campaign system are played-out using the tactical system.<br/><br/>Ultra Starfire is a partial rewrite to Galactic Starfire, Fourth edition. Ultra Starfire was designed for completely balanced game play in a player versus player competitive environment. While it could still be used for story-based games, the appendixes and additional material was designed for shorter competitive campaigns.<br/><br/>Ultra Starfire was the first all-electronic product from the SDS, sold as a set of cross-linked PDF files, but still used the counters and map sets from Galactic Starfire.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>     Galactic Starfire<br/><br/><br/>",

After centuries of abuse from mankind, the dying spirit of Earth has called out to the dragons with hopes they&rsquo;d help better humanity and reshape the world in elemental harmony. However, the destruction and violence that gave rise to their birth also tainted the dragons, driving them mad with a lust for war. Now the dragons not only battle humanity, but themselves. Ruthlessly hunting for the dragon eggs to satiate their endless hunger for power, the dragons wage an eternal struggle for dominance and the very soul of Earth.<br/><br/>In DragonClash, you are the dragon, hatching your beast from a variety of decks geared towards a specific breed and play style. The core set of DragonClash includes the Red Breather, Blue Adept, Silver Channeler, and Brown Mauler decks. Each deck of 72-cards includes a dragon and a variety of attacks unique to that deck&rsquo;s theme.<br/><br/>To claim victory, your dragon must win the opponent&rsquo;s Dragon Egg Card. You can do this by either forcing your opponent to discard his Dragon Egg or by consuming your opponent&rsquo;s hoard with a Feast card, while a Dragon Egg is hidden there. Players take turns feeding their dragon&rsquo;s hoard, aging from hatchling to elder wyrm, training a variety of attacks, and engaging in combat. Executing attacks, playing effects, and taking damage depletes your dragon&rsquo;s Essence (the playing deck) and when a player&rsquo;s dragon has exhausted all of their Essence, they must flee and lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Prior to the game, you build a custom fleet and a custom deck of cards from a large available pool.  The fleet is then deployed and the cards are used during the game to provide special attacks and other special powers.  There are also several pre-constructed fleets that demonstrate diverse strategic paths.<br/><br/>The components can be procured by combining 4 sets of commercial Battleship and/or printing out the necessary materials from the PnP files.  There are also templates for building the ships out of Lego bricks.<br/><br/>",

While one player weaves a tale inspired by the story card, the others will play their Vanfolk, overcoming the challenges presented.

If you like the stories of Narnia and Red Wall, this game is for you.<br/><br/>The simple core mechanics ensure that Vanagard is playable by a wide range of player, from age 7 to 77. There are 6 talents in the game, and they appear on both Nature cards and Talent cards. These talents are used to overcome the challenges presented in the scene. Runes are drawn to set type and difficulty of the challenge.<br/><br/>Players may create their Vanfolk characters as they play, ensuring that you can jump right into the action from the moment you open up the box.<br/><br/>EXTEND the game with new card decks. As the Vanfolk increase their level, add-on decks present a natural evolution to the rules. These add-on decks include magic items (relics), spells, profession cards and other goodies that evolve the Vanfolk as they embark on a series of adventures.<br/><br/>Add-on decks will also include new tools for the story-teller, in the form of challenge decks, story plots and many more interesting features. All of these are optional add-ons allowing you to tailor the game experience to your personal taste.<br/><br/>",

This tomb was to become known as the &quot;stepped pyramid&quot;, the first of the great pyramids of Egypt.<br/><br/>Each player is a builder vying to add to their wealth through this grand project. The builders secure the services of some of the kingdom's artisans to supply finished stone for the pyramid and food for their workers. They then use these tiles to build the pyramid and are rewarded for their efforts by the treasury.<br/><br/>But building the pyramid is not the only way to gain wealth. There is a thriving market for the stone and food required to build the pyramid. There are profits to be made by selling goods on the open market and at times, tiles purchased on the market may let you build when you would not otherwise be able to do so. By deploying influential members of your family, you can also gain advantage in various aspects of your business dealings.<br/><br/>Use your money and influence wisely and the completion of the pyramid will see you take your rightful place as the kingdom's most successful builder.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Galactico is a game of intergalactic scale, in which players act as taxi drivers, delivering passengers to the most remote corners of galaxies. The world of the game is impregnated with references to loved and well-known characters, as well as stamps of science fiction.<br/><br/>In Galaktico, you need to transport passengers from one space sector to another, at the end of the game getting victory points for satisfied customers (and penalty points for customers that you didn&rsquo;t take to the final destination). A total of 8 stops in the game, and they are responsible for special cards, laid out in a circle. With a different number of players, the routes change (green, yellow or pink).<br/><br/>The second (and main) type of game cards are passengers. There are four types of them - the usual (with a white rim, bring 1 software), the rich (with a yellow border, bring 2 software), hares (with a red border, bring 2 software) and the Worthans (with a green border, do not bring victory points).<br/><br/>The third type of cards - controllers. They do not bring points, but they help to catch hares.<br/><br/>Before the start of the game, each player receives a chip, which is then placed on different route maps as starting points. In his turn, the player must do 4 actions:<br/>move your chip. You can only move to unoccupied stations;<br/>lay out new passengers. On the five cards of the previous sectors from the displaced chips, one new passenger appears, which are taken from the deck of passengers;<br/>disembarking passengers. A player can land (lay face down in front of him) any number of passengers per hand if their symbols match the symbols on the station map. There are a couple of nuances: if there is a controller card at the station, the player can land all the hares (even if their symbols do not match the station symbols); Wortana can be landed only where there is another Wortana (both Wortana go to a dump);<br/>make loading. The player picks up passengers from the station to 6, starting from the lowest one in the row of passengers.<br/><br/>When the &ldquo;end of shift&rdquo; card comes out of the deck of passengers, the current lap is played, then another lap is played, and the players proceed to the calculation of victory points. Passengers landed bring 1 or 2 points, and passengers remaining in the hand take away points. The winner is the one who scores the most points.

The goal of the game is to finish with the most points at the end of the game, thanks to the connections of the socks and the bonuses of the monsters.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game two cards are dealt to each player and with the remaining cards four equal draw decks are made showing the sides of the socks.<br/><br/>In turns, the player draws a card from any draw deck and then plays a card on the table. We must always start on our first turn with a monster and then follow the placement rules.<br/><br/>We will be playing cards forming our stall and making chains of socks to be able to lower other monsters. The socks are connected and superimposed following the placement rules and the requests of the monsters.<br/><br/>At the end of the game we will get points for the correct connections of the socks, the score bonuses of the monsters and we will subtract points for the stinky socks.<br/><br/>In addition, the game has a small variant, where the weather symbols come into play and add more interaction and bite to the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Odd is a simple abstract game for 2 players, with stones of 2 colors, typically played on a hexagonally tiled board with 5 cells on each edge (though it can be played on almost any tiling). Odd can also be played with pencil and paper.<br/><br/>Definitions:  <br/><br/>     A group is a set of stones on the board, all of the same color, for which it is possible to trace a continuous path between any two of  them by stepping between adjacent stones of that color.<br/>     The size of a group is the number of stones in it.  <br/><br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>     The board begins empty.<br/>     Players take turns.  On each turn a player places one stone of either color onto any empty space.<br/>     The game ends when the board is full.  Player 1 wins if there is an odd number of groups of at least size 5 on the board, and Player 2 wins otherwise.  When counting groups, be sure add up the total number of connected groups of both colors.<br/><br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>     One can change the character of the game by increasing or decreasing the minimum size which a group must have in order to be counted at the end. The larger the minimum group size, the more strategic and less tactical the game becomes, and vice-versa    <br/><br/><br/>",

A game for 3, 4, or even 5 players.<br/><br/>Each of you will lead a noble family became prominent during the Renaissance or late Middle Ages in Italy, struggling for power and in a war to control the fortified city, famous for being the location of violent battles and heated rivalry.<br/><br/>You will take control of the most important places of the town, by influencing the personalities who govern them and by taking advantage of the secret of the two young lovers...<br/><br/>As an emissary of a noble family at every turn you can visit one of the city's locations to carry out your actions. By bribing, you can steal cards from the hands of your opponents. By exercising power, you will instead get the support of a personality and earn victory points: to do this you will need specific card combinations, or you can bluff and pretend to have them...<br/><br/>During your mission, you can &quot;unmask&quot; the secret identity of your opponents without revealing yours: if you know which Family sent your opponents, you will unveil more easily their bluffs and your opponents will lose victory points.<br/><br/>In this power struggle everything is permitted: finding legal quibbles with the pettifogger will force your opponents to change strategy, and if things go wrong you can always hire an assassin...<br/><br/>At the end of the game (for rounds or when a player finishes their markers) who has more victory points wins!<br/><br/>",

It's always the same with you two. Succeed and get paid, or fail and get vaporized.<br/><br/>The discovery of the pentaquark in the early 21st century shed some light on the conditions inside neutron stars. Now, in Twin Stars: The Quark Star you are trying to create the hypothetical Quark Star, an even more dense state of matter. Calibrate, Test, and Experiment with your particle collider, and Capture 5 Quarks to win. Lose if funding reaches $0.<br/><br/>The Quark Star is a scenario in the Twin Stars solo system by Jason Tagmire and Mike Mullins. The game consists of just 3 cards and players will provide their own dice and coins/tokens. Each scenario comes with 2 all-new characters and can be interchanged with others for a very different gaming experience.<br/><br/>This is the second scenario in the Twin Stars family and was originally offered as a stretch goal for Button Shy's Pentaquark Kickstarter.<br/><br/>",

The &quot;trick&quot;, in effect, is made by confrontation between the value of the word you place on the board (as in Scrabble) and the one of the previous player: so, any word is considered in 2 &quot;tricks&quot; (the one with the previous and the one with the following player). The suit proposed by the winner of the auction is the &quot;trump&quot; for the round: once played, the tiles with this suit on will receive a bonus in points. <br/>The game is played in 3 rounds: any player receive a random set of tiles per round. At the end of any round, the teams score victory points according to the contract made at the beginning of the round.<br/><br/>",

You are searching for food for the trip, robots to navigate the alien ship you must steal, other captured aliens to help you carry all the stuff, and weapons to deal with inevitable guards you will encounter. Early in the game the food and robots are plentiful and cost very few hours to find--alien friends and weapons take longer to find.  As the game progresses food and robots become harder to find and aliens become easier to recruit. Weapons also become easier to find as the guards become aware of your plans and bring in more firepower. As you draw items (cubes) you may also trip an alarm. This means that all sources of food, robots, hiding places, and weapons will be moved to new locations and you will have to face guards. As you carry more things, you move slower, but alien allies can help. They can help you find items more quickly, fight guards, carry items and scout new supplies. Your struggle ends when you find the escape ship and have enough food and robots to leave. But this may not be the end of the game.  You must still defeat the guards watching the ship.  Then other players can still beat the first player to escape if they can spend less hours to get out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Make the best impression by having the least number of open ends in your color at the end of the game, but watch out for the other apprentices who might try to sabotage you with a snip of their shears or some bubble gum! Do you have what it takes to outwit your opponents and claim the title of Beardsmith?<br/><br/>In Beardsmith players take turns playing tiles on a start tile, which is the face of a customer. Most tiles have regular braided sections of beard on them and these must match neighboring tiles  as they are played. The players each have their own draw pile, and color. A player will have three tiles, played open hand, and on their turn will draw a tile and play one of their four tiles. There are some special tiles that can help a player out, or give another player a headache. These are scissors, gum, and the wild tile.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the tiles have been played. Each player adds up their score by gaining one point for each visible tile in their color, and losing a point for each open end (a section of braid that leads to nowhere) and any braided ends that touch a gum tile. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Beard on!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Reichshoffen, also known as Froeschwiller or Woerth, was one of France's early disasters in the disastrous Franco-Prussian War. It is most notable for a desperate and futile charge by the French cuirassiers and for a children's song that begins C'&eacute;tait au soir d'la bataille de Reichshoffen.<br/><br/>The scale of Reichshoffen 1870 is the same as Solferino 1859 (600 meters/hex, 1 hour/turn, units are brigades). The rules vary only slightly: French defensive fire and Prussian artillery are both more effective than in the earlier game, reflecting the two nations' technical advances in small arms and cannon, respectively. French heavy cavalry have two opportunities per game for a charge &agrave; la mort, which can strike anywhere within five hexes of a French headquarters - usually without effect but useful if saved for just the right opportune moment.<br/><br/>Other rules changes are based on the armies' command problems. The French army has no commander-in-chief. Marshal Mac Mahon, the hero of the Battle of Magenta, &quot;although physically present on the battlefield did not direct the battle&quot;. As a consequence, French formations can act effectively only by passing initiative tests. (Optional rules give the Marshal a chance to be slightly or fully effective.) On the Prussian side, there was quite a lot of initial confusion; brigades cannot launch coordinated attacks until the commander-in-chief, Prince Frederick William, arrives on the scene halfway through the action.<br/><br/>The battle begins at 8:30 am and lasts for 10 hourly turns. The victory conditions are simple: The Prussians must occupy four villages in the center of the map; otherwise the French win. The map is slightly less than half the old Vae Victis standard, sharing a sheet with the one for Magenta 1859. The counters must be mounted and cut apart.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zpocalypse: Breakout is a Print &amp; Play teaser for its parent game Zpocalypse. It is intended to showcase the different aspects of Combat Phase in the main game.<br/> Objective: make it out of the prison alive. In order to accomplish the objective you, the player, begin as a Squad using the Survivor Cards of a prison guard and an inmate inside a prison cell. You must collect the key and combination code from two different search locations. There are 3 search cards, one of which is the key to the door. You move your Squad around the prison game board attacking zombies that get in your path. When attacking you can use the weapons cards provided which tell you each weapon's attack abilities.  Moving, searching and attacking all cost 1 action. Players may spend 2 actions, then zombies have a turn to move, attack and spawn. This cycle continues until you have collected both items you need.  Once you have collected your items you can proceed to the locked door of the Warden's office. Only then can you open it (by spending 1 action) and escape the map. The game starts with 3 zombies on the board, and has the ability to spawn new zombies each round. Do not waste precious time as each turn a new zombie will appear and hunt you down!<br/><br/>Game play is solo, and takes about 20 minutes, give or take your untimely demise.<br/><br/>",

The British were vastly outnumbered, and the offensive&rsquo;s goals were limited in scope (it was just supposed to be a &ldquo;five day raid&rdquo;). However, it wasn&rsquo;t long before the surprised and poorly-led Italians were in headlong retreat. Following the capture of the Italian fortress at Bardia, the Italian retreat turned into a full-scale rout. All that stood between the British and complete victory were the remnants of the Italian Strategic Reserve, the Sabratha 60th Infantry Division and the Babini Armor Group (roughly a brigade) who were dug-in at the frontier village of Mechili. The war&rsquo;s first major tank battle in North Africa occurred here as the British vanguard ran into an Italian force that was ready and primed for a fight.<br/><br/>Each copy of Sound and Fury is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    One 11 by 17 inch map with game record-keeping tracks and terrain identification.<br/>&bull;    56 un-mounted double sided units.<br/>&bull;    One set of 7 page rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pond Hockey is an abstract, highly tactical game for 2 players that simulates an informal hockey match played by two teams of 6 players on a frozen pond.<br/><br/>Each player acts as a coach for one of the two hockey teams.  Both coaches have a draw deck of 10 cards. A card drawn from the top of the deck at the beginning of a turn, determines the number of movements points the coach will have available to move one or more players and/or to move the puck (be it by passing or by shooting the puck on goal). After the draw deck has been exhausted, the drawn cards are shuffled to form a new one. The match ends after the draw deck has been exhausted for the third time; so, after 30 &quot;minutes&quot; or 3 &quot;periods&quot; of play. The coach whose team has scored the most goals wins the game. If the scores are tied, the game can go into &quot;sudden death&quot; overtime, where the first team to score a goal will win the game.<br/><br/>The game's movement system was inspired by Corn&eacute; van Moorsel's StreetSoccer but adapted to handle the difference in how a soccer ball can travel versus how a hockey puck can travel: more than one player can be moved on a turn; players can move with and retain possession of the puck; the puck travels in a straight line and it may only change direction if it comes into possession of another player who moves with it or passes it again or if it is deflected off the boards bordering the ice surface. The game also adds rules to permit poke-checking, body-checking, and assessing penalties.<br/><br/>",

The standard game includes additional rules modules (and ships/counter) for merchants, armed merchants, and destroyers.

Because from every position there are precisely two possible paths to the next destination, and the opponent is only allowed to block one path.<br/><br/>A thrilling &quot;cat-and-mouse&quot; game for two poker faces and a lesson in the art of the bluff!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An old Tatarian legend says that Batu Khan, Mongol leader and a grandson of Genghis Khan, always took an extraordinary board game along when he had gone to a war, and carefully hid this game from all trespassers. Batu Khan usually played one game before a battle, just to get into a right warrior mood. The legend does not specify any particular game but it was most likely Jarmo, an old battle-and-race Tatarian game where players are expected to have concentration, observation and imagination.<br/><br/>The goal of this game is to reach opponent's first row with as many own archers as possible. However, the winning strategy is more complicated than simple moving pieces towards opponent's base, it will be described in the next sections. Likewise at Tank Battle, the player who gets more points at the end of a game, wins.<br/><br/>How to capture opponent's pieces<br/><br/>If an archer moves to a circle occupied by an opponent's archer, this enemy piece is captured and immediately removed from the board. An archer that captures at least one enemy is marked by a small black (white) line. It is important to know which archers have captured enemies when the &quot;loop&quot; rule is used.<br/><br/>How to finish the game<br/><br/>The game is finished if one player moves all their non-captured archers to the opponent's first row. At this moment, the final score is calculated and the player with more points wins. In case of a tie, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

As a young engineer at the famous Freeze Factory, you have spent years developing a pioneering ice cream machine. <br/>It can scoop 3 different flavours at one into a cone. Today is your chance to present your invention to the world and treat your guests to delicious ice cream. But who is the best at operating the machine, getting the combination of flavours right and serving the most people?<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/>The aim is to serve as many people as possible, collecting the most cones, by skilfully moving the flavour tiles.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>You decide whether or not to roll the dice. <br/>If you roll, the number you roll is your number of movement points. If you do not roll, you get exactly 3 movement points.<br/><br/>If you manage, either during or at the end of your turn, to create a row of three ice cream flavours on the board that matches the flavours in one of the cones in your hand, you have served the cone and can place it face-up in front of you. Remember that the flavours must be in a horizontal or vertical row; diagonal lines or rows that go over the edge of the board do not count. <br/>If you have no more cones in your hand, you take a new cone from the draw pile.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>The game ends when a player who has just served a cone is unable to take a new card because the draw pile has been used up. The player who has collected the most cones wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Adventurer's Kit is a culture exploration and genuine artifact excavation game, bringing kids from ages 3-12 a true adventure experience.<br/><br/>For the game preparation, players first setup the world map by randomly placing landscape boards with the landscapes icon side facing up, and the adventure/treasure side facing down. Each player then draws a vehicle, which corresponds to a particular starting point on the map and a holds a special ability. After getting prepared, the adventure through the ancient four continents begins!<br/><br/>Each turn, a player rolls a die to determine how many steps the player can move. Upon moving on to a landscape game board, the player may flip it over to find out whether it is an adventure event or treasure. Event game boards effect players located at different continents (such as Bigfoot effects Americas and Mummies effect Africa), while treasure game boards from different locations brings treasure cards from different continents. Collect the artifacts on the way and beware of the events that may occur. At the end of the game, the winner would be the first to dig out the ultimate treasure and become the great Adventurer!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>► Adventure<br/>Tornados, UFOs, Bigfoot, Kappa, and more. Overcome all the adventure obstacles through decision making, and collect more than 50 treasures on your journey to become the true adventurer!<br/><br/>► Culture<br/>From the lost empires of the four continents, comes more than 30 ancient civilization that once ruled the world, including Egypt, Greek, Maya, China, Persia, and lots more.<br/><br/>► Artifacts<br/>Through a series of research and testing, we are finally ready to remake the greatest legacy of civilizations out of the EXACT material, such as Terracotta Army with 100% pottery.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a post-apocalypse future (&agrave; la Mad Max), with scarce resources and few individuals, the survivor clans resolve disputes through ritualised racing instead of open warfare. You are one of these mad drivers. Only the first place counts, and no holds are barred.<br/><br/>The print-yourself components include 10 two-sided race track segments, six player cars and control panels (with tokens for shift gear and engine temperature), a 54 card deck (of additional car equipment) and armour, tires, brakes and turbo tokens. Five dice are also needed.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can speed up, slow down or change gears. This is cleverly handled by the control panel, where speed is vertical and gears horizontal - but not all grid points are connected. You can only go so fast in first gear! The gear diagram is also colour-coded to indicate how bad the engine heat test is. In addition, you may spend brake or turbo tokens (to slow down or speed up further).<br/><br/>You manoeuvre your car from lane to lane - but this depends on speed and your driving skill test. The faster you go, the less you can switch lanes. Tire tokens are spent for extra lane changes. If you ram an obstacle or another player, armour tokens are spent. Other cars could end up being pushed. A favourite technique is the Rush N' Crush, where you speed up right behind your opponent so as to crush him forcefully.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hidden Empires is a print-and-play game for 2 to 6 players where each player assumes the role of an ant colony.  Players deploy worker ants on an abstracted hex-area map to look for and forage food.  Colonies use food to produce more workers to produce more food, etc.  Eventually colonies grow large enough to produce reproductive male and female ants.  Players score points for each reproductive ant released during a nuptial flight.<br/><br/>A deck of cards provide environmental events and different genetic traits for the various ant species.  Conflict between colonies is possible but is not the primary focus of the game.  All events, traits, and general game play are based on the natural history of actual ant species.<br/><br/>As of 2012 a new version, Hidden Empires II, is available.<br/><br/>",

Task Force has a large folding board showing a highly stylised map of Europe and East America, and a small box to hold the pieces and rules. The game does not seem to have a large box to contain both board and bits, and this form of publishing may have been common in the UK post-war.<br/><br/>The game is a simple battle between blue (US) and red (Russia) pieces in which the players moved different forces from town to town, outnumbering and capturing their opponents. Getting into the opponent's heartland wins the game.<br/><br/>A random element is provided by a d6 numbered 1-3. A modern element is provided by two atom bombs. These are large red and blue discs which the players may use once in the game. Placing them on the board, they destroy any pieces the touch and remain in place for two turns, blocking movement there.<br/><br/>I cannot determine a publishing date, but the style of the game and the casual use of of the atom bomb as a strategic piece suggests the game is from the 1950s. It's interesting to see how large Britain is on the map, bigger than France!<br/><br/>Jean Shepherd (best known for the movie &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;) mentioned an ad for Task Force on his June 18, 1963 radio show. It's not clear if he is discussing game 2982, 13059 or another version of this game.<br/><br/>",

All three sets are mutually compatible as far as layout and systems are concerned and base sizes are standardized throughout.<br/><br/>Wargames in the Hundred Years War period and the War of the Roses have been marginally popular for some years and my hope in publishing these rules is that this interest can be widened to the more general European and indeed British wars of the period. Wargames armies of Hussites and Burgundians etc. would be welcome newcomers to the wargames tables and the rules readily accommodate the armies of Samurai and Chinese, Russians and Mongols already being built up.<br/><br/>These rules cover only field battles, as sieges during this period were very complex affairs and demand a set of rules all to themselves. However there is no reason why the rules cannot be used to fight actions resulting from sallies or relief attempts or indeed assaults on wagon forts or barricaded towns.

Although written with 28mm figures in mind the rules are stand-based and so easily translate to any scale of model. The rules cater for many popular basing methods so there is absolutely no need to re-base your figures to be able to play Crusader.<br/><br/>At the heart of the rules is the concept that you are representing units of troops in battle rather than individual warriors. Dispensing with the traditional phases within a turn the unit-based mechanics allow for a fluid game that simulates the quality and training of troops rather than the abilities of a few super characters.<br/><br/>The rules have been created with the flexibility to allow armies from widely differing time periods to fight against each other through the use of a consistent points system. So if you want to fight William the Conqueror's Norman Army against Alexander's Macedonians feel free!<br/><br/>",

While the original game featured largely the classic hex and counter movement that was prevalent in the 70's. This new version will use area-movement, action points for movement and a new card deck (that adds random events without driving the game). Players will use cards for both events and action points and at the same time being able to play cards during their opponent's turns to counter their efforts.<br/><br/>Players can play one of four European powers competing for control of the resources of the new world. The game's time line goes from 1495 to 1615 with players trying to establish colonies in the Americas and bring home as much gold and resources as they can back to Europe. Along the way they will have to deal with natural disasters, other European powers and of course the indigenous people of the New World including the Mayans, Incas and Aztecs.<br/><br/>",

You are a captain of industry, seeking to expand your burgeoning railroad empire.  Your tools are the railroad cars produced by you and your fellow magnates.  Draw cards and place them wisely to earn big points.  Vie for control of public railroads and stock to earn extra bonuses.<br/><br/>In Iron Horses, players compete to build the most lucrative railroad trains using a special deck of cards.  Each player starts with one train, consisting of a locomotive engine and a tender full of coal.  Players will add cars to these trains.  The cars themselves are produced by four manufacturing companies, each owned by a player.  Some types of cars (a passenger coach, a cattle card) are more valuable than others (like simple boxcars).  And adding cars to your train in the proper color order earns bonus points.  Don't forget about the public lines, though, which earn points for the players who have contributed most to their construction.  Finally, in multiplayer games you may purchase stock in other players&rsquo; train lines, thus capitalizing on their successes.<br/><br/>This game was developed for the Quick Print and Play Design Challenge:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/625604/quick-print-and-play-design-challenge-entry-thre\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/625604/quick-print-and-p...</a><br/><br/>The work-in-progress thread may be found here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6398031\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/6398031</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Board With Life: The Metagame (The Microgame) is a 2-5 player card game representing a single game being played by the Board With Life crew. Each of the 5 main characters is represented by a suit/color, and each has an identical set of 5 action cards, with corresponding power that will help that character win the (fictional) game in question:<br/><br/>- Eliminate (1) - removes another card from the game<br/>- Defend (2) - protects previously played cards<br/>- Swap (3) - swaps cards between players<br/>- Strategize (4) - adds to the power of any other card<br/>- Gloat (5) - does nothing really, but has the most power<br/><br/>The game begins with a quick draft so each player can develop their own strategy, but each turn of the game consists of a player playing a single card. You execute its action, and the card remains in front of you as power towards winning that character. Players are vying to have the highest total power in each character, but player with the highest only scores points equal to the power his opponents control. And since there are five different characters, there are five opportunities to score, so players want to have the highest strength in each character, but only by a slight margin and in as many characters as you can for maximum points.<br/><br/>Distributed as a free print &amp; play game released to backers of the web series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Papilio is a card game that recreates the life of butterflies in a fun and didactic way. It combines the fun of an enjoyable game with the discovery of the world of butterflies and some of the most common species in the Mediterranean area.<br/><br/>The aim of the game, fun apart, is to build the richest habitat, and this is achieved by gaining the maximum number of points: completing butterflies, attracting them with plants, trying to make them breed, or catching them (with final penalisation). You also have to ensure that neither predators nor changes in the weather nor human intervention have a negative influence in the strategy of each player.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-5 players of all ages, and especially from 6 years old to an adult public. We have devised three levels of difficulty so that the learning process is gradual until dominating all the aspects of the game.<br/><br/>The game has a total of 66 cards, and 40 of them represent butterflies, 17 are actions by the players and 9 refer to the weather. The butterflies chosen represent more or less the variety of diurnal species in the area and the majority are grouped by colours, an approximation to the different families.<br/><br/>Papilio is a game of simulation yet it is also competitive. This means that the dynamic of the game is agile and with continuous toing and froing, and at the end establishes a score in points that in some way is related to the concept of biodiversity and the biological cycles of these insects.<br/><br/>Thus there are more points for the butterflies that are free than those caught with butterfly nets. The diversity of the butterflies is also rewarded and the number of species of the same group. Finally, points are scored for the combination of plants and reproduction cards (caterpillars). Moreover, given the vulnerability of these insects, the game includes three species of protected butterflies, rare or in danger of extinction, species that in the game cannot be caught with butterfly nets.<br/><br/>",

Playing Abaku significantly improves your calculating skills, logical thinking and intuition.<br/><br/>The players are using playing tiles to create numeric operations on the playing board. Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squares and cubes of whole numbers and square and cube roots of whole numbers are allowed. The player wins over the other players &ndash; calculators thanks to the proper combination of each tile&rsquo;s value and strategic use of premium squares on the playing board. The aim is to get more points than the others.<br/>Numeric operations are created by adding (horizontally or vertically) one or more tiles to tiles already lying on the board. Newly created numeric operation must contain or adjoin one or more tiles lying on the board. Numeric operations must be legible from left to right and from top to the bottom.<br/><br/>Abaku is an effective supporting instrument for teaching mathematics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Donsol is a simple solitaire card game where you are tasked with exploring the rooms of a dungeon using a standard 54-card poker deck. It was designed by John Eternal for Train Jam 2015.<br/><br/>Clubs, Spades, and Jokers serve as monsters, hearts as potions, and diamonds as shields. Red numbered cards possess their face value with royals and aces equaling 11. Black numbered cards also possess their face value with Jack at 11, Queen at 13, King at 15, Ace at 17, and Jokers equal to 21.<br/><br/>The rooms of the dungeon are created by laying out cards in groups of four. Progress is made by playing all four dungeon cards or passing to another room when three of the four dungeon cards have been played. Four more cards are then dealt for the new room. Rooms can be reset in their entirety as many times as needed but never twice in a row.<br/><br/>Shields may be equipped to defend against monsters in descending order of their value with damage being dealt to the player for monster values in excess of the equipped shield. The shield breaks if it is used to attack a monster of equal or greater value than the previous monster. Attacking a monster without a shield depletes the players health for the full attack value of the monster. Health potions may be used to increase life points up to the maximum starting value of 21. Playing a second potion in succession nullifies the effect of the second potion.<br/><br/>The game ends when life points reach zero or the player has successfully slayed all monsters and exited the dungeon alive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hurray, your company just got a lucrative job: build a road between two cities.<br/>But the computer managing the production line just went bananas and random building material comes out of the factory.<br/>Do you give up? Well, partly.<br/>Forget about joining the two cities with a wonderful infrastructure, just try to use the material as it is ready and build as much as you can!<br/><br/>Going Further is a very fast solo game, estimated playing time with standard rules is between 1 and 5 minutes (depending on the tiles you have). Its playing speed makes Going Further ideal to be played in group, challenging the score of your mates.<br/><br/>Going Further, in its standard playing mode, is a tile placement puzzle, as all the tiles are visible to the player. However, every game is different because only 32 randomly selected tiles, out of a 72 deck, are used for a single game.<br/>The objective of the game is to built a continuous road by placing tiles picked from a limited number of available ones. As long as tiles are connected to the road, others become available to be chosen and played. The game ends when no more playable tiles are available.<br/>The player shall choose the best strategy to unlock new tiles and prevent the game to end, while scoring as much points as possible. <br/>In fact, each tile grants a different number of points; the total score consists of the sum of each individual tile points.<br/>Additional points can be added or removed from the total, depending on the achieved road final configuration.<br/><br/>The game can be customized making it more or less difficult, or by introducing a luck element.<br/><br/>When more than one person is playing, each player takes his turn as for a solo game. The winner is the player able to score more points, after each one had his chance.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt character, weapon, and location cards after the top card from each card type is secretly placed in the confidential file in the middle of the board.  Players must move to a room and then make an accusation against a character saying they did it in that room with a specific weapon.  The player to the left must show one of any cards accused to the accuser if in that player's hand.  Through deductive reasoning each player must figure out which character, weapon, and location are in the secret file.  To do this, each player must uncover what cards are in other players hands by making more and more accusations.  Once a player knows what cards the other players are holding, they will know what cards are in the secret file.  A great game for those who enjoy reasoning and thinking things out.<br/><br/><br/>Part of the &quot;Silver Line&quot; edition of Hasbro games. In addition to the distinctive black and silver motif, it includes &quot;invitation&quot; cards and the extra poison weapon from the 50th Anniversary edition. It also has new custom dice that trigger &quot;Clue&quot; event cards, and Dr. Orchid in the place of Ms. White.<br/><br/>",

Two sets of male cards have been added, otherwise the gameplay is the same.<br/><br/>The game has a romantic theme, with one set of red cards themed for a woman, and blue sets for a man. Each cards carries various romantic lines (all in Japanese), that the players ought to speak as they play.<br/><br/>Players draw and play out hand cards, with a set of numbers on each card controlling which others may follow it. If the blue player can get the red player to exhaust their cards first, blue wins. Otherwise, blue loses.<br/><br/>The red deck has 12 cards numbered from 1 to 12 (and this player starts), the blue deck has 11 cards from 2 to 12. On their turn, a player may draw one card from their deck, up to a hand limit of five, or play a card to the table.<br/><br/>Along the bottom of each card is a set of numbers, one for blue and one for red. These say what card can be played after this card. For example, the blue 5 can be followed by a blue 2,3,4 and 6 or by a red 4 or red 6-12.<br/><br/>As players go through their deck, they must carefully decide which cards to hold and which to play, in order to push more cards out of their opponent's hand.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The sky is orange and dense with thick clouds, through which a faint Sun barely shines. A vast, greenish, muddy ocean covers almost the entire planet. The little dry land is black volcanic rocks and barren. But deep in the ocean and in a few oases, something is cooking: life is about to emerge.<br/><br/>In AEON, you and your friends represent prebiotic environments where Life might have emerged. Together, you build a network of chemical reactions that transforms simple prebiotic reactants into complex molecules. Eventually, these molecules will allow you to establish the basic mechanisms of life which make the reactions more efficient.<br/>The first player to create all the requirements for the emergence of biological evolution wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each theatre has its own challenges and opportunities, some rewarding control over the sea, some rewarding control over the skies.

Will you rely on stealth as you move units secretly, springing up where you are least suspected, or will you attempt to overwhelm your enemy with brutal overkill?<br/><br/>Combined Arms can be played as a stand-alone game or players can incorporate Bolt Action, Blood Red Skies, Cruel Seas, or Victory at Sea for an epic continent-spanning campaign.

This particular starter set deals with the Western European Theater during World War II. The game consists of a Conflict deck of 50 cards, 47 Arsenal cards for the British forces, and 47 Arsenal cards for the German forces. Based upon the draw of Conflict cards, players may build forces, learn about their opponent, gain a secret advantage, or enter into a battle. The objective is to be the player at the end of the game with the most victory points, or to win the battle for your opponent&rsquo;s homeland. In addition, 20-card expansion packs are available to improve the selection and capabilities of Arsenal cards and Conflict cards for this set. Additionally, this set can be combined with the other World War II Starter Sets so you and your friends may play the entire war as you please.<br/><br/>Africa: Desolate, expansive, and inhospitable. Even in the absence of war, its hostile elements threaten the lives of all who trespass upon it. But war is not absent, as hordes of Italian soldiers and tanks take up arms to establish the New Roman Empire for their leader, Mussolini. Standing in their way is the old established British Empire, and the new up and coming power of America. Reaching out for help from their ally Germany, the Afrika Corps is formed to deal with the Army of the Nile which is now reinforced with fresh American blood and equipment. Thus, the see-saw war across a continent ensues. Can Rommel be victorious at El Alamein? Will the Allies take the fortress at Tobruk? Can Operation Torch penetrate the Italian Navy? Will the French navy be an asset to the Allies, or the Axis? Will Patton's forces be defeated at Kasserine Pass? You decide in this Desert War edition of Battlecards: World Conflict.<br/><br/>",

Players have paper and pencil on hand to keep track of which cards of what rank they have seen for each suite, to deduce the remaining cards in the Suite Spots.<br/><br/>TURN SEQUENCE<br/>Players take turns. <br/>Each turn has 5 Phases: <br/>Investigate Phase (draw cards)<br/>Action Phase (play (discard) one card from your hand to activate its special ability (dependant on suite))<br/>Sleuth Phase (solve a case by playing, all at once, seven cards - one of each of the seven card types)<br/>Deduction Phase (You may guess the rank of a specific card on the Board (one of the 7 Suites)).<br/>Retire Phase (Discard excess cards - hand limit is 9).<br/><br/>Players share a common set of Case Tokens.  These are awarded for solving cases in the Sleuth Phase or correctly guessing a card identity in the Deduction Phase.  Victory is achieved by being the first player to accumulate 5 Case Tokens.<br/><br/>",

Katalon, features five interlocking squares, with one central square and one square at each of the board's four corners; each square features within it an X pattern of holes that mimics the layout of the squares on the game board.<br/><br/>On the first turn, a player places a marble in any hole, but from then on a player must place a marble in the square matching the position of the hole in which the previous player placed his marble. Within that square, though, the player can place the marble as he wishes. When no more empty holes lie within a square, then you replace an opponent's marble with one of your own.<br/><br/>To win, you either completely fill a square with your marbles, have a majority of marbles in three of the five squares when all spaces on the board are full, or have all of your marbles on the board at the start of your turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Easiest description is likely that this game plays similar to Spades.  It uses a regular deck of 52 playing cards, it is about taking tricks to match a 'bid' (assigned in 7-4-1 versus bidding in Spades), with Aces high and a trump suit (declared in 7-4-1 versus always spades in Spades).<br/><br/>In 7-4-1, 12 cards are dealt to each of the 4 players; this leaves a 4-card kitty.  The dealer MUST try to take 7 tricks, but she gets to declare which suit is trump AFTER looking at her hand.  She then gets to pick up the 4 middle cards, and discard 4 face-down (could be from the kitty, or not).  Player 2 must get 4 tricks, player 3 for 1 trick, and player 4 need not take any.<br/><br/>After round 1, figure out how many cards more or less players got.  YOu get one point for every trick you make above your required tricks, and lose one for every trick you fail to make.  For the next round, a player who had MORE in the previous round can then pass one card per amount more to a player who had less; that lesser player must then pass their HIGHEST card in each requested suit.  Some pre-defined ordering for this is necessary; the player needing to make the most tricks has precedence over the player needing less.<br/><br/>For example, in round 1, the players take 6-2-3-1 tricks.<br/>So, the position 2 is now the new dealer.  Player in position 3 was +2 in round 1 (took 3, needed 1), and would ask position 1 for 1 suit, and position 2 for 1 suit.  Player in position 4 would then ask position 2 for 1 suit.  We've played where if the numbers over/under match (position 3&amp;2, 4&amp;1 in this example), then they could simply swap cards too.<br/><br/>Play then proceeds as described above.  Trump is declared AFTER the card-swapping is done.  And if the player who needed 4 in the previous round took NONE, then they can also look at the kitty too before declaring a trump!  However, they'd also have just given up 4 good cards to other players...\\<br/>Game ends after either 2 or 3 rounds, with everyone getting a chance at each position an equal number of times.<br/><br/>",

Over 100 Random variations of combat chits provide a unique experience with each play-through and cut down dramatically on analysis paralysis. Rules are included for multiple interventions, air-power, and UN supply.<br/><br/>Activations go back and forth with a fixed initiative, creating a unique go-like simulation that recreates the ebbs and flows of the front without railroading players into a foregone conclusion.<br/><br/>Players each action phase can choose to move, strategic move, conduct a meeting engagement, amphibious invasions, or prepared attacks. The main scenario covers the mobile part of the war and with the combat chits, no 2 games can be alike.<br/><br/>Players can spend VPs during combat to absorb losses as well as supplies, or deciding to give up ground or rout.<br/><br/>Players win by driving the VP threshold further towards their side by the end of the game or win automatically by reaching their maximums. Win conditions are based on cities, Pusan Perimeter, and performing historic actions like reaching the Yalu river for the UN or Pusan Perimiter for the Communists.<br/><br/>No two games of 1950 will ever be alike and plays just as well solo as it does with an opponent.<br/><br/>Designed by Ray Weiss<br/>Developed by Matt Ward<br/>Box Art by Ivan Caceres<br/>Counter Art by Ray Weiss<br/>Map Art by Ilya Kudriashov<br/><br/>WEIGHT: 6/10<br/>SOLITAIRE: 8/10<br/>PLAYERS: 1-2<br/><br/>",

Using three dice, players use randomly generated numbers on their sheets showing the time they spend in different parts of the facility, including the yard, storehouse, and mess hall. Due to the rotation of the guards, which rooms are available are random, making it all the harder to assemble the six parts of the escape plan before anybody else does. Privileges are earned through certain choices throughout the game, allowing the ability to sneak into off-limits rooms, use dice multiple times, or score numbers, although these numbers must be shared with other players. The first player to finish their plan wins, although there can be ties.<br/><br/>Roll to Escape is a free-to-play printable game designed during the COVID-19 crisis, and will remain available here and through the publisher's website forever, with continued support.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Two are needed to win. To count, each canoe must be separated from your other pieces. The other player's pieces can only interfere by blocking positions of play, as there is no capture.<br/><br/>On your turn you may place, remove, or move one piece. But you have only a limited number of them to play.<br/><br/>The novel aspect of the game is that completion of your goal pattern normally requires you to remove your own pieces.<br/><br/>",

Players divide into teams and take turns describing a mystery word without using that word or five other &quot;forbidden&quot; words listed on the drawn card. So if the mystery word is Nephi, the player who drew the card prompts teammates to guess the word without saying Lehi, Brass Plates, Laman, Lemuel, or Brother. Beware: hand gestures, sound effects, abbreviations, or rhyming words are also not allowed! More than 400 cards are included, with mystery words from the Book of Mormon, Bible, Church history, and Church culture. There is no limit on the number of people who can play, which makes Speak It Not the perfect game for family home evenings, parties, or Church activities.<br/><br/>",

Wholesale information, Big Data.<br/><br/>The XXI century has witnessed how some new brokers have arisen. Known as the Data Brokers, they are data processors which then distribute among companies, corporations and governments.  They know everything about us, even what we imagine.<br/><br/>The game 4 Data Brokers was born among the pages of a novel by M&agrave;rius Serra in which Oriol Comas is the main character.. Now, it goes from fiction to reality to let you experience the sense of power that only information can provide you.<br/><br/>During the game, players take cards form the player on their right, save two cards, vote to use special rules or take new scoring goals and finally resolve it trying to make combos or score regarding their goals.<br/><br/>After four rounds, the Data Broker with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

As more cards are placed on the table, a player might decide to move a finger from one card to another. When only one player has a finger on a card, they claim it and discover what they've won &mdash; or sometimes &quot;won&quot;.<br/><br/>The cards have values from +7 to -3, or they contain an action, such as discarding an acquired card, releasing a finger, or commanding another player to release a finger. Beauty cards are worth +6 pts, but if you collect a second one, it's worth -3 pts. The top hat is worth +1 pt, but if you place it on your head and keep it there until game's end, you get +5 pts instead.<br/><br/>Players are not allowed to move the draw deck or placed cards, and are meant to use all the fingers of one hand, if possible. A player may also use fingers on their other hand as long as they can still draw on their turn.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

If at any time you run out of cards, replenish your hand by drawing five more cards from the deck.<br/><br/>On your turn you may place one herd animal face up in front of you, either a zebra or an antelope. When you have 5 of one kind in front of you (5 zebras or 5 antelopes), you win the game.<br/><br/>After you play your herd animal, you may play one action card from your hand. Lions, elephants and giraffes are your action cards.<br/><br/>To play a lion, place it face up in front of you. When you have played a second lion, you now have Matching Lions. Your matching lions can be used to chase away two animals from one other player&rsquo;s herds. They can chase away 2 zebras, 2 antelopes, or 1 zebra and 1 antelope. The animals all go into the discard pile. You may use your matching lions on the turn you play the 2nd lion, or you may wait and use them on another turn, after playing your action card for your turn. If you gather several pairs of matching lions in front of you, you may use them all on one turn to chase away other players&rsquo; herd animals if you choose.<br/><br/>When you play an elephant, everyone, including you, must pick up their lions and put them back in their hand. The elephant then goes to the discard pile.<br/><br/>When you play a giraffe, you may choose any other player and view all the cards in their hand. The giraffe then goes to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Other animals:<br/><br/>The hippopotamus is a defense card. Play the hippopotamus to block a pair of lions from chasing away any of your herd animals. The hippopotamus and the pair of lions all go to the discard pile.<br/><br/>The hyena is automatically played when it is drawn. All herd animals migrate left, meaning your herds go to the player to your left, that person&rsquo;s herds go to the player to their left, and so on until every herd has migrated. The hyena goes to the discard pile, and you get to draw again and start your turn. (If you choose, you may use the hyena as an action card instead.)<br/><br/>When the last card from the deck is drawn, the discard pile is shuffled and replaced as the deck.<br/><br/>",

Each play starts with a story - one of the &quot;kufli&quot;s loses something (there are 16 stories included in the box) and players have to find out which creature of the meadow took it. For this they walk around the meadow, trying to find certain creatures (shown on face-down tiles) that remember something about the animal (like &quot;It didn't have fur... I'm allergic to fur and I wasn't sneezing.&quot;). After four main features are known, players find out who the thief is and try to remember where that thief is on the board. If they succeed, they've won!<br/><br/>3 game variants are included in the box:<br/>- from age 3: no memory element - tiles that have been turned up remain face-up<br/>- from age 4: cooperative play<br/>- from age 6: competitive play with players holding certain creatures' cards in hand, sometimes drawing from each other and trying to have the thief in hand in the end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Christmas at White Mountain is a small mini-game that shipped to customers who took part in Hollandspiele's 2016 holiday sale. It is also available for download via Wargame Vault for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>It is based on one of the early battles of the Thirty Years War, the Battle of White Mountain. One sheet of rules and one mapsheet is provided; you'll need to provide twelve dice and 50 tokens, coins, or cubes.<br/><br/>Each player has a pool of dice that he rolls each turn, and then he commits dice to a particular unit's box, according to the type and number of dice that can be placed in that box. For example, the Bohemian Right and his opponent's Catholic League Infantry both use sixes, but the latter can gain at most one die per turn. It's not that the Bohemians are more ferocious or better-led (they're not!), but rather that they are fighting (albeit poorly) from a strong defensive position, while mounting an attack on that position takes time and preparation. When a unit is activated, all the stored dice are removed, and losses are inflicted on the enemy depending on the number of dice.<br/><br/>Or not; one of the signal features of this particular design is the ability of cavalry and artillery to screen and discourage enemy attacks. If I have the right number of dice in my cavalry box when you attack an infantry unit under that cavalry's protection, I can expend those dice to cancel your attack. In fact, it's not just that I can do it, but that I'm required to, and so both the attacking unit and the screening unit have their dice cleared out. When I perform that Reaction, it robs me of the ability to make an Attack on my own turn immediately following. This means that there's a definite cat-and-mouse feel, with each side struggling for control of tempo. You don't want to just prevent your enemy from attacking, you also want to get the leverage you need to launch a successful attack yourself. You want to set up your cavalry so as to screen effectively, but if that's all you're doing, you won't have sufficient dice to press your advantage when it appears.<br/><br/>In general, the Imperial/Catholic League position is a more flexible one, representative of the superiority of their commanders and the bifurcated command structure. Not only may they place in two boxes per turn (one per army), but between them there's at least one box that can potentially utilize each die result. The Bohemian Player on the other hand places in only one box per turn, and any ones, twos, or threes are absolutely worthless. Because of his defensive position, he can place more dice for his infantry divisions - if you roll three sixes, you can place three sixes, while the enemy infantry places at most one at a time.<br/><br/>So, each side has its strengths and weaknesses, and while your decisions are driven by your dice, they are still meaningful decisions. The game typically plays out in less than thirty minutes, with the exact time depending on the aggressiveness of the players.<br/><br/>",

It is operation-level wargame presenting clash of arms that started just after new 1944 year came. Game scenario allows 2-5 Players to play all battle or its variants with 5 available scenarios. Battle involved all German mobile reserves on Eastern front which was exhausted and the losses were hardly recovered.<br/><br/>The battle started on January 24th. Red Army&rsquo;s target was very simple: surround and destroy as many as possible German units in Korsuń pocket. 2 Fronts were to assault concurrently in order to definitely cut off the pocket. It was done after 4 days but it didn&rsquo;t mean the end of the operation.<br/>On January 28th German forces begin to counterattack which grew in strength every day. Battle of Korsuń pocket was very dynamic, neither side managed to entrench therefore almost every position was advanced and attacked immediately. Every German attack was answered with Soviet counter.<br/>Hitler&rsquo;s orders denied retreat and shortening the front line so Germans attack constantly, supported by forces in the pocket vitally interested in the success of relief offensive. Russians who had all the aces at the beginning run out of all the reserves and had to switch into defensive positions. Only when reinforcements of 2nd Armored Army arrived the offensive was resumed.<br/><br/>",

Each structure can contain up to three kinds of blocks: white cubes, black cubes, and black quarter-circles.<br/><br/>Each structure is shown on four identical cards in three views: top, front, and right. Players all take the same card and simultaneously try to build the structure on their own boards. The first player to complete a structure gets two points, unless they make a mistake in which case everyone else gets one point.<br/><br/>There are four sets of challenges of increasing difficulty. Each set has twelve different challenges.<br/><br/>The quarter-circle blocks can be tricky to put in place and in harder challenges you need to hide some blocks to get the right view!<br/><br/>",

Whereas Crops are relatively flimsy and easy to destroy, Animals are permanent. Each Animal will provide many points to your farming operation, assuming you're willing to pay!<br/><br/>The goal for this expansion is to create a balance between tactical Crop management and strategic Animals. It also broadens the strategic choices of the game and adds depth without too much complexity. Players will need to make a choice with their Action cards to lean into animals, crops, or both, to squeak out ahead. Along with the animals will come new Action cards, special animal abilities, and a little bidding to top it off.<br/><br/>In addition to animals, Livestocked and Loaded will introduce Weather Events. These will shake things up so that no game is the same.<br/><br/>The best part is that you won't need to relearn the game. Livestocked and Loaded is built upon the simple framework of the original Farmageddon game. On each turn you're going to Draw Crop cards, Farm and Play Action Cards, then Draw Action cards.<br/><br/>",

Changes include a slight font change (Starting with Magic 2015, an in-house font known as Beleren will be used rather than the Matrix Bold font), the addition of a holofoil stamp in the bottom center of all rare and mythic rare cards, a slightly narrower black border, and a redesign of the collector's info at the bottom of each card. The new border will make it easier for machines to read the cards, helping to prevent mispackaging. Advertising for the set featured the planeswalker Garruk Wildspeaker, with a tagline of &quot;Hunt Bigger Game.&quot;<br/><br/>Magic 2015 includes the mechanic &quot;Convoke&quot;, which originally appeared in Ravnica: City of Guilds. This mechanic allows a player to use their creatures to help cast spells with Convoke. It also includes 15 cards designed by notable non-employee Magic fans, such as Richard Garriott, George Fan, and Notch, some of which also appear in Duels of the Planeswalkers 2015.<br/><br/>",

It is strictly a series of naval and island hopping maneuvering and battles fought in the Pacific. We always wanted to play with the boats more in A&amp;A, but we also wanted to win. The boats and planes are so expensive that no one can really afford to wage much sea war after the first turn or two in A&amp;A. Enter Conquest of the Pacific. Both sides face daunting tasks. Japan has a huge fleet, but has a lot of islands it needs to conquer to win, and ends up being so far away from its supply lines that it usually can't defend everything while still being able to challenge the growing American fleet. America starts the war far from a state of readiness, but its huge economic advantage helps make up for it. The front is close to the US, so supply lines are short, but the Japanese fleet is usually much larger if it can consolidate. This makes for some interesting cat and mouse maneuvering and epic sea battles.<br/><br/>Planes take a large role in Conquest of the Pacific as they are able to:<br/><br/>1. land and take off from islands without it costing a movement point because the island and the sea zone(s) surrounding/adjacent to the island are considered the same zone.<br/><br/>2. project their defensive power one sea zone away from their island base zone during the opponent's combat phase.<br/><br/>3. defensively scramble to attack anything entering their zones of projected power during the opponent's turn on the combat movement and non-combat movement phases.<br/><br/>4. escort other units to protect them from defensive scramblers.<br/><br/>Battleships and Destroyers may bombard every round during an invasion, or once per turn without a land invasion. Battleships and Carriers take two hits to kill and can be repaired at several ports on the map. And, be on the lookout for the Japanese SuperBattleship, the Yamato. It attacks, defends, and bombards at a 5 and takes 3 hits to kill, ouch! It really is fun to get to play with all the expensive pieces!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the most interesting bike race games with a &quot;Tour de France&quot; theme made ever, but unfortunately also one of the rarest, because only 300 boxes were produced by the authors in 1981. And that&acute;s a pity, because all the ingredient's of a great game are there.<br/><br/>Die Tour is a card driven game and all players have 15 cards (1 card = 1 turn) at the start, which they have to work with, until only 2 are left and the hand is filled up again to 15 cards. On these cards are four numbers (= number of fields, the drivers are allowed to move), one for each of the drivers, every team has at the beginning and sometimes special moves for special situations. Each number has to be attached to one of your drivers and the decision how to divide them, is yours.<br/><br/>Rules for group splitting, mountain races, single driver time races and slipstreaming are included in the basic game, but there exists an (even more rare !) advanced rules set, which the authors played with their gaming buddies. Besides various modifications to the basic version, this advanced rules set includes additional rules for group slowing, card exchanges, team time races and more.<br/><br/>Die Tour allows single races (about 60 minutes playing time and there are flat, mountain and time race stages) or an entire campaign game, which is a series of connected stages. Since there are various roads to victory (champion, best mountain driver, highest points and best team), the campaign game is of course the most interesting way, to play Die Tour, because it reduces the effects of luck. But the kings way, to play Die Tour, is to race a campaign game over many gaming nights and to give little prices to the winners in the different categories every evening and bigger prices for the final winners.<br/><br/>An extremely hard to find game, but if you see it somewhere (best chance probably : On flee markets in Berlin-Germany, because the authors are from there), grab it immediately, because you will not regret it !<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Global Chess is pure chess with 64 squares, traditional pieces and traditional moves. The game of chess was developed when armies fought on open fields in distinct formations and the entire battle could be seen from a single vantage point. As warefare and technology have advanced, battles are fought over the limb of the horizon with no edges to the battlefield. This is the transformational premise of Global Chess. There is no backline and no sideline on the Global Chess board. There is nowhere to hide.<br/><br/>Think of a 64 square chessboard wrapped around a globe. Now you can play chess around a sphere with no edges to the game. The problem is that it's difficult to see all the squares at the same time and understand your options. The Global Chess game separates the globe at the equator and flattens them into hemispheres that are geared together. By turning the game you rotate the hemispheres against each other to examine the crossing point of a piece in it's possible trajectories across the hemisphere or through the poles. Turning the board does not alter the relationship of the game pieces to each other.<br/><br/>The easy to understand rules of chess as they pertain to a global playing surface are explained in text and graphic form. The possible strategy is yet to be written! The board is annotated to record game play.<br/><br/>",

The playing time is about half an hour. At the beginning of the game 49 cards are layed out with their face down. Therewith, the hidden cards take the function of a chessfield. The goal of the game is to collect most of the couples. It is not enough, just to remember the position of each card. It is equally important to cleverly plan ahaed your own moves.<br/><br/>THE CONCEPT<br/>Malstrom is published in several editions. For each edition, a, as far as possible, well thumbed book is been used. The single pages of the book are furnished with motives. Out of these pages fragments are generated, which in pairs result in collages. The motives of the respective edition are inspired by the content, the theme, or the author of the book.<br/><br/>Nerved river-silicics with pores, breaches and twinkling inclusions are used as tokens in the game.<br/><br/>The selection of these stones is determined by respective theme and in a way that an ensemble forms. In the basic version, each Malstrom is stored within a cartridge (ca. 25 cm x 35 cm x 4 cm) of 13mm thick three-corrugated cardboard. It contains 49 cards (34 cards with motives, 15 without), four river-silicics, the rules, a copy of the impressums of the used book, the number of the respective game and a signature.<br/><br/>A single cards measures:   ca. 6,5 x 6,5 cm<br/><br/>",

In fact, he dreams of owning his own one day, and is in constant search for all the rainbow colors.<br/><br/>McBiv is growing old though... he no longer has that snap to his stature or that whistle in his stride. His cane is wobbly and his vest is tattered. This being so, he has enlisted the help of young leprechauns, like yourself, to collect these colors and complete his dream.<br/><br/>You can make use of McBiv's magical items along your quest, like his trusty hat or his durable buckets, but don't be irresponsible when it comes to finding those rare colors. In the end, only the first lucky leprechaun to collect these colors will win McBiv&rsquo;s favor and a portion of his gold!<br/><br/>Shenanigans is a leprechaun themed card game where players try to collect sets of colored cards.  Each card is assigned a specific color and action.  Using a rainbow color range, the number of cards available for each color diminishes as you go from red to violet (red being the most common and violet being the rarest).  Players must play the action of one card on their turn, balancing the need to keep rare colored cards with the need to use the abilities those cards possess when played.  The rarer a color is, the more powerful its action will typically be.  When a player collects a set of cards, they call &ldquo;Shenanigans&rdquo; and score a point.  The first player to call &ldquo;Shenanigans&rdquo; three times wins.<br/><br/>",

The first player who has a double nine plays it in the center hub, and the next six dominoes fill in the spaces around the hub to form the chicken legs (if a player cannot match a nine, they draw and play or pass).  After that, players match domino ends until a double is played.<br/><br/>When a double is played, the player presses the hub and normal play is suspended until three chicken &quot;toes&quot; are played.  The next three dominoes must match the double and are played under the double, one angled to the left, one in the center and one angled to the right (to form the chicken foot).  Players who cannot match can draw and play the match, or they must pass.  Play continues until the three toes are completed and normal play resumes either on the chicken toes or any of the chicken legs.<br/><br/>Play ends when a player plays their last domino or the game is blocked (because no plays can be made and the &quot;chicken yard&quot; (spare dominoes) is exhausted.  The player who gets rid of their dominoes scores 0.  The other players count their pips on their remaining dominoes to get their score.  A new round then begins.

These companies start with random values (1-6) and on each turn the active player must change the value of one of them by rolling two dice. They must choose one die which represents the company to change, the other die being the amount of the change, and whether the total of the two dice is odd or even determines whether the value goes up or down.<br/><br/>The player can then purchase up to three shares of one of the two companies rolled, using money printed on the gamesheet; no change is given and when it is used up no more purchases can be made.<br/><br/>The object is to have the greatest total share value and capital when the game ends, which happens when a roll can't be used (each company's value can only be changed a fixed number of times).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All the time tiny bugs were seen whenever we played outdoors in childhood. Sometimes by homework, and sometimes by curiosity, we used to catch bugs with friends. But these days, especially in downtown, we can barely see the bugs. Furthermore, some kinds of bug are very rare. Now let&rsquo;s meet the bugs evanescent and out of sight from us.<br/>The players need to find various kinds of bug as the bug-hunters. We are not trying to collect bugs stuffed and exhibited. Rather, we study and preserve them for the better ecosystem. The conference will be held that everyone pay attention soon. Collect various bugs and be the best bug-hunter!<br/><br/>[Object]<br/>You have to collect various bugs as a bug-hunter. You can collect the bug when you gather all same kind of it in your hand. But it would be a little hard because other bug-hunters also compete for the collection. If you collect the most bugs until the conference(end of game), you will be called the bug expert.<br/><br/>[Game Play]<br/>On your turn, you do 1 action among the 3 actions - Pick, Call and Collect.<br/>Each player holds the cards of bugs and shows their backs to others during play. The backs notices the color of the bug, so players can deduce the cards needed.<br/>By Pick action, you pick only 1 card from specific player.<br/>By Call cation, you call a kind and a color of the bug to specific player. If you success, you get the card and do Call action again.(Until you fail.)<br/>When all cards of same kind of bug are gathered on your hand, you may collect it and get scores.<br/>At the end of your turn, you have to swap a card in your hand with a card in Forest - the array of 3 cards in hidden on the middle of table.(The illustrations of backs are trees.)<br/><br/>[Scoring]<br/>When 7 kinds of bug are collected during play, the game ends immediately. (There are 10 kinds of bug in the game.)<br/>The period of bug hunting has been over, and the anticipated conference is held now. Score 1 point per a card of the collected bugs. (e.g. The bug with 5 colors(cards) scores 5 points.) Sum whole points including the bug collected by items. And the player who has no item card at the end of the game gets -2 points. (It is basic attitude of the bug-hunter to take care of items!)<br/>The player who scores the most points wins a victory.<br/><br/>For details, check the rulebook please.<br/><br/>",

They define the number of seeds players get and the luck of their germination. Thanks to the dice the size of a garden is different in each game. Players must adapt their strategy to it.<br/>The game consists of three rounds - growth, blooming, and harvest. Each turn players draw three cards from the deck. They can swap these new cards once. Then you play them to boost your plants or sabotage others.<br/>But don&rsquo;t get fooled, the task will be indeed daunting. Not only natural disasters like molds or pests, but mainly the malevolence of other players lurk here as only one of you can become the best grower!<br/><br/>The game ends when the last player finishes the third round. Players count the yields from their gardens and write down the values. There will be as many games as there are players.

Based on how well you predicted answers, including your own, you earn (or lose) citation points.

International stars at the end of their career, a script that fits on the edge of a postage stamp, and extras who don't speak the language should ensure your next film has a great career on VOD sites.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, other producers want to shoot the same kind of masterpiece. Under the pretext of a story of clones, twin brothers and other North Korean cosmetic surgeons, the same heads are found in several productions at once. No one can afford to use real stars, so each project hits the screens at the same time, and to decide between them, you have to flatter the viewers' low instincts by being as bad-ass as possible!<br/> Badass Force is the story of this fight, and a tribute to the heroes of action movies where it was fashionable to shoot dozens of extras between two crappy lines.<br/><br/>In Badass Force, the goal is to be the first to achieve 16 victory points on the badassometer. Points are earned by eliminating the opposing characters, but a player is NEVER ELIMINATED from the game.<br/>At the beginning of the game, seven different characters are selected from the ten in the box. Each player retrieves a copy of each of these seven characters and a weapon card. Players then choose a character from their hand and put it face down in front of them. In turn, a player will increase the level of charge of their weapon AND choose an action from five options (changing characters / changing weapons / fetching ammunition by throwing the 2 weapons dice / using their weapon / announcing a Character to use their power): everyone plays in turn order until a winner is declared.<br/>Badass Force is a thematic game, with strong interaction in which one must use bluffing, guessing, hand management, and a little tactics to succeed and being declared the most Badass of all!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the beginning the small treasure cards are shuffled and then put on special fields on the board. Subsequently, the small definition cards are put on the fields at the side of the board. The active player throws all four dice and uses the result, to move two of his figures. In order to receive a small treasure card, two figures must face each other and the treasure card must lie between them after a movement. If the sum of the two figures together is just as large or larger than the numerical value of the small definition card, the treasure may be taken up. The player looks at it secretly and puts it down before him. Each player may have only one treasure of each of the six different kind of treasures. If a player takes up a second small treasure card, he decides afterwards, which of the two treasures he keeps and which he gives to a fellow player, who still doesn't possess the appropriate card. Apart from collecting small cards, later in play players increasingly duel each other. If a figure reaches the field of an opposing figure they fight a duel, if they have the same kind of treasure. The aggressor chooses whether he would like to make a duel with or without treasure cards. In a duel without treasure cards each player throws a dice and adds its result to the value of his figure. The attacker wins, if he has a higher total result than the defender. In the duel with treasure maps the attacker selects a treasure sort, which both players possess. The opponents uncover their treasures, and add the result of a dice throw and the value of the figure. The attacker wins again, if he has a higher total result than the defender. The loser is banished and the figure is again placed in front of the suitable entrance and must be brought back into play from there. <br/>The game is over, when all players possess the six different kinds of treasure. The small treasure cards are uncovered and the individual numerical values of each treasure are multiplied by the numerical value of the small definition cards.

The Korean version of dominoes are called kol-hpai (meaning &quot;bone tablets&quot;) or sometimes ho-hpai (&quot;Barbarian tablets&quot;) - possibly linked to the attitude of the korean nobility towards the game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tComponentsChinese Dominoes  differ from Western Dominoes in the number and distribution of the tiles, as well as the games that are traditionally played with them.<br/><br/>A set consists of 32 tiles of a double-six pattern, distributed as follows:<br/>Two copies of 1-1, 1-3, 1-5, 1-6, 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 4-6, 5-5, 5-6 and 6-6.<br/>One copy of 1-2, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6 and 4-5.<br/><br/>These differ from Western Dominoes in that they have no blanks.  The tiles are made up of the 21 different combinations of two six-sided dice thrown, plus the 11 &quot;duplicate copies&quot; listed above.<br/><br/>The pips for one and four are colored red.  All other numbers are white, with the exception of six, which is half-and-half.  These colors have significance in the Chinese games.  Asian Dice have the one and four pips colored red as well.<br/><br/>Pai Gow and Tien Gow (Sky Nine) are popular games played with Chinese Dominoes.<br/><br/>",

Therefore, despite his young age, he bravely explores an old abandoned castle, armed only with his camera, looking for naughty ghosts.<br/>It will not be easy because ghosts will try to confuse the young detective.<br/><br/>Will you help him?<br/><br/>Initially, players spread all ghost cards in the middle of the table facing up. Cards show different combinations of the 4 colored ghosts. At the beginning of each round players roll all 4 colored dice. Then, by simultaneously picking ghost cards, they try to collect a ghosts' combination that exactly matches with the dice result. Fast reasoning and a sharp eye will turn out to be crucial, as taken cards can't be put back on the table. <br/>As soon as a player feels satisfied, he/she calls for the round's end. Then all players stop picking cards and see what they got. Players get minus points for each ghost over or less than the dice result.<br/>At the end of the fifth round, the player with the least minus points wins the game.<br/><br/>2 optional rules are included. They help change the game mechanics.<br/><br/>",

A volunteer army, comprised mainly of hardened Civil War veterans, was established for the purpose of an invasion of Canada. The Fenians reasoned that territory seized from British controlled Canada could be bartered for Irish independence. Army of Ireland is a tactical level recreation of the historically significant Battle of Ridgeway, where encroaching Fenians clashed with spirited Canadian militia in what is now Ontario.

        "description": "Brasil is a game about gold-mining in 18th-century Brazil when Bandeirantes (explorers) started to travel through the country and discovered a new region of &quot;black gold&quot; along the way. The &quot;sugar rush&quot; was coming to an end in the northeast part of the country and near the city-to-be of Vila Rica, a whole new region of precious metal was suddenly one of the most important suppliers of the old world. Hundreds of thousands of men came from everywhere once word spread, and a number of small but relevant locations started to grow near Vila Rica.<br/><br/>Most of the wealth in Europe had its origins in the colonies of that time. Brazil, for example, was the number one provider of gold, and Portugal lived a prosperous long time from it. Some people maintain that the industrial revolution was in part financed by the metal that came from Brazil.<br/><br/>The game of Brasil is played with cards. More than a simple game about mining, it requires that players combine actions to develop the region by building essential infrastructures like houses, stores, farms, churches and roads. Players build their path to wealth by keeping in mind the changing characteristics of the region, the moves and needs of other players, and the common good of the vibrant and prosperous Vila Rica.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chaos reigns in the wake of the king's death. People are starving, the roads are dangerous to travel and the nation's foreign enemies have begun to stir at the borders. The kingdom cries out for a new ruler - and you are the head of a minor house who intend to answer that call... if you can do so before your adversaries take what should be yours.<br/><br/>Now is your chance. Restore order under your rule and claim the throne for yourself.<br/><br/>In Crown of Exile players compete to seize control of a kingdom at the verge of a dark age while guarding themselves from opponents with ambitions of their own, and underhanded ways of interfering.<br/><br/>Crown of Exile is a game for 2-5 players that takes 90 minutes to play. The rules are simple to learn but offer a depth of strategy that will keep both experienced gamers and newcomers scheming and plotting over and over again.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>Crown of Exile is a game about developing your domain and deciding when you have built enough to risk taking on quests. Move too quickly and your opponents might interfere, leaving you unable to fulfill your quests, but move too slowly and someone else will take what could have been yours. You can be an aggressor and try to steal what others have as a means to victory, subtly manipulate the flow of the game with political influence, or trade to gain enormous resources quickly, but give your rivals the opportunity to profit.<br/><br/>In Crown of Exile players begin with a hand of cards representing their domain - a treasury, serfs, nobles, and infantry, they also begin with a knight and a construction card. Unlike other deckbuilding games Crown of Exile gives you access to all of your drafted cards, but limits players to only four each round, forcing players to balance generating resources versus expansion and conquest.<br/><br/>Each round players will use four of their cards to generate resources, attack, trade, draft new cards and complete quests that will grant them various bonuses, including titles and victory points needed to win the game.<br/><br/>Once completed, quests require you to pay an upkeep cost to maintain the order and control you have established, and keep the advantages provided by those quests. So as you gain power and complete more quests your resources will become strained- and your opponents may attempt to sabotage you and try to steal your quests by preventing you from gaining the necessary resources.<br/><br/>At the end of every round players pay their upkeeps and gain bonuses based on their titles and quests and then pick up all of their cards and begin another round. Play continues until one player has achieved the rank of &quot;Prince&quot; or 8 rounds have elapsed.<br/><br/>",

The player begins by drawing cards to create a randomized character with a starting temperament. Card draws will also determine the goal the character must achieve by the dream's end in order for the player to win.<br/><br/>Storytelling then begins by drawing cards to create an Encounter.

The player must immediately write about the generated Encounter, including all of the prompts and the location while attempting to move the character closer to their goal.<br/><br/>Some Encounters will prompt the player to generate an Event. Two cards from the Event deck will determine what is happening as well as the tone. These cards too include surreal artwork for inspiration.

During each turn, players alternate picking &quot;command markers,&quot; which designate the sub-command within their force they may then use to conduct operations. The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, may conduct attacks with the units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &quot;heroism markers&quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.<br/><br/>In this game, each turn represents between one week and one month, depending on the time of year, and each hexagon on the map represents 10 miles across. Units of maneuver for the US Army are primarily battalions, while Indian units are warbands, awarded one strength point for each 80 to 120 individuals within them.<br/><br/>Low complexity, 280 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There has been a zombie outbreak! The cameras focus in a small town, where a band of clich&eacute; characters has holed up, waiting for rescue. It never comes. Worse still, the zombies continue to grow in number and intelligence. A conclusion is drawn: If the characters wish to survive, they must make a break for the outskirts and escape the town. Will anyone be left when the credits roll?<br/><br/>PostHumousZ is a team based zombie survival horror game. Each player controls a single human character or horde of themed zombies. A modular town is randomly laid out each game, with the safe house at one end and the escape on the other. Likewise, every character and zombie theme is randomly generated by combining 3 cards giving each player, and team, its own strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>The humans must move through the town to the escape, collecting items, rescuing nameless survivors (extras), fighting zombies, and hiding at strategic moments. Zombies killed by the characters are taken as points, and are spent to activate abilities and buy powerful plot changing cards (H-cards). The zombies in turn spawn and direct the undead, collect hunger (zombies&rsquo; resource) and use their cards and abilities to overwhelm the humans before they escape. Unlike the humans, the zombies&rsquo; plot cards (Z-cards) are drawn freely over time as well as purchased, meaning the clock is against the living. Gameplay is dynamic as both teams are affected by random events and changes in their opponents&rsquo; strategy.<br/><br/>PostHumousZ 295 unique cards add near endless variation, depth, drama and humor to each game, while simple base rules and bold art make it quick to learn, easy to keep track of, and low on downtime.<br/><br/>",

The players are &quot;Radiatov&quot;, a race of aliens who want to collect artwork from particular games.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player receives ten cards (with some cards removed for fewer than six players and a smaller hand size for 7-8 players) as well as a secret goal card. Cards come in five suits valued from 2 to A. The top card of the remaining deck is revealed to show a trump suit, and three of the 30 characters are laid face-up.<br/><br/>The trick-taking in Dieci is fairly standard: One player leads a card, with everyone else following suit if possible and throwing off (or playing trump) if not possible. The highest trump card claims all cards in the trick; if no trump was played, then the highest card regardless of suit wins the trick. The player claiming the trick must then claim one face-up character card bearing a suit played in that trick; if no such character is face-up, the player claims the top character card from the deck. Going clockwise, each player then claims a remaining character card or passes; once everyone has passed or all characters have been claimed, the next trick begins.<br/><br/>Once the character deck runs out, the game ends. Players score:<br/><br/><br/>    One point for each card claimed.<br/>    A variable number of points (0-20) depending on how many characters they took that are shown on their secret goal card.<br/>    Their lowest-valued character card in each of the five suits. For each other character in a suit, they lose points equal to that character's value.<br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Players simultaneously search for parties (symmetric collections of four icons, see below for more), shouting &quot;Party!&quot; when they find one, after which they put it together to show the group and flip the four blocks used.<br/><br/>For a more finite and competitive version, players can keep score (often with tokens or Block Party cards) where the first player to 10 parties wins. This number can be changed to alter the duration of the game, or set per player to handicap and make for a fair race.<br/><br/>",

Players can move their chosen heroes ( each one gets uniquely powered and equipped ) up to two tiles. If there's no tile to move in, you may draw　as many tiles as you need from a stock for placement.<br/><br/>Tile by tile, the mansion would gradually reveal itself to players. On their explorations, your heroes sustain mental/physical damages ( your  characters might go mad or die if it's too much to bear ), fight off some deadly monsters, and discover powerful artifacts to help your team keep on.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Prime Number Lv.0, a.k.a. 素数大富豪 Lv.0, prime numbers meet Daifugo, the most popular climbing game in Japan, resulting in a Daifugo game with a twist. Prime Number Lv.0 is a re-implementation of 素数大富豪 (Prime Daifugo) with changes made for easier play and for the incorporation of hand management during the game.<br/><br/>Shuffle the deck, then deal ten cards to each player. The leader plays any prime number from a combination of 1-3 cards (see below), then in clockwise order, players may pass or play a larger prime number than the most recently played prime using the same number of cards as the leader. (A player can optionally draw a card from the deck prior to playing.) The round continues until no player wants to play. The last player who played a valid number leads the next round. If you get rid of all cards in your hand, you win the round and whoever first wins two rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>To play a prime number, take 1-3 cards from your hand and arrange them to create a single number by using all the digits on those cards. If the number is prime, your play is valid. For example, if playing &quot;3&quot; and &quot;5&quot;, you may arrange their order and play them only as &quot;53&quot; because &quot;35&quot; is not a prime number. To play three cards, all of the cards must have single digits on them (so you can't use &quot;10&quot; or &quot;12&quot;) and at least one of the cards must feature a &quot;play three&quot; icon.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>素数と大富豪と素数の素敵な出会い！<br/>普通の大富豪とは一味違ったゲームです。<br/><br/>元々トランプゲームで遊ばれていた「素数大富豪」をより遊びやすくアレンジしたものです。<br/>遊びやすくなっただけでなく、ハンドマネジメントによるゲーム性がより高いものに進化しています！<br/><br/>【ルール概要】<br/>各プレイヤー10枚のカードが配られた状態でゲームが始まります。<br/>大富豪と同じように、プレイヤーがカードをプレイする時、親が出した枚数と同じ枚数で、かつ前のプレイヤーが出した数字よりも大きい数字をプレイする必要があります。手札を全て出し切ったプレイヤーが勝利です。<br/>通常の大富豪と違う点、それは「プレイするカードが素数でなくてはならない」ということです。<br/>複数枚のカードをプレイする場合はその数字を並べたものが、プレイした数字となります。例えば 3 と 7 をプレイすると決めた場合。<br/>1枚目を3、2枚目を5とすれば「35」になり<br/>1枚目を5、2枚目を3とすれば「53」になります。<br/>この場合35は素数ではないので、53としてプレイすることになります。<br/><br/>その他細かいルールもあるので詳しくは説明書を見てください。<br/>（2018年11月現在、英語版の説明書は作成中です）<br/><br/>",

A 4x4 grid of matching cards of each cat picture are placed face down. The active player plays a card from her hand, then flips three cards in the grid face up. If these cards match the card from her hand, she scores it. She may then attempt to match a second card from her hand, etc.<br/><br/>Cat Hiding DX includes components for five variant editions of the game, including a new type of target card and cat dice.<br/><br/>",
