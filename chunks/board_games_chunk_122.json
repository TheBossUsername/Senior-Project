        "description": "This Parker Brothers game is different from the 1938 release with the same name. The 1956 version is a simple track game in which players play the parts of the Lone Ranger and Tonto. The board depicts the Wild West including trails and hideouts for outlaws. On your turn, you roll the dice and either move the Lone Ranger piece the amount shown on the white die, or the Tonto piece the amount shown on the colored die (all players move the same two pieces). If you land on a Star space next to a hideout, you spin the &quot;Six Shooter&quot; spinner to see if you score a hit. If you did, you turn over the disk on the hideout. If it has a bandit's name, you keep the disc and will score the points shown on it. If, however, the disc reads &quot;Ambush&quot;, then the piece that was ambushed is captured and placed on the hideout space. A captured piece is released and returned to the Sheriff's Office if a player rolls doubles. When all the disks have been turned over, the game ends and the player with the highest point total wins.<br/><br/>",

The result is a fast-paced puzzle game requiring quick thinking and even quicker fingers! Players manipulate sixteen stone tiles to form the patterns (Runes) needed to cast spells at their opponents. Will your Fireball best your opponent's Heat Shield? It all depends on who can build his Runes the fastest.<br/><br/>Consists of a rulebook, 32 &quot;stone&quot; tiles (cut from a stone-like flooring material and hand-painted; this game was most definitely a basement production by the designer), and two complete sets of spell cards (DTP quality). Rated for ages 10-adult. Each set supports 2 players, so you can add more sets for multi-player battles. The game comes with 22 spell cards for each player for use in a 2-player game, and 16 more for each player that are designed for multi-player use only.<br/><br/>",

The cards are dealt, face down, in a 4-by-5 rectangle.  Players take turns flipping two cards face up; if they match, the player keeps the pair and goes again, otherwise the cards are flipped face down and the turn passes to the next player.  One minor rule that I don't remember from the original Memory game is that, once a pair is removed, the holes that are thus formed are immediately filled by shifting cards to the right.<br/><br/>Flying Aces, played with the cards depicting the airplanes, is a variant of War.  Each player is given a stack of cards; everyone places their top card face up in the center of the table, and if exactly one player plays a Sea Duck, they win all the cards; otherwise, it's a tie, and everyone goes again.<br/><br/>",

Your tabloid is seeking to have the best stories in the business. Deal the cards and write some headlines!&quot;<br/><br/>Self-published game consisting of 96 word cards, a few blank cards and a couple of quick-reference cards. Each word card has 4 different words on it along with either a positive sign ( + ) or a negative sign ( - ). Words are articles, nouns, verbs, adjectives or adverbs. Different symbols correspond to the different parts of speech.<br/><br/>Everyone is dealt 10 cards face down (your personal pile) and players then draw 3 of those cards to form a hand. Remaining cards form a draw pile. On your turn, you may start a headline with a noun or article card, add a card to your headline (following normal sentence structure), add a card to someone else's headline (if you have a headline of your own started) or pass (and draw a card from the draw pile). If you use a card from your hand, you draw a card from your personal pile. Headlines must start with a noun or article and must contain at least 2 nouns and 1 verb. The headline is completed and set aside when the second noun is placed.<br/><br/>The round continues until a player runs out of cards from both their personal pile and their hand. Each player then scores their completed headlines. Incomplete headlines do not score any points. Subtract the number of negative cards from the number of positive cards in the headline. If the result is positive, this is your score. If the result is negative, take the absolute value as your score (e.g. you get 4 points for a score of -4).<br/><br/>The first player to reach a score of 10 wins the game. However, &quot;The primary purpose of RAG is to be entertaining. Many of the headlines will be funny. Some of them will be VERY funny! Enjoy the game and laugh a lot. Laughing is good for you!&quot;<br/><br/>",

This game dates from the 1960s, when metered parking was relatively new in the UK.<br/><br/>The board shows a network of one- and two-way roads and a number of parking bays.  Using numbers rolled on 2 dice the players must move each of their cars from the starting garage to a bay. Exact moves only, and no reversing!  There are some traffic lights on the board which at times allow or deny access along certain roads.<br/><br/>The player's turn consists of move one or two cars, then take a card. The cards are:<br/><br/>Parking meter - collect 4 of these<br/>Warden - immediately pay &pound;1 for each parked car<br/>Tame Warden - retain and use to counteract a Warden<br/>Speeding - immediately pay a &pound;2 fine<br/>Traffic Lights - change the lights<br/>Bank - retain until able to stop outside a Bank, then collect &pound;5<br/><br/>Players can bump another parked car out of a bay, unless the owner has a Meter card for each car parked.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes 2 picture cards from the deck and places them face down on the table. The pictures on the cards (skateboard, hot dog etc.) show the spaces on the board owned by that player. On your turn, you begin advancing your pawn one space at a time along the track. You must get permission to enter a space owned by another player by saying &quot;May I&quot; and the name of the player that owns the space. If you do not ask permission, the owner says &quot;Stop!&quot;, reveals the picture card and turns it face down again. You say nothing on an unowned space. You may continue moving as long as you don't make a mistake, so as more and more cards are revealed, players can travel further and further along the track during a turn. The first player to reach the finish space wins. For a more challenging game, players may draw 3, 4 or 5 cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game's subtitle, 'A playful introduction to the people and cultures of Africa' is perhaps overstating things. This game consists of rolling and moving around the board collecting things that are supposed to tell us about Africa (coconuts, tree, necklace, fish, mask, drum, hut...). Each player has a board with pictures of 9 of the 16 objects to be collected and rolls the die to move around the board and fill up her or his board. The only further 'complication' is that there are some arrow squares on the board, some pointing clockwise, some anticlockwise. It would appear that landing on these squares can change the direction the player is going in. Landing on any other square gets one of the objects, if its one the player needs.<br/><br/>This is intended as a child's first game. My copy is missing the rulebook, but it isn't hard to surmise the basic rules.<br/><br/>",

Three games may be played...<br/><br/>The Winning Team: Four cards are dealt to each player and face-up on the table. On your turn, if you can match a card from your hand to a card on the table, you take both cards and place them face-up in a pile in front of you. If you can match a card to the top card on an opponent's pile, you may take the player's entire pile of cards. When no more plays can be made, the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Sport Snap: The deck is dealt out evenly among the players. All players simultaneously turn over their top card. If no cards match, turn over another card. If two or more cards match, the first player to call out a correct matching sport wins all stacks with that card on top. If you make a wrong call, you must give 1 card to each opponent. The player that wins all the cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Spoons: Spoons are placed in the center of the table (one less than the number of players). Each player gets 4 cards. The dealer draws a card and either keeps it or passes it to the next player who also can either keep it or pass it etc. As soon as you have a complete set of 4 cards, take a spoon. All players then grab for the remaining spoons. The player who doesn't get one receives a letter - first an &quot;S&quot;, followed by a &quot;P&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, and finally an &quot;N&quot;. When one player has spelled out SPOON the game ends and the player with the least number of letters wins.<br/><br/>",

All of these consume energy that has to be supplied.

The basis for the conflict revolves around the shortage of a mineral called &quot;galactium&quot; used to power the propulsion systems of starships and vehicles.  The Triton empire has invaded the mining planet Abarathascan (renamed Triton II after the invasion by the Tritons) to gain control of the galactium supply.  The Megan Confederation will have none of that and hence the invasion of Triton.<br/><br/>The game is played on 3 separate 8-1/2&quot; x 11&quot; hex maps depicting the main mining centers of Triton II.  Basic wargame mechanics such as Zones of control, Combat results tables, Terrain Effects Tables, describe the basic gameplay.  Both sides use transport ships to move ground units between maps.  Production points are alloted at the beginning of gameplay, used by each side to purchase their forces.  All space craft movement over the planet surface is conducted in a simultaneous plot mechanism.  Bases on the planet surface can be used to repair damaged craft or vehicles.  Victory conditions are determined by the scenario and involve accumulating victory points obtained by occupying the planets resource centers.<br/><br/>",

With 5 cards to each family, there are cards for the father, wife, son, daughter and the family symbol.<br/><br/>Cards are shuffled and dealt evenly to all players.  Each player in turn freely asks any player for a specific card, if that player has the card asked for, the player must give that card to the person asking.  Play continues for the asking player until the person asked does not have the card asked for and the turn goes to the next player.<br/><br/>Once a set of Family cards is collected it is laid on the table and retired from play (scoring no points for the player).  The object is to be the player that lays down the last Family set<br/><br/>A twist in the mechanics of the game adds fun to the gameplay.  Anytime a card is given to a player, the receiver must say &quot;Thank You&quot;, if the receiver fails to do so, the first person to say &quot;Duster&quot; receives all of the cards from the person that neglected to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.  The person receiving the cards must in turn say &quot;Thank You&quot; or is subject to the same &quot;Duster&quot; rule.<br/><br/>The person that did not say &quot;Thank You&quot; and lost all of their cards can not be spoken to.  They do not get any additional cards, but if someone speaks to this person, then the first person (any player) to say &quot;Duster&quot; receives the cards of the person that spoke to the person with no cards (and again, &quot;Thank You&quot; must follow receipt of the cards or the &quot;Duster&quot; rule applies again)<br/><br/>",

It is designed to be fun and educational.<br/><br/>Sign It! was born out of necessity. The creator is a 50 year old cabinet maker with a progressive hearing loss. While taking ASL classes, he searched in vain for a teaching tool to help him and his wife practice ASL and increase their vocabularies, and subsequently developed Sign It! to fill this need.<br/><br/>The Sign it! board game which includes a board a rule booklet and markers for six players, provides instruction for learning 824 signs. The game also comes with a copy of &quot;Signing Illustrated&quot; :The complete learning Guide, a 258 page illustrated and indexed reference book.<br/><br/>Sign It! contains a set of cards (which cover more than eight categories), a rule booklet, one die and markers for six players.<br/><br/>The game is setup reminiscent of Trivial Pursuit, with color coded squares.Each person gets a token (I was the elephant) then rolls the die. As expected,what ever the number you rolled...that's the number of spaces you moved. The color of the square is the color you look at on the card. Then you sign that word.<br/><br/>Colors are categories such as feelings, communication, locations, and more.On the card next to the words are page numbers for the accompanying book where you can find the appropriate sign. The game can be purchased with the reference book, &quot;Signing Illustrated&quot; by Mickey Flodin, which includes well drawn illustration, clear directions and even little reminder hints to help you remember new signs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the game's site: <br/>SCALE: Tactical. Time and distance scales unstated. Each model represents an individual spacecraft.<br/>PERIOD: &quot;3600 A.D., a time when fragmented human empires first come into contact with an alien menace (the Vallarri).&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This game is a space fighter boardgame for which custom miniatures are available. Players can design their own fighters or use pre-designed plans. Weapons include lasers, cannons and missiles; defenses are armor and shields. Fighters move in an order determined by their tactics and the pilot's skill level, and firing can take place during movement. Damage results in critical hits, which limit or eliminate ship systems or wear the starcraft down until structure failure occurs. Rules allow players to form squadrons, then fight a series of individual battles or a linked campaign. Background material (optional) details six human empires and one alien power.&quot;<br/><br/>The Game's Components consists of the following:<br/>'56'-page rulebook (includes record forms)<br/>'4'-(four) 11&quot; x 17&quot; mapsheets (black with hexgrid)<br/>'2'-(two) countersheets (counters must be cut out)<br/>The game includes a rule book with rules for both Basic and Standard games. Two full-color countersheets are included along with a hex-map so that you can start playing immediately. Dice are not included. Three 6-sided dice and one 10-sided die are required for the Basic game, while the Standard game requires one 4-sided die, three 6-sided dice, one 8-sided die, one 10-sided die and one 12-sided die.<br/>The rulebook contains 21 pre-designed fighters, each associated with one or more of the political entities of the 37th century. Although an official set of miniatures is available, these rules are suitable for use with any space fighter models of appropriate size.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives seven coloustrokes at random and the object of the game is to collect or swap colourstrokes in order to obtain the set of seven colourstrokes which are the principal colours apparent in that player's art card. This is harder than it might seem - there are, for example, quite a few very similar shades of white. <br/> This game is principally designed to test a player's ability to match colours, but there is some luck introduced in the use of a spinner which can alternatively enable a player to win or lose colourstrokes.<br/><br/>",

Although the goals remain the same, wars are no longer fought by people in uniform.  Today's wars are fought by the groups that hold the real power in today's society.  Political factions are puppets to these entities, armies and military might are under their control.

        "description": "It is over 200 years since the first of the terran colonists landed on the uninhabited and unsuspecting planet of Neo-earth. Humans have begun to establish a new history of wanton destruction and unbridled creativity. The Singularity rift that eventually will lead to the establishment of a utopia is centuries away in the future. The fledgling nation of U.S.N.A. originally set up by the North Americans of old earth is fast becoming one of the most powerful of the industrial states.<br/><br/>As nations formed and the population began to be settled the media was there to cover it. Whenever a settler put a spade in the ground, wiped out a species or did something horrible to another human being a camera was there. The media became the chronicler of the pioneering years, and more. To forget the hardships of day-to-day living the Neo-earthlings immersed themselves in all forms of entertainment sims, V.R. and finally real combat TV. Beginning as fighting matches between professional athletes it quickly evolved to include audience participation. Teams of home viewers roamed across elaborate battlegrounds beating the snot out of each other for the sake of entertainment. These &quot;teams&quot; eventually became fighting orders with their own particular combat styles. As long as TV audiences could see a New Texan housewife savagely mauling an accountant from Maine with a pain-wand each week real combat TV continued to be a success.<br/><br/>Nobody knows exactly when FENRIR (Fusion Engine Non-Robotic Intercept Raider) was invented. Originally developed as support for conventional army forces, they began to be used in the frontier areas and in civilian &quot;control&quot; situations. The executives of the NABC (Neo-American Broadcasting Corporation) weren't slow to adopt this new technology and use FENRIR in their real combat events. Unable to construct artificial battlegrounds of a sufficient size the media networks purchased the ruins of Harmony, the former capital of the USNA state of Piermont that had been destroyed during the conflict with the Ontarians. In this city-sized arena the combatants now range across the landscape in giant FENRIR machines dealing devastation to the opposing team(s). The ultimate televised combat sport is born!<br/><br/>In PIKE: City arena each person controls one of the four major real combat &quot;teams&quot;. The object is to crush the opposition while putting on the most entertaining show for the cameras.<br/><br/>",

To do this, you must roll combinations of dice and color cubes and move your men through an exit triangle, hazard hexagon, safety zones, alien colors and goal paths. If that's not enough, there's also the danger of being 'bumped' by other players!<br/><br/>&quot;COLOPTION can be played by two to six players which immediately makes it more sociable than backgammon which is played as a twosome. A round is over when all of one player's men have either reached the goal or been bumped. A round usually lasts from fifteen to thirty minutes. Play can be for several rounds as in backgammon or for point totals as in bridge.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each section has a number of star systems which produce varying amounts of credit, and have no other characteristics.  Players use their controlled credit each turn to build or upgrade their ships.<br/>Ships have two characteristics, movement speed and combat strength - players choose the values of these by how much they spend.<br/><br/>Interest is added by the technological advances which can be purchased.  Some of these are permanent, such as Hyperdrive, which lets one ship per turn move an unlimited distance, or Capture, which lets you capture enemy ships if you have a 3:1 advantage, while some are temporary, such as Force Field, which protects a system for one turn.  (Capture will sound familiar to players of Flying Buffalo's Starweb play-by-mail game - most of the Starweb abilities are in fact reproduced here.)  Each advance can only be purchased a given number of times per game (depending on the number of players), so players will be forced to use different mixes of abilities.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to control a given quantity of credit production.<br/><br/>",

There they are to achieve dominance over the local population, grow a crop for the aliens and, in the ensuing climactic holocaust, be almost wiped out and, therefore, not become a threat to the aliens.<br/><br/>At the time depicted by the game the [aliens] have just bagged a new group of Earthlings and taken them to the planet. This group is from 1979 and is a bunch of mercenaries on the losing side of an African civil war. They have been grabbed from a soon to be terminally untenable position. They have been taken to a planet where the society that has grown up around the survivors of previous recruiting drives consists of several warring states peopled by Medieval feudal kingdoms and knights, Roman legions, pony riding barbarians and Egyptian pharaohs. The game finds the few mercenaries, having allied themselves with the European kingdoms, at war with the local Roman empire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Original Intersection TM&quot; is the humorously intended title of a game that owes almost all of its creative inspiration to Parcheesi, the Westernized version itself of Pachisi.  The designers are simply experimenting to see how little they have to change to come up with their own game that will make them a million dollars in royalties, (or at least a tidy income so they can design MORE games without otherwise having to work) and thus, avoiding copyright infringement lawsuits.  As such, it IS a useful and instructive game, as it is almost certain that they would have made more money had they simply reproduced the original public domain version and sold it.<br/><br/>The game differs from Parcheesi in that it has a jazzier layout, where the players move in a more complicated journey around a mazelike path of concentric circles.  An additional option is the ability to play as a &quot;partner&quot; with other players, moving your partner's  pieces once yours are all safely &quot;home&quot;.<br/><br/>Though the board itself IS reasonably attractive, this is purely a &quot;novelty&quot; game, purchased for no other reason than that probably nobody else had ever seen it.  It is one step away from a total &quot;home production&quot;, in that the parts are made nearly as cheaply as possible.  Indeed, though it looks totally unplayed, the box is so flimsily designed, that it is bent in several places.  The tokens are push pins with the pins removed to save production costs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alternative Armies' second attempt at a game in their Ion Age universe, this transports the action to the world of Golgotha, the &quot;last battlefield&quot; of the Great War.  It also modifies the background found in the Firefight game which ostensibly takes place in the same setting.  It uses the Ion Age miniatures produced by their company.<br/><br/>There are 3 factions - the Confederacy, the Khanate and the Trators (a mixture of mercenaries and scavengers).  Players can play in either 15mm or 28mm scale - the army lists differ, with the smaller scale featuring larger vehicles like tanks.  A points buy system is provided - players will control a squad or two in a typical game.<br/><br/>The basic game system is fairly straightforward, using a 10-sided die and centimeters.  All players move (using jumpacs for extra speed), then all units fire, with the latter normally being simultaneous.  Roll to hit - on a successful hit, you inflict damage, generally by chipping away at the opponent's armor and wound totals.  Heavy weapons will generally vaporize a target in one hit and have enormous ranges - consequently they dominate the game.  Finally, there is melee, which, as is typical for a science-fiction game, is generally more lethal than ranged combat.<br/><br/>The game itself could either be purchased as a PDF file or as a bound rulebook of about 94 pages (11 of them rules with another 17 pages of optional rules, most of which are geared towards providing a campaign system).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Krylons invaded New Jersey one day. They had nothing personal against the Garden State, but they wanted to conquer New York City so they&rsquo;d have a place to park, and they needed a base of operations. The Jerseyites were annoyed enough at being invaded. But being told that their state was just a stepping stone to New York was the last straw. As one, they rose up to fight for their homeland.<br/><br/>They didn&rsquo;t have much to fight with. The federal government refused to intervene, because the Krylons&rsquo; green cards were all in order. The National Guard could help, if they could mobilize in time. Some of the state&rsquo;s more militant citizens needed no encouragement to take up arms against the alien invaders. And a mad scientist in Newark (every cheesy sci-fi story needs a mad scientist) figured out how to turn pleasure boats and junk cars into impromptu spacecraft. But the aliens had big advantages in firepower and mobility.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the Krylons didn&rsquo;t bring much of their advanced technology to bear. Their code of honor forced them to fight at the level of their intended victims, and they turned to the New Jersey media to determine what that level should be. Luckily, the Krylons&rsquo; cable TV had been cut off due to a billing error; they could only get one channel on their TV sets, and that channel was running a barbarian-movie festival that day. So the alien spaceships began disgorging their equivalents of Cossacks and Roman legions, thinking them adequate for the task of subduing the Garden State.<br/><br/>Boy, were they in for a shock.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dead Slug, players roll five six-sided dice and, if they can build certain shapes, continue to roll and accumulate points. It plays very much like many bar room dice games.<br/><br/>You need two+ players, five six-sided dice, and a way to keep score.<br/><br/>On your turn, roll all five dice. Pull aside only the highest dice rolled (including doubles), AND any &lsquo;attached&rsquo; dice. An attached die is one that is sequenced one number lower than the high die (or dice). Ex: rolling two 6&rsquo;s, a 5, and three 2&rsquo;s, only the 6&rsquo;s and the 5 are pulled aside. Rolling a 4 and four 1&rsquo;s, only the 4 is pulled. Note that 1 has no lower attached dice (just as you can&rsquo;t roll higher than a 6).<br/><br/>These &lsquo;pulled&rsquo; dice occupy imaginary tiers in a &lsquo;shape matrix&rsquo; (see completed shapes in the image section). Whatever your highest die is (or dice are), place it (or them) into the topmost tier of what will become your shape (if completed), and place any attached dice in the next tiers down. Ex: rolling a 6, two 5&rsquo;s, a 2, and a 1, the 6 and the 5&rsquo;s are pulled into the top two tiers (the roller is on her way to several possible shapes&mdash;Praying Mantis, Snowman, etc.).<br/><br/>Pick up any dice that aren&rsquo;t pulled into the shape matrix and roll them again. The tier system continues, as long as the roller has thrown any &lsquo;attached&rsquo; dice that would occupy the next lowest tier. Only the lowest filled tier is considered &lsquo;open&rsquo; for attached dice, in that you can match the number occupying that lowest tier (in addition to rolling the next lowest number). Ex: the first roll &lsquo;pulled&rsquo; three 5&rsquo;s, which all occupy the top tier (possible shapes include Little T, Beret, Dead Slug, etc.) &ndash; the other dice (we&rsquo;ll say a 2 and a 1) are picked back up and re-rolled. Second roll: another 5 and a 6 (the 6 cannot be placed above the 5 and will be re-rolled); the 5 is pulled alongside the existing 5&rsquo;s (roller is on his way to a Dead Slug or a Beret). Third roll gets a 1. The roller&rsquo;s turn ends and the dice are passed to the next player. Had the roller gotten another 5 or a 4, a shape would have been created and the roller would receive the appropriate points and would be &lsquo;still rolling&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Keep rolling, as long as at least one die can be pulled (from each subsequent roll) and played legally. Only if a shape is completed: players may decide to stop and score the points for the shape, OR roll all five dice again, continuing to accumulate points. If a player ever decides to keep rolling and is unable to complete a shape in subsequent rolls, that player &lsquo;bombs out&rsquo; and scores zero points. A player must accumulate at least 2,000 consecutive points before &lsquo;being on the board&rsquo; for the first time only. Once players are on the board, they may choose to score anytime they complete a shape.<br/><br/>To win: score 10,000 points. Longer game? Score to 20,000, etc.<br/><br/>Variation: For a slightly longer (but more exciting) game, have the Black Widow and the Skull take away 800 points apiece, BUT only if they are rolled completely on the first roll (they can still be &lsquo;built&rsquo; for positive points). Have fun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mestieri (The Game of Trades) is an Italian card-game using a non-standard deck of 52 cards for 2 or 4 players. The cards are divided into 4 suits, each suit representing a trade: Mechanic, Bricklayer, Farmer or Carpenter. The cards within each suit do not have ranks and display tools or supplies that trade would use. For example, the Farmer cards include seed, a tractor and a scythe. Some cards belong to more than one suit (e.g. the bucket belongs to both the Bricklayer and Farmer suits). In addition, there is a fifth suit, labeled with a 'T'. These cards bear generic goodies like money, Industry, a first aid box and a 'Good Luck' card.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives a card specifying his trade for that hand. The object is to collect as many cards as you can that belong to your trade. At each turn, you pick one card from the previous player's unused cards. If it belongs to your suit, you add it to your sequence. Otherwise, it joins your unused cards which you then offer to the next player, who will pick a card, and so on. 'T' cards are wild cards that you can add to your sequence. There are three 'T' cards with a '?' on them and the words 'dillo tu' (name me). You can only add these cards to your sequence if you can name a tool/object that fits with your trade and is not already used in the game. The 'Good Luck' card has the power of negating an unused card in your hand - if you have the 'Good Luck' card and only one unused card, you can end the game immediately.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player runs out of unused cards. Unused cards count as penalties (I assume this means they subtract one from the length of your sequence). The winner of the game is the player with the longest sequence of cards bearing objects of their trade.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the instruction manual:<br/><br/>&quot;Become a master of the ancient Martial Art of Karate. Use wit, skill, and luck to battle your opponents as you progress from white-belted novice to Black Belt of the eighth degree!&quot;<br/><br/>The game is actually played with the use of cards depicting different karate maneuvers (attack and defense) and generic kung-fu weapons (like sai and nuchukus). Players turn cards over, and a rock-paper-scissors effect determines the winner. The players advance around the board, challenging each other and winning belts until they can advance to the Master Sparring Circle, where they must defeat two opponents at the same time to become the true Black Belt Champion!<br/><br/>From the black-and-white cards that feature only the names of the moves they represent, to the 4-color gameboard covered in Yin-Yang symbols, to the box cover featuring two Karate Black Belt Masters fighting in silhouette against the backdrop of a setting sun, this apparently self-published item (Jim Co.?) is really not much fun as a game, but worth a few chuckles as a curiosity.<br/><br/>",

You do this by outguessing what your opponent will play.<br/><br/>Each player writes down a sequence of three shapes. The only valid shapes are circle, triangle, square, and pentagon. On each player's turn, the player picks a circle to adjust. The player secretly picks a number of beads and put them in his hand. His opponent does likewise. Every white bead counts for one point. Every black bead counts for one negative point.<br/><br/>Reveal your beads simultaneously and add them up. This will give you a number from -6 to +6. Move the token in your chosen circle that many steps clockwise (for positive numbers) or counterclockwise (for negative numbers). If your total balanced out to zero, the token does not move.<br/><br/>If tokens in three adjacent circles are resting on shapes that match the player's goal, then he wins. Note that the order must match also. If his goal is circle, square, pentagon then tokens resting on circle, pentagon, square don&rsquo;t count. The sequence may be read forward or backward; square, square, circle is the same as circle, square, square. The current player also wins if tokens in three adjacent circles are resting on spaces that match his color.<br/><br/>Rules and the board can be downloaded here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/46/thinking-in-circles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/46/thinking-in-circles</a><br/><br/>",

You may look at your pattern card, but keep it secret. On your turn, you get to roll and fill. Roll: (This step is optional, except that you must roll if the previous player filled a blank space.) Roll the die. Fill: Put a piece in a vacant space that shows the same number as the die. If there are no available moves, you may put a piece in a vacant blank space. If there is no vacant blank space to fill, then roll again. Play passes to the left. The game ends when all spaces are filled. When the game ends, you must reveal your pattern card.<br/><br/>Winning: Starting with the last player, each player takes turns 'lifting' (removing) one sequence of his or her tokens that matches one of the following conditions:<br/><br/>* If you lift your pattern, you get 4 points.<br/>    * If you lift a straight line of 4, you get 5 points.<br/>    * If you lift the pattern of the player to your left or right, you get 6 points.<br/><br/>Once all available patterns have been lifted, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Rules, cards, and an optional board (a set of double-six dominoes can be used instead) are available here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/51/pitter-pattern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/51/pitter-pattern</a><br/><br/>",

The game consists of two (2) folding game boards, each measuring 17&quot; by 17 1/2&quot; when open.  One is the OROTECH AUTO RACE board, and the other is the  SPE-DEM. Six cast metal cars, each measuring 1 3/4&quot; long by 1/2&quot; wide and standing 5/8&quot; tall (Buick, Ford, Paige, Maxwell, Dodge and Saxon) are included, as well as a cardboard shaker and six wooden dice that have the six letters that stand for the cars (B, F, P, M, D, S) that along with the cars fit in a small utensils box.  Directions are on inside of the box lid.<br/><br/>The game is basically a roll-and move horse-racing type game. There are several squares on the playing track marked &quot;Accident&quot; which, when landed upon, cause that car to have to restart the race. The &quot;Blow-out&quot; squares cause the cars to stall for one turn. First car across the finish line wins.<br/><br/>",

Flying Fortress II may have been the first game with double-sided counters (the back used for step reduction).<br/><br/>Each turn in the game was a separate &quot;tactical mission&quot; game representing a month of real time. These turns were linked together to make a campaign. The mission game rules were divided into basic, standard, and advanced levels.<br/><br/>",

It includes a pocket sized box containing 54 cards, a magnetic football field and magnetic tokens for keeping the state of the game.  The 54 cards are broken up into 27 Offensive and 27 Defensive cards.<br/><br/>The players each receive a hand of random cards with the offensive player playing a card and the defensive player either trying to counter it or discard a card.  Whether the play is countered or not the winning card's instructions are followed.  The players then move the tokens on the magnetic board to keep track of the down, line of scrimmage and distance to the next down.<br/><br/>An example offensive card is &quot;DRAW PLAY - 10 Yard Gain&quot; with it's counter defensive card &quot;DRAW PLAY - 10 Yard Loss&quot;.  If the offensive card is not countered then the ball moves 10 yards, otherwise it moves back 10 yards.<br/>There are also cards for intercepting, fumbling, field goals, field goal block and punting.<br/><br/>Essentially it's a derivative of Snap with state and a few special cards thrown in.<br/><br/>",

This introductory story must contain some clue to one or the other (or both) of the liaising personalities, but not be so vague as to be meaningless.  Successive questioning through the game must contain additional clues.  Any information provided is recorded by all the other players on &quot;Probe Sheets&quot;.<br/><br/>The &quot;Probe Sheets&quot; contain a list of permitted questions (e.g. &quot;What did he first say to her&quot;) that may be asked during the course of the game. The questions that may be asked are determined by the movement of playing pieces on the board, which comprises three concentric rings.<br/><br/>Additional information may also be gained through the use of Chance cards or &quot;Acting Up&quot; - in which players are required to act as another celebrity, but in the style of either the boy or the girl of their liaising couple.<br/><br/>On certain squares it is permitted to attempt to guess the names of the liaising couple for one of your opponents - this is done in secret by writing on a scrap of paper.  The challenged opponent will then award markers for correctly guessed personalities.<br/><br/>The first player to unmask all the liaisons of all of his or her opponents is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The players then deposit money or counters in the pool.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The pigs are placed, with their hind legs on the lowest step of the planks.  At a given signal they proceed, step by step, up the plank, by the aid of the string, which the players must pull lightly.  If the string is pulled too hard or violently the pig will tumble and fall from the plank, which necessitates going back to the starting point, thus rendering the game very exciting and making the fun fast and furious.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;At first many of these 'accidents' will happen, but with a little more practice, the player becomes adept and the pigs make splendid progress.  The player, whose pig arrives at the trough first, is declared winner and accordingly takes the stakes.  Throughout the game the pigs must not be touched by the hand.&quot;<br/><br/>No year or publisher is on the box...<br/><br/>",

The game contains 42 silver balls, 8 blue balls and 1 red ball, but only 36 of these are used in each game. A cleverly designed box/board with sliding panel makes setup a breeze as well as randomizing the initial set up.<br/><br/>Players take turns removing any number of consecutive balls along a single horizontal line, as long is there is no gap or red ball between them. The removed balls are discarded into the large hole and underneath the slider, which stops them going astray and gets them ready for the next game. The red ball can only be taken on its own. Any row containing red can only be taken up to the red. A blue ball allows players to take up to, or part of, three entire rows radiating from that blue. Other blues in the path are treated as regular silver balls. The player with the last ball loses.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to get all five trains across the board to your Station, and then to get them all back Home. The train tracks might not run from your Home to your Station, but you can switch the tracks so that they will point where you want your trains to go. Sound simple? It is, except that your opponent has a Home and a Station too, and is trying to run trains on the same tracks. Your opponent will be turning the switches so that the paths run in a different direction. This is why you and your opponent are always at Cross Purposes!<br/><br/>",

Players had to collect the Ponies found on the road, and get ten back to their Corral, avoiding the usual hazards of Forest roads.<br/><br/>Then, finding that we adults also wanted to play, we made it more interesting with scope for an element of low adult cunning.  Enter the Verderer and Game Licenses; and &quot;Ponies&quot; was born in its current form.<br/><br/>The game is ruled by the throw of dice, but the Chase Cards introduce scope for planning and strategy and generate suspense and excitement.  The lucky early leader rarely wins, and the ultimate winner has to run the gauntlet of determined Verderers so that often it is the last throw of the dice which decides the victor between three or four neck and neck contenders.<br/><br/>My family and all our friends have been playing it ever since, both adults and children have remained addicted over the years.  Bowing eventually to everyone's enthusiasm we have at last decided to go public with &quot;Ponies&quot;: we are certain you are going to become as ardent Verderers as the rest of us!&quot;<br/><br/>",

The venues represent six different UK sporting venues (Wembley, Lord's, Wimbeldon, Silverstone, St. Andrews and Newmarket) though the venues themselves have no direct significance to the game.<br/><br/>Starting at their home venue players roll the dice and move the appropriate number of spaces in the clockwise direction marked on the board.<br/><br/>On each colored space landed on a question is answered corresponding to the color of that space:<br/>Purple = Grounds and Venues (GV)<br/>Red = Clubs, Competitions and trophies (CCT)<br/>Yellow = Personalities (P)<br/>Blue = Records, Facts and Feats (RFF)<br/>Mauve = Mixed Bag (MB)<br/><br/>A correctly answered question allows the player to throw and move again - if not, the turn ends and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>If the coloured space also depicts a trophy then a correctly answered question will earn part of a two part trophy (first time round the trophy itself and then the lid).  The various bits of the trophy are placed in that player's home venue on the appropriately coloured square.  The aim is to amass one trophy and lid for each of the five categories of questions.<br/><br/>Alternatively a playing piece may land on a space marked with a C meaning it is a Challenge position - there are two types of these:<br/>On a white &quot;C&quot; a player may challenge for one of the &quot;unlidded&quot; trophies in that particular home venue (i.e. a trophy already won by another player).  If choosing to challenge for a trophy a player may elect to answer a question himself (in order to &quot;steal&quot; the trophy) or challenge his opponent to do so (in order to retain the trophy).<br/>On a striped &quot;C&quot; a player may challenge for a trophy base on either of the adjacent venues, or elect to answer a question in any category for which a trophy base or lid is required.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player who collects in his/her home venue, five complete trophies.<br/><br/>",

Whenever they worked together they spent more time arguing than working. One time, two palettes of tiles were destroyed (one forming circles and one with squares), so something had to change. Since that day, Albert and Boris use only tiles which can be used to form circles and squares as well and they play 'Turnio' while they work.&quot;<br/><br/>Turnio is a tactical game for two players Ages 10 and up. The chips show on two or four corners quarters of circles or squares. Each player chooses one of these symbols. The players try to place or turn the chips in a way that completes their symbols. Two quarters of the same symbol placed side by side are called a pair. Quarters which touch only at the corner, i.e. which are placed diagonally are by definition not a pair. For each pair completed, the player gains one point. That means a half of a symbol is worth one point, three-quarters two points and a complete symbol gives four points. The player who has collected more points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The gameboard has a fort which houses the 12 cavalry markers while on the opposite side of the board an Indian village houses the 12 Indians.  A one-way path winds around the board, with the Indians moving in one direction, while the cavalry move in the opposite, which means they'll come head to head in a short while.<br/><br/>The Indians player leads off, spinning the spinner, which has values of 0 to 10; the player moves his first marker accordingly.  The cavalry player follows in suit.  On the next Indian spin, the player moves the Indian marker already in play and adds a new one from the village, each moving the distance the spinner indicates. Play continues on with each player soon moving several of his markers on each turn.<br/><br/>Each marker counts for 10 men, and there are several spaces scattered across the board which, when landed upon, indicate you must lose 10 men.  Essentially, that marker is removed from the game, not to return.  Also, when a player lands on an opponent's marker, he captures that piece and moves into his fort or village.  Additionally, a few spaces allow a player to raid his opponent's fort or village and re-capture his captured markers.<br/><br/>Eventually, through such attrition, one player will find he has no markers left out on the trail.  At that point, if he is holding some of his opponent's markers captive, he may trade his captives for his own markers, place them in his respective fort or village, and move them into play as normal.  If, however, a player has no markers on the trail, and no captives in his fort or village, he loses the game, giving his opponent the victory.  Thus, the markers have no end destination and may move round and round the board, victory coming only when the opponent has lost all of his markers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Double Trouble and The Calendar Game were a pair of health education and promotion board games sold together in one box. The games featured the theme of healthy lifestyle habits tacked on to familiar board game formats.<br/><br/>Double Trouble, for four players, had a ludo-like format with each player having only one playing piece, but traveling around the board to try to gain four 'health habit' counters (eat right, exercise regularly, don't smoke, control stress) before racing for home. The twist to the game was that whenever any player rolled doubles, all players made a grab for one of the little bean bags (of which there was always one less than the number of players) on the board. The player who did not manage to grab a bean bag was sent back to his/her start.<br/><br/>The Calendar Game was a conventional 'go-round-the-board' dice-roll-and-move game where players tried to gain 'health points' by picking up 'health cards'. Up to six players could play.<br/><br/>",

Six plastic yachts sail around the course area marked on the board.  In the center of the board is placed a spinner that shows how far the yachts may move in a given direction.  The trick is that the spinner is magnetized so the wind will only vary 45&ordm; from the mean wind direction for the game.  A good way to simulate wind direction over the period of a yacht race.  The board is dark blue and the course is marked on in darker lines with dots to show where the yachts may move. There are also currents and shallows to be navigated.<br/><br/>",

One person, who can can also choose to be a player, takes the part of &quot;Questioner&quot; and reads the questions and keep tracks of cards and answers. The &quot;Questioner&quot; changes at the end of each game.<br/><br/>The players in the game each get an answer card which is set up like a Keno card. Each of these cards have 5 headings (same on all cards): Artists/Authors, Headliners, Military Men, Statesmen, and Famous Women. When a quiz card is drawn and the question asked, a player having the correct answer on his/her card marks the spot with a mini poker chip. The first player to get a straight row of chips (vertical, horizontal, or diagonally) wins the game. The &quot;Questioner&quot; reviews the answers to make sure all answers were correct. Cards can be exchanged between players before a new game begins.<br/><br/>There are 75 Cards with 2 questions (A&amp;B) on each card. The backside of the card contains one answer which is correct for both A&amp;B questions. This yields a total of 150 different questions. The 12 Keno/Answer cards are different from each other.<br/><br/>Simple, straight-forward game mechanics, but the game rules state that modifications to game can be made by player consensus.<br/><br/>",

The cards tell the story of infamous occurrences during the Westbank Gamers history, and cause a wide variety of events to occur.<br/><br/>Victory goes to the player who collects the needed cards, manages his hand properly, and survives the chaos of the events.<br/><br/>The production quality is outstanding, thanks to the talents of Jim &quot;Dr. Z&quot; Fairchild.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to pick up as many of the other player's passengers as possible, delivering them to their destinations, collecting money and avoiding fines.<br/><br/>All players begin with $150.00 and 4 Passenger Pawns (same color as their taxi). Players distribute their Passenger Pawns on the board, as well as Bank owned Pawns and Police/Highway Patrol Cars.<br/><br/>The object is to pick up as many of the other players&rsquo; pawns as possible and deliver them to their destination (as determined by the draw from the card deck).  Taxi drivers collect $1/space driven from the owning player of the pawn, but the route must be direct because cheating gets you a $20.00 fine and a trip back to the garage.  The Bank pays for Bank Pawns. Whenever a Passenger Pawn is picked up, a Destination Card is drawn, but beware the random Hazard Card!<br/><br/>Police/Highway Patrol Cars are moved by the current player who rolls either a &lsquo;1&rsquo; or a &lsquo;6&rsquo;. The object is to &ldquo;Bust&rdquo; one of the other taxis caught in its jurisdiction (spaces marked yellow on the board). When a player has picked all the pawns he can, they head back to the garage to end the game. The person with the most money wins the game. Bank Pawns in possession are worth $5.00 each.<br/><br/>The length of the game is dependent on the amount of players. Placement of the Bank Pawns also adds to the game length, since players can choose to keep a Bank Pawn, or put it into play:  more pawns in play equals a longer game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;This black-oriented game uses black history as a theme. Correct answers to quiz-card questions regarding contributions of blacks to American history and culture earn players the chance to fit pieces into one of four picture puzzles of famous Afro-American men. Game II will include the historical contributions of black women, overlooked in Game I.&quot;  Mentioned in article &quot;Games with Soul&quot; published in Newsweek magazine 10/9/72.<br/><br/>Players place shuffled history cards face down near the board.  Each player picks a puzzle and removes all the pieces.  Players then spin the spinner and try to fit the number of puzzle pieces matching the spinner in their board in 60 seconds.  If they fail, they must return all unused pieces back.  If the spinner points to a question mark, the player can answer an African American history question and receive the number of puzzle pieces on the card.<br/><br/>The player who finishes their puzzle first, wins.<br/><br/>",

All units and structures are made out of HEAVY DUTY staples, which can be found at any hardware store. Staplewars plays like a strategy game... until it is time to attack. Ammunition staples are flicked at units and structures, and if the units or structures are knocked down, they are destroyed! The purpose of this page is to encourage people to play this exciting game, to give people instructions for their own StapleWars arenas and sets, and to clarify information about this exciting new game.

Each time around the board equals one week in the season. There are 200 player cards with stats on the back broken down into 17 weeks. The stats are their actual performance last year, with a column for their fantasy points each week. There are also 16 rookie cards with newly drafted rookies and their projected stats for 2005. At the end of each week, you add up the points for the players on your team and compete against a different player each time around the board.<br/>                                     <br/>Several things can happen while playing the game as you advance around the board. You can be forced to trade with another person, you can pick up free agents, your players can get injured or suspended,you can get plus or minus points for the week,etc.<br/>                                     <br/>You accumulate season points, as well as wins and losses.

        "description": "From the directions: A lightning fast game for 2 or 3 players.<br/>The goal is to move all three of a player's marbles around the board from base position to &quot;home safe&quot;. Each player rolls his dice once to determine who plays first. Player rolling the highest number is first and chooses his color, placing the three marbles in &quot;base&quot; position. Play will proceed to the left, each player choosing his color and placing his three marbles in his &quot;base&quot; position. With all marbles now in &quot;base&quot; position, first player rolls his die. Either a one or a six must be rolled to take a marble from base to &quot;start&quot; location marked by single hole of the player's color. Players roll their die in turn, moving marbles which have been started the exact number of places permitted by number rolled. When a one or a six is rolled, player has choice of moving a &quot;started&quot; marble that number of spaces or starting a new marble. Also, the rolling of a six entitles that player to an additional turn IF he was able to use the six he just rolled. As play proceeds, a player may not pass or land on a marble of his own color. However, when a player's move lands his marble on a space occupied by another's marble, he may JOLT by replacing that marble with his own. The JOLTED player must then re-start the marble from his &quot;base&quot; position. Marbles are ALWAYS subject to JOLTING until in &quot;safe home&quot;. First player with all three marbles &quot;safe home&quot; is winner of the game.<br/><br/>With that being said (or rather written), sounds like Parchesi revisited...<br/><br/>",

You decide to clean up your rifle and go hunting for a turkey so yer family won't go another holiday season eating Spam sandwiches for the main course.&quot;<br/><br/>I believe this was published in the December 2000 issue of Games Unplugged Magazine. The board is printed in the magazine; you provide a few D4's and 2 pawns of the same color for each player (must be able to tell what direction your pawn is facing). The board also has a &quot;Buzz Meter&quot; for each player (Betty-Jo, Jim-Bob, Tex, Cousin Luke, Uncle Robert and Ma) so you can keep track of how drunk each one is.<br/><br/>&quot;Objective: Everyone's pawn on the board represents a drunken hillbilly stumbling through the woods trying to land on the center square of the game board (shooting a turkey). Once you have landed on the square, you then have to move your pawn off the board (bringing the turkey home). First one to do this wins.&quot;<br/><br/>There are two phases per turn:<br/><br/>Action phase - Move (you control only distance or direction), Drink a beer (allows you to change your direction) or Sober up (decrease your level of drunkenness on your Buzz Meter). Everyone performs their action before the Shootin' phase.<br/><br/>Shootin' phase - Anything in each player's line of sight (turkey or hillbilly) gets shot automatically. Of course, if you are shot, you guzzle a beer to ease the pain before continuing.<br/><br/>You are out of the game if you get so drunk that you wander off the board. You are the winner if you are the first to shoot a turkey and bring it home OR you are the last player on the board without anyone else having gotten  a turkey.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>First of the great dynastic struggles of the eighteenth century, the War of Spanish Succession involved most of Europe. A state which did not back up its policies with troops in this period probably supplied them as mercenaries to those which did.<br/><br/>Central to the causes of conflict were the expansionist ambitions of Louis XIV, King of France, which were opposed by a series of shifting alliances. Towering over the period is the figure of John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, and his close ally Prince Eugene of Savoy.<br/><br/>This is the classic campaigning period. Each year, the armies marched across Europe is a colossal chess game on a board constricted by river barriers and studded with fortresses. These manoeuvres culminated in great set-piece battles, including Marlborough&rsquo;s &lsquo;big four&rsquo;: Blenheim, Ramillies, Oudenarde and Malplaquet.<br/><br/>The War of Spanish Succession has much to recommend it to wargamers; uniforms were colourful (but are simple to paint.) and manoeuvres were bold and forceful. Standing armies were in their relative infancy at this time, and the period saw the founding of traditions which were to last the centuries.<br/><br/>Polemos War of Spanish Succession is specifically aimed at enabling the wargamer to fight large scale actions; actual battles, rather than small scale skirmishes. Systems for firing, melee and morale are straightforward and easy to learn, but allow your troops to emulate the tactics used by their historical counterparts. For instance, troops using the platoon firing system have improved close range factors, while others using fire by ranks are allowed to be more aggressive.<br/><br/>The basic playing piece in Polemos is the Base. An army consists of a number of bases, organised into Brigades and Commands, either to an historical model or by the use of army lists. The size of armies in this period varied enormously; in Polemos WoSS, a general&rsquo;s command can be from eight to 15 bases, but an army can comprise anything from two commands upwards.<br/><br/>Polemos War of Spanish Succession is designed to not only give the feel of command in the period, but also to give something of the look. The actual number or composition of figures on a base is unimportant, but it should mount enough figures to make it look like a real unit of troops. The sight of your lines of steady musketeers or massed cavalry advancing across the table should fill your opponent with awe and trepidation!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Malaka is a cross between Backgammon, Plakoto and Lines of Action.  Players race to move their pieces around the board, delaying their opponent while trying to connect their pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol.  Using a familiar (Backgammon type) roll-and-move mechanism, each player attempts to form an orthogonally connected group of their pieces (as in Lines of Action) at the opposite corner of the board from their starting location.  The board is designed with two &quot;walls&quot; that force the players to navigate an &quot;S&quot; type path to reach their goal in the opposite corner.  The board consists of nine subareas, each with a basic direction of forward movement (which is, of course, opposite for the two players).<br/><br/>On their turn, each player rolls two dice (4-sided dice for the 9x9 board, 6-sided dice for the 12x12 board) and uses the resulting numbers to move their pieces.  Pieces may either step directly forwards, or jump over a wall.  If a piece steps directly forwards, then it must step in a straight line a number of spaces equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  If the piece steps onto a single enemy piece, then that enemy piece is pinned (as in Plakoto) until the player moves off.  Players may stack as many pieces as they like onto any point, but cannot move to any point at which the enemy controls a block (a pile of two or more pieces).  Alternatively, a piece may jump over a wall (ignoring the movement restrictions of the moving piece's current sub-area) if that jump lands on a single enemy piece a number of spaces away equal to the number of pips shown on one of the dice.  The enemy piece is captured and removed from the game.  Players cannot jump backwards and cannot cross both walls with the same jump.  Jumping over a wall to capture an enemy piece is a double-edged sword: it allows the piece to push forward quickly by taking a shortcut, but also makes the opponent's task easier as they have one less piece to connect.<br/><br/>After making any move, the same piece may take further steps or jumps, possibly changing direction if the first move resulted in a change in sub-area. If a double is rolled, then the player moves four times using the pip value shown (as in Backgammon).  The player must make a move that uses the maximum possible number of pips.<br/><br/>A player wins by orthogonally connecting all of their remaining pieces to the far end of the board marked with their symbol (not necessarily in a single connected group, but all pieces orthogonally connected to a piece on the goal line).  A player may also win by pinning an opponent's piece on his own starting line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this very large game (22.5&quot; x 32.5&quot;), players race to explore the eight other planets within the solar system.<br/><br/>One unusual gimmick to this game is its use of a stack of slide transparencies (vs. regular cards) in concert with a board randomizing mechanism. Pulling a lever rotates the obstacles to movement on the board as well as pushes a transparency off the bottom of a stack into position. Movement of the transparency into place causes a small light bulb to turn on, lighting the slide and revealing the instructional text.<br/><br/>",

Two factors handicap each horse: the odds of each number being rolled on the special dice vary with the lesser numbers being favored (&ldquo;One&rdquo; appears on every die while &ldquo;Eight&rdquo; appears on only two dice) and horses carrying less weight have an advantage over more burdened beasts.<br/><br/>Players place their minimum $2 bets before each race. The starting gate is placed the appropriate distance from the finish line and the horses are placed in the starting gate according to the weight they are carrying. The dice are rolled and each horse is advanced one space each time its number is rolled. Bets are paid when three horses have finished.<br/><br/>Advanced rules lets players own the horses and get a payoff whenever the horse wins.<br/><br/>The game comes packaged in a massive box that measures 25&rdquo; x 14&rdquo; x 3&rdquo;.

But Hard Times lives up to its name: get fined for parking in the handicapped space, max out your credit card, and turn down a job only to be faced with a hospital bill? Real life hurdles lurk.<br/><br/>Players compete to build personal wealth.

Be first to correctly answer one question in each of the five categories, and win!&quot;<br/><br/>The game comes with a couple of dice and 150 cards asking educational questions about Earth and its environment; each card has four levels of questions to provide different challenges for different age/knowledge groups. The rules provide with a few different variants of play: &quot;Regular Play&quot;, &quot;EARTH Master&quot; (a game show variant for large groups), &quot;EARTH Face-Off&quot; (spelling bee), and &quot;EARTH Challenge&quot; (team play).<br/><br/>",

The games are even compatible with one another.<br/><br/>This particular game is made of 36 different playing cards that were included in the &quot;Project A-Ko: The Roleplaying game book&quot;. Included in the roleplaying book were two different character sheets (one for B-KO and one for A-KO), that needed to be photocopied in order to keep track of the progress of players during the game. Their number of action points left, their remaining health, etc. as well as being used as a reference sheet for the various special powers each character had.<br/><br/>The game was meant as a stand-alone card-game that could also be played within the boundaries of the role-playing game as a player's aid for the game. Players were encouraged to describe verbally how exactly their characters attacked the other using a particular card. It provided those players that described the action behind a card play with special bonuses to their character's statistics, such as increased delivered damage to their opponent.<br/><br/>Also included in the book were various other characters that could be used against B-Ko and A-Ko, such as &quot;ordinary persons&quot;, tanks, mechas and spaceships, which could bring the game to more than 2 players (to an infinite number if needed), although no character-ready sheets was made available for them in the RPG book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>WTF is, on the surface, a game about cards and points.  You play a card, you gain or lose some points, and the player with the most points when the GAME OVER card is played wins. But there's a catch or two: First, the GAME OVER card is double-sided, so everyone knows where it is at all times.  Second, over half of the cards in WTF contain blanks and you get to fill them in and finish the rules!  You might get a card that lets you determine how many points players gain or lose, or you might get a card that lets you require all players to perform some ridiculous task of your choosing.  Each card simply must follow on the &quot;suit&quot; of the previous card -- but many of the suits are made up by the players as they play! The big catch is that you actually write on the cards each game, so your deck is always changing.  The result is that the card that seemed funny when it made the player to your left eat his own earwax is a lot less funny when it comes back around to the player on your right!  For even more excitement, you can mix up your deck with another friend's deck and see what happens. It&rsquo;s up to everyone to decide how far you have to go to get points and keep the GAME OVER card out of the point leader&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>",

It is imaginative and clever - FUN for the whole family, the bigger the better. Wild and crazy, with 8 different categories and 3 different levels of play, it builds personal confidence and increases sensitivity to others. <br/>Just a pile of FUN for everyone!<br/><br/>It's used in schools, hospitals and anywhere kids and families want to have FUN! The categories include: Science and Nature, Sports, Emotions, Life skills, Professions, Entertainment, Oops and Oh Goody cards.

A marble has to be pushed to make a move in the center square.<br/><br/>When a marble is pushed in the center square, this marble is considered taken and cannot be used or moved directly.

Lucky die rollers can make use of the shortcut spaces to speed movement.  Players can not pass their own marbles and landing on any one else's marbles sends the landed-on marble back to Home where it must start again.  First player to get all five pieces to Finish wins.<br/><br/>Since a 1 or a 6 are required to start a marble on its path, an optional house rule is that no one can jump your only marble if they have another choice, unless it is your last marble.

        "description": "This book was written by an Assistant Commissioner of Police as an aid for Magistrates in Malayan Courts who had to hear cases involving all manner of gambling games common in the region at the time.<br/><br/>As the author, Dobree, says in his preface to the book, dated 1st February 1955, &quot;The book contains detailed descriptions of the majority of gambling games, betting and lottery games and betting which usually form or which may form subjects of charges in this country under the Common Gaming Houses Ordinance No. 26/1953 and the Betting Ordinance No. 47/1953.<br/><br/>Also mentioned for the most part briefly, are other popular gambling games mostly in the card game category, which do not usually form subjects of criminal charges as they are invariably played under circumstances which do not constitute any offense under the Ordinance ...&quot;<br/><br/>Although intended to be a functional legal document, this book has concurrently become a major reference work for gambling games in South-East Asia, containing descriptions and rules for games not described in English in print elsewhere.

        "description": "The name of this traditional roll-and-move race game possibly derives from the hulu (Mandarin) or hor lor (Hokkien dialect), which means a gourd, that often appears as a symbol on the board. In the catalogue for the exhibition, Asian Games: The Art of Contest, the following names for this game are mentioned:<br/>hulu pan (gourd board) - southern Fujian and eastern Guangdong area<br/>hulu qi (gourd chess) in Hong Kong<br/>hulu wen (gourd puzzle)in Suzhou<br/>fenghuang qi (male and female phoenix chess)in places such as Tianjin, Weixian (Shandong Province), and Chengdu (Sichuan Province).<br/><br/>I know it, in Singapore, as Hor Lor Boon.<br/><br/>This game is played on a board showing a spiral track and the object is to move one's piece from the outside into the center of the track first(q.v. Game of Goose and Sheng Guan Tu). The track is made up of individual symbols which will be repeated once on the board. Players roll two dice and move the number of symbols along the track. Wherever they land, they will then jump to the corresponding symbol elsewhere on the board (which could be a help or a hindrance). It's not necessary to land exactly on the center square to win - passing it also wins.<br/><br/>The symbols may vary, but are usually traditional or mythological Chinese figures (e.g. the Eight Immortals, creatures from the Chinese zodiac) and would include a gourd (hor lor).<br/><br/>A contemporary set made in China called cai shen you xi qi (God of fortune game) has two pieces for each player - presumably the roll can only apply to one of the pieces in this version (the rules are not clear on this). The rules for this version state that if a piece is supposed to land on a space occupied by another piece, it remains where it is and the piece it would have landed on is sent back to the start. The board features the God of Fortune as the central space that all the players are trying to reach.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SARS Wars &ndash; Sha Si Zhan Qi<br/><br/>Towards the end of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in Singapore in 2003, an enterprising media company published this simple roll-and-move board game, incorporating the public health education messages that were issued at the time. It was sold at branches of a book-cum-stationery shop chain, Popular Bookstore.<br/><br/>The game is for 2 to 6 players and players each have a coloured pawn that moves along a spiral track towards an End Point. Along the way, players follow instructions on spaces they land on, including taking two kinds of chance cards.<br/><br/>The &lsquo;Personal Hygiene&rsquo; card is drawn when landing on a &lsquo;Personal Hygiene&rsquo; square &ndash; players follow whatever instructions are written on these cards. The &lsquo;See Doctor&rsquo; cards may be drawn when landing on a &lsquo;Symptoms&rsquo; square, or also after landing on a &lsquo;Check Your Temperature&rsquo; square and rolling a 4, 5, or 6 (on lower numbers your temperature is normal, so you naturally don&rsquo;t need to see a doctor).<br/><br/>Players may also get sent to Hospital or be put under Home Quarantine. Being in the Hospital is worse as the player proceeds to Home Quarantine after discharge from hospital.<br/><br/>The game has lots of humorous touches that reflect the atmosphere at the time. One of the pre-game preparation rules is, &ldquo;All players must wash their hands thoroughly before playing&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s also a rule concerning expulsion from the game, &ldquo;You are not allowed to continue with the game when you are expelled because of reckless, irresponsible personal misconduct that jeopardizes the entire community&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the End Point is the &lsquo;overall winner&rsquo; of the game. The other players can continue to play the game. Ominously, &ldquo;the last player left is the loser, who may be punished appropriately&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

The first player takes a telegram from the top of pile and reads it to himself and places it face down on the table in front of him. He then throws the two dice at the same time and moves the correct share marker to a higher or lower price and follows any printed instructions there. He may use his telegram at this point or hold to a later point in the game. To present it he turns it face upwards and the share marker to which it applies is then moved to a higher or lower price as indicated by telegram. Shares may then be bought or sold by any player at the value indicated. Then once players have bought or sold play continues by the next player picking up a telegram. When the last telegram is taken from the pack, the dice are thrown for the last time. Each player is then, in turn given one chance to present any telegrams still held.<br/><br/>Note: One die is chosen as the number 1 die. This die determines which share type rises or falls, according to the table printed on the board and box. The other die shows the amount of fluctuation. For example if number 1 die shows 3 and number 2 die shows 6 the price of mining shares will fall 6 points.<br/><br/>Table as below:<br/>No 1 dice<br/>1. Industrials fall<br/>2. Oils fall<br/>3.

The play consists of getting to know some of the interesting places in Singapore, collecting as many token points as possible and escaping the multifarious pitfalls that are intricately simulated in the pot luck cards. Each player competes for the highest token value and he can strategize and take advantage by using his discretion wisely. The players can also have great fun and laughter with the creative catch-phrases that are used to portray the interesting places.&quot;<br/><br/>This game was obviously targeted at the tourist market. It is small, portable and features tourist destinations in Singapore, some of which are no longer around. References to the defunct Van Kleef Aquarium and Bukit Turf Club date the game to the 1980s or early 1990s.<br/><br/>It features a Monopoly style board with pictures of the tourist attractions on the spaces. There are 'Pot Luck' cards that act like chance cards, and token cards with point values that the players are trying to collect. Player's pieces feature a tiny Merlion's head.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns rolling their steel balls to collect opponents until all pieces have been captured.  Pieces have different point values, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>In &quot;Magnetic Pull&quot;, one game piece is placed in the center of the playing surface, and each player uses the magnetic properties of another Tengamo piece to try to drag the center piece to their side of the table.  Pieces are placed in the game by both players until all have been used and collected.

        "description": "A very traditional Nim&iacute;ipuu game, shared throughout the Plateau region is called C&eacute;exstem, a form of dice game. Formally played by women, today both men and women of all ages enjoy the excitement of C&eacute;exstem. The goal of the game is to see who can reach the agreed upon point total first. Any number of individuals can play at one time. The game is a wonderful way to learn the number system of the Nim&iacute;ipuu, counting from n&aacute;aqc (one) to le'dptit (twenty), and have a lot of fun doing so!<br/><br/>To play the game, you need two sets of game sticks, each set colored a different color, e.g., blue and red, and each set marked indicating a &aacute;ayet (male) and hamma (female), a &quot;couple.&quot; The male stick is often marked with an extra perpendicular line across it. The reverse side of a stick is called, caya, &quot;nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>Before starting the players agree upon the number of points to win, the higher the number, the more challenging and the more fun. Typically, 5, 7 or 11 point totals are selected. Usually starting with the youngest player and proceeding to that person's right, each person throws the four game sticks onto the rug before them. Depending on how the sticks land, the following points are possible.<br/><br/>* one &quot;couple,&quot; a &aacute;ayet and a hamma of the same color = one point<br/><br/>* two &quot;couples,&quot; both sets of &aacute;ayet and a hamma sticks = three points<br/><br/>* one &aacute;ayet and two hamma = two points. This combination refers to the Nim&iacute;ipuu practice of looking after a male friend's wife should he fall in combat.<br/><br/>* if there are no pairs matched, e.g., &aacute;ayet and a hamma of differing colors = no points<br/><br/>* but if all the sticks land caya, &quot;nothing&quot; = all points accumulated are lost and the player starts over.<br/><br/>After deciding on the win point total, be it 5, 7, or 11, the players need to agree on other rules. Will you need to win on the exact number, be it 5, 7 or 11, not going over that total? If a player gains points beyond the agreed upon win point total, will extra points over that total be subtracted from that player's earned points? As players gain points, they should always announce their totals in Nim&iacute;ipuutimptneewit.<br/><br/>Nim&iacute;ipuutimptneewit numbers:<br/><br/><br/>     n&aacute;aqc - one<br/>     lep&iacute;t - two<br/>     mit&aacute;at - three<br/>     p&iacute;ilept - four<br/>     p&aacute;axat - five<br/>     'oyl&aacute;aqc - six<br/>     'uyn&eacute;ept - seven<br/>     'oym&aacute;tat - eight<br/>     kuyc - nine<br/>     p&uacute;utimt - ten<br/>     p&uacute;utimt wax n&aacute;aqc - eleven (ten and one)<br/>     p&uacute;utimt wax lep&iacute;t - twelve (ten and two)<br/>     le'eptit - twenty<br/><br/><br/>",

Players collect as many Math Cards as possible (each card has a point value printed in the center). The secondary objective is to use up all of your Math Cards before the other players can use up all of theirs. Once a player uses all of his or her cards, the game ends, and points are tallied. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>There are many ways to set this game up, to accommodate different levels of math skill of the players. The Spinner can be used in the center of the board to determine the target equation&rsquo;s solution or it can be removed so that the target solution is always 21.  Or,  take away the multiplication and division operators, so that less skilled players only have to think about adding and subtracting. When math skills increase, CardMath will be along side to grow with your needs.<br/><br/>",

A right-wing German government has seized several disputed nuclear weapons brought into their nation by American military actions in the Ukraine. The German chancellor has demanded the disarmament and the immediate removal of all US military personnel in Central Europe as well as Germany being recognized as &quot;a nuclear power&quot;. The President of the United States appears to capitulate to the German demands; however, Lt. General Al Malin, commander of the US Tenth Corps, refuses to disarm without a fight and leads a bold, yet desperate plan to invade Germany, recover the nuclear weapons, and march his units to the North Sea to uphold American military honor. &quot; Based on the novel by Harold Coyle.<br/><br/>For this, you'll be provided with the game's mapsheets, rules, charts, etc., while you will utilize the components from Axis &amp; Allies or related games.<br/><br/>",

Then, he'll take any of the lasting twos until the same arrives, upon which he'll take his last character.<br/><br/>The turn is divided in 4 segments. All player undertake a segment before any begins the following segment.<br/><br/>The 4 segments are:<br/>- &quot;D&eacute;pensez vos butins&quot; (expense your loot) where you can buy some of the &quot;big&quot; weapons cards and add them to your hand (the small ones are ALWAYS in your hand)<br/>- &quot;Pr&eacute;parez vos esquives&quot; (prepare your dodges) where you put on your character, face up, any of the weapons you bought, up to the prestige (fame) value of your character<br/>- &quot;Attaquez&quot; (attack) where each player chooses a weapon in hand and say who he attacks (players at his side for contact weapons, other players with ranged weapons)<br/>- &quot;Videz vos querelles&quot; (end your quarrels) where attacks are resolved. An attack is dodged if the defensive player has correctly found the value of the attack coming. A successful attack make the defensive character lose some of his HP, and the attacking character win prestige or loot.<br/><br/>In plus of the weapons card, there are other cards that players can use to affect the game.<br/><br/>If a player arrives at 5 in prestige, he can call the militia that will end the game. If a character becomes KO by losing all his Hit Points, its player takes his next character.<br/><br/>A player can come in the game, or leave, at any moment.

It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/><br/>After a set time<br/>When the first player becomes bankrupt<br/>When all but one player has gone bankrupt<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

The Cashier shuffles the cards and deals them face down into six piles,one for each store.Cashier spins the spinner to tell the first player to his left which store he'll be going too. The player picks up the top card of that store pile, turns it over, and reads aloud what it says. He then pays the Cashier for his purchases as shown on the card. The Cashier must check the payment and also any change that is given. The Cashier spins the spinner to see which store the next player will go to, and so on.

        "description": "FIRE puts one or more players in the role of a city fire department chief or battalion chief in a department.<br/><br/>The mounted board is an 18 x 15 inch representation of an urban environment including streets and alleys, business and residential districts, industry and fire stations.  Structures are color-keyed green for low buildings and blue for multistory.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are squares and rectangles of 3/8&quot; plexiglass.  Self-adhesive colored stickers are applied producing lime-green miniature fire command vehicles, rescue ambulances, fire engines and ladder trucks.<br/><br/>The standard game is 24 turns long, represent a 24-hour shift.  Each turn, a die roll determines whether zero, one, or two alarms are received.  Each building on the map is marked with a street address.  Every time an alarm is received, a label corresponding to a board location is drawn randomly, indicating the site of the alarm.<br/><br/>An alarm may be indicated as a &quot;medical emergency, a &quot;call&quot; (corresponding to a &quot;local alarm&quot; in many fire departments) or a &quot;1st Alarm&quot; (potentially, a more serious situation).<br/><br/>The controlling Player determines which assets to dispatch to the scene depending on nature of incident and location.  Responses range from a single rescue ambulance for a medical emergency up to a multi-station response for a multistory structure, row house with multiple exposures or industrial complex.<br/><br/>Each game-turn is broken down into three impulses.  Each impulse, emergency vehicles may move up to eight squares toward a scene.  Physical space limitations often play a role, since alleys are only one square wide.  Pumpers take up two squares, ladder trucks three, making traffic control important when placing apparatus (particularly ladder trucks, which must be within reach of the structure in question).<br/><br/>Beginning in the second impulse, as long as at least one unit has arrived the controlling player may attempt to resolve the incident.  Resolution may determine that the call is a false alarm, that the fire has been extinguished, or that it continues to burn or intensifies.  At the player's discretion, he may wait until the third impulse before resolving the situation, in order to allow more assets to arrive.<br/><br/>Each unit type has a points value representing its firefighting capabilities.  Certain combinations of units--such as two engine companies, a truck company, and a chief officer--have a higher value than the face value of the units present, representing the fire ground tactics such combinations make possible--primary and secondary search, fire suppression, water supply, ventilation, exposure protection, fire ground command, etc.<br/><br/>The point total of firefighting assets present is cross-indexed to a die roll on the &quot;Results Table&quot; and an outcome determined.  Fires not extinguished at the end of the game-turn intensify one level (defined in the game as &quot;1st Alarm, 2nd Alarm,&quot; etc. through &quot;5th Alarm&quot;).  Fires of 2nd Alarm intensity or greater spread to adjacent spaces, either to a neighboring building or to additional spaces within a single large structure.  Poorly placed fire apparatus may also be destroyed by expanding fires.<br/><br/>Each new game-turn the alarm determination process is followed, meaning that new incidents may be generated.  It is important to hold some department assets in reserve to allow for responses to additional incidents.  The entire department numbers one &quot;Marshal&quot; (Chief of Department), three Battalion Chiefs, twelve Engine Companies, five Ladder Companies and six Rescue Ambulances distributed in six stations of various sizes.  Relocation of uncommitted assets is sometimes necessary to maintain adequate fire protection during major fires.<br/><br/>Rules cover wind direction, firefighter injuries, apparatus breakdown or other loss while responding, and, optionally, water supply.<br/><br/>The goal of FIRE is to maintain public safety at the lowest possible level of asset activity.  At the end of each turn, points are assessed for each unit out of quarters, whether fighting a fire or returning from a call.  The object is to achieve the lowest possible score while efficiently handling emergencies--a balancing act between dispatching sufficient assets and using assets efficiently.<br/><br/>",

The problem? The Queen will arrive in only six hours! The rats have to be taken care of...and soon! With a little bit of the Wizard&rsquo;s magical help and your own wits, you attempt to impress the King with your abilities. But the Wizard also has an interest in what you trap. Will you be able to match wits with your competition and secure the rights of trap master in this land? Can you catch the vilest and most numerous of rats and secure your position as a member of the King&rsquo;s loyal staff?<br/><br/>Goal of the game:<br/>The players will move from room to room trying to trap as many of the rats as they can, by using magic items and outmaneuvering their opponents.<br/>The rats have three point values depending on their degree of nastiness:<br/>    1: plain old rat<br/>    2: aggressive rat<br/>    3: diseased rat<br/>The rats also come in four colours:<br/>    black, white, grey, and brown.<br/>Most of the valuable rats are of black colour, followed by brown, grey, and white. This may lead some players to choose to pursue only black or brown rats in their quest. However, the Wizard is a strange sort and wants to use the rats of all colours for his potions and magic. He rewards players handsomely for having rats of each colour. Keeping in mind that the white rats are the least common, and the black rats are most numerous, it is the rat trapper who can balance the best of both strategies who will ultimately win the game.<br/>This game features a very innovative game board design: a northern cross section of the castle is one one side of the board, and the southern cross section of the castle is on the other side of the board, in such a way that the roofs are almost touching. Each room presented on the cross sections have doors leading east/west/both, but also have a door set into their back wall of the room which leads to the other side of the board and the other cross section.<br/><br/>",

Movement across tiles of your own colour is easy, but there are special rules for crossing other players' corridors or dealing with situations where pawns find themselves blocked by other pawns.<br/><br/>Players start with 60 tiles each, equally split between the 3 different types of corridor. The backside of the tiles show 3 dice results that come into play when players attempt cross other people's corridors. Players pick the tile of their choice, add it to the board, then move one of their pawns as far as they are allowed. The next player does likewise. This continuous until someone succesfully crossed the 10 square gap to the other side of the board with all their pawns.<br/><br/>This Austrian game was self-published and appeared in a large, lavish, tailormade plastic wallet that offered space for the folded cardboard board and had a seperate compartment to hold the wooden pawns, the tiles and the tiny die. The designer later founded his own imprint, Leobener Spiele.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sneak is a commissioned game from Kira Snyder for the game design textbook &quot;Rules of Play&quot;, by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.<br/><br/>Sneak is a party game for 3 or more players.  Each player is secretly assigned a role, either a Spork, a Foon, or the Sneak.  Only one player is the Sneak, the others are evenly divided between Sporks and Foons.  The goal is to figure out who is the Sneak.<br/><br/>The players perform a series of challenges.  Some of the challenges are private (written on a note card) and some are public.  The challenges typically direct Sporks and Foons to do different things (for example, draw a train vs draw a plane), and the Sneak gets to choose which one to do, except for certain challenges which tell the Sneak what to do.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with four counters, and they can use these counters to buy information.  For one counter, a player can require another player to show the entire group one of their written note cards.  For two counters, a player can purchase a private look at another player's note card.<br/><br/>Players can call for a vote at anytime, and each player writes down who they think the Sneak is.  Sporks and Foons get points for guessing correctly, or lose points for guessing wrong.  The Sneak gets points when other players guess incorrectly, and loses points when other players guess right.<br/><br/>",

Obtaining cards from another player involves requesting cards by the colour of the jacket the player wears, though the player is not obliged to declare any musicians of that type should he choose not to do so.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get a full band - that is one card for each section in the band: cornets / horns / trombones / euphoniums / basses / percussion / conductor.<br/><br/>When a player is confident that he has a winning hand then he can &quot;declare&quot; by placing his hand face down on the table.  Play continues among the other players until a second player declares.  At this point the players with complete bands then score their hands with the highest total winning.  In the event of a tie the winner is the player with the highest number of cards with players in the same colour jacket.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Swarm, a game loosely based on the hierarchy of bees, is a simple yet very deep abstract strategy game for two players. The game play is somewhat like a cross between Go, Chess and Backgammon. Players may make multiple moves per turn (up to 12 when using dice). There are two ways to win the game. Players may move their opponent's pieces as well as their own. Players can re-claim captured pieces (when playing with dice). The game can also be played without dice as a pure abstract strategy game - suited to advanced players who are interested in a deeper more serious game. The depth in the game is partly due to the multiple move paradigm which means that the first players first turn has more than 10 million possibilities.

The first player who reaches the end space by exact count gets the bank of five cookies -- one of each type shown in the game.<br/><br/>Some of the cookies featured may have undergone name changes and variant expansions, but they all remain in the Nabisco line: Vanilla Wafers, Nabisco Chocolate Chip Cookies, Fig Newtons, Oreos, and Lorna Doones.<br/><br/>There is no explicit rule declaring a winner. Presumably the winner is the player with the most cookies in hand (or consumed), but one might also assume that Nabisco wanted all the players to feel like winners for getting to eat their cookies. (Of course, the ultimate loser is the person who had to furnish all the cookies for the game!)<br/><br/>",

It is a simple race game with each player taking a pawn and starting in the corner of the board. Pieces travel only on the outermost squares of the Shogi board in an anti-clockwise direction. Each time they pass their start corner, they can be promoted to the next higher piece. The first player to get promoted to King wins. An unusual feature is that the 'dice' are actually the four Gold General pieces. A player casts the four Gold Generals and moves according to how the pieces fall. If the piece falls with the calligraphy facing up, that counts as 1 square. If the piece lands on it's edge, that counts as 5 squares.<br/><br/>",

Fairly nasty is the space on the home stretch that forces the piece to move backwards into the path of other pieces. <br/>The game has a military theme and pieces are toy soldiers in different colours.

The point is that a team of 4 members has to build the A-Class in exactly 60 time units. 6 components (the puzzle pieces) have to be brought from &ldquo;B&rdquo; to &ldquo;A&rdquo;. The team members need different lengths of time from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;B&rdquo;: 25, 20, 10 and 5 time units. The journey back from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;B&rdquo; takes the same amount of time. Two team members always have to go from &ldquo;A&rdquo; to &ldquo;B&rdquo; together. This costs the higher of the two time units. Each member is allowed to take one component with them. One of the two has to go back to &ldquo;B&rdquo;. The task is solved if all 6 components are brought from &ldquo;B&rdquo; to &ldquo;A&rdquo; in exactly 60 time units in this way. To measure time, use the timeline on the game board with the staff as a timer. Since the task is not easy to solve, there are two tips under the cardboard insert and - if these are still not enough - a complete solution.<br/><br/>A challenging puzzle for one person that is sure to cause some headaches if you can resist the temptation to read the tips and solution.

Quite fast, some of the icebear friends glide down to the the water. But, with some skill you can help the friends get the best spot in the sun. This requires a steady hand, to place your cards firmly on the ice berg.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of cards, some counters and two icebergs (three dimensional cardboard stands). At the beginning of each game, each player receives a number of cards, of which three are face up. Each turn a player tries to get rid of one of his face up cards. This is done by placing the cards on one of the icebergs. How exactly the card is to be placed is determined by the animal depicted on the card. Some cards need to be placed against a side of the iceberg, others need to be on top, etc. In some cases, it is not the card that needs to be placed, but a cardboard counter (using the card as a tool).<br/><br/>If a player succeeds in placing his card, he draws a new card from his pile and puts it next to his other face up cards. However, if one or more cards fall down while he tries to place his cards, half of the cards that have fallen down are shuffled and put on his draw pile (the others are discarded).<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

A player builds his or her empire by tabling cards, with the value of a player's empire being dependent on the number and layout of cards that player tables during the game.  To maximise your empire you must use your investment chips to maximum effect.<br/><br/>Cards have region and industry types, cards must be linked to either the same region (vertically) or the same industry (horizontally).  The more cards in a chain the higher the value.<br/><br/>A final element to the game are the Investment Chips.  Each player has the same number of chips, each chip can either double one or more of your chains or halve the value of one or more of an opponents chains.<br/><br/>The winner is the person with the highest value totalling all region chains and industry chains.<br/><br/>",

Players move around the track, getting or receiving money and winning, losing or breaking even on votes. The spaces that grant votes are sometimes optional usually require rolling the +/- dice to bet against the house or another player, with 2+ being a win, 2- a loss and 1/1 breaking even.

In 2006, when Game Show Network aired its series of the 50 Greatest Game Shows, the inclusion of Studs as #47 (despite not showing any footage) led to flabbergasted game show fans calling it Freaking Studs and wondering how it could have possibly ranked higher than Blockbusters and Treasure Hunt; while far from the only shocker of that series, it's the only one relevant to this entry.<br/><br/>",

In this game, you are made aware of your experiences by means of the symbolicism of a fairy tale. The inner spaces of the conscious and unconscious self are represented as different storeys in a big house. The levels, from the deepest cellar to the attic symbolise the different levels of consciousness.<br/><br/>On the way up, a players will encounter different archetypical persons, who represent different sides from his personality. Those are the fairy-tale characters who live in the house. Connected to these characters - Dwarf. Witch, Prince, Princess, Giant, Queen and King - are different feelings. The persons will ask questions connected to such feelings.<br/><br/>Interaction between players occurs when the answer a player gives is not the answer others think he ought to give - in other words, when someone perceives himself different from how others perceive him. This should lead to a discussion to find the true answer (and the true personality).<br/><br/>Allthough the actual game is a race to the attic, this interaction between players is the most important part of the game. Discovery of self and development of social actions is the main goal of the game.<br/><br/>",

Each card represents a student in a clique, such as the Lunch-Stealer Bully, the Goth Burn-Out, and the Gamer Geek. Social Disorder combines the trick-based play of classic games such as Spades and Hearts with a twist: Each player has a hidden rule, which can affect all other players. Is the suit order reversed for this hand? Can the same player not win two tricks in a row? Can you force two players to swap hands? Only you know what your rule is, and you can choose whether or not to enforce it. And, just like high school, no one knows all the rules.<br/><br/>Designed by three-time Origins-Award-winner Steven Marsh, Social Disorder takes about an hour to play per game. It comes with everything you need except friends ... just like high school.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Ultimate Number Game&quot;<br/><br/>Number Quest plays sort of like Boggle crossed with Othello/Reversi; this game is essentially a number version of its cousin, Overturn.  The playing board is a plastic tray into which nine tiles (from a set of eighteen) are placed in a random order.  Each tile has four raised pegs on it, each with a different digit (from 0-9) printed on it.  On their turn, each player must construct an equation by selecting at least three adjacent digits (digits may be adjacent both orthogonally and diagonally) that form a valid equation when the proper operational symbols are added (i.e. 347 becomes 3+4=7, 9752149 becomes 97+52=149, 678234444 becomes 678-234=444, etc.)  Only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are allowed.  No fractions or decimals are permitted.  Equations must follow normal sequence (i.e. 97+52=149 is valid; 149=97+52 isn't)and may not contain more than one operation (i.e. 4-1-2=2 is not valid.)  A given digit may not be used more than once in the same equation, and equations must make use of the digits on at least two separate tiles.  0 may never appear by itself in an equation (i.e. 4+0=4 and 5-5=0 are invalid.)  The equation is claimed by placing plastic rings of the player's chosen color (either green or gold) around the pegs of the digits forming the equation.  After the first player's first turn, all subsequent turns must use at least one previously used number.  If necessary, the player forming the equation flips over the ring so used (rings are gold on one side and green on the other), a la Othello/Reversi.  The game ends when all 36 rings have been used, or when no more equations are possible.  Players then score one point for each ring of their color.  Player with the most points is the winner.  Although Number Quest is essentially a two player game, more can be accommodated by forming teams.<br/><br/>",

On each turn, the current player moves one planet (represented by a magnetic marble) one space, then rolls an eight-sided die and moves the comet (represented by a ball bearing) that number of spaces.  If magnetism causes two planets to collide, both are destroyed; if the comet hits a planet, the planet is destroyed but the comet remains.

The games in 'Wine Knot' are variations of old nautical drinking games, believed to have been originated by Portuguese sailors involved in the notorious 'triangular trade' of the 18th century where wine and textiles were shipped to Africa, traded for slaves who were then shipped to the Americas, the ships returning to Europe with cargoes of molasses and tobacco. Long periods at sea and wine in abundance, diversions were created using the materials at hand; wood, canvas and rope.<br/><br/>There are eight games to be played, which will provide interesting, unusual and amusing entertainment for up 8 players for as many hours as you wish.<br/>Port wine was originally used but because of its strength an ordinary (or extraordinary) bottle of red or white wine will ensure that the game does not finish too early.<br/><br/>",

On arriving at the designated area players have to complete an activity in a manner similar to the items featured on the TV show:<br/><br/>SNAP CACKLE POP - A memory game in which players have 30 seconds to memorise 14 items on a list and a further 30 seconds to recall them.<br/><br/>WHOSE WASHING LINE - The player has to guess the identity of someone from clues read from a card.<br/><br/>ON THE BED - A player must convey the identity of someone to the other players without using any of the words written on the card.<br/><br/>ONE LUMP OR TWO - A drawing game in which players try to reproduce the picture on a card with their eyes shut.<br/><br/>THE CRUNCH - Players perform silly actions as described on a card.<br/><br/>DOWN YOUR DOORSTEP - Players must guess where they are from the description on the card.<br/><br/>EGG ON YOUR FACE - Players must mime or impersonate the individual on the card for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>INVENTION CORNER - Players must attempt to answer general knowledge questions.<br/><br/>Points, in the form of breakfast items (sausage, tea, marmalade, egg, toast ...) are awarded for succesful completion of activities.  After a predetermined time (60 minutes for 4 or less players, 90 for 5 or 6 players) the game ends.  The winner is the player with the biggest breakfast (i.e. the one with the greatest number of points).<br/><br/>",

The sale and breeding of exotic animals is one of the fastest growing businesses in the world. Breeding in captivity has become a necessity for the survival of most of the species existing 30 degrees longitude north and south of the equator. This massive area is so hot and dry that the remaining animals are simply fighting for survival and have no energy left for breeding. A massive movement to save these animals from extinction and the preservation of a living gene pool for genetic engineering has become the focus of many different organizations around the world.<br/><br/>Schleswig Holstein is the world leader in the art of genetically engineering exotic animals. They are highlighting and creating new traits in animals. Zebrazucht is a clinical experiment by two of the leading companies in the field of Genetics. One company genetically stripped male Zebras of most white coloration. The second company was able to genetically create female Zebras to be void of most of their black pigmentation. This six-year-old project is now in its final stages and the animals are being brought together for the first time in the height of mating season.  A special breeding facility was created to accommodate the project.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of scientists from both companies trying to bring as many pairs together as possible. The calculated end result should produce offspring Zebras that revert back to a more brilliantly stripped black and white color. If things go wrong the offspring might be hard to distinguish if placed amongst Holstein cows.<br/><br/>In this two-player game players move two workers towards each other and place a fence of their colour in that space.<br/>Once a player has four fences of his color surrounding a corral that player places his Zebra in the space.The person opening the most corrals to unite black &amp; white Zebras wins.<br/><br/>",

The game was released last year in a Neurology edition, but was completely reworked for this year. What&rsquo;s it all about?<br/><br/>The game casts players as doctors doing their bookkeeping. They have to make sure that the numbers work out as much in their favour as possible &ndash; they can leave the cases that will incur huge costs to their colleagues. Cases are laid out &ndash; a primary diagnosis and a face-down &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; card which eventually becomes a secondary diagnosis. Depending on the difficulty level of the secondary diagnoses, a table defines the value that the primary diagnosis will have in this case. This value can be changed by other players by playing out &lsquo;on call&rsquo; cards. The next player tries to capture the trick by playing out a case with a higher value. When scoring, the &lsquo;waiting&rsquo; card for each case is turned over separately and the value adjusted for a long or short waiting time. The costs are tabulated and the gains recorded. Over the course of the game, &lsquo;after months&rsquo; cards can also be played that can ruin the best cases.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Monopoly clone features locations in Chester County, Pennsylvania.  Property cards are printed with advertisements by local businesses and organizations.  The game features an equine theme -- all playing pieces are colored horses, and wooden &quot;stalls&quot; and &quot;stables&quot; take the place of houses and hotels.  The game also adds a trivia element -- the ARC and United Ways cards (which replace Chance and Community Chest) feature trivia questions in addition to the usual instructions.  Players may choose to ask these questions of their opponents -- if anyone answers correctly, they win $50 from the bank; otherwise, the player asking the question wins the money.  Apart from these and a few other minor differences, the game plays like its more famous inspiration.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a Stratego-like game that's actually two games, an army game and a navy game.  Pieces are set up on a board in a manner similar to Stratego, but rather than being linear (numerical values), the units have a rock-paper-scissors relationship.  i.e. the tank unit is superior to infantry and engineers but is inferior to aircraft, artillery, and mine units.<br/><br/>For those who want to recreate the (army) game, the pieces are as follows:  Private, corporal, sergeant, staff sergeant = 3 each.  Second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain, major, lieutenant colonel, colonel, 1, 2, 3, and 4 star generals = 1 each. Tanks=2, plane=1, Anti-aircraft/anti-tank=5. Mines=6, Engineers=6. A-Bomb=1.<br/><br/>Infantry take each other according to rank; infantry also takes anti-aircraft/anti-tank and engineers.  Tanks and planes take infantry and engineers. Plane takes tank, anti-aircraft/anti-tank takes planes and tanks, engineers take mines without damage.  Mines are stationary pieces that explode and destroy anything that triggers it except an engineer. The A-Bomb is essentially a movable mine that destroys every piece in a surrounding square when it explodes.<br/><br/>The pieces are like mah jongg tiles arranged so that the opponent cannot see what kind they are -- he just sees blank pieces advancing toward him. When a piece is attacked or attacks, it is turned over so that the face is visible.  It then becomes a known piece for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>We played the game in Hawaii in elementary school in the late 1950s.  There were two blank pieces included, presumably in case a piece got lost.  We sometimes used these to create two additional pieces, the brainwasher and the kamikaze.  The kamikaze was simply a flying bomb.  The brainwasher changed an opponent's piece into one of your own.  It was not possible to brainwash the A-Bomb.<br/><br/>",

Throw the 12 sided die and move that many spaces.<br/>You draw a card with 15  random words on it. You pick 1, 2 or 3 words off of the card according to the number of eyes on your field. Don't show the card to the other players<br/><br/>Another player draws a card with sentences on it and he/ she picks a sentence for you. You have to start your 1 minute story with that sentence and try to get all your words in the story. If you fail to get all your words in the story, you get zero points, if you succeed you get 50 points per word. (So the max is 150 points per story)<br/><br/>The other players can now guess which words the storyteller has used, for every correctly guessed word the player gets 25 points<br/><br/>For every 150 points you get an eye token and after that you start counting again, so if you have 175 points you get 1 eye token and have 25 points left.<br/><br/>There are special fields called Raa..Raa..! fields. If you have an eye and you end on a Raa..Raa..! field you are allowed to lay your eye on that field. If there is already an eye of somebody else there, you are allowed to remove that eye and give it back to the owner.<br/>If you receive your 4th, 5th or 6th eye, you can use those to block an other player. Just lay your eye in front of his pawn and the other player, that player must now skip a turn.<br/><br/>The challenge:<br/>If you end on a Raa..Raa..! field you can choose between either skip a turn or accept the challenge. The challenge is pick 4 words and use those in an 1 minute story. If nobody guesses the words, the storyteller gets 250 points.

        "description": "The year is 2340.  Just as in all of history, conquest is at the heart of mankind.  Enslave or become a slave is the future.  You are in charge of breaking through the wall of your enemy&rsquo;s city to allow the entry of your battalion to take over.  Organic Titazium metal (O37T2y) has been used in the construction of all walls during this time period, which makes them virtually impenetrable.  The wall cubes must be removed carefully or the wall structure will collapse and repair itself thus defeating your mission.  While you are attacking the walls of your enemy, they in turn are attacking you.  By using limited means, you must minimize the damage directed to your city.  Victory belongs to he who enters the city first.<br/><br/>",

Well maybe! What happens if you cannot complete the sum? You have to pick up a spare card and wait for your next turn. This game can be played by people with all levels of ability and in our testing, we found some people with devious minds who tried to stop others winning tricks. I'm sure you wouldn't do this!

On the eve of the first Opium War, the players sail their junks through the China Sea and buy silk, spices, porcelain or tea from the various harbors. These wares are sold for a heavy profit in the canton where the English freighters are. But the freighters also bring a trading good with them, one out of India that is worth much gold in the harbors along the sea: Opium! The only catch &ndash; dealing in Opium is punishable by death. Each player can choose in this game: a long life, or get rich quick. After war breaks out, the needs of the dealers change on a daily basis, forcing flexibility: A harbor that might have been shut yesterday is now open again, where Opium trafficking might be punished heavily today, tomorrow the English might allow it again. The historic events of the time are also included and have an affect on the way the game goes. And yet, there&rsquo;s still enough variety in the game to make it play out differently each time and allow the players to influence the game in many ways!<br/><br/>",

You lost your job last year when the lumber mill shut down. Nobody&rsquo;s hiring. The local bank where you kept your money saved made loans to those businesses that were shutting down. Depositors panicked and there was a run. The bank went into receivership, and your savings were wiped out. With no job and no savings you couldn&rsquo;t make your house payment, and your mortgage was foreclosed on. Like millions of Americans you find yourself jobless, penniless, homeless.<br/><br/>Down by the Port, on the site of the old shipyard, some men are gathering supplies for winter: cardboard boxes, tar paper, firewood. You have decided to join their shantytown and to try to start again.<br/><br/>Who will eat the most food? Who will wear the least tattered clothes? Who will live in the finest hovel? Who will become The Mayor of Hooverville?<br/><br/>",

Booktastic appeals to rudimentary readers, bookish braniacs, and everyone in between. Because the casual reader questions are opinion-based and have no wrong answers, anyone can play including children and non-readers. During the game players move around a quaint town square of bookstores to buy, sell, and trade books according to a collection card they receive at the beginning of the game. Before each turn, players earn money by choosing question cards. The player with the most valuable collection of books and cash at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On January 7, the British 12th Brigade, which had been hammered back for weeks, now faced a new bold foe: Japanese tanks (type 95 and 97) composed of two companies supported by the 42nd Regiment. With only a few antitank weapons, the British defenders were hard pressed when the Japanese bold use of armor in the jungles began at 0330. What followed was simply a mini-blitzkrieg as the Japanese tanks found numerous previously undiscovered roads through which to bypass British defenses. The British really did not know what hit them and by 0830, the Japanese had secured the Slim River bridge and the road to Singapore was open. In the game, chance cards create the uncertainty of battle from the sudden approach of Japanese aircraft, discovering a bypass road, stumbling onto a minefield, or the sudden activation of British units. Formation cards determine which formations activate and in which order, depending on the player that plays them. This will vary with every game turn. All this creates a totally unpredictable game.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 11x17 in. map, 280 counters, formation and chance cards, which are used to activate the counters on the map, a rulebook. The scale is 350 yards per hex, platoons, individual tanks\\weapons, 30 min. turns for a total of 11 turns.<br/><br/>",

The first card displays an advertisement for this product, the next two cards show a list of instructions, and the other 33 cards are divided equally between circus character pictures of heads, bodies, and legs.<br/><br/>Game #1: This version is essentially the only game.  It is for 3 or 4 players.  The head cards are divided equally among the players.  The rest of the cards are mixed up and spread face down on the table.  Player take turns revealing cards in a memory game type fashion.  A player with a &quot;head&quot; card must uncover a &quot;body&quot; card while a player with &quot;head&quot; and &quot;body&quot; cards must uncover a &quot;legs&quot; card, otherwise the turn passes to the next player.  The first player to complete all of his funny characters wins the game.<br/><br/>Game #2: A player can divide the three types of cards into three piles for a solitaire version players where the sole player reveals a &quot;head&quot; card followed by a &quot;body&quot; card followed by a &quot;legs&quot; card, creating various funny-looking circus figures.<br/><br/>Game #3: A player can place the cards in numerical order to create a &quot;flip-movie&quot; by riffling the top of the deck with his or her thumb.  (It might be noted that these different numbers and pictures on the backs of the cards could be used essentially as &quot;marked cards&quot; for the 3 to 4 player game.)<br/><br/>",

Spielertage, Essen 1983 - Das Rasante Kunstflugspiel - Mit do-it-yourself Spielregeln&quot; (*) to give it it's full title.   (&quot;Hexagames - Specially made for the first Essen Game Fair 1983 - The Speedy Stunt Plane Game - With Do-it-Yourself Rules&quot;)<br/><br/>This must be the most unremarkable game to have ever been presented on any of the Essen game fairs if it wasn't for a very small detail: it was the first promotional give-away game on the Essen fair ever. It was possibly also an entry in a whole new genre: make-it-up-yourself-gaming. J&uuml;rgen Hagedorn from Hexagames was simply handing out  20x35cm sheet of paper, with a hand-drawn game board on it. Stuck to a corner was a small bag with 4 wooden cylinders and a dice. The drawing was very suggestive, but had no rules.<br/><br/>Whilst freebies continued to be used by various companies in an effort to get noticed, they often took the shape of fashionable and pointless pins that people could stick on their clothes, or, after a more inspired moment by Jumbo, were god's gift to gamers on Essen: jumbo-sized carrier bags - with appropriate logo of course.<br/><br/>It took until 1995 before the next noteworthy Essen promo-expansion appeared: Goldsieber's 13th constellation for &quot;Sternenhimmel&quot; (although this was not free). Kosmos followed in 1998 with a &quot;robber-gang-figure&quot; for &quot;Die Siedler von Catan&quot;, probably embarrassed by the success of the game and in a genuine effort to thank the fans. But it wasn't until Hans im Gl&uuml;ck released a player's expansion for its &quot;El Grande&quot; that the promo floodgates truly opened. <br/>The game itself, off course, hardly got noticed and was easily forgotten. What do you expect from a sheet with a large plane and a game-of-goose type track of fluffy clouds that have different shapes but lack any explanation?<br/><br/>Nevertheless, now the &quot;Essen Freebie Game (Expansion)&quot; has became a bit of an institution, it might be time to pay tribute to the very first one: Hexagames, we salute you with a BGG entry for what must have been a great laugh.<br/><br/>",

The four-player game can be played with a set of two partners.  The game begins with each player being dealt 4 cards.  Three cards are placed face up in the middle of a table, although the 3-player game requires five cards to be placed face up in the middle of the table instead of three.<br/><br/>Players can claim cards in three ways.<br/><br/>1. By matching: A player can claim a card that matches on in his or her hand.<br/>2. By combining: If there is a Mickey Mouse &quot;Lucky One&quot; on the table, a player can form a +1 addition equation to place this card on another card already on the table and pick it up with a next highest number card in the player's hand.<br/>3. By building: A player can attempt to form an addition equation to pick up a set of cards.  For example: If there is a &quot;3&quot; on the table, a player can place a &quot;4&quot; on a &quot;3&quot; to build a &quot;7&quot;.  If player can use a &quot;7&quot; card next round to pick up the &quot;4&quot; and &quot;3&quot;.  However, this player could lose this &quot;4 + 3&quot; in two ways.  Another player could take this &quot;4 + 3&quot; before next turn by playing a &quot;7&quot;, or another player could attempt to build a higher number equation by placing another card on the &quot;4 + 3&quot; stack.  However, a player cannot build unless he or she has a card to pick up the stack.<br/><br/>A player that cannot match, combine, or build must place one card on the table.  The player making the last play takes any cards left on the table.  A player gets 3 points for having the most cards, 2 points for a Lucky 2, 2 points for a Lucky 10, and 1 point for a Lucky 1.  The player or team that is the first to get 25 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is published by Judy/Instructo, a division of Frank Schaffer Publications, Inc.  It appears to be recommended for children Ages 5 - 8<br/><br/>It consists of 10 nursery rhyme cards and 30 word cards.  The word cards are shuffled and spread face down.  Each player chooses a nursery rhyme card and places it in front of him or her.  Players take turns picking up a word card and reading it aloud.  If the word rhymes with the boldfaced word on his or her nursery rhyme card, the player keeps it and takes another turn.  The game continues until one player has collected all three words for his or her nursery rhyme.  That player must then read the proper completed nursery rhyme to win the game.<br/><br/>",

As allies of Ho Chi Minh's fighters against the Japanese, it is clear that the U.S. had several choices in Indochina. The decision to back the French, attempting to regain control of the region, led to America's eventual involvement, and all the consequences thereof. The war that ended in 1973 had led to all of the following: 57,661 U.S. servicemen dead, 2 million Vietnamese dead, the first military defeat for the U.S., internal turmoil in the U.S., distrust of the government and military, the devastation of much of Vietnam, and many other things. Is it possible the war could have turned out differently? It is up to you to decide...&quot;<br/><br/>Now YOU can take over where &quot;Nixon&quot; failed! Send them 'Tin Soldiers' far away FROM the grounds of &quot;Kent State&quot; et al, and unto the &quot;killing fields&quot; where they belong. Using your 'A&amp;A' pieces along with some others, then you too can attempt to &quot;rectify&quot; the situation in Southeast ASIA, where the &quot;domino effect&quot; concerning 'Communism' was at its height! SEE if the &quot;Bombing Cambodia&quot; Campaign would have truly been 'effective', OR perhaps an EXTRA couple 100-thousand 'Troops' might have &quot;done the deal&quot; instead. Here's your chance to &quot;re-write&quot; some gaming 'History', and either rise UP to the 'occasion', or 'go down' through &quot;Defeat in detail&quot; with THIS!<br/><br/>",

The hexagonal tiles mean that each tile has six large triangles, each of a different color...Stubborn has only four large triangles and hence only four colors.  Each Tickityboo tile is therefore a member of 6 different numerical series.  <br/>Despite its increased intricacy, Tickityboo is begun just like Stubborn, by placing the specially marked Starting Tile face up on the table.  Each player  then takes 9 tiles blindly from the remaining total of 143 tiles still face down on the table.   When there is more than one player they take turns, but unlike in Stubborn, in Tickityboo each player becomes &quot;vulnerable&quot; if they cannot place a tile, and the another player can move an overlooked tile, and discard one of their own tiles to the vulnerable player's pile. <br/>Like the other games in the &quot;Mining Order From Chaos&quot;(tm) series, Tickityboo is a great solitaire game.  It supports up to nine players, however, to make an engaging pastime for a small party or a third of a normal classroom.<br/><br/>",

Moving and fighting is done with the same cards. The better movement cards are also the ones with the higher combat value so card management is vital. One of the nicest aspects of the game: I always start (says the rules). The publisher is actually &quot;Spiel-Bau-Stelle&quot; with is was the forerunner of 2-F Spiele.<br/><br/>",

They win if they are correct or produce a grid with the same number of wires in every space as the correct grid.

These crystals hold magic power, power that will allow you to summon great magic, and to control mighty beasts. These crystals are thus used to wage mystical war on your foes, all in the hope of defeating them and their own goal of possessing the needed crystals to become your master instead of you becoming theirs.<br/><br/>Within the game you get well over 40 monstrous creature to summon and battle, spell cards and magical items, as well as over 60 crystal cards and more.<br/><br/>",

Long had she plotted and planed for this day, her dark heart pounding with the pent up joy she was having at hearing the screams of the dying on the other side of the high wall. Her house had finally crushed their greatest rivals, and now nothing, no one, stood in their way of taking complete control of the city. A dark elf warrior casually walked up to her and bowed, as was custom among her people. A lower caste member of the dark race must always pay nominal respect to those of higher rank and birth. High born over lowborn, nobles over all others, females over males. That was the law of the Dark Elves, that was the way of the people of the Spider Queen.<br/><br/>This is the game of Web of Tears, a game of politics, intrigue, struggle and conquest. Web of Tears allows players to take control of a Dark Elf noble house, where they then must compete with other Dark Elf houses as each tries to achieve multiple victory conditions and goals. Can you train your nobles to their ultimate in skill, or will you need to amass a great army of slaves and skilled warriors. Maybe you will need to work the political side of the social order and have yourself proclaimed the queen of the city.<br/><br/>Web of Tears uses a unique system of influence peddling, intrigue, political plotting and all out war to allow players to interact in the nastiest of ways.<br/><br/>Can you out smart, out fight and out survive your foes?<br/><br/>The game comes with everything you need to have a great couple of hours of fun.<br/>Over 30 Noble Cards, showing each of their skills and levels of ability.<br/>40 spell cards covering both Arcane and Faith based magic.<br/>80 Special Ability cards covering Warfare, Arcane, Faith and Stealth based skills.<br/>Over 30 Market Cards<br/>6 Noble Houses to play, each having its own special powers and victory conditions.<br/>A massive playing area, which shows the Dark Elf city and its may locations. <br/>And a massive amount of counters<br/><br/>",

It may have come with some Combat Operations Plots when sold separately (these were used in all of GFG's strategic games).<br/><br/>The cover of the Battle Manual is done in the style of a military field manual. Under the obligatory number (OBM-76A-171) it states &quot;For Fleet Commanders and Officers of Flag Rank.&quot; The manual is also marked CLASSIFIED DATA, noting &quot;under official regulations, any attempt to reproduce, pass on, reveal, or place in possession of unauthorized personnel constitutes a violation of military law under the military code, espionage and sabotage acts and is punishable under the penalties regarding treason.&quot;<br/><br/>The Combat Operations Plot is a large chart designed to assist in setting the current configuration of your starship. There are 23 separate Operations Plots displayed, each specifying the various ship settings for the forthcoming turn.<br/><br/>The values specified in an Operations Plot include Offensive Power Level, Defensive Power Level, Shield Potential, Counter-Attack Factor, Defense Factor, Sensor Screen Penetration, and Rate of Warp (acceleration and deceleration). Each Operations Plot is given a descriptive name, ranging from the straightforward &quot;Full Shields&quot; and &quot;Total Offensive Weapons Deployment&quot;, to more convoluted selections such as &quot;Special High Speed Evasive Action Plan for 'A' Type Beta Battle Cruisers or 'CR' Type 'Gammas'.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carlo Derby is a depression era horse racing game.  It comes in an orange and white tube with all the components rolled up in an oil cloth track.  The game contains a layout cloth, race tickets, ticket punch, five horse and a mixer called the &quot;carlo box&quot;.  The carlo box contains 6 white marbles, 5 red, 4 blue, 3 green and 1 black.<br/>As the marbles are dispensed, the horses advance. There are three raised felt circles below the track that receive marbles when you push the carlo box down.  The track has a fast and a muddy (slow) lane for each horse.  For example, the black horse fast track has only one space, which means he finishes the race the first time his marble comes up (1/19).  The black horse muddy track has two spaces.  You can bet on horses to win, place or show, and the payoff odds are shown on the track.  For example, black pays 8.5 to 1 for a win on the fast track or 24 to one for a win on the slow track.<br/>The best part of this game is the quality of the molded glass horses.  The tickets are also very realistic looking.<br/>The designer and publication date are unknown.  However, the game is described as patent pending, and the company address is 268 First Street in San Francisco.<br/><br/>The &quot;carlo box&quot; could also be found (with the same marbles) in the game Lido<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a space-o-meter to record the number of millions of miles they have traveled on each leg of the journey.  Movement is governed by a spaceship spinner that advances from 10 to 90 million miles per turn.  To claim a planet, you have to be the first to have your mileage hit the orbit range of a planet.  For example, to claim Mercury, you have to hit the 100 to 130 million mile range.  If you go over, you have to reverse your direction and  start subtracting mileage for each spin.<br/><br/>Once all planets are claimed, you add up the value of your planets.  These range from 10 billion dollars for Mercury's gold to 50 billion dollars for Saturn's plutonium.  These are very generous sums for 1951!<br/><br/>This game has rich retro decco graphics.  The artwork is very similar to the 2005 Zathura: Adventure is Waiting.  In fact, the spaceships are nearly identical.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SCRAMBLED HEADS! - The Crazy Clues Game! is a similar game to HEADBANZ and others of that ilk.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to be the 'Head Case' by placing a headpiece on their head. A card is placed in the headpiece by another player such that it can be seen by all the players except the one actually wearing the headpiece.<br/><br/>The game card shows three subjects in three different categories - Food and Drink, Entertainment and Miscellaneous.  The subject is something that should be familiar to all the players and could be anything from a famous film star to a wild animal.<br/><br/>The 'Head Case' selects whether he wishes clues on the category on the top, middle or bottom row of his card, and is then informed of which particular category the subject belongs to.<br/><br/>The other players then take it in turns to offer clues as to what the subject is.  Clues should be relevant to the subject but somewhat distant and slightly cryptic.  Clues should not be derived from part of the subject title.  The 'Head Case' has 10 seconds to try and guess the text on the card at which point the next player gives another clue.<br/><br/>Tokens are added into a central pile to indicate how many clues have been given - these tokens having been evenly distributed amongst the players at the start of the game. If the 'Head Case' guesses the subject then the player that gave the last clue must collect all the tokens.  A player also gains them if he is unable to provide a suitable clue.  In the event of the 'Head Case' not guessing the answer within 12 clues he fails and collects all the tokens from the pile,<br/><br/>Another player is then selected as the 'Head Case' and the while process is repeated.  Play continues until one of the players runs out of tokens or when all players agree to stop.<br/><br/>",

The designer found that children that are not used to adult conversation will often reply to questions with one-word answers or an answer not related to what the question that they were asked.  The game is also helpful for adults that have had strokes, brain injuries, or are attempting to relearn or expand their language skills.<br/><br/>As a player lands on certain colored game board squares in a train track format, a player chooses one of 240 question cards, divided into the four corresponding color categories of &quot;Wh- Questions, &quot;If I...&quot;, &quot;Tell about...&quot;, and &quot;How do you...&quot;.  The game cards have three levels: kids, adults, and both.<br/><br/>The companion workbook called ConverStation Graphic Expression teaches people when to express themselves in writing versus conversation.<br/><br/>The board game hit the market in June 2005, winning the 2005 Preferred Choice Award from Creative Child magazine as a Toy of the Year Finalist.<br/><br/>The game is published by Say It Right, a small press educational publisher based in Tybee Island, Georgia.

The Goat is the odd card or the &quot;Old Maid&quot; that you don't want to be caught with or you lose the game!<br/><br/>Rules from the game box:<br/>Deal 3 cards to each player and 3 to the table face up. If the Goat is dealt to the table, he must be put back in the pack shuffled, and a new card dealt to the table in its place.<br/><br/>The first player must make a pair by matching a card on the table with one in his hand if he can, at the same time reading aloud the title of the card, for instance, &quot;I am Buster's Father&quot;. He then takes the trick to himself. If he cannot make a pair in that way, then he must play a card on the table, any one he likes, except for the Goat.<br/><br/>After his play, he must then take the top card from the pack, so that he will always hold 3 cards, until the pack runs out, when there are no more cards to draw from. Then, if a player cannot make a pair by matching one on the table, he may make one from his hand. If he can do neither, he must draw a card from his left-hand neighbor and try to make a pair from the table or from his hand, and so on, until the last card remains unplayed which must be the Goat. The player with that card must hold it up and say &quot;I am the Goat.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Most of the items look faintly sinister: here is something called Schimmel, or Ball and Hammer and here an inscrutable British concoction, Squails, and, behind the sofa, his earliest acquisition&mdash;the ghastly New and Fashionable Game of the Jew, a dice game devised in 1811 that, according to Sondheim, &quot;taught kids to be anti-Semitic. But all the games you see here are very nice to look at and real boring,&quot; he adds. &quot;This thing about games&mdash;I'm not really fascinated with games.&quot;<br/><br/>--<br/>Looks to be a variation of Gluckshaus.  Roll both dice and pay the amount rolled onto the space of the same value.  If there is something already on the space, collect it instead.  Rolling a 7 always pays to the Jew space.  Rolling a 12 collects all the counters on the board.<br/>From: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gamesetal.net/Stock_Pages/GLB/glb3930.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gamesetal.net/Stock_Pages/GLB/glb3930.htm</a><br/><br/>",

The full deck is only required for a full complement of players.<br/><br/>All players are dealt 4 cards, except the player to the dealer's left who receives 5 (the 'captain').  The clock is wound and held until the deal is completed; the timer is then released.  Cards are passed to the left on the direction of the captain until one player has four-of-a-kind; this player places their cards on the table.<br/><br/>As soon as this happens, opponents do the same, regardless of cards held at the time.  This procedure mimics 'snap' and the player whose hand is on top also stops the clock timer and scores the amount indicated on the dial.<br/><br/>When any one player reaches 25 points, the game is over.  The winner is the player with the lowest score at that time.<br/><br/>",

The spheres have four holes each, so you can build dodecahedrons and different three-dimensional structures with penta- and hexagons, varying the possible forms, twisted and shrinked ... the fact you can turn the connectors even if it is already sticking in a hole, offers many ways for construction.<br/><br/>There are different kinds of games you can play with Pendoka, from easy to difficult:<br/>At &quot;Master of Pentagon&quot; the players get a certain number of colored spheres and connectors, each player his own color. The goal is to build after a couple of rules and hinder the others from building. Winner is the first player who built all his parts.<br/><br/>At &quot;F&uuml;nferkette&quot; (five-in-a-row) the winner is, who built the first five of his parts in a row, at &quot;Your Turn&quot; you have to enclose a sphere of the contrary player ...<br/><br/>There are even more Games in it, so Pendoka is not a single game of its own, but more a system, like Spiel (with hundreds of dice) - you can create your own rules, build as you want or have a look on the website for new ideas.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.pendoka.de\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.pendoka.de</a><br/><br/>",

Players can start a new food chain circle by playing a green card or they can add to an existing food chain circle by playing an orange or blue card with at least 1 matching food element to the adjacent card(s). The shape of the cards allows 8 cards to be played in a circle or &ldquo;rose&rdquo;. Whoever places the 8th card in a food chain circle gets to claim the set.

It's possible to be blown out or have a double overtime game.  Unlike programmed electronic games, no two games will ever be alike.<br/><br/>Take your favorite team to the FINAL FOUR!!!!<br/><br/>It's great fun!!!<br/><br/>Game includes: Team Rosters, Scoresheet Pads, Game Instructions, Scoresheet Instructions, Game Scoring Pads, Dice, Dice Cup<br/><br/>- - - - - -<br/><br/>Now, after reading the instructions, here's how the game works.<br/><br/>Coaches choose their starting lineup and allocate the players to a position (two forwards, two guards, and a center).  Then, they roll dice and confer with a standard results table (same table used for any team that plays--ie, there are no considerations for team or individual player talent level).  Repeat this until game is over.<br/><br/>Hence, the game is not realistic in the sense that Clemson can beat UNC just as easily as UNC can beat Georgia Tech.<br/><br/>The box cover shows the logos of the then-eight teams in the ACC.  Inside the box are all-star rosters for each of those teams (that is, players from different years play together), plus eight other teams (Georgetown, Indiana, Louisville, Marquette, UNLV, Notre Dame, St. Johns, and UCLA).  For whatever reason, Abdul-Jabbar/Alcindor is not included on the all-time UCLA team.<br/><br/>That's about it.  A basketball simulation with specified rosters, but you can list your own buddies names and get the same results when you take on the all-time all-star UNC Tarheels.<br/><br/>",

No copyright or authorship information is included with the game.<br/><br/>The materials are hand-made.  The box looks like a standard gift box with artwork pasted on.  The box insert and game base are constructed of foam board; the building pieces are thin, hand-painted wood or fiberboard.  There are three kinds of slats, all parallelograms.  Large red slats are notched at the end, large green slats at the ends and sides, and smaller yellow slats are notched at the corners.<br/><br/>Per the instructions, three slats are inserted in slots in the foam base and then the players take turns building a structure, adding slats by mating the notches.  If the structure falls or bends enough to touch the table anywhere but the base, the last player loses.<br/><br/>The notches are inconsistently cut, so it's nearly impossible to play - sometimes you can't get the pieces together, and sometimes they fit too loose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hunt the Higgs is an educational card game intended to introduce schoolchildren to a few of the basics of particle physics. Cards represent &quot;bosons&quot;, &quot;final states&quot; and experimental events.<br/><br/>Players take turns in trying to pair a boson with a final state from their hand to make as a high a score as possible. These scores are hidden from other players and the player with the highest card combinations at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>An elements of tactics is introduced with the experiment cards which can either boost your own experiments or interfere with those of other players. Play of one of these experiment cards is the mechanic that causes the game to end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DIX PETITS INDIENS is a French game based on the murder mystery novel by Agatha Christie in which ten people on an island get murdered by 10 different methods.<br/><br/>The game board represents the island with the locations of where the 10 bodies can be found.  The 10 characters are represented on 10 red cards and the 10 methods of death by<br/>10 blue cards. These are shuffled and placed face down on the 10 red and blue spaces on the outside of the board.<br/><br/>When it is his turn a player can (and must) carry out one of the following three actions:<br/><br/>1.    Simultaneously turn over one red and one blue card.  Look at their contents (in secret) and then return them face down to the spaces from which they came.<br/><br/>2.    Move his playing piece along one yellow line to a neighboring black or red space.<br/><br/>3.    Write down on a record sheet any information concerning the cards turned over in previous rounds.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is for players to work out where the matching red and blue cads are located and then move their playing piece to the appropriate location on the board to 'discover the body' (by turning over the two matching cards).  Successfully doing this earns the player one of 10 &quot;little Indians&quot;.  Making a mistake means the player loses his next two turns.<br/><br/>The game ends when all 10 bodies have been discovered, with the winner being the player that discovered the majority of them.<br/><br/>",

Each spot has a matching card which forms a pair; these cards are shuffled and form the draw pile for gameplay.<br/><br/>A turn consists of drawing a card and finding the matching spot on the gameboard.  Unmatched cards are placed face up in front of the drawer until the appropriate match is made.  Cards may be taken either from the draw pile, from in front of an opponent or from in front of the drawing player.  The player with the most matching pairs when all spots have been removed from the board is the winner.<br/><br/>The game has a garage theme tacked on rather loosely - the 'spots' are representative of spots found on a garage floor and many of the words on the discs relate to this theme - dirty spot, wet spot, danger spot, grease spot etc.  The gameboard is the garage floor.<br/><br/>",

The game is intended to instruct children on the environmental conditions and health practices conducive to the spread and prevention of dengue hemorrhagic fever.<br/><br/>Good-bye to Dengue combines traditional roll-and-move mechanics with question answering in the style of Trivial Pursuit. Board spaces represent practices (e.g., covering water containers), symptoms (e.g., a rash), and stages of the mosquito life cycle (egg, larva, pupa, adult). Players gain extra turns for answering questions correctly (for example, &quot;are the mosquitoes that transmit dengue and malaria the same?&quot;<br/><br/>Good-bye to Dengue originally appeared in an unpublished 1996 manuscript written by Lennon and titled, &quot;Health education and control of dengue hemorrhagic fever for schools and communities.&quot; The game was later reprinted as appendices K through N of Lennon's 2001 doctoral dissertation (Univ. Alabama at Birmingham) titled The Utility of a Board Game for Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Health Education. The dissertation is available through UMI Microform (number 3040921).<br/><br/>",

Were the extended panzer columns vulnerable to an Allied counter stroke?<br/><br/>While the game&rsquo;s core content is strongly derived from Dunkerque 1940, the game system and visual approach are totally new.

Players draw a card for their question number, choose a category, try to answer the matching question in the book, and -- if successful -- roll the die, advance, and repeat the procedure. A wrong answer ends the player's turn. Some spaces on the board force a player to answer from a specific category, though the player is limited to this constraint for only three unsuccessful turns.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to arrive at Blarney, &quot;and his prize is the life-long gift of eloquence.&quot;<br/><br/>Ideally the game is for two to six players, though its inventor notes that the game may be played solo. Six cardboard &quot;elves&quot; are provided, but the inventor add that it may also be played by more than six people by adding &quot;shirt buttons or pennies&quot; for the other players to move with.<br/><br/>Finally, the game contains an optional 1-hour tape of Irish music and dance, recorded live during a summer ethnic festival in Baltimore.<br/><br/>",

Elements of the game are:<br/><br/><br/>     A large number of marbles in solid colors including red, blue, yellow, green and purple.<br/>     A yellow plastic &quot;mountain&quot; in a volcano shape with a small rim at the bottom to catch fallen marbles.<br/>     A matching plastic cone that marbles are poured into and that the mountain is then fitted into.  The combination is inverted so that the mountain then rests on its base and the plastic cone is carefully lifted off, leaving the mountain evenly covered with a variety of solid colored marbles.<br/>     A set (I think there were 6 of these but am not positive; it might have been 4) of black cardboard playing fields cut into the profile of a mountain.  Approximately a dozen circular depressions are cut into each playing field, and these have a random distribution of colors matching the marble colors painted on them.<br/>     Several sets of oversized, blue plastic tweezers with blunt tips.<br/><br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the player who fills the most circles on his playing field by picking the appropriate color marbles off of the plastic mountain with the tweezers and setting them into the matching circles on his board, without causing an avalanche of marbles to cascade down the sides of the plastic mountain, and also without knocking any marbles out of their depressions on his playing field.  The first child to cause an avalanche or knock over her marbles loses.  In the event that none of the players create an avalanche or knock off marbles, then the first player to fill up all of the circles on her board wins.<br/><br/>Players must start at the base of their own mountain playing field and fill in the entire bottom row with marbles before ascending to the next row up.  Since each playing field has a unique distribution of colors, players will need different colors of marbles at different points in the game.  This means a layer of strategy can be added by trying to remove not only the color of marble you need next, but by selecting a specific marble of that color from the marble mountain that leaves your opponent with more difficult and avalanche-prone choices.<br/><br/>",

It's a tongue-twisting game of funny sounds and phrases.<br/><br/>On each turn, spin to find out which letter sound will be used to describe the words on the Blibber chip you have drawn. For example, if your Blibber is &quot;Penguin,&quot; and you spin &quot;B,&quot; you must begin all your words with the &quot;B&quot; sound. You might want to say, &quot;This animal lives in the Arctic,&quot; but instead would have to say, &quot;Bis Banimal Bivs Bin Be Barctic.&quot; If you spin the letter combination &quot;SH,&quot; it would be, &quot;Shis Shanimal Shivs Shin She Sharctic.&quot;<br/><br/>You can pass if your team gets stuck, but then you risk losing the Blibber chip to your opponents. Also, if you blab using an incorrect sound, the other team gets your chip. Continue collecting Blibber chips and describing words to your teammates until the 60-second timer runs out. The team with the most Blibber chips at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher's web site:<br/><br/>This murder mystery game is rated for Teen and Adult audiences. The murder does not take place at the party although there may be further murders that do. The main 12 characters are all couples very much in love. There are no affairs at all in this game. This game was created for church groups, class reunions or those looking for a VERY clean murder mystery game.<br/><br/>We also have a Mature rated Version. It is still relatively clean, but has more intrigue then the 'clean' version and it does have 1 past affair.<br/><br/>A Killer Reunion was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups, high school &amp; college reunions or others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!<br/><br/>Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.<br/><br/>This is the same game as our Class of '57, but we removed all reference to year &amp; school so that people could customize it to any year, decade or school. We have areas in the game that can be customized by you to perfectly match your event.<br/><br/>The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/killerreunion.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/killerreunion.htm</a><br/><br/>",

The 2-4 players each start with a single home planet and must accumulate resources to build ships, capture additional planets (obtaining more resources), and eventually conquer the other players' home planets.<br/><br/>There are three types of ships that can be built, plus immobile (but transportable) star bases. Somewhat unusually, players must keep track of each ship's fuel and weapons, and have a ship stop off for refueling when its onboard fuel supply gets too low. The deck of cards adds events and such to the long version of the game.<br/><br/>The components consist of a board, 4 record sheets in plastic folders, crayons for the record sheets, a reference chart, a set of rules, a deck of cards, and 4 sets of pre-cut counters.<br/><br/>The 1977 edition of Space War was sold in a rectangular box. The game was also published in ziplock format as Space War II. Based on the apparent similarity in the components between the two editions, it is unclear if there were any substantive revisions to the game or if the two editions simply involved a change in packaging.<br/><br/>",

It is 5 years later and Don &amp; MeMe Wannabe are hosting their annual New Years Eve Gala at their speakeasy The Four Deuces and you are invited to attend. The cream and not so cream of society will be there again.<br/><br/>This murder mystery game is rated for Teen and Adult audiences. The murder takes place at the party. There are references to prohibition / booze. This game has no affairs, but there are so many sub-plots going on that it has all the excitement of the first game. There is also no prostitute, madam or house of ill repute referenced in this version. They were not needed to bring the game forward 5 years. This is actually a pretty clean game that still manages to be very exciting in spite of it:-) It is filled with twists and turns.<br/><br/>Murder At The Four Deuces 2 is the sequel to our very popular Murder at the Four Deuces. It takes place 5 years later at a New Years Eve Party and has most of the original characters returning, along with a few new ones. You are not required to have played the original game to play this one, but I highly recommend doing so, as it does add a depth to the game. Guests who have played before will have a greater understanding of the characters, motives and backgrounds. If guests are playing the same character as previously played they will really have a blast with their matured character.<br/><br/>It's New Years Eve 1924 and Don &amp; MeMe Wannabe are hosting their annual New Years Eve Bash at their speakeasy The Four Deuces and you are invited to attend. The Four Deuces is a lavish joint. The cream and not so cream of society will be here. With gangsters, hit men, politicians, opera singers, molls and many other interesting guests in attendance there are sure to be a lot of big deals being made here tonight.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/4deuces2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/4deuces2.htm</a><br/><br/>",

Each year they assemble on All Hallow's Eve for a chilling celebration of sinfulness, an evening of evilness and a night chock-full of nightmares&hellip;.to say the least.  This year's blast will be NO exception as there is sure to be some major blood-curdling and hell-raising going on!  And so on this evil evening,  black silhouettes of broomstick riders can clearly be seen across the bright full moon as they head for the annual bash. The setting is perfect - a long forgotten cemetery where vampires and zombies, ghosts and ghouls, and mummies and monsters from all over the globe will party hardy ... until the sun begins to rise.<br/><br/>&quot;So what happened?&quot; Last seen, everyone was having a delightfully devilish time.  The guests were feasting on a barbeque of Malaysian monkey brain medley, river rat ragout, along with bubbling cauldrons overflowing with the potent plasma of Peruvian llamas. Bone chilling music, provided by Haggy May Maudlin and the &quot;Undertakers&quot;, echoed through the graveyard. A s&eacute;ance was in session and interestingly enough, the spirit of Sir Matthew Tudworthy had been conjured (executed for wizardry on October 31, 1694, Grave Harbor's only recorded execution). All in all, the boneyard bash was quite the smash! &hellip;that is until Lord Sagen Ray arrived.<br/><br/>&quot;Tell us more.&quot; Suddenly the evil gaiety stilled in silence as Lord Ray and Nadia Tarot (local gypsy extraordinaire) became involved in a rather &quot;heated&quot; conversation.  Nadia was heard to lash out, &quot;Liar! Liar!! Lord Sagen Ray&hellip;..you are nothing but a miserable master of falsehoods, an overlord of deception and, worst yet&hellip;&hellip;..a loathsome heart breaker!!!!<br/><br/>Nadia burst into tears and dashed toward a grove of pine.  The music began once again but the party was disrupted, for the second time, when an arrow flying through the air with the force of the devil speared and lodged into Lord Sagen Ray's head. Sagen's blood covered body then fell upon the grave of Sir Matthew Tudworthy.<br/><br/>Now it is time to join the Bogey Mann; Count and Countess Cadaver; the Grave Harbor Butcher; the Cemetery Skreecher; Boney Baloney; Black Beauty (the Headless Horsewoman); the ghosts of Sir Matthew Tudworthy and Lord Sagen Ray and many, many other creatures of the night. So get ready for a ghoulish, ghastly evening of masquerade, mystery and, of course, MURDER!<br/><br/>",

You will not just be watching, you will be completely involved in the wheeling and dealing. Can you outbid the opposition, keep your dark secret quiet and unmask the murderer? There is only one way to find out!<br/> A week before &quot;The Auction&quot; all of the guests attending will receive the front page of &quot;Yesterday's News&quot; - the antique dealers' magazine. This explains the background to the auction, the unfortunate death of Baroness Audry Von Munchen and the relics found on her last archaeological expedition. There will also be a copy of the guest list with a brief description of everyone attending the auction, including the character you have been given. This might be a lord, lady, the butler, a priest or even a spy!<br/><br/>On the day of the event the guests will be met by you, acting as the solicitor of the late baroness. When everyone has arrived you call the gathering to order, welcome the guests and introduce Inspector Clu d'Eau. As the events start to unravel, everybody opens their own personal envelopes of information and finds out what they have been up to.<br/><br/>The guests are soon the suspects as they start questioning, bribing and blackmailing each other. Towards the end, the auction itself takes place. All the deals and maneuvering come to fruition in a competitive flurry of bidding. After the auction the various claimants to the money make their cases and the solicitor decides between them. Inspector Clu d'Eau announces that he has solved the mystery of who has murdered the baroness. Everyone has a chance to make their accusations before the inspector reveals all.<br/><br/>More than just a boxed version of a murder game, &quot;The Auction&quot; provides you with everything you need to run a fun, participative event for 12 to 40 people. Every guest has a character, with their own objectives and money and/or props, making the game both memorable and enjoyable for all kinds of people. We have been running &quot;The Auction&quot; since 1989 for a wide range of companies and businesses such as IBM and American Express.<br/><br/>Because some of the guests at &quot;The Auction&quot; will have to play the part of criminals (including a drug-dealer) we think this game is suitable for people aged 15 and over.<br/><br/>If you have looked through the introduction, and like what you see, you should buy a password for the main game from our shop<br/><br/>",

When the Duke of Felthorpe is found dead in his bath, everything suggests that his death was accidental. The room was locked from the inside and, to gain entry, the door had to be broken down. So surely no one could have got in there and killed him!<br/><br/>Everyone taking part plays a character who is here for the reading of the duke&rsquo;s Last Will and Testament. The contents of the will are a surprise to almost all of them. So why did the duke make these last-minute changes? Was he being blackmailed? Was he mad? Should this will be thrown out &ndash; and replaced with an earlier one?<br/><br/>The murder mystery usually takes place during a meal. Fresh clues are introduced as the plot gradually unravels and evidence of murder emerges. One of the characters is the duke&rsquo;s butler &ndash; did he do it? Or was it the duke&rsquo;s maid? His idiot son? His idiot son&rsquo;s scheming wife? By the time all is revealed, everyone will have had a great time playing their parts, working out whodunnit and trying to prevent other people accusing them.<br/><br/>Who is the Reading of the Will suitable for? Almost anyone! No acting experience is needed to enjoy it and no one will be expected to do anything that will make them feel awkward. Although some of the characters behave badly, we don&rsquo;t believe the plot contains anything that would cause particular offense. But, because those under the age of 14 may have trouble understanding several matters referred to in the plot, we recommend it as suitable for those aged 14 and above.<br/><br/>",

It seems that Aurora's lifeless body was found on the cold, dirt floor of her cell in the Salem Prison for Wicked Women.  The letter &quot;A&quot; had been hastily sewn to the bodice of her dress and a black candle was found in her left hand. Aurora's lips had been stitched closed, coins had been placed on her eyelids and a hazelnut was found in each ear.<br/><br/>So what happened?<br/><br/>Many of the townspeople had been witness to strange and uncanny happenings around and about the Nightstorm cottage.  Some say that Aurora could take down a huge oak, chop it into firewood and stack it at her back door....with just the twitch of her nose. Others testify to have seen Aurora levitate to the top of her roof to rescue her curious, black feline....her faithful companion, &quot;Wee Gee&quot;.....and children claim to have seen Aurora fly through the sky chasing vampire bats. Therefore, it should be of no surprise that Governor Giles Bickford was presented with a petition for her arrest. The document had been signed by every man, woman and child in Salem.  Hence, the Governor had no alternative but to bring charges of &quot;Witchcraft&quot; against Aurora Nightstorm.<br/><br/>The trial was swift, the outcome, evident. Aurora was to swing from the gallows until dead.  But sometime during the pre-dawn hours someone paid Aurora a &quot;final visit&quot;. Alas, the townspeople will witness no vengeance against Aurora, their proclaimed, evil one. Who was it that dared enter her cell?  Who had reason to preempt the hangman?....and why??  To resolve this mystery one must be ready to venture back to the days of witch-hunts and sorcery. So, gather those black capes and broomsticks and come join the &quot;Sisters Three&quot; &ndash; Haggatha, Tabitha and Elain;  the Village Virgin, the Ghost of Lady Bickford, Evil Omen and the Reverend Smiley to name a few.<br/><br/>",

When Prohibition set in, Leroy hightailed it to Chicago and brought along his wife, El-le  May, his one-armed cousin, Clyde Hatfield, his Ma and Pa, his trusty bloodhound, Billie Blue&hellip;&hellip;and most importantly,  grandpappy Hatfield's recipe for moonshine. Leroy heard that making illegal hooch, or bathtub gin, and selling it to the local speakeasies was a great way to make some big money&hellip;.and so &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; rented a cold-water flat on the southside and set up his trusty still.  It wasn't long before his potent NOTO &quot;Nectar of the Ozarks&quot; became very popular with the club owners&hellip;and their patrons.<br/><br/>Tells us more ~<br/><br/>A wild time was being had by all at &quot;Rosies&quot;, very popular speakeasy owned by Second-Hand Rose Romanowitz. The gin was flowing and a  Charleston contest was in full swing. It was a Saturday night and the joint was really jumpin! Outside, Leroy and Billie Blue were making the last delivery of the night when a dark automobile slowly pulled in front of the club. Suddenly, tommy guns began blasting, barrels of booze started bursting.......and when the dust settled, Leroy's bullet ridden body was lying in a puddle of blood&hellip;.and NOTO.  Who could have left Leroy belly-up?  Was this a mob hit?&hellip;the work of the vengeful revenuer?&hellip;&hellip;or do we smell a &quot;McCoy&quot;?

        "description": "From the Publisher's web site:<br/><br/>Homicide, horse-trading and horrid goings-on: a murder mystery in which it's not just the horses that get taken for a ride!<br/><br/>For 14 to 40 guests.<br/><br/>Set in timeless rural England, Cudham Riding Club offers all those taking part the chance to belong to the stirrup set for a few hours. Everyone is given a character, and whether you end up playing a Lord, a Lady, a dustman or a horse meat wholesaler, you will encounter more skulduggery, adultery, coercion and crime than in the entire works of Jilly Cooper, Joanna Trollope and Dick Francis. <br/> Lady Amanda Cudham, founder and chairwoman of the club, has died in tragic and mysterious circumstances. Our plot unfolds during a meeting of the club, where members decide who should replace Amanda as chairwoman.<br/><br/>Invitations are sent out in advance, so everyone knows which character they are playing and understands some of the background. The plot is usually run over a meal and, as well as solving the murder, characters are given other objectives to achieve. Some, for instance, want to become the next chairwoman. Some have guilty secrets to keep hidden. Some have scores to settle. And everyone is keen to get rich, buy and sell a few horses, and place a few bets before the Race of the Season (the Isle of Man Handicap) gets underway.<br/><br/>No knowledge of horses is needed to run or enjoy this plot. How much guests become involved is up to each individual but, in our own experience, even the quiet ones become utterly caught up in the action.<br/><br/>Towards the end, a live commentary of the Isle of Man Handicap is read out and winning bets are paid out. The guest playing Inspector Dawdley then gets everyone into teams and invites each of them to put forward their solution. Finally, Dawdley reads out the correct solution, arrests the murderer and brings a fun-filled, highly entertaining and irresistibly silly occasion to a close.<br/><br/>Word of warning:<br/><br/>The behavior of some of the characters in &quot;Cudham Riding Club&quot; is appalling: they take drugs, they gamble, they cheat on their partners, they kill. As a result, we consider the plot to be suitable only for people aged 15 and over.<br/><br/>",

The plantation is buzzing with excitement as the O'Hoara family tend to the preparations. All is going well until it is discovered that Massa Big Daddy is no where to be found!<br/><br/>It seems that Big Daddy's favorite slave, Gusbo Tac, came across his beloved Massa's straw hat, treasured pipe, and blood stained monogrammed handkerchief in an empty slave cabin. Sensing foul play, Gusbo ran to the main house to inform Massa's wife (or as she is known to the slaves, &quot;Miz Massa&quot;) of this alarming discovery.<br/><br/>Back at the plantation a ransom letter is found on the mantel in the great room. It is printed in block letters and reads as follows:<br/><br/>MIZ MASSA, IF YOUIN EVER WANTS TO SEES YOUR MAN AGEEN PUTS $100,000 IN CASH OR GOLD IN A SACK AND GIVES IT TO AUNT MAMMY. SHE BE GETTING STRUCKSONS. DO IT, OR MASSA, HE BE DEAD!<br/><br/>Who wrote this note? Why? Will Massa be released&hellip;&hellip;..or is he, be dead?<br/><br/>Come join the suspects, Massa's daughter, Scarface O'Hoara; his devoted wife, Ima O'Hoara; famous proctologist, Butt Rhetler, M.D.; and adopted son, Al A. bammy (just to name a few) and test your sleuthing abilities and try to detect just who swiped Massa&hellip;&hellip;maybe it was you!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Contrary to what our history books tell us, the colonists did not leave England to gain freedom&hellip;.not by a long shot. They left their homeland to gain spacious new territories, listen to jazz and enjoy fast food. However, they did not expect the numerous and unfortunate encounters with the Native Americans. Hence, the colonists needed the support of the British Army. NO WAY DID THEY EVER WANT INDEPENDENCE!  Why, they even held a tea party in Boston to honor King George and to present their &quot;DECLARATION OF DE-PENDENCE&quot;.  This document begged for more British intervention and rule. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness were a little harder than expected.  Their Declaration revealed an emotional pleas for more taxes, more stern governors and the security of the Army.<br/><br/>So what happened?  Well, unfortunately for the colonists, King George was fed up the &quot;American Leaches&quot; and wanted to sever all ties. Thaddeus Bell, Philadelphia's Town Crier, was to spread the news of the King's intention&hellip;&hellip;intention of war! &quot;Was&quot; is the key word here for Thaddeus never did get the opportunity to ring his bell. The poor fellow's body was found in bed by a rather shaken chambermaid.<br/><br/>Come visit colonial Philly in the year 1776 and join General Eggs Benedict Arnold, Prudence Plum, Paul Reverse, the Princess Featherbed (to name just a few) and help reveal the facts that will lead to the culprit.  So get out those powdered wigs and pewter goblets and get read to solve &quot;Murder in Philly!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher's web site:<br/><br/>It is time for the All Saints College Class of '57 Reunion. For one night we will return to the good old days when Elvis was at the top of the charts. Sock hops, hula-hoops and poodles were radioactive. Getting pinned meant something altogether different than it does these days.<br/><br/>The Class of '57 was written to be a little different than the rest of our games. First of all the 10 or 12 main suspects are all couples very much in love. Couples will be working together at times to achieve goals. They may have some secrets from each other, but overall they will be working to protect each other. This gives the game a romantic flavor. This murder mystery game is what we would call a 'clean' game. There are no affairs &amp; people are basically good. This game is great for church groups and others who are worried about the possibility of offending guests. It can also be used for older teen groups!<br/><br/>Another difference is that the murder happens before the game. Being a couples murder mystery we felt it would be too complicated to murder them both or only one. That is not to say that there won't be more murders during the evening. Those tend to happen in our games since we provide a lot of intrigue outside of the murder itself.<br/><br/>The 12 player version has 6 couples and we include our 2 Extra Character Packets to expand the game up to 32. The Extra Character Packets add a little quirky flavor to the party, but not all of these 20 extra characters may be suitable for conservative groups. (Remember... these are included FREE in the 12 player version, no need to purchase them!)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It was a gray day for all the world's comic book readers to learn that the robot that was once the famous, &quot;Robo Gal&quot; was found deprogrammed behind the old Metropolis Theater. Wire harnesses, electronic components, and floppy disks had been strewn about the deserted parking lot. Detectives on the scene immediately noticed that Robo Gal's electro-cerebrum had been tampered with.... as well as her power pack units. Her legendary umbrella with its unique candy cane handle was found on the pavement along with a leaking can of acid. A set of stainless steel wrenches, a flying bat and batteries were also found on the scene as well as&hellip;a clove of garlic, a chocolate candy bar, and some French fries!<br/><br/>Tell us more&hellip;<br/><br/>The annual celebration of the world's most famous &quot;superheroes&quot; was just about to commence. These worshiped figures always assembled for their yearly &quot;SUPER-BLAST&quot; party in the secret ballroom located in the basement of the old abandoned theater. Each year they honor one of their peers with the &quot;Trophy of Power &quot;and this year Robo Gal was to be the recipient of this tribute. Robo Guy was preparing to make the announcement when it was discovered that our beloved Robo Gal was nowhere to be seen. While everyone searched the ballroom and the theater, X-ray Faye, with her incredible super duper infer-ray vision, turned on her powers and was able to look right through the old thick theater walls. There, to her dismay, she saw the remains of her beloved friend and compatriot.<br/><br/>Who could have committed this horrible crime? Why would anyone want to do away with the wonderful Robo Gal? And what was with the garlic, chocolate and fries??????  Hmmmmmmm.<br/><br/>So now it's time to grab those capes, turn on your powers and join this gang of superheroes for an evening of masquerade, mystery, and MURDER!<br/><br/>",
