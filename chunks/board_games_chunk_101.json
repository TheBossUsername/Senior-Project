Apart from the map being as seen in a mirror, the only difference in its layout is an extra link between two planets. For some obscure reason, the game is limited to four players - maybe because they ran out of cool colors, as they used black, white, gold and silver.<br/><br/>",

Also, each bingo card has every picture so all players have something to do each turn.  The pictures are randomized through the use of a spinner.  The spinner has a built-in musical chime sound mechanism which is pleasing to the ear.<br/><br/>Since all cards have all pictures, play is fast and easy.  A recommended variation lengthens the game by having each player spin only for themsleves.<br/><br/>Ages 4-8.<br/><br/>",

(There is also a very strong source of power that moves randomly around the board.) Wizards can make direct physical attacks on one another, cast offensive or movement spells (using two shared Fate decks -- cheaper and weaker Primary Fate cards and stronger and more expensive Secondary Fate cards), or summon elementals to fight on their behalf. The last player with a wizard or elemental left in the arena wins.<br/><br/>The approximate playing time is a guess and will probably depend on the number of players and their temperament.<br/><br/>The designer created this game when he was a sophomore at Booker T.

        "description": "Max Backtalk is an electronic memory/reaction game that uses the player's own voices. To begin, each player sits by a colored button and speaks a word into the microphone. The game starts by Max flashing a player's light and repeating that player's word. The player scores a point by quickly pressing his or her button. If your reaction time is too slow you lose a point. Max then calls another player's word and so on. Be careful - Max can also bluff by calling one player's word and lighting another player's light. Any player that reacts would then lose a point. The longer you play, the faster the words are spoken and the lenses light. The player with the most points at the end is the winner. An elimination version, and a simple memory game (ala Simon) can also be played.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of a spiral recessed track, 32 small containers (8 in each of 4 colors) and 16 chips.  The chips are put in half the containers (four per color) and the containers are mixed together so that the locations of the chips are hidden.  The containers are placed in the spiral and players take turns rearranging the containers.  When players move pieces of their own color (or have permission from the owning player) they shake them and listen for the chips.  When four pieces of a color are in a row in the spiral, the player collects the chips contained within.  The first player to find all of his chips wins.

        "description": "Six circular areas, each with a sweeping radar at its core, are surrounding a central area, again with its own radar system. Each radar is surrounded by three rings, marked 1 (=inner) to 3 (=outer), and each radar zone is divided into 6 pie-parts, except for the central radar zone, which has 12 pie-parts. The radars themselves are small dots at the center of each zone. The outer 6 radars each have 2 pie-bits connected to a neighbor. One movable radar beam is placed on each station, covering a sixth of each circular area, and a beam half that size is  placed in the central zone. Each player takes ownership of an equal amount of outer radar posts, and gets a small squadrons in the same color. These are then placed on the starting fields on the outer edge of the board, just outside their own radar post zone.<br/><br/>Using dice, 2-6 players try to keep their fleet of planes under the radar, and the first one to sneak 3 planes of one color into the center zone is the winning commander.<br/><br/>In turn, players will first move the radar beam at their own station forwards. The beam speed depends on the activity within the zone. Any planes that get caught by the sweeping beam have to abort their attempt to reach the center, and return to their start location to start another approach.<br/><br/>After that, the planes move, by rolling 4 dice. Planes are under no obligation to move, but when a die gets allocated to a plane, the entire move has to be made. Planes start on the outer rim and move, avoiding the area covered by the radar beam, clockwise or anti-clockwise, along the ring it is currently occupying. However, in the pie-part that touches its neighbor, planes have an opportunity to &quot;flop&quot; radar stations instead of continuing on their current track. When they do flop, they move their plane to the other station's pie-part, but place the plane one ring closer to that's station's radar than the one they just left.<br/><br/>When a plane leaves the most central track and flops right on top of a neighboring radar, called the blitz-field, that plane is then immediately moved to the outer ring of the central radar, which is surrounded by 2 rings. Each subsequent plane of that color that manages to make it to the central zone undetected, arrives one ring closer to its center. When the third plane of a color pops up on the most central ring, that player is the winner.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, the central radar also sweeps forwards, the speed again depending on how crowded the central zone is, and detected planes must abort and start their mission again from the beginning. After each round a new turn-order is established.<br/><br/>This is a fairly abstract race game, using a novel mechanic, that works quite well. It is probably slightly more complex than the average Spielbox game, but simple enough to appeal to a family audience.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (4/1984 oct-dec), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. Its novel movement mechanism made it the winner in Spielbox' &quot;Invent-a-Game&quot; competition. Some assembly required.<br/><br/>This is not the first &quot;dodging&quot; collaboration between Bernd Brunnhofer and Karl-Heinz Schmiel. A year before the pair had given the start signal for &quot;Hans im Gl&uuml;ck&quot; by self-publishing Dodge City, in partnership with Bernd's wife Margaret.<br/><br/>",

Goal is to catch the robot while spending as little energy as possible. Rules suggest that each players gets to play as the robot once, and then the scores are added.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players first choose an action card. There are cards which cost a different amount of energy (victory points); they cause the evil player to give more or less precise information about his current hiding place. Another type of card leads to some dexterity/sports contest between the evil and one of the good players; if good wins, they can make a guess where the robot is now.<br/><br/>After this, the players move their submarines; but they are restricted in the paths they may use.<br/>Then the robot moves; he may use all paths, but can never return to a place he was before, which limits his moves as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Game ends with a victory of good when the players reach the robot, when the robot has no legal move left, or when the players guess right after winning a dexterity challenge. The robot player wins if he survives until the action card deck is exhausted after 16 turns.<br/><br/>",

The pieces race in the same direction along opposite edges of the board rather than circling the entire board as in Backgammon.<br/><br/>The pieces start off board. Entry and movement are determined by the roll of two dice. The number on each die may be used separately to move two pieces or combined to move a single piece, except when doubles are rolled in which case the player is only allowed to move the amount shown on a single die (i.e. on a roll of double sixes, the player is allowed to move only one piece six spaces). Rolls which may not be played are lost.<br/><br/>Each player's pieces must remain in their order of entry - there is no passing - and two pieces cannot share a space except when they reach the home space (the twelfth point) at the end of the board. When a piece is moved to a space which is immediately opposite a space containing an opponent's piece (except the home spaces at the end of the board), the opposing piece is sent back off the board to re-enter on that player's next roll.<br/><br/>",

Armies constructed of Samurai from the same clan are more powerful than armies using various clans.

But yet, if they choose to let it help them, it will push me over the top to get an early Province lead. While not all cards involve decisions quite this Paradoxical, it was the driving inspiration for this Chapter to the Dominion Fan Universe. Consider printing this fan expansion if you are interested in:<br/>A) heightened player interaction;<br/>B) more variety in win conditions;<br/>C) additional powerful card combinations depending on setup;<br/>D) shifted timing, with once strong early game cards becoming strong only late game (in certain setups);<br/>E) non-obvious cards which involve more critical thinking than &ldquo;do I have any actions left&rdquo; to play;<br/>F) and just generally re-thinking how best to play.<br/><br/>New mechanics (and further exploration of existing mechanics) to accomplish this include:<br/>Curses &ndash; A greater variety of curse cards, some of which you&rsquo;ll actually want (in controlled quantities).<br/>Loops &ndash; Sustain a card ability as long as you can meet the trigger.<br/>Vulnerability &ndash; A new type of interaction with other players and increased occurrence of Attack &ndash; Reaction plays.<br/>Guilds and Variant Rules &ndash; New goals to aim for to mix up the rather abstract strive for victory point cards.<br/>Reaction cards &ndash; A higher saturation than normal of reaction cards that respond to more than just attack cards. Some you may choose to reveal only at the right times they are triggered rather than at every opportunity. And others are simply beneficial to all, in a somewhat reverse attack fashion.<br/><br/>_________________________________________________________________<br/>Components:<br/>Total Expansion Size (with all options)<br/>587 cards &ndash; 36 mats &ndash; 46 tokens &ndash; 1 rules document<br/><br/>Kingdom cards &ndash; 404 cards (40 decks: 38 decks of 10 cards, + 2 Victory card decks of 12 cards)<br/><br/>Other cards / components: optional (breakdown in rules)<br/><br/>",

The players act as narrators, moving Allan by playing cards and collecting points. Let your skills take over, earn points and travel around the world together with Allan! (Translation from the box back)<br/><br/>The game is based on the best-selling book &quot;Hundra&aring;ringen som klev ut genom f&ouml;nstret och f&ouml;rsvann&quot; (The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared) by the Swedish author Jonas Jonasson.<br/><br/>Players play cards to move the common Allan figure on the world map and to trigger events (related to the book storyline). Events score points for the player and move the time marker forward on the time track. When the marker reaches the end, the game ends and the player with most points wins. The key to winning is to have Allan in the right locations in the right time, as most events can only be played in a certain city at a certain time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Textra is word game, that consist of a plastic container, 206 letter tiles and 4 letter trays - clearly inspired by Scrabble, but the main gimmick here is the plastic container with clever mechanism to separate vowels and consonants. In the container you have trail where you put your letter tiles to make words. And when the trail is full (something like 15 tiles), the first used letters drop in to two departments one for vowels and other for consonants.<br/><br/>When you start the game, the first player puts one vowel and one consonant in any order in to the trail and then every player gets six letter tiles to make words. You can choose the distribution of vowels and consonants at the start of the game and always when you refill your tile tray. At the players turn you try to make a word using as many already laid letters in a trail as the first letters of your new word. Rest of your word consists of letters you have in your tray. You just put the letters from your tray to the trail to make a new word. Then you multiply newly added letters with letters you used from the previous ones and that makes your points. You fill your hand and then it is the next players turn.<br/><br/>Example: &quot;AUTO&quot; becomes &quot;autoMATIC&quot; (4*5=20 pts.), then &quot;ticK&quot; (3*1), then &quot;tickLE&quot; (4*2) etc.<br/><br/>In a four player game you play to the end of the round, when someone gets total of 60 points. Winner is the player who got the most points. In three player game you play until 80 points and with two players until 100 points. When playing alone you just decide number of rounds and try to make as many points as as you can.<br/><br/>You can play this game as long as you like, because the used letters are dropping back to containers departments, which is the same place where you take the new letter tiles. There is 100 vowel tiles and 100 consonant tiles and six wild tiles in the game. There's quite a few letters missing, that are used in Finnish language. Letter distribution of the game is:  vowels: (40*A, 10*E, 20*I 15*O, 15*U) and consonants: (5*H, 5*J, 15*K, 15*L, 5*M, 10*N, 5*P, 5*R, 10*S, 20*T, 5*V). You can play the game in any language, where you can make enough words with these letters. Because of &quot;the clever&quot; mechanism, the vowel tiles are bit smaller than the consonant tiles.<br/><br/>",

Players can be divided into 3 groups, Traitors, Loyal shipmates and the captain.<br/><br/>Traitors try to eliminate the captain, who is known by everyone, and the loyal mates while the shipmates try to defend the captain and kill all the traitors. The captain's goal is simply to stay alive, but since he's the only one oblivious to the other players loyalty, it can be harder than it looks.<br/><br/>The two main groups will then decide, one after the other, which meal they want to poison and once this is done the round can start.

The villagers try to kill the monster before more than half of them are caught.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this Finnish Formula racing game the car is represented by two standard pawns. The game starts so that everyone has one on the board, then a special die is rolled. If you get 1, 2 or 3 you put your other pawn on the board - now you are on the move. But beware, as your moves always affect your next move as well. The basic idea is that you always move by putting the pawn that is behind in the exact opposite spot (called &quot;A&quot;-spot) in front of the other pawn. You do however roll the die on each turn and that tells you how many grid points you can deviate from the &quot;A&quot; spot (from 0-3). Deviating sideways represents steering while deviating the two pawns closer or further apart represents deceleration and acceleration. Thus, the two pawns form a vector which represents the car's speed and it goes without saying that if you approach a tight curve with a too long vector (=too high speed) you won't be able to make it within the possible die results, but will crash out of the track. Crashing will cause you to pass a number of turns equal to your speed, which is doubled if the crash happened in a particularly difficult spot, as marked on the board. Rolling a &quot;NO&quot; will force you to pass the turn while rolling a &quot;FREE&quot; gives you an extra turn. Rolling 0 means that the car simply keeps it speed and direction for that turn (with possibly disastrous results if it happens many times in a row).<br/><br/>Hitting a green spot on the track causes you to pick a Turbo card (good) while hitting one of the more plentiful yellow spots means a Danger card (bad, surprisingly). Hitting one of the red spots gives you a free move, which is somewhat limited by the blue lines that divide the track into shorter &quot;race areas&quot;.<br/><br/>After a pre-agreed number of laps, the winner is the player who first manages to cross the finish line AND bring their car to a controlled full stop.<br/><br/>The game promises to give &quot;a surprisingly realistic feel of racing&quot;.<br/><br/>The game comes with the basic track of Monza. Additional tracks have been published for Hockenheim, Las Vegas and Monaco (1983).<br/><br/>",

In turn, each player plays a card to add to their attack, repel an opponent's attack with a defense card, or modify an attack or prevent a defense; alternatively, a player can pass to skip one turn. If all players are out of cards or pass in turn, the round ends, and whoever has the highest attack value wins. If, however, a player would increase their attack value to 5, they win the round immediately.<br/><br/>The round's winner receives Roman denarii, and whoever first collects 5 Roman denarii wins.<br/><br/>",

In this combo building card game for 2 players, each player leads a fledgling tribe rebuilding after the near end.  Using 3 Action cards and multi-use Lord cards, players will call upon the Lords for help, expand their tribe, and search for shards of the old world.<br/><br/>Each Lord card can potentially be played 4 different ways: played for its ability, as a Devotion, as a Shard, or as a Nomad.<br/><br/>There are no points in Soulfall; the game ends and a player wins if they have a certain number and/or type of cards.<br/><br/>This is a card only, two player adaptation of the original 2015 Soulfall board game.  This adaptation, while it loses the board, as well as some of the original game's timing weirdness and confusing scoring, utilizes multi-use cards and the same action system to replicate the original in a quick playing, combo driven, card only game for two players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, each of these nine games is in itself a square within one Master Game.  Thus, when a player wins an individual game, he or she will also be winning one of the large squares in the 10th or Master Game.<br/><br/><br/>In Tic Tac Toe Times 10 each cell of the 3x3 grid of the master-game is broken into a 3x3 grid for a mini-game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You play each mini-game of  Tic-Tac-Toe normally to try and win that cell in the Master grid.<br/><br/>There is a twist to normal Tic-Tac-Toe play however. The first player can place their piece in any of the 91 min-board squares on the board. After that each player must move to the mini-game which their opponent sends them.<br/><br/><br/>    So if the first player plays in the top right square of one of the 9 mini-games, then the opponent must play their move in the minigame in the top right Master cell. Subsequent play follows the same rule. <br/><br/><br/><br/>    There are two exceptions to this however for which you get an open turn and you may place your piece on any tile you like.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Your opponent sends you to a tile that has already been won (either by you or them).<br/>        Your opponent sends you to a tile which is full, and hence a tie. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Winning Condition<br/><br/>The first player to win 3 cells in a row in the Master game wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>Playing board<br/>39 small &quot;X&quot;<br/>39 small &quot;O&quot;<br/>9 large &quot;X&quot;<br/>9 Large &quot;O&quot;<br/>(Instructions printed in boxtop)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Rules Booklet (of around '8'-pages in length):&quot; With Fire and Sword is a game type simulation of the Thirty Years War period. From 1618 to 1648 most of Western Europe was engulfed in a brutal dynastic struggle. The game is an operational/strategic Level simulation with each turn representing one year and military units representing armies of various types and strengths.&quot; This is basically a (2) player game with (1) player having the &quot;Habsburg&quot; forces, while the other player has the &quot;Anti-Habsburg&quot;(or 'Coalition') forces. There are (3) Scenarios presented, beginning the Game at either '1618', '1630', or even '1636'. Players will need to provide their OWN '6'-sided DIE, before commencing play. This game is described as: &quot;A medium complexity strategic game of this period of turmoil.&quot; The TROOP 'strengths' can be considered as 'hidden' since the FRONT of the 'counter' depicts ONLY that it is a TROOP, while on the REVERSE of them is the actual 'strength' denomination. The scale is given as '48'-kilometres across EACH 'Hex' and &quot;Yearly&quot; Game Turns. This Game was produced in either a &quot;Plastic Baggie&quot; form, or as a &quot;Boxed&quot; edition, for those that might find one of these versions.<br/><br/>The gamemap(of '3'-colors~BLUE, TAN, GRAY or a combination of those) depicts an area encompassing Eastern France &amp; the 'Benelux' countries, over to mid-Poland/Hungary, and from Northern Italy up to the Baltic Coast. As is usual with the excellent production values of the fine folks at &quot;Simulations Canada&quot;, this gamemap has plenty of useful information contained upon the 'Gamemap', such as: a 'Terrain Key'; a 'Victory Point Track'; (3)~&quot;Resources Available&quot; Charts(for EACH of the '3' Scenarios); an 'Event Generation' Table; 'Movement &amp; Winter Attrition' Tables; with 'Field and Siege Combat Results' Tables. There are '200' Game counters(printed on FRONT and BACK) in quite a large variety of COLORS, such as: RED; Dark RED; BURGUNDY; BROWN; PINK; YELLOW; GREEN; BLUE; Dark BLUE; Light BLUE; TAN; GRAY and WHITE. These mainly consist of TROOP and LEADER counters, with small silhouettes for them, while there are other 'Informational'(with appropriate 'silhouettes') ones as well, such as: 'CONTROL'; 'Siege'; 'Plague'; 'Famine'; 'Barren'; 'Sacked';  'Rebuild'; 'Game Turn'; numbered counters from '1~6'; and (2) sets of 'Victory Point Track' markers('1' SET for EACH player).<br/><br/>The &quot;Sequence of Play&quot; is as follows:<br/>A.-Payment and Recruitment Phase:<br/>1.-Pay Units on Map. 2.-Recruit new Units. 3.-Place new Leaders. 4.-Wounded Leaders recover.<br/>B.-Flip 'Sacked' Markers and Remove 'Rebuilding' Markers.<br/>C.-Event Phase: 1.Roll Yearly 'Event' and any Scenario *Special* 'Event'.<br/>D.-Initiative Phase<br/>E.-Movement and Combat Phase: [1st Player]<br/>1.-Movement 2.-Field Combat 3.-Siege Combat<br/>F.-Movement and Combat Phase: [2nd Player]~same as 1st Player.<br/>G.-Siege Maintenance Phase<br/>H.-Removal of 'Barren' counters placed previous year.<br/>I.-Winter Attrition Phase<br/>J.-Control Phase<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>",

Each player takes a playing piece and starts anywhere on any of the 4 edges of the board (just off the edge). You can move one space per turn. When you land on a space, you must perform the instruction on it. If you land on a space with an arrow, you must move that direction on the next turn.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first player to the center of the board.

(Also included in the box is an expansion adding additional roles with other effects on the scoring and gameplay.)<br/><br/>The game starts with as many Treasure cards as there are players stacked in a face-down pile. Players then take turns playing a card from their hand face down on top of the stack, announcing it as one of the cards it might or might not actually be can be (Knight, Noble, or Thief).<br/><br/>After all players have played all their cards, the deck is flipped over and the cards are scored in order.<br/><br/>Thieves will take all cards played before them, unless the next card (played right after it) is a Knight. The Thief (or Knight), and all the cards taken are given to the player who played it, and then the remaining cards are scored - up to the next Thief.<br/><br/>A Knight by himself does not take any cards. Only Knights right after Thieves can take any cards.<br/><br/>Treasure and Noble cards do not have any effect, but do count toward scoring when they have been taken.<br/><br/>If you look at them left to right, with the bottommost treasure cards on the left, a sample game might look like this:<br/><br/>An example 3-player game, with Red, Blue, and Green, using K, N, T, and X to represent Knights, Nobles, Thieves, and Treasure<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         X<br/><br/>         X<br/><br/>         X<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         T<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         T<br/><br/>         K<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         K<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         T<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         ...<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Blue's Thief is not beaten by a Knight (Green played a Noble after it) so Blue gets 5 cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         N<br/><br/>         T<br/><br/>         K<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         K<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         T<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         ...<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Blue's Knight beats Red's Thief, and Blue gets 3 more cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         N<br/><br/>         K<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         T<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         N<br/><br/>         ...<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Red's Knight does nothing.

        "description": "The Game of Nancy is a betting, trick taking, and partially co-operative card game played with a seventy-eight card tarot deck. The game is frequently played by people of the video game universe of Dishonored (published by Bethesda Softworks). The official rules are included with the Dishonored Tarot Deck which was included as a pre-order bonus of the video game in some regions.<br/><br/>It is mostly co-operative in so much as it is a turn-based game in which players change teams from round to round based on which player bets they can win the most tricks with the card they have been dealt. The winner of the betting round, or the Taker, then plays against the other players to win as many elected tricks before the round's end. At the conclusion of a round, the Taker's ability to completed win the required tricks is scored and the inverse of the Taker's score is given to each of the remaining players. The player left of the previous round's Taker deals a new round and bidding begins once again.<br/><br/>The Game of Nancy has no set winning end score and thus, duration is unknown. The rules state that a target score should be set, and agreed upon, prior to game commencement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the packaging:<br/><br/>&quot;An addictive game of strategy versus risk for any number of players. Roll the dice and build your score... but learn to judge when to stop!&quot;<br/><br/>The game comes in a plastic blister pack. It contains a &quot;velveteen&quot; dice pouch, six dice with roman numerals, a black-and-white rule book with historical notes, and a black-and-white score pad.<br/><br/>A turn consists of the player rolling all six dice. If he scores any points, according to a list of scoring combinations (e.g. three &quot;D&quot;s score 500 points), he may then set aside these and roll again, getting the chance to accumulate more points. Alternatively, he can stop rolling and keep his accumulated score. If he rolls a no-scoring throw, then he  scores zero for that turn, even if he had set aside scoring dice from previous rolls. His points are then recorded, and play passes on to the next player. The game ends when someone scores 5000 points; everyone else &quot;with a turn left&quot; then gets a chance to better this player's score.<br/><br/>The historical notes claim that this is a real ancient Roman game, originating from the late republic.<br/><br/>As of writing, this game is being sold in museum shops in the UK, at historic sites related to ancient Rome (e.g. sites on Hadrian's Wall).<br/><br/>",

Don&rsquo;t forget to charge up your cannons to shoot down your enemies&rsquo; sails. Galeone Galeotto is a game of luck and memory.<br/>You first have to try and pick up from the table your four pirate cards with different colors, before forming the ship crew.<br/>Pay attention, if you pick up a pirate in a color you already have just put it back on the table... then try and recall where your enemies have put them, one never knows!<br/>Once your crew is recruited, the whole staff is completed and you can start firing at the enemies&rsquo; galleons. You pick up cannon cards that allow you allow to hit other sails with a given color: the yellow cannon hits a yellow sail, the green cannon a green sail...<br/>Yet you have to set the strategy and decide which galleon you want to shoot at.<br/>Sail before the wind and... fire!<br/><br/>Available as pdf download on the Kidultgames Homepage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is another charming key-chain game from Haba. An unusual feature of this range of games is that the name of the game that appears on the packaging (and only the back of the packaging) is different from the name of the game in the rulebook. So while this game might be labeled as Zwerge, the rules call it Schneewitten und die sieben Zwerge (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs).<br/><br/>Described as a cheeky die game for 2 dwarfs aged 4-99, the authors are Wolfgang Dirscherl (who has designed several games in this series) and Markus Nikisch. The illustrations are by Stefan Fischer.<br/><br/>You get 7 wooden dwarfs in 3 colours (divided 3-2-2), and a special die with spots of the 3 colours (the colour with 3 dwarfs is repeated), a side showing Snow White and a side showing the wicked witch. Players take turns rolling the die. If the die shows a coloured spot, the player takes a dwarf of that colour from the centre, or from the other player if there aren't any more of that colour in the centre. If the die shows Snow White, the player gets to take a dwarf of any colour from the centre or the other player. If the die shows the wicked witch, the player nominates a colour and both players return all dwarfs of that colour to the centre. The game ends when there are no more dwarfs in the centre and the player with the most dwarfs wins.<br/><br/>",

Castle tokens are won from successful sieges of different castles throughout the game, as the king travels across the country evaluating the knights' skills. Whoever wins shall be king!<br/><br/>The game includes a large board with four cardboard castles (square spaces closed off with walls) with turrets, upon which ladders with differing numbers of knights are hung. The king moves on a track in the middle of the board. Different spaces on the track may indicate different castles upon which sieges will be scored. In order to score for a siege, a player must have the appropriate amount of knight tokens on the spaces under the castle walls, as well as ladders with knights. To place a ladder or token (or draw an 'intrigue' card), dice are rolled by the leading player in that turn, and each player takes off a die and resolves the appropriate action.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Immortal is a strategy game of warring mythologies, combining area control and card battle play. The war of the gods has begun... Born from the dreams and nightmares of mankind, mythic beings are gathering forces to crush their enemies. They have put their fate in the hands of mere mortals like yourself, granting you the power to lead them to victory. Capture your opponents&rsquo; forces, turn their powers against them, and forge your own legend!<br/><br/>In Immortal, ancient gods, heroes, and monsters battle for control over mythic realms. 2 to 4 players assume command of powerful pantheons summoned from world mythologies - Master Set One features the Norse, Greek, Japanese, Celtic, Egyptian, and Native American pantheons. Each pantheon of character cards offers unique abilities and strategies to be mastered. Battles take place on a battlefield created from modular board tiles, representing the nexus of mythical realms. The goal of the game is to control the most cards on the battlefield by capturing your opponents&rsquo; cards and defending your own.<br/><br/>During the game, players take turns placing their character cards on the spaces of the board. Each card has a distinct combination of battle strengths, represented by numbers on its four edges. When a card is placed on a space adjacent to the north, south, east, or west edge of an opponent&rsquo;s card, an attack begins and the strengths on the cards&rsquo; touching edges are compared. If the attacker&rsquo;s strength is greater, then the defending card is successfully captured, giving the attacking player more control over the battlefield. Special abilities can influence the results of an attack, and set the board up for future combos by strengthening allies, weakening enemies, and bending the normal rules of the game.<br/><br/>After the first battle, players upgrade their pantheon decks with more powerful cards, and expand the battlefield with additional modular boards. Victory goes to the player who controls the most cards at the end of two battles. Game variants allow players to form teams, change the rules of engagement, or play faster matches. Once players have mastered the basic strategies of the game, they can mix and match characters from different pantheons to build their own custom decks. As Immortal evolves, more pantheons will be added from the myths and legends of distinct cultures. These expansions will introduce new boards and cards, and new abilities and playing styles to the game.<br/><br/>",

Eventually leave the city to the Black Mountains, and find a place called &laquo;&nbsp;The Throne&nbsp;&raquo;. That is the lair where the Persians are hiding.

To move, you turn either one of two dials and check the window next to it. If it shows a color, move ahead to the next empty space of that color. If you dial a hole, you may open or close either of the two secret doors (representing the Phlogs) to block or unblock a path, and then dial again. If your path is blocked by a Phlog or secret door, you must move backwards to the color you dialed. Sometimes when you dial, you'll open up one or more mud holes. Players falling into a mud hole must move back two spaces. The first player to reach the top step of the tree house and enter the door (which you must dial to open) warns the village elders of the monster assault and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In every round one player builds a playing field from 24 blocks of different length. Each player gets a pawn and chooses a starting position. Then players take turns moving their pawns from block to any adjoining block, trying to capture opponents by going onto the same block with them, until only one player remains on the field.<br/><br/>Every five turns one player chooses a block to remove from the playing field, so the field is reconfigured throughout the game (because fewer and fewer blocks remain). This ensures that the game never ends in a draw and provides additional strategy opportunities. The game set includes an extra pawn and a move counter to help keep track of who makes every fifth move.<br/><br/>There are no random events in the game, the outcome is entirely based on players' skill.<br/><br/>The rules specify some restrictions for building the playing field to prevent the person who constructs it from gaining an unfair advantage.<br/><br/>",

There are also four wild cards, valued at thirteen, to bring the total number of cards in the deck to fifty-two.<br/><br/>All players place their pawns on the start space. Each player chooses a card secretly. All players reveal their chosen cards simultaneously. The player who played the highest valued card gets to advance one&rsquo;s own pawn the number of spaces equal to value of the winning card. The rules do not state what happens if two or more players tie. If two or more players play wild cards, there is no winner and the hand is replayed.<br/><br/>Certain spaces on the track assign a player who happens to land on them a personal trump suit. This trump stays in effect until the player moves on.<br/><br/>The hand is over when someone lands on the &ldquo;Off the Air&rdquo; space at the end of the track. The value of the cards remaining in the hand of the players is totaled and added to the score of the player who ended the round. All players receive the value of the cards in tricks each has taken. The first player to score five hundred points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The following are the four games that can be played and a brief summaryof each:<br/><br/>1.)The Transformers Truth Game:  The object is to get rid of all your card by placing two, three or four cards on the table and declaring that they are all the same numbered card.  If any opponent thinks you are bluffing then  he declares this.  The player than shows the cards.  If the player lied than he takes all the cards.  However, if he was telling the truth then the opponent takes all the cards.<br/><br/>2.)Robot Battle: This game is played like the game &quot;War&quot; where you want to be the one with all the cards at the end.<br/><br/>3.)The Transformers Brainpower: This is a matching game where all cards are placed face down on the table and then two cards are flipped.  If they are the same, then the player takes the pair and goes again.  However, if the cards are different then the players turn is over. The player with the greatest number of pairs wins.<br/><br/>4.)The Transformers Shout: In this game, each player flips over cards one at a time.  When a card is duplicated, the first person to spot this and yell &quot;transformers&quot; gets all the cards on then table.  This continues until one player has no cards.  At that time, the player with the most cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It takes players on a virtual Pubcrawl through historic Oxford, scoring points by sampling drinks in some of the city&rsquo;s most iconic pubs.  All this without leaving home or having a drink - unless they&rsquo;d like to, of course! The game also includes quirky and interesting Pub Trivia about each pub.<br/><br/>There are three types of cards in the game: Pub Cards, Drink Cards, and Action Cards.<br/><br/>Pub Cards showcase a selection of Oxford&rsquo;s finest pubs.  They are colour-coded by region on the Pubcrawler Oxford Map, and range in value from 20 to 100 points.<br/><br/>Drink Cards comprise Beer, Wine, and Cocktail cards.  They are also colour-coded to match the regions where they are served as Local Drinks.  Generally you can only play colour-matching Local Drinks on pubs of each region.  However, there are also multi-coloured Guest Drinks which you can play on pubs of any region.<br/><br/>Action Cards add extra fun to the Pubcrawl but can be unpredictable!  There are three types of Action Cards:  Bonus, Bother, and Between cards.  Bonus cards help you score extra points, Bother cards cause problems for other players, and Between cards take effect between players.<br/><br/>Turn by turn each player builds up their own virtual Pubcrawl by playing Pub Cards and Drink Cards, while trying to slow down other players&rsquo; progress. Through the Action Cards you can also earn bonuses through events like Happy Hours and Quiz Nights - but watch out for dangers like Punting Mishaps or Dodgy Kebabs which could end your night on a bad note!<br/><br/>Players can bank their points by Calling the Crawl after visiting three pubs, or double their score by visiting at least four pubs.  The player with the most points at the end of the final Pubcrawl wins.<br/><br/>",

Along the side of each piece is a number from zero to five, expressed with a blank or a number of dots.  (Later games like Tri-Ominos would place the numbers on the corners of the pieces.)   Also, in the center of each piece is a digit representing the sum of all the piece's sides.  The smallest number of unique combinations of pieces results in a fifty-six piece set, plus a special fifty-seventh piece marked with a star and called &ldquo;the boss.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game's inventor, Franklin H. Richards, included in his patent application several games to be played, involving matching the sides of the pieces or matching by the central (total) digit, and trying to outscore the opponent to win.  The boss piece may or may not be used in these games as a kind of joker, matching up to any number.  Also included with the patent is a description of a smaller set of triangular dominoes, with only the numbers zero through four, resulting in a total of 35 pieces, including the boss.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Love Hotel is a party game with teenagers, mainly girls, being the target audience. In the game Love Hotel you choose a (fictive) partner. Your goal is to get to the love suite before any of the other couples for some private time. You are only allowed to enter the love suite after you've collected four types of cushions for your bed. Let the race begin!<br/><br/>You and your opponents move around the board, answering questions and acting out tasks for each of the four categories. Doing so correctly will earn you a cushion of the corresponding color. Helping your opponent with a task will earn you a heart. Hearts can be used to buy cushions or to mend broken hearts. If you land on a broken heart tile and don't mend it (by choice or because you don't have any heart tokens) you risk losing one of your cushions. The first person to collect all four cushions and make it to the love suite wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Will you become the victor and claim your spoils or be lost and forgotten in the ever changing labyrinth of The Maze?<br/><br/>The Maze is a fun, fast paced game where you create a new maze each time you play. Once The Maze is created you and up to 3 other friends try to escape The Maze, but there can be only one victor. Everyone takes their turns together using a fun dice mechanic, so no one is waiting for their turn to come around again. Your roles on the dice determine how The Maze changes each turn.<br/><br/>Each game of The Maze uses a little bit of luck and a little bit of strategy. You can create a large maze using all of The Maze cards or just a few to create a smaller maze. The possibilities are endless. For even more unique maze creations consider purchasing The Maze: Teleportals, an expansion to The Maze, which adds the ability to play with up to six players and incorporates a new teleporting mechanic to the game, which allows you to make islands in The Maze as well for even more maze possibilities.<br/><br/>The Maze Contents:<br/>48 Maze Cards<br/>4 Player Pawns<br/>4 Six Sided Dice<br/>1 Set of Rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ZORP is a shoot-em-up strategy game that combines fast-paced action with chess-like strategic maneuvering and decision-making. It's easy to learn and has both recommended and randomized board arrangements.<br/><br/>One player is a zombie master who controls a steadily growing horde of zombies. Every other player is a human who has been infected by the zombie virus. Humans have nine turns to get to a cure. Along the way they will gather weapons and events to help them survive.<br/><br/>In a two/three player game, there is only one cure on the board and in a four player game there are two. This means that in a three/four person game, one human is always guaranteed to not get a cure. Humans will want to work together, at least somewhat in order to overcome the odds, but in the end, one person cannot be rescued, so humans may turn against each other to slow each other down.<br/><br/>Each human begins with one random weapon and their turns consist of two movement phases and an attack phase, which they can use in any order. (Move/Move/Attack, Attack/Move/Move, Move/Attack/Move) A movement is one tile in a non-diagonal direction and an attack lets you use all of the ammo at your disposal during the attack phase. Each weapon has different properties and the ammo is reloaded each turn.<br/><br/>When a human lands on a weapon tile, they add it to their inventory and are able to duel wield weapons. If they land on an event, they trigger it immediately. Some events persist throughout the game (like finding fast shoes, etc.) some are one time use (like finding a live grenade, etc.).<br/><br/>The Zombie Master's turn begins by moving all of the zombies on the board. Different zombie types have different movement abilities. After moving existing zombies, he/she spawns new zombies to add to the board. Certain turns will also trigger a zombie event after the new zombies have been placed on the board. Zombie events are generally good for the Zombie Master, but expert humans can find ways to exploit certain zombie events.<br/><br/>The players take turns until either all the cures have been acquired, or time runs out and none of the turns have been acquired or if the zombie master can zombify all the humans in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ranter-Go-Round (also known as Chase the Ace, Cuckoo, Bohemian Poker, Screw Your Neighbor, Stick or Swap, Bring the King, or Chicago Shuffle) is a card game with bluffing elements.<br/><br/>Any number of players, 52 cards. The object is to not have the lowest card at the table. The ranking of cards from highest to lowest is: K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 A, or alternately A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. Suit is irrelevant.<br/><br/>Each player has an equal number of counters placed in front of them - usually from 2 to 4 - to mark his or her &quot;lives&quot;. (Alternatively, a dollar bill or other note may be used, and players use the corners to mark their lives, folding a corner in when a life is lost.) Cards are dealt, one card to each, face down. Starting to the left of the dealer - each in turn examines their card. If they are satisfied with their card they may keep it, usually simply by announcing, &quot;I'm good.&quot; or similar. However, if they are unsatisfied they may pass it to the player on their left while announcing that they are &quot;not good&quot;, receiving that player's card back in return. The player to the left is obliged to exchange for the unwanted card unless they currently hold a King at which time they can refuse the card by showing their King. That transaction completed, privilege now passes to the player to the left who may or may not have a new card to decide on. (Players who have shown a King in defense are considered to have completed their play.) Play continues to the left as such. Once we reach the dealer the dealer has the same decision as any other player except that they exchange with the top card on the remaining deck instead of another player.<br/><br/>All exchanges completed, the players' cards are then all turned face up, and the lowest at the table loses a counter/life - which they place into the central pot. Ties lose a life each. Once a player loses all their lives they are out of the game, and only remaining players are dealt in for the next hand. Each hand the dealer rotates to the next player to the left.<br/><br/>Play continues as such until the only player with live(s) remaining takes the entire central pot.<br/><br/>Of special note, if it gets down to just two players and they each have one counter and they tie, they both lose and place their existing counter into the pot and all players re-ante and start the round over again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the world of Elementa Arcanum.  Hundreds of years in the future, scientific advances have given humans control over the power behind the elemental forces of nature: Fire, Water, Wind and Earth.  Through genetic engineering, the richest families of the galaxy have evolved a race of superhuman wizards.  The strongest representatives of each generation participate in a galactic tournament once a year called the Elementa Arcanum -- a spectacle so mesmerizing it surpassed the Olympics and rendered it obsolete.  As the years pass, the most talented of each generation slowly begin to emerge until a victor is declared.  The winner is named the Elementa Prima and dons the Black Hole Robes, forever etched into history.  Will you wield Ultima and master the 4 Elements?<br/><br/>Elementa Arcanum is a deck-building card game for 1-6+ players.  Players alternate between Combat Turns, where they vie for Stars (Victory Points) and Research Turns where players can improve and optimize their decks.  The first player to 5 Stars wins the game.  The rules are relatively simple and can be taught to newcomers while the game is underway through the &quot;Teaching Game&quot; system.  The game has a very small form-factor and is highly portable.  A common shop containing new cards for players to acquire uses a tiered system and uses rules to prevent shop stagnation.<br/><br/>",

Booster sets are also available.<br/><br/>Each player selects a character card secretly before the beginning of the game, which will affect which action pieces that the player will be most effective with, determines the minimum and maximum number of action pieces that the player must play with, and describes any special abilities of the character. Next, each player chooses which action pieces they will play with from their collection, subject to the limits of the character card. Finally, each player contributes an agreed-upon number of hexes (rooms) to the game in their own stack.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of drawing/discarding action pieces,  playing any number of free action pieces, taking one action (such as moving, exploring by adding a new hex to the board and resolving the occurrence on the hex, playing an action piece, attacking another player/creature, or exiting the crypt).<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first player to find your key in the action piece deck, find and place your exit tile, and successfully exit the crypt complex.<br/><br/>",

The basic rules, though, stay the same in every game, e.g. for flight maneuvers or movement. <br/>In the starting scenarios, they have to deal with navigation and movement, whereas the advanced setting allows for more variation, like different planets, refueling, evasion, freight, etc. The different game phases are navagation, movement, and supply.<br/>Then there are expert scenarios, which add mines and rockets to the battles.

Play begins with each player (or team) tasting the 3 wines and taking notes about the wine's color, smell, and taste as well as noting the wine's name, vintage, and region of origins.<br/><br/>Each turn, players draw a trivia card which asks a question about wine.  If the player answers correctly, they advance 1 space.  Each player also has 3 bonus/challenge cards which can be played to either double their movement (a bonus) or force another player to answer the question (a challenge).  If a player correctly answers the bonus they move ahead 2 spaces.  If a player is challenged and answers incorrectly, the challenger moves 2 spaces.  however, if they answer correctly, the challenged player moves 2 spaces<br/><br/>Spaced around the board are 4 Blind Taste Test squares.  Whenever a player lands on one of these, another player secretly pours a glass of any one of the 3 wines.  The player who landed on the taste test now must name the selected wine, its vintage, and the region or country it came from.  For each correct answer they move forward 1 space.<br/><br/>On the final test you must name the wine selected and poured for you.  If you are correct, you win the game.<br/><br/>Here is the description from the back of the box:<br/><br/>Winerd (as in wine nerd) is the wine tasting game that crushes grape fears by presenting amusing wine facts at every turn.  With Winerd the steps of wine tasting will be easy to learn, yet telling the difference between your wines might be more challenging than you would think.  You'll be amazed at what your taste buds can teach you(tm)!  The first player or team to taste their way to the Winerd  Circle wins the game and becomes a Winerd.  With different friends and different wines it's a whole new game every time!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Egyptian Flood, a card game for 2-6 players featuring city building and destroying.<br/><br/>Designed and ideas by: Benjamin Sperling (Gurken Games), James Casey, Byron Grimes, Erik Lechak, Craig Somerton, August Larson, Jay LaFountain.<br/><br/>Instructions:<br/>You need these items to play:<br/>10 Farm cards, 10 Floods, 7 Settlements, 6 Kingdoms, 5 Pyramids, 6 Soldiers, 7 Riches, 4 Anubises, 4 Sandstorms, 5 Harvests.<br/>Some kind of coins for gold, different color tokens for each player, and another type of token to represent damage to buildings (solider damage and flood damage).<br/><br/>The deck of cards should be shuffled and each player is dealt four cards from the central deck.  Choose one player to go first and have each player chooses his or her color.  All players take 3 gold from the bank.<br/><br/>The first player draws one card and plays a card from their hand.  That player does what the card says, then the turn ends and the next player begins their turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when no one is able to play any further cards.<br/><br/>Winning: <br/>Each player earns 1 victory point for each gold they have plus 2 victory points for each pyramid they control.  The highest total wins the game.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy this game.  It was a collaborative effort of the above designers and idea people.<br/><br/>",

You supply the pizza, toothpicks (about 10 per player for eating conquered armies) and six sided die (one per player).<br/><br/>Since you eat your opponent's conquered armies, and it is very unlikely that you will eat your own armies, it is suggested you order an ingredient that others hate.  This will ensure that others will think twice about attacking you.<br/><br/>Your armies (ingredients) move from land (slice) to land waging war against the opponent's armies.  Last man standing wins.<br/><br/>The game is very simple but does come with optional rules to add difficulty, realism, and flavour (sorry).<br/><br/>Also includes rules for Grubb Chess, using a chess board and various hot peppers; Galactic Gluttons, using pizza, dice, paper, plates, and a ruler (Apparently you said between the lands); and Gulf War, with rules sadly omitted because the designers decided that the average gamer could not afford to fill a bathtub with chili-con-carne.<br/><br/>",

The game is packaged in a wedge (&quot;piece-of-pie&quot;) shaped box.<br/><br/>The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.<br/><br/>Featuring 600 questions from the popular Disney/Pixar movies, including:<br/><br/>    Finding Nemo<br/>    Ratatouille<br/>    Monsters, Inc.<br/>    Toy Story 1 &amp; 2<br/>    The Incredibles<br/>    Bugs Life<br/>    Cars<br/><br/><br/>Made in China, released in Australia.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can you get all your balloons safely into the stratosphere?  But watch out for falling hailstones!<br/><br/>Each player has 4 balloons and tries to move all of them from the bottom to the top row of the Sky Grid.  The first player to do so wins the game.  If a balloon hits a hailstone then the balloon is burst and returns to the bottom row.  Players may also burst other players balloons by squashing it between their own balloons and/or a hailstone.  Balloons can jump diagonally over balloons of the same colour (counts as one move) all the way up the Sky Grid thus being an efficient way of using the action-points allocated each turn.<br/><br/>To begin a game, the 10 hailstones are lined up in the stratosphere (one in each square).  Each player places their pawn on the corresponding 'Big Balloon' space on the Flight Path on the outside of the board.  Then players place their balloons on any squares on the bottom of the Sky Grid (each player places one balloon in turn until all balloons are placed).  Several balloons can occupy the same square for the first 3 rows (green area).  Beyond row 3 (in the blue area) - only one balloon to a square.<br/><br/>On a player's turn they roll a 10-sided dice and move their pawn around the Flight Path.  When the pawn lands on or passes certain squares it gives that player a number of action-points (1-4) in which to move their balloons in an upwards direction (vertical or diagonal).  The action-points may be split among the player's balloons as they see fit.  When a player's pawn lands on a 'Storm Clouds' square on the Flight Path the player must move any hailstone of their choice down one square.  If a player's pawn lands on a 'Wind Clouds' square the player must move any one of their balloons one square sideways (if that is impossible - their lowest balloon is deemed burst, and falls back to the ground.)<br/><br/>Players can choose to stop their pawn on the Storm/Wind Clouds squares even if the number thrown on the dice could take the pawn past.<br/><br/>When a player's pawn passes or lands on a Kite/Cloud square in the corner of the Flight Path the player also throws the dice to determine which of the 10 hailstones moves down one square.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has moved all their balloons to the top of the Sky Grid or when a hailstone hits the ground (in which case each balloon carries a score for the height it has reached, the highest total score then wins the game).  For a quicker game, players can agree that the first balloon to reach the stratosphere ends the game - then the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

In the middle of this board the dragon, which has to be defeated, can be found. The players start on different positions on the board and try to collect fire and water cards as well as an outfit. When a player thinks he has enough resources to fight the dragon, he may go to the middle of the board and start a battle. You have to hit the dragon three times before it is defeated. In between the hits you may return to the board to collect more cards or to expand your outfit.<br/><br/>Joris en de Draak is a board game based on a roller coaster of the same name which can be found in the Efteling. Therefore the game will only be sold in the Efteling as a souvenir. You can also buy the game at the webshop of the Efteling.

The goal of all this mess is to follow the rules and get rid of the cards in hand, but keep in mind that failing the challenge or rule makes you to pick more cards in your hand and distances you from the victory.

Judging by the number of boards and playing pieces found in Roman sites, Ludus Latrunculorum appears to have been an extremely popular game, played extensively throughout the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>In Ludus Romanus we aim to capture the spirit of an ancient Roman pastime whilst providing a contemporary game that is challenging and fun to play.<br/><br/>",

When relaxing, you are at risk of being denounced to superiors by your fellow players. What is more &ndash; each time a denouncing person proves right, his or her career thrives.

The players hurry to fill the basket the donkey is carrying with their fruits before the Dashing Donkey crosses the bridge. By playing cards that feature the players fruits the players are allowed to put their fruits in the basket. At the same time the bridge is built. The cards will also bring forth surprises that will slow you down or help you load the donkey. When the Dashing Donkey has crossed the bridge the game ends and the player who loaded the most fruits wins.

When you roll to move, you can either move or move the rail lengths to make your color line as long as possible (or to break up an opponents' line!) and move, depending on the die roll. First to the end of the line wins.<br/>     Game components are interesting and colorful. Like all the best childrens games, it teaching simplified elements of strategy and planning.

Players take time rolling the die, then placing one of their pieces on the ring indicated by the die roll. The uppermost two rings can be twisted. One die result is to twist these rings--without toppling the board and the pieces.

But hunters tricked him and now he's locked in a chicken coop. Now you are either Dolfje Weerwolfje, Noura, Timmie or Dad and you're trying to save Grandpa Werewolf as quickly as you can. But of course, you have to transforn into a werewolf first! Be the first to release Grandpa Werewolf from his cell to win the game.<br/><br/>This is a game based on the popular books by Paul van Loon, about a little boy who's actually a werewolf. It's a simple 'roll and move', where cards replace the dice. The board is divided into day, twilight and night. During the day, players have to become werewolves. During the night, they have to find the items necessary to save Grandpa Werewolf. The 'twilight' part of the board serves as a second chance, where players can try to get the things they miss to finish either day or night.<br/><br/>",

You have three years to show that you can make your share profitable. You may plant corn and grain, raise animals, and gather berries and herbs from the countryside. You may sell goods at each of the three Markets, and enter the income in your ledger. The sibling who has the most money in their ledger after the third year wins the contest, and will receive the remainder of the family farm. [Source: rules]<br/><br/>In The Cottonwood Contest, players develop their farms by plowing fields, planting corn and grain, building pastures, raising animals, weaving baskets, and gathering herbs and berries. Double-ended farm cards depict the choices for what the farmers may do with their day.<br/><br/>There are three scoring phases, triggered by drawing a market card. Prices for each item fluctuate, and players must determine the best time to sell their items. Corn and grain may be sold, or used to raise sheep and cows. Players may sell the wool from their sheep and the milk from their cows, or the sheep and cows themselves. Players may sell berries and herbs, or make the berries into jam and dry the herbs to sell at a later market.<br/><br/>The player who has the most money in their ledger after the third market is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The forces of the two Soviet Fronts met each other near Zvenigorodka three days later. The Pocket that Soviets thus created, centered on the airfield at Korsun, encircled most of the units of two German Corps and was the largest encirclement the Soviets had achieved since the Battle of Stalingrad in November 1942.<br/><br/>Escape Hell&rsquo;s Gate covers the final attempt of the German 3rd Panzer Corps formations to reach those German units that were encircled within the Korsun Pocket between 10th and the 17th February 1944. Hell&rsquo;s Gate is a two-player game using the standard Fire and Movement rules and a set of exclusive rules that model the actual campaign. The game presents some unique challenges to both the German and Soviet player as the German relief forces attempt to break thru to the pocket, while the German forces within the pocket struggle to survive the Soviet onslaught. The Soviet player will be faced with moving his forces to block the relief attempt while making a final attempt to reduce the pocket. Both players will be fighting two battles and how well each player allocates his forces will determine the victor.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>        Game Turn: ? days<br/>        Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 km<br/>        Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>        One 34 x 22&quot; full color map<br/>        One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>        One rulebook (including Fire &amp; Movement Standard &amp; Korsun exclusive rules)<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: ?

In this free demo version, there are only 10 cards. Each of them presents 12 different symbols concerning the contemporary history of Poland. If you take a closer look at any two cards, you'll find out that they contain only one common character. The aim of a player is to notice the character on two other cards on the table and to tell its name as fast as possible. If the player succeeds to do that, he/she passes his/her card to another player. If he/she does not know the name of the character, he/she turns the card, reads the definition of the symbol, puts a new card on the table, and the game goes on. The winner is the person who first gets rid of all the cards in hand.<br/><br/>",

But your patriarch is in failing health, and his sons must prove who is the most worthy of Hokkaido! Hokkaido is the second game in Blue Panther's &quot;Trailblazer Series&quot;, following Nepal. Featuring quick gameplay, key decisions every turn, and just a little bit of conflict. Hokkaido is a strategy game with a Euro feel for 2-4 players that plays in an hour or less. Players take the role of a clan leader in feudal Japan, trailblazing trade routes and holding on to them in an effort to convince the Shogun that they are worthy to rule the isle of Hokkaido. Three actions per turn, seven actions to choose from including move, grow, sea move, claim public trade route, draw a card, discard, reveal private trade route. An important decision or two every turn, and never enough actions to get it all done. Conflict can be used, but sparingly, when a province is overpopulated. A simple and robust combat mechanic rewards players who plan ahead. Victory is won through control of key trade routes and area control. Population limits scale with the number of players to ensure a tight board for any number of players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Investor (sk) is a Slovak remake of games of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; mainstream line. It was created in Slovakia and most of its rules draw from its fathers.<br/><br/>It is for 2-6 players, though from 4 up the game is the most enjoyable. Depending on the strategies, alliances and also luck the game can last from an hour to easily more than 2.<br/><br/>Distinctions can be made with types of property you buy or its distribution over the playing field, but the game pretty much resembles its predecessors.<br/><br/>The main aim of players in this game is to roll for their movement around the board, buy properties which can bring them money afterwards (when someone else steps on them). Collecting sets of properties can bring even more money as the player can then buy subsidiaries and concerns, which mean higher payments from other players.<br/><br/>There are also the usual Jail, Risk and Cash areas over the board. Jail means you skip your turn(s), Risk can give, but also take money from you and Cash usually means some Win for you.<br/><br/>Player elimination is part of the game - when you run bankrupt because you cannot pay your debts and/or tolls, you are out.<br/><br/>",

Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>So, players play 2 vs.2. Each team gets a figure representing it on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take a card and not show it to other team member. After that a sand clock (also included) is set. The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsmen wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team looses a turn.<br/><br/>In this Genius Alias, you have word you have never heard. The are long, they are hard. Are you smart enough to play this game???<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another light game from Asko K&uuml;nnap &amp; Priit Isok. The title roughly translates as: &quot;The winner is the one who has the most stuff when he/she dies.&quot; With a subtitle &quot;Another absolutely useless item: a boardgame about owning!&quot; In the game players madly run in a circle - like rats in a wheel - collecting useless luxurious items until the grim reaper stops the race.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player has five items (cards). Items come in 6 colors with value from 1-5. A player's turn is a three-step affair:<br/>1) Throw a die and move your pawn forward (clockwise in a circle). When you throw 1, the reaper also moves forward.<br/>2) Do the action indicated by the space where your pawn landed. Most of the spaces are malls where you collect additional items but some spaces, like robber and recycling, take cards away. <br/>3) Gift an item to another player. You can gift only an item that matches the color of an item that an opponent already has and is of higher value.<br/><br/>The game ends when the reaper makes a full circle of eight steps. All players total the value of their cards and the player with the smallest total wins the game. That is, contrary to what the title claims, the winner is the player who has the least stuff in the end.<br/><br/>The emphasis of the game is obviously on fun. It is a family/party game which mocks the madness that takes hold of the &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; world just before any big gift-giving holiday. The items are titled such as &quot;all types of USB cables&quot; and &quot;precious jewels for pets&quot;. The game was published just before Christmas and the board design closely resembles the logo of one of the leading chain of malls in Estonia. Unfortunately the game is available only in Estonian. Knowledge of the language is not essential but you will miss the fun titles of the cards.<br/><br/>",

However, instead of the choices being &quot;keep rolling&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;, one must choose whether to roll along a column, row, or across the entire board in order to maximize their chances of winning.<br/><br/>Gameplay involves tossing two dice and marking the space on the board corresponding to the row and column rolled.  The player then decides whether to roll one or both dice again in order to place more markers on the board.  The point value of a row or column is equal to the number of markers on it, squared.  If a player rolls a space that has already been marked, their turn ends and their score is tallied.  The winner of the game is the player with the most points after a set number of rounds.<br/><br/>",

One player flicks a card on the table. Then it is the next one's turn. Both aim to cover their opponent's cards with their own. After all cards are flicked, points are given to the player whose card is topmost in a pile. Points are then gained depending on the white dots on the leaf cards. The player who is first to reach a previously agreed victory point target (for example 20) wins the game.

It may not give you the smell of freshly plowed ground or the self-satisfaction of a hard day&rsquo;s work, but it will wake you up to the fact that farming is much more than just plowing and planting.  You&rsquo;ll experience the responsibility of farm ownership and development, and with luck, reap the benefits of successful farm management.<br/><br/>RICH FARMER, POOR FARMER was invented by a 28-year old Alabama farmer, Donald McDonald, as a means of educating the public to the realities of farming.<br/><br/>The game was first introduced in October, 1978, at the Sunbelt Agricultural Exposition.  With the news coverage of tractorcades and the farmers dilemma over the past year, the game&rsquo;s popularity has steadily gained momentum.  It continues to receive widespread exposure in farm magazines, newspapers and television.  As a result, the game has been mailed all over the United States.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to survive financially &ndash; just as in real life.  In the game, an actual farmer has no advantage over a city slicker who thinks a &ldquo;bush hog&rdquo; is a type of pig.  Players can end up a Rich Farmer or a Poor Farmer, depending on how well they manage their money.<br/><br/>An entertaining and educational game about farming for 2 to 6 players.<br/><br/>",

The board game &quot;Conflict Cards&quot; has an age limit of 18+!<br/><br/>Cards of Ð¡onflict (2 Edition) are a very controversial, if not &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo; game. In it, participants will select the most successful answers to strange questions. Uncensored. Without political correctness. No brakes. &ldquo;Cards of Ð¡onflict&rdquo; raises a wide variety of topics, often going far beyond the generally accepted norms of decency and etiquette. But if your company prefers black humor, banter over everything, and undisguised sarcasm, then this game is just what you need. Here you can plunge into the world of toilet jokes about orgies, people of non-standard sexual orientation, racism, and of course, laugh heartily at other charms of modern civilization.<br/><br/>Table of Contents Cards Board Game Content:<br/>- 85 cards with questions<br/>- 420 cards with answers<br/>- rules of the game<br/><br/>The game begins with the fact that each player receives 10 white cards. In the first round, 1 player is selected - &quot;Card Bro&quot; of this round. &quot;Card bro&quot; takes 1 black card from the deck (black cards lie in one deck with the inscription down) and read out the text loudly. Each of the participants (except for &quot;Card bro&quot;) chooses one of his white cards that seems to him the most suitable.<br/><br/>White cards are transferred to Card Bro, which in turn reads each option separately. We recommend that you reread the black card completely before reading out a new white card. &quot;Card bro&quot; is chosen by the winner, in his opinion, the option. The player whose white card wins this round receives a black card as a &ldquo;ball.&quot;<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player draws a new white card from the deck, so that at the beginning of the next round everyone has 10 white cards. White cards used in this round can be put down the white deck so that after a while they will return to them again. In each subsequent round, a new Card Bro is selected so that each player receives this role in turn. You yourself can choose the principle of changing &ldquo;bro&rdquo;: clockwise / counterclockwise, by height, age, leg size, or another sign that is understandable to all participants.<br/><br/>There are black cards in the deck, labeled &ldquo;take 2&rdquo;. In this case, each player must choose 2 white cards to form a winning combination. It is important to read the white cards in the correct order. Therefore, the card, the text of which you want to read first, you always need to put under the second card and so transmit &quot;bro.&quot;<br/><br/>If you wish, you can modify the rules, for example, play without a &ldquo;Card Bro&rdquo;. In this case, each player votes for the option that he liked and gets the most votes with the score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Congratulations! You've just completed your Evil Doctorate! Now you've moved back to the small eastern European town where you grew up to start your revenge and build your first Monster.<br/><br/>You have to appear to be an upstanding member of society, so you have to hire some assistants to do your dirty work. Going and getting body parts, for example. The problem is that as you're just starting out and can't pay them very much, so your assistants aren't very reliable.<br/><br/>Once you finally get them to bring a brain, a torso, a set of limbs, and some supplies back to your castle, you can pay off your assistants and assemble your Monster. Then you send the Monster to town to destroy the buildings that you have been using. If you can destroy enough of them, you will win the game. If there are too many Monsters and not enough buildings for that, however, the Monsters will fight to the death to determine who wins!<br/><br/>This is a 2 - 6 player game, for ages 12 and up, taking 30-90 minutes to play depending on the number of players. It's an action-based game, where each player chooses one action for each of their three characters each turn.<br/><br/>This is indeed a rebranding of &quot;Good Help the Card Game.&quot; We feel that the new title is more dynamic and better captures the feel of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beowulf: A Board Game is a dynamic tabletop strategy game for 3-6 players, adapted from one of the oldest and most celebrated works of European literature.<br/><br/>The game uses the Anglo-Saxon epic poem as a point of entry into a vast interpretation of the Viking Age. As the legend of Beowulf's life and death unfolds on the game's board, players will trade cards, scheme and raid one another to grow their own kingdom's influence and power. After the death of Beowulf at the fangs of a dragon, the game moves forward in time, as players scramble to preserve the brave legacies of their kingdoms in the face of a quickly changing religious landscape and the relentless tides of history.<br/><br/>The game uses two decks, the WYRD Deck and the DAED Deck. At the beginning of the game each player is dealt a handful of DAED cards - these represent powers, abilities and resources of your individual kingdom. On each turn, a player draws a card from the WYRD Deck, which is composed of monsters, events, hardships, and instances drawn from the source text and the greater Viking Age. The player must either face the consequences, or reap the benefits of these cards, and can use their DAED cards to repel or augment the effect of the WYRD Deck. In addition, players can attempt to raid one another for their DAED cards. Successfully defeating a Monster drawn from the WYRD Deck nets you a Trophy - in the form of some grisly piece of the felled creature - which acts as a counter for your Kingdom's greatness.<br/><br/>All the while, each draw of the WYRD Deck moves Beowulf further along his life path on the game board, with each stop dramatically affecting the stakes of the WYRD Deck. After Beowulf's death, the winner is determined by the player with the most Trophies amassed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the kids version of the famous The Farming Game.  This game has three levels of play for harvesting your crops:<br/><br/><br/>     The first level is for kids ages 3-5.  It consists of rolling a red die (values 1-3) and moving the number of spaces indicated by the die roll.  If you land on a type of produce, you get a matching card for it.  If they land on a school bus or playground, they get nothing.  The first player to reach the end stops the game.  All players count their cards and the one with the most wins.<br/>     The second level is for kids ages 5-7.  Again, you roll the red die to move, but instead of collecting produce cards when you land on a produce space, you roll a white die (values 1-6) and match it with a produce rate card to see how much money you sold that produce for.  You then get it in play money.  The first player to reach the end stops game play and all count their money.  The one with the most money wins.<br/>     The third level is for kids ages 7-9.  This combines the aspects of levels 1 and 2 and adds additional complexity.  When you land on a produce space, you get the matching produce card.  You can then roll the white die to sell the produce, or keep the card.  If you keep it, the next time you land on that produce space, you get another card.  You then have two of a kind.  If you want to sell them, roll the white die, consult the rate chart, and sell all of your cards of that produce.  The one who makes it to the end, stops the gameplay and the one who has the most money wins.  You can also trade cards with other players before the red move die is rolled.<br/><br/><br/>This game has a colorful board and easy-to-read rate charts and money.<br/>Even parents can find amusement with this game.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    The Farming Game<br/><br/><br/>",

Players must lay a path of  eras (cards) in chronological order, outwards from their edge of the board. The objective is to be first to  advance your playing piece onto the end era of your own path. Cards are drawn from a main pack which contains eras  cards . Play actions are determined by what symbol shows when the die is thrown. The three symbols are era ( reveal an era) , thunderbolt ( take a thunderbolt card) and eruption ( move or or erupt volcanoes on an opponents path). Thunderbolt cards are not laid but trigger various natural calamity and more benign events. Each era card is an aerial view associated with a particular evolutionary period. Each era card has various sites to be negotiated including rocks,waterholes, swamps, volcanoes, rising seas and ravines. Different sites have different levels of risk (hazardous areas). Certain thunderbolts can penalize players whose paths have cards that contain hazardous areas. Players interact by contesting some or each era card by a bidding using tokens.  A neat (new) rule limit player's from bidding excessively because tokens are lost by the winning bidder depending on the bid difference between his and the next highest bid.  A player who wins an era card may be include it in any path. He may for example, include a card with a risky site  in an opponent's path. Each player now has his own   cone (volcano) which  can be moved to  create an obstacle for an opponent's playing piece and can cause an eruption on an opponent path. An eruption   can be used to   force an opponents playing piece back .  The first player who survives his turn with his path complete ( 6 era cards ), holding at least one token  and with his  piece on his end ( sixth) era card  wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The captain is grumpy all the time and the ship needs constant management. So what do the crew do to keep up the spirits? Gamble with Round-o-Loot of course!<br/><br/>Round-o-Loot is a fast, risk based card game, where cards are played fast and plays disrupted by selective hand management. Players try to play the most points they can while gathering cards to get combos to disrupt other player&rsquo;s play. The deck consists of 61 cards: 5 different cards and the captain card. Most of the cards are point cards, and then there is the rum card. Cards are played one type at a time, and when possible, 3 or more cards can be played in conjunction with rum card to create combos to disrupt other player&rsquo;s game. After dealing their hand cards, players play one type at a time. With careful card drawing and hand management, players can also collect 3 or more of the same card type, and when played with the rum card, players get a combo. These combos affect other players and gives the player an edge.<br/><br/>The goal is to get the most points possible until someone draws the captain card. After someone draws the captain, the round ends immediately and points are calculated. The player with the most points win the round and gets a token card. Then cards are shuffled again and a new hand is dealt. When any player gets their 3rd token card, they win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;A scare-raising, dice-chucking, card-playing, back-stabbingly awesome, friend-killing good time.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Fright, the family-friendly, tabletop experience that you learn in 5 min, spend the rest of your short life mastering&hellip;. Death is a scary thing indeed.  The only board game with ghost-appeal.<br/><br/>Ghosts aren&rsquo;t real, right?  Time for some actual hands-on education on the subject.  Every neighborhood has one, you know, that old abandoned mansion down the lane that you dared each other to step inside and explore.  Well, now your little party gets to spend the entire night or better yet SURVIVE the night on the inside.  You see, this particular abode has a little something special for the newly initiated ghost-hunter.  The catch?  This one actually IS haunted, and by none other than old man Alabaster, RIP.  He&rsquo;s a playful spirit now, well, most of the time, but has been known to possesses your dice and toy with you like his own personal plaything.  Can you survive both your friends AND Alabaster, and walk out again the next morning?  Alive is much preferable to worm food.<br/><br/>So pick up those possessed dice, change them as you see fit, put on your Big Kid Pants, say Boo! with creative drama, pick on the living Bully, and pray to be Resurrected by your friendly neighborhood Ghost. You also argue with the living, make alliances as quickly as you break them, and finagle your way to not being six feet under. This is the hectic, fun-filled world of FRIGHT, where no one is ever completely out of the game, and Ghosts have a way of exacting revenge on those that made them.<br/><br/>Each player gets their own tombstone with 5 scare tokens and a dice. Each round consists of a dice phase and a scare phase. The dice determine who gets to scare, but cards can change the dice. When players are scared, they must remove a scare token and players &ldquo;die&rdquo; when all of their tokens have been removed. The last player alive wins.<br/><br/>Even when players die, they can still play cards to affect the outcome of the dice round.<br/><br/>",

They use a trick indicator card to declare the number of tricks they expect to take. If they're right, they get a bonus. It's also up to the players to decide whether they will openly announce the tricks they expect to take or whether they keep it secret. But beware! A face-up trick indicator card increases the possibility that the other players will be able to influence the outcome. With increased risk it's true that you get: &quot;Alles oder Nichts (Double or Nothing)&quot;.<br/><br/>A game last for seven rounds. Each player receives:<br/>in the 1st round - 6 cards<br/>in the 2nd round - 5 cards<br/>in the 3rd round - 4 cards<br/>in the 4th round - 3 cards<br/>in the 5th round - 4 cards<br/>in the 6th round - 5 cards<br/>in the 7th round - 6 cards<br/><br/>After the cards are dealt, the dealer turns over the top card of the remaining cards. The color of this card is the trump color. After distributing the cards, players take the playing cards into their hand. Each player now judges for himself how many tricks he thinks he can take. Players select the appropriate card from their trick indicator cards and place it face-down in front of themselves<br/><br/>Once all players have made their decision, the dealer, starting with the player to his left, asks each player if he wants to openly announce the number of tricks he plans to take (by turning over his trick indicator card) or if he wishes to keep it secret. Once each player has indicated his decision, the dealer asks the other players in clockwise order until all players, including the dealer have indicated their decision. Turning over the trick indicator card brings a higher risk but also potentially more points.<br/><br/>Rules of play:<br/><br/>Players must follow suit (play the same color as the card that was lead) if it is possible for them to do so.<br/><br/>If a player cannot follow suit, he has two possibilities:<br/>1. Play trump - play a card of the trump color<br/>2. Throw off - play a card that is neither the trump color nor the color that was lead. You can never win a trick when you throw off.<br/><br/>If no trump was played, the player who played the highest card of the suit that was lead wins the trick.<br/>If trump was played, the player who played the highest trump card wins the trick.<br/><br/>If the trump color was lead, it must also be followed. If a player does not have any cards in the trump color, he must throw off a card with another color.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Secret trick indicator cards:<br/>Players whose trick indicator cards were face-down get one point for each trick that they took. Players who took exactly as many tricks as noted on their trick indicator card get a 3 point bonus.<br/><br/>Openly declared trick indicator cards:<br/>Players whose trick indicator cards were turned face-up only get points get if they take exactly as many tricks as they predicted. If they fulfill this condition, their score is equal to the number of tricks they took multiplied by 2 plus the 3 point bonus.<br/><br/>Goal of the game<br/>The goal of the game is to have the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

What makes this version particularly special is that the tokens, houses, and hotels are all foil-wrapped chocolate candies.<br/><br/>To start, each player is given $1,000 and all properties are dealt out much like a standard Short Game (although it is of course possible to play a standard game). There is only one die to roll, so you cannot get in or out of Jail with doubles; instead, rolling a 6 or paying $100 gets you out. Only two houses are needed before a hotel can be built, and the interest rate is fixed at $40.<br/><br/>The winner of the game gets not only the satisfaction of having won over his or her opponents, but also has the privilege of consuming all the chocolate.<br/><br/>Unlike the later Monopoly: Chocolate, this version is perfectly playable post-chocolate consumption through borrowing the same tokens, houses, and hotels from another Monopoly game.<br/><br/>",

This two pieces are rotated  each time a 6 is obtained on the spinner or a player falls in a square that orders it. Each time the volcanos are rotated, the crater squares changes its position. If a player falls on one of them, they must move back as much squares as it reads in the crater. Therefore, the player rotating the volcano can do it strategically in order to gain advantage over his competitors, making them fall in the craters. Once the volcanos are left behind, the first to reach the drawbridge of Grayskull wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In the middle of the board is a circle of 12 fields, where five different colored crocodiles are placed (belonging to no-one). There is also a deck of cards showing a number in the color of a crocodile. In their turn, a player reveals a card from this deck and sees if they can pull the corresponding crocodile the number of fields indicated by the card in clockwise order. This is possible, if the landing field is empty. After success, the player can decide to reveal another card and do the same. They can also decide to stop and move their pawn one field for every crocodile card which was revealed. But if it is not possible to move the crocodile, the player has to stop and give all cards already revealed to the next player. This player must reveal at least one card (if successful, they can move their pawn for all cards!). If a player in last place moves their pawn, they can double the value; a player in first place must move back, if they are not successful.<br/><br/>Some special action cards can also be used; they allow a player to stop only after an even number of cards revealed or force them to move back, etc.<br/><br/>The game is in German, but all components except the rules are language independent.<br/><br/>",

In fact, it is really just a direct steal from TACTICAL GAME No. 3 of the TSG. What I hope it will do is provide that real bridge between board and miniatures, to get each side of the fence partly on the other. Miniature wargamers are going to find having combat factors and a CRT a bit strange, while board wargamers are going to find all those tank models and painted figures weird too. In fact, the lack of hexagons alone is startling enough.<br/><br/>The rules are neither complex nor comprehensive, if anything they were designed to be clear. This game is a 'quickie', fast to set up, almost as fast to play. For those tactical historians with the &quot;what if--&quot;, it is a tool for endless answers. By now you should have enough organizational information to be able to set up various German and Russian formations using platoons and companies as building blocks. Pick your terrain and objectives, and have at it. If your imagination fails you, some reading into the real campaign and some of the battles should produce enough food for thought. For the fun-minded, I personally have a set of &quot;orders&quot; cards each containing an order of battle and a mission for one side. I set up a Russian and German deck before each battle, and thus players remain in the dark about enemy forces and objectives<br/><br/>For those who find Tac 3/20mm just a nice take-off point for 1944 vintage land miniatures, note that S&amp;T does indeed have considerably more detailed and simulation-oriented rules around. I know because I have designed and tested one set myself! Naturally, all it takes is a lot of little notices from you to produce them in an upcoming issue.<br/><br/>",

Players tempt powerful Cohorts to fight for their cause.  The fleeting Temptresses grant the players additional special abilities.  Tempt is a mix of strategy, tactics, and clever card play.  The player controlling the largest portion of the kingdom after the conflict ends, wins the game.<br/><br/>Tempt takes place over several rounds of play.  Each round, each player will receive 3 turns.  A round always begins with players secretly selecting 2 Temptress cards to aid them for the round.  The 3 facedown Cohort decks in the middle of the play area represent 3 areas of the kingdom, and each player controls a Column on his side of each area where he can Tempt powerful Cohorts, in attempts to gain and hold control of that area.  The player with the strongest Column has Primacy in that area and is awarded extra points and actions.  Cohorts may also be tempted as Chanters, granting the player additional abilities.<br/><br/>Due to the artwork on some of the cards, Tempt is not recommended for gamers under the age of 13.<br/><br/>",

As players attempt to collect all of the members of as many families as possible, the game relies heavily on both observation and memory (remembering who did or did not appear to have certain cards).<br/><br/>Historically, 7 Families makes use of a variety of families, including actual family names, animals, fictional characters, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guess What I Am! - The Hilarious New Twist on a Classic Guessing Game<br/><br/>There are 4 different games suggested to use with these components.<br/><br/>What Am I?<br/>Everyone receives one of 30 mystery character cards with a hole for them to place their face in. The cards show cartoon outlines of animals and community members (a pig, a lobster, an astronaut, a cowboy, etc). Your face replaces theirs, which looks really silly, and everyone can see what you are except you. Each player rolls a die and asks questions about their card to deduce what it depicts. The die tells them whether they can Ask, Guess, Lose a Turn, Reverse Direction, etc. Questions must be Yes or No: for example, &quot;Do I have a lot of fur?&quot; &quot;Do I wear boots?&quot; &quot;Do people drink my milk?&quot; A tally sheet is used to keep track of which characters aren't on your card, based on the answers given by the other players. The first person to correctly guess what their card depicts is the winner of the round.<br/><br/>Team Challenge<br/>Each team gives clues to a player on their team who is wearing the card. They are allowed only five clues (three for advanced play) before the player must guess who they are. The first team to guess correctly wins a chip; first team to five chips wins.<br/><br/>Charades<br/>Players select a card that only they can see. They then act out the card and each player in turn gets one guess. The player who guesses right gets two chips and the actor gets one.  Then another player chooses a card and is the actor. First person to collect ten chips wins.<br/><br/>Lightning Round<br/>One team gets all the animal cards, the other team gets all the people cards. Players use one card at a time and guessers are only allowed one clue from their teammates. The team who guesses the most cards wins the round; if you guess the entire pile you get 3 bonus points. Card piles are shuffled and swapped. At the end of that round whichever team has the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game in HABA's mini-spiel key chain series comes with two sheep (one black, one white), four green four-leaf clovers and a die showing a four-leaf clover on three sides and a wolf's head on the other three sides. Like other games in the series, the pieces are wooden and terribly cute, especially the tiny die.<br/><br/>To start, the two sheep are placed at equal distances from the box they came in. Varying this distance will determine how long the game is. During a player's turn, he can create a path to the box using up to four clover leaves (slight ambiguity in the rules here: initially the rules say 3 then say 4). However, before he can place each leaf, he must roll the die. Rolling a clover leaf means the player can continue to add clover leaves, or the player can stop and move his sheep ahead of the last clover leaf placed (i.e. nearer to the box). If instead a wolf's head is cast, the player's sheep is so frightened that it is unable to move that turn. The player whose sheep reaches the box first is crowned King of the Sheep and wins the heart of the woman shepherd, Edda.<br/><br/>&lt;!-- Entry audited by (nsolitander) (13-08-2009) --!&gt;<br/><br/><br/>",

Can you sniff out outrageous lies and downright bullshit? You'll learn some toe-curling and bewildering facts along the way - but to win this game it't not what you know, it's the way that you tell it.<br/><br/>You can choose to speak the truth (often stranger than fiction) or dish out some deadpan deceit. Select from the scandalous, but oddly believable 'facts' on the card, or wing it with a Double Bluff that could pile on your points. Do you have what it takes to fool your friends? Do they?<br/><br/>A strictly adult party game, not for the easily embarrassed, to make you laugh out loud within the context of a genuinely competitive game.

Along the way pigs will stop on spaces which earn them gold coins for their banks, spaces which allow them to put black coins worth -1 gold in their opponents banks, and spaces which allow them to shake their opponents' banks so as to try and gauge how many coins they hold.<br/><br/>The first five pigs to cross the finish line earn five, four, three, two and one coins, after which the game is over and all the piggy banks are opened.

In addition, you get &quot;result points&quot; in each sport. The better your results, the more points you get. The result points are added up, and the player having the most points after all five sports is the winner! The &quot;super score&quot; - very hard to achieve - is 1000 points or more.<br/><br/>One special feature of the game is that you yourself can influence your results; the outcome is not decided by the dice alone.<br/><br/>So if you're planning to win this official game of the world championships in athletics, it is going to take both skill and luck - just like in real life!<br/><br/>This is a rare Fenno-Alga publication in that, being published to promote the specific sports competition in Helsinki, it does not seem to have a Swedish counterpart at all.<br/><br/>",

Other powers are passive, such as the Nature mage which cannot be directly targeted by any enemy mage.

Each player, playing as 1 of 7 unique goblins, takes turns visiting and building various locations in and around their dungeon. From flame throwing turrets, to sharkodile moats, to poison traps, players must work semi-cooperatively to build each location to perfection before the King's royal guard shows up.<br/><br/>If all three primary defenses are constructed before the King's Royal Guard arrives, the Loyal goblin players win the game. If the Royal Guard reaches the dungeon before that happens, the hidden Spy will win.<br/><br/>Players achieve global and, more importantly, individual rewards for completing construction phases of a particular defensive structure. But beware! Your fellow goblins may not be as loyal as you! Each player has a hidden identity card and plays as either a Loyal Goblin, a Spy, a Selfish Jerk, or an Anarchist.<br/><br/>Each Loyalty type has its own win conditions. <br/><br/>     If the Royal Guard shows up before the defenses are built, the Spy player wins<br/>     If the defenses are built before the Royal Guard shows up,<br/>         The Anarchist wins if the Anarchy Track is high enough, otherwise<br/>         The Selfish Jerk wins if he/she has accumulated enough individual glory, otherwise<br/>         The remaining Loyal players win.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Stay Out of My Dungeon! combines the fun of hidden identity games and the camaraderie of cooperative play into one strategically rich yet easy to learn board game.<br/><br/>",

Unchecked, zombie hordes destroyed the agricultural base; destroying fields, devouring cattle. Governments toppled as food resources became scarcer and scarcer. Quarantined by the rest of the world, it took 10 years for the survivors and governments-in-exile to wheedle support and aid from an international community filled with fear and skepticism.<br/><br/>Early in the process of containment, eradication, and reconstruction, a horrible secret was discovered: To supplement dwindling ration supplies, many survivors harvested and ate the corpses of the zombies they killed. Shockingly, zombie flesh was the most tender, tastiest, best-aged meat in the world. Preserved by the zombie disease while tenderized by necrotic bacteria, zombie steak made several black-market smugglers very wealthy. Serving zombie steak became an unusual, but chic, status symbol among the elite and wealthy outside North America.<br/><br/>Recognizing the demand for zombie steak, and desperate for revenue to rebuild the economy, the US government did not eradicate the last of the zombies, but herded them into federally controlled and regulated 'zombie ranches'. Each fiscal year, contractors bid for the right to harvest and process zombies from their local zombie ranch. You are one of the contractors lucky enough to land a rancher's contract. Your goal is to capture the finest, tastiest, and best-aged zombies and render them into juicy steaks and fillets.<br/><br/>Welcome to the world of Zombie Rancher.<br/><br/>The printable board and rules are available here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/91/zombie-rancher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/91/zombie-rancher</a><br/><br/>",

If you gather many cats of the same color, your party warms up and you gain high reputation. You may simply play a cat card or two special cards, two cats card or a fish card. Fish card can lure other cats. Basically the goal is simple: gather as many cats of the same color as possible. But to do so, you should consider several factors while drafting, such as what color opponents are gathering, or whether you should play special cards now or not. That makes this party game so strategic that everyone from children and adults can enjoy together.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>ãCat&rsquo;s Partyãã¯ããã©ããã¿ã¤ãã®ã«ã¼ãã²ã¼ã ã§ããåãã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ã¯ãèªåã®ãã¼ãã£ã¼ä¼å ´ã«ã­ããéãã¦ããã¾ããããªãã¹ãåãã°ã«ã¼ã(åãè²)ã®ã­ããå¤ãéããã»ããããã¼ãã£ã¼ãçãä¸ããã¾ã(å¾ç¹ãé«ããªãã¾ã)ãããããªã«ã¼ãã(å¥ã®ä¼å ´ã«è¡ããã¨ãã¦ããã­ãããã³ãå¯ããã«ã¼ã)ããã¾ãä½¿ãã°ãããå¤ãã®ã­ããéãããã¨ãã§ãã¾ããåºæ¬ã¯åãè²ã®ã­ããéããã ããã¨ããç°¡åãªã«ã¼ã«ãªãããã2ã­ãã«ã¼ãããããããªã«ã¼ãããªã©ã®ç¹æ®ã«ã¼ããä½¿ãã¿ã¤ãã³ã°ããä»ã®ãã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ã®ä¼å ´ã®ã­ãã®è²ãç¢ºèªããªããåãã«ã¼ãã¨æ¸¡ãã«ã¼ããèãããã©ããã²ã¼ã ã®æ¦ç¥æ§ãã¨ãã»ã³ã¹ã¨ãã¦å«ã¾ããå°ããªãå­æ§ããå¤§äººã¾ã§ä¸ç·ã«æ¥½ããéã¹ããã¡ããªã¼ã²ã¼ã ã§ãã<br/><br/>",

He control the events in the Arkhan City, where each player has a secret role: cultists os citizens (some citizens with special powers).<br/>The goal from the cultists is to kill every citizen, one by one. If they achieve these goal, then Cthulhu will come to our world.<br/>The goal for the citizens is to kill all cultists.<br/>Every round has a night fase (where the cultists kill one citizen) and a day fase where everyone (including the cultists) discuss and vote to kill one player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally an ancient Hindu game for children, Pulijudam is a two player strategy game free from elements of chance.  It is almost an abstract strategy game, but one of its alternative names, &quot;Lambs and Tigers&quot;, suggests the theme overlaid for children.<br/><br/>Pulijudam is very similar to Bagh Chal and Fox and Geese - it is essentially a member of the Hnefatafl family of asymmetrical abstract games, although of very different origin.  One player uses three pieces representing tigers; the other player uses fifteen pieces representing lambs.  The initial placement of the three tigers is fixed.  The lamb player begins to place his fifteen lambs wherever they wish in the twenty remaining spaces on the board; neither side can move any pieces until all of that type have been placed.  Therefore the tigers may begin to move from the third turn while the lambs may only move from the fifteenth turn.<br/><br/>Each piece may move to any vacant adjacent space on the board (effectively orthogonally).  Tigers may 'eat' lambs by jumping over an adjacent lamb into a vacant space beyond.<br/><br/>The game is won when the tigers have captured all the lambs or the lambs have encircled the tigers preventing them from moving.<br/><br/>",

Each player becomes a producer of the movie, or hire the talent, we will increase the influence in the industry by creating a slush fund or been successful in investing, or making a movie variety. Rivals and won the &quot;psychological warfare&quot;, it becomes &quot;mastermind&quot; who do you think true...<br/><br/>Game description from user:<br/><br/>&quot;Film Fixer&quot; is a 3-4 player card game based on the theme of producing movies in the film industry. Although this game was made in Japan, the company has made it bi-lingual (although a few of the translations are a little strage).<br/><br/>Each player starts with a new talent card and 8 coins. The player uses coins to purchase (contract) &quot;talent&quot; and sends them to &quot;movies&quot; in order to earn more money and victory points.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>4  - Newcomer Cards<br/>36 - Money Cards (9/6 coins, 12/3 coins, 15/1 coins)<br/>37 - Movie Cards (15/Talent cards, 11/QE Film cards, 11/CP Film cards)<br/>1  - The End Card<br/><br/>Each turn is conducted in 6 phases:<br/><br/>1 - Investment<br/>2 - Change<br/>3 - Contracting<br/>4 - Shooting<br/>5 - Profit<br/>6 - Replenishing<br/><br/>The instructions provided are a little confusing at first, but I'll do my best to try and summarize them.<br/><br/>The movie cards (talent and film cards) are shuffled, the END card is placed two from the bottom, and 5 cards are dealt into the play area.<br/><br/>1 - In the investment phase non-acting players can invest money in what they think the acting player will do. Money cards each have one of three logos on them: Yukidama Agency Corp. (for all talent cards [YA]), Qvinta Essentia Entertainment Inc. [QP] and Cosaic Pictures Inc. [CP] (the two movie companies). The invested money is placed face down and players wait until phase 5 (where they see if the acting player has played any of the companies non-acting players have invested in.<br/><br/>2 - In the change phase the acting player can choose to pay one coin to switch out one movie card with a new one. They can do this as many times as they'd like as long as they have the money to do so. They do not receive change from this transaction.<br/><br/>3 - In the contracting phase the acting player can purchase &quot;talent&quot; which will be placed face up infront of them. Talent often have various abilities that will affect play. In this phase, players can receive change from this transaction.<br/><br/>4 - In the shooting phase the acting player sends talent (this includes their &quot;new talent&quot; card) to film cards (if any in the play area). They can send multiple talent to work on different films as long as those films are being produced by the same company (you can't send one talent to CP and one to QE in the same turn. Either one or the other). You can also send multiple talent to the same film (as co-stars). The acting player will collect money and the film card (film cards go into the victory point pile). If the sent talent card has a star mark on it, it is discarded.<br/><br/>5 - In the profit phase the other players will collect their reward if they properly invested their money (for example: If player B decides to invest a &quot;one coin&quot; card with the CP logo on it and the acting player (player A) sends tallent to a CP film, then player B will be rewarded [they can either put the invested money into their VP pile or upgrade it to the next higher value coin card]). If the non-acting player invested in the wrong company, that invested money is discarded.<br/><br/>6 - In the replenish phase new movie cards are dealt into the play area until there are 5 cards again. It is now the next player's turn and it becomes the investment phase again.<br/><br/>Once the END card is dealt, the game will finish after the &quot;next&quot; player's turn. Once finished, each player counts their Victory Points. Player with the most VP is the winner (if tie, the player who made the most movies wins).<br/><br/>",

The players take turns, selects one of the three cards on the board, and then tries to collect this by playing one character card. The strongest character gets the card. It is good to have strong characters, but some of the gives minus points if in hand then a round is completed, eg. Satan (-20 victory points)<br/><br/>The cards collected can be put together to complete a story. The round ends then a player can complete a whole biblical story, and then all players count there victory points.

Then each player in turn may exchange 1, 2 or all 3 cards in his hand with the ones on the table. Or he may pass. When all players pass the cards are removed from the table and 3 new added from the remaining pile.<br/>The object is to get 3 cards of the same color in your hand. When you have 3 cards of the same color in your hand then you say 'Manara' and put down the cards in front of you. All cards, except the winning set, are then collected, shuffled and a new hand is dealt. Any player who receives the Manara card may put it down in front of him and receive a new card from the pile immediately.<br/>After 10 deals the players now have a number of sets in front of them and scoring begins. Each set of 3 scores 1 point. If a player have all 6 cards of one color then he receives a bonus point. The player with the Manara card in front of him also receives a bonus point.<br/>According to the rules, the losing players should now remove one piece of clothing for each point by which they lost to the winner...<br/><br/>((From Hakko504's first impressions thread))<br/><br/>",

Going in turns, they roll a die to move their tokens and attempt to get rid of their cards.  Certain acts, such as those for pie fights, can be passed to players whose tokens are within range.  Others can only be passed to players whose tokens are in the same room or are laid down as traps (a player whose token passes over them has to pick them up).  The player who empties his or her hand of cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

What you can do with them though is build up Gameworlds that take the CGME Core Rules and fill in the details of the game setting you want to play.<br/><br/>The Gameworlds are the source documents that will add the detail to the Core Rule's atomic structure. They will describe things like a worlds terrain, the units available, their strengths and weaknesses, the climate, special rules that modify combat resolution, new rules that cover things like horse back ridding, vector space ship movement, and just how to handle a Vogon star destroyer that has wandered into your Medieval Fantasy realm.<br/><br/>By building off the same Core Rules and by using the Gameworlds you have created, or have been created by others, you can then build up Gamesets to cover the specific events to play out. For example, by using the CGME Core Rules coupled with the CGME Space Gameworld you could build a Gameset to play interstellar battles, trade wars across colonial star systems, early 1970's Soviet vs. US orbital conflicts, and many more.<br/><br/>If a Gameworld does not cover all the details you need to play out your event, you are free to haul off and add in what you need, modify what is there and hopefully make it available so others can use it.<br/><br/>CGME is freely available in Volume 1 Issue 1 of Countermoves<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game consists of four dice and a deck of special cards.  They come in three suits (blue, green, red) and range from 2 to 12 in value.  The frequencies vary (one each of 2, 3, 11, and 12; two each of 4, 5, 9, 10 and three each of 6, 7, and 8).<br/><br/>There are rules for ten games.  Two family games: Cancellation and Dice Deck Rummy, two children's games: Give And Take and Crazy Dice, two casino games (you will have to supply the betting chips): Three Card Down and Make My Point, two strategy games: Pathfinder and Admiral, and two solitary games: Dice Deck Bingo and Stack 'Em Up.<br/><br/>To give but one example, in Dice Deck Rummy you are dealt 8 cards.  On your turn, you draw a card from the stock or the top discard.  You then roll two dice.  You can play any sets of the number rolled (two or more cards of that value), or any runs (three or more same color cards that follow each other in sequence) that end or begin with the number rolled (counting the dice as an extra card).  Finally you discard.  You can also freely increase played sets and runs on your turn.  First player to go out scores the total value remaining in the other players' hands.<br/><br/>Dice Deck is similar to the Deck of Dice<br/><br/>",

From the box...<br/><br/>Crime Scene: When Norma Ashby heard they were closing Lakeside High School and tearing it down, she was devastated.  She, one of the few alumni left in town, was on a mission.  She would save the school.  She decided to have a reunion and convince her old classmates to help her purchase Lakeside High.<br/><br/>This was the high school reunion weekend.  The 'get re-acquainted' party the night before was a great success.  In fact so much so that the eight of you and Norma decided to meet at the Lakeside Greasy Spoon before going to the 60's, 70's 'Rock 'n' Roll' costume party.  Norma never made it that night.<br/><br/>Norma had said she would save Lakeside High or die trying.  And, that is exactly what happened.  Norma Ashby was found dead in her home.  She had been shot to death.<br/><br/>The Suspects:<br/><br/>Debbie Rowe: A devoted wife and proud mother.  Driven by her competitive nature.  How far would she go to be number one?<br/><br/>Blake Walker: He is a soap star.  An 'idol' who has it all.  A beautiful wife, wonderful children...what more could he ask for?<br/><br/>Mary-Lou Potts: A successful businesswoman with a razor sharp mind and a troubled past.  Left Lakeside and vowed never to return.  Was attending the reunion a cover...for murder?<br/><br/>Doug Griffin: An ex-football player.  Spoiled and reckless, he hates rules and regulations.  Was his next play &quot;unsportsmanlike conduct&quot;?<br/><br/>Dr. Veronica Hardy: A psychiatrist and marriage counselor.  Haunted by a past she tries to keep secret.  Was she all psyched out?<br/><br/>Dr. Wayne Hardy: Veronica's husband and business partner.  He is attractive, friendly, and self-assured.  He and Veronica have it made.  Would he risk it all for revenge?<br/><br/>Wendy Larose: A high priced Madam.  She is quick-witted with loose morals.  Would she do anything, or anyone, to get what she wanted?<br/><br/>Randy Whalen: Police Officer for Lakeside's finest.  He was a forceful personality, not to be crossed.

        "description": "Milton Bradley produced 8 mystery party/role-playing games (in the vein of &ldquo;How to Host a Murder&rdquo;) beginning in 1987. They were published as &quot;Life of the Party&quot; games; four mysteries and four murders. These are also copyright Jamie Swise Games&mdash;the designer of the games, who produced several other titles (and many, if not all, of these) a few years earlier.<br/><br/>Episode: The Coffeehouse Murder<br/><br/>Folk singer Jeremy Swain was found dead in an apartment above the Gate of Fate Coffeehouse. He had just finished a two night engagement at the club before embarking on his first national tour. It was very uncool what got laid on poor Jeremy. Like, it was a stone drag. Dig. Invite some faces over to the crib, make a scene, and riff on who did the cat up.*<br/><br/><br/>    Translation within<br/><br/><br/>The Time: August 16, 1958<br/><br/>The Place: The North Beach area of San Francisco<br/><br/>Patty Farb: Department store heiress with too much money and too much time on her hands. She often gave money to struggling artists she felt showed promise. Patty had affairs with most of the performers at the club and once fell especially hard for Swain. She also gave her money to many causes and was once, for a short time, a member of the American Communist Party. She attended a party for Swain that evening and claimed she was with one of her artist friends at the time of his death.<br/><br/>Art Fez: The bongo playing comedian who opened the show for Swain and doubled as the M.C.. Fez was active in the labor movement in the late 1940's and at that time a good friend of Swain. Fez was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) While he was cleared of any &quot;wrong-doing&quot;, he was black-listed from the clubs and was playing his first gig in four years. He did attend Swain's party but left early. He stated that he was searching the streets for a restaurant that served purple gelatin at the time of Swain's death.<br/><br/>Barney Fawn: Forty year-old club owner and amateur UFO watcher. Fawn claimed to have had encounters with alien beings and believes some of the acts he hires are the next closest things. He would loan struggling artists moderate sums of money and then have them pay him back by playing his club for peanuts. He did not attend the party, choosing to remain downstairs counting the night's receipts instead.<br/><br/>Teresa Wilcox: Was Swain's live-in but was not sharing the apartment during Jeremy's current engagement. They had been having &quot;marital&quot; problems of late. Wilcox also served as Swain's back-up singer but did not perform at the Gate of Fate. She attended the party but was unclear of her whereabouts at the time of his death.<br/><br/>Rocky Tuttle: Young and aggressive loan officer of a small bank. Tuttle was making the scene often in the past few months. Although he was as square as they come, Tuttle and Swain struck up a close friendship. He did not attend the party and was vague about his movements around the time of the crime.<br/><br/>Del Finney: Swain's business manager and owner of a dry cleaning store. He was a big force behind Swain's success and was a hard working as any manager of a folk act could be. Finney was not at the party. He left right after the show to make final preparations for Swain's next date.<br/><br/>Natalie Corvus: She was a chronic club hanger-on who fancied herself a talented singer. She would invariably come on stage every amateur night and belt Gregorian chants at the top of her lungs. Natalie was often seen outside the club in Swain's company and it was well known that Teresa found that fact unbearable. Natalie was at the party but left after a boisterous argument with Wilcox about the former's singing or lack of singing talents. She claims she was star gazing at the time of death.<br/><br/>Fran Fern: Fran was the manager/bartender at the Gate of Fate. She was briefly married to Swain during the lean years. Active in many causes, she once lobbied to have the raisin declared the national fruit. She stayed in the club to clean-up and did not attend the party.<br/><br/>Game Includes:<br/>Full Plot Scenario <br/>Character Biographies<br/>Recorded Introduction<br/>24 Clues <br/>Solution<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>LYNCHED IN LUCRE VALLEY -or- Who Rigged the Rig?<br/><br/>It's July, 1952, and the oil industry has been booming in Alberta, Canada since the end of WWII. New oil reserves have been discovered just as fast as wildcatters can set up rigs and drill. As a result, new oil and oilfield service companies have been springing up like Alberta winter wheat. One such company is Drye Holle Drilling, founded by Mr. Dryesdale &quot;Drye&quot; Holle of Lucre Valley. And tonight, you've been invited to attend the company's First Annual Safety Award Dinner, in honor of Drye Holle Drilling's remarkable safety record. And of course, the affair will be catered by the local Crude Cafe.<br/><br/>Now the real question remains: Will Drye Holle Drilling have an outstanding safety record for a second year in a row? In any case, one thing is certain, murder would definitely mar that record . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Tarra &quot;Tar&quot; Sanze is a sassy secretary who mans the front lines of Drye Holle Drilling. Known for her smarts as well as her savvy, she's a tornado on the typewriter and a dervish when it comes to dictation. Pretty as well as proficient, she's had more than her share of suitors, but the oil industry remains the love of her life. She dresses to fit the occasion - pants or skirts for trips to the field and dazzling dresses for dinner.<br/><br/>Derek Hand is the dashing Drilling Manager at Drye Holle Drilling, a company Derek has worked for since he and Drye returned from the War in Europe. Hard working and an industry expert, Derek's loyalty to the company is legendary. Because he's constantly on call, he prefers to wear casual work clothes.<br/><br/>Madame Mae Kittup is an exotic beauty from the Ukraine, a gypsy woman whose psychic powers include telling the future via her magic pysankas, or Ukrainian Easter eggs. Sultry and mysterious, Madame Mae is employed by Drye Holle Drilling to locate oil reserves far beneath the Earth's surface. Yet she attributes her great gift to her grandmother, and prefers to dress in the clothing of her native land.<br/><br/>Denver Driller is a rich and rugged oilman from the States, whose business frequently brings him to Canada, where he plans to reap the rewards of the country's bountiful resources. A world traveler, he's charming and charismatic, and a favorite among the locals. He dresses to suit the occasion, with a wardrobe that ranges from designer suits to dungarees.<br/><br/>Olivia &quot;Ol&quot; Barrinesse could be described in three simple words: rich, refined and ravishing. Originally from Calgary, she's the daughter of the late Brigham Barrinesse, from whom she inherited her wealth, as well as her independent and highly profitable oil company, Brigham Oil. Ol is always dressed in the height of fashion, famous for her foreign shopping sprees and her bounty of baubles.<br/><br/>Andre P. Renure is a bold businessman who provides a valuable service to the oilfield consumer by running Lucre Valley's only general store and restaurant, the Crude Cafe. A Frenchman from Quebec, he came to the West after the War, hoping to amass a fortune from his vocational ventures. Shrewd and sophisticated, his suits are the latest of fifties fashions.<br/><br/>Beulah &quot;Beu&quot; T. Kween is a beaming beauty from the heart of bovine country, who was raised on a cattle ranch in southern Alberta. Having won more than her share of beauty contests, everyone says her future is bright, that she'll be married with a house full of kids before she can say &quot;baby boom.&quot; Flirtatious and fun-loving, she currently works as a waitress at the Crude Cafe, where she earns enough money to keep her wardrobe stocked with delectable dresses.<br/><br/>Royal T. Ohhner is an Alberta cattle rancher whose range reaches far across some big beefy underground oil reserves - oil reserves that are leased to and drilled by Drye Holle Drilling. Thus Royal often jokes about raising both crude and cattle, which have proven to be real cash cows for him. A real grass roots kind of guy, he's never been one to steer away from hard work. He wears nothing but Western attire.<br/><br/>This mystery game features a Western Canadian setting. (If you've never seen Calgary and the Canadian Rockies, then you've never really lived!) So, of course, we used some classic characters that you might find in that neck of the bush -- the Frenchman from Quebec, the Ukranian woman and her psyankas (decorated eggs), a cattle rancher and the people in the oil industry. Of course, there's also a mention of playing hockey.<br/><br/>Besides all that, it's set in the early 1950s, which provides so much opportunity for costumes, as well as setting the mood. People can dress either 1940s or 1950s style, and you can easily play music from both decades.<br/><br/>All and all, it's a fun romp, with the same lunacy and ludicrousness as the rest of our mystery games. Watch out for the surprise twist at the end!<br/><br/>",

We think it is a question which needs answering.  And if that burning question doesn't compel you, you might like to figure out who murdered her.<br/><br/>The case of characters is indeed curious: a right-wing megalomaniac, the cold-blooded co-publisher, a pompous author, a flower child, the degenerate son, an immensely virile handy man, the town's mayor and only plumber, and Mary's bible thumping ex-best friend.<br/><br/>The time is March, 1968.

When the player's roll brings up one of the fur patterns, the player moves the corresponding animal clockwise around the board to the next watering hole. When the die roll shows the raindrop symbol, all players remove one raindrop from his watering hole for every animal that is standing at that player's watering hole at that time.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who feeds the most thirsty animals by being the first to run out of raindrops.<br/><br/>",

For example:<br/><br/>STRATEGY A: 2-7: -10$, 8-10: +100$, 11-12: +1250$<br/>STRATEGY B: +300$, -100$, -120$<br/><br/>In the basic game players take turns revealing the cards, choosing a strategy, and rolling to see the gain or loss. In the slightly more advanced game each player is allowed to buy partial information on a card, by rolling a single die before committing to a strategy. In the example above partial information costs 90$, and if you bought it then rolled a 6 you would be more inclined to choose strategy A.<br/><br/>In the advanced game players take turns revealing cards, and auctioning them off to the other players who then play them against the auctioning player, rather than a bank. Additionally each card has a set indicator, and when you collect six cards in a set you can turn them in for 500$ from each player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a mystery party game, but NOT a murder mystery.<br/><br/>First in a series called &amp;quot;Murderless Mysteries&amp;quot;, that claim the following difference from other mystery party games:<br/>&middot;There is no murder, the crime to be solved is non-violent.<br/>&middot;An unlimited number of party guests can participate.<br/>&middot;The same game can be played again with a different solution.<br/>&middot;No one, including the host and even the culprit, can ever be sure of who dunnit, until it is revealed at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are 6 main characters who are encouraged to dress in costume but not required, plus a game leader.  But other guests at the party can ask questions and vote on who they think did it.<br/><br/>The six main characters in this story are members of a club similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, but they&amp;#039;ve sworn off evil-doings:<br/>Hagatha Grub&mdash;The Activities Director is a wicked old witch who cackles often, sometimes for no apparent reason. Hunched shoulders under black clothing complete with pointy hat, she frequently pets her only friend, her cat.<br/><br/>Professor Trixie Gimmick&mdash;The Club&amp;#039;s Technical Administrator who runs the club website is an ultimate techo-geek. She prefers machines over people and plays with gadgets all the time, getting a little annoyed when people interrupt her work to talk to her.<br/><br/>Vanessa Van Avarice&mdash;The club Secretary is a beautiful vamp, vain, ruthless and very greedy. She flirts with all the men and is catty to all the women.<br/><br/>Captain Brutus LeCad&mdash; Would you trust a former pirate as Club Treasurer?<br/><br/>Morley Krupt&mdash;A former gangster makes a great Security Officer.<br/><br/>Barnaby Underwood&mdash;The club Vice President is a stereotypical villain from melodramas. He constantly twirls his large black mustache and has an evil laugh. He doesn&amp;#039;t understand why everyone yells &amp;quot;boo&amp;quot; every time his name is spoken.<br/><br/>",

It can, however, be played solitaire since it is basically a detailed guide to palm reading and analysis.&quot;<br/><br/>The game includes a set of oversized cards illustrating different categories of markings on the hand and a pad of Profile Sheets for recording which markings appear on a player's hand. The personality characteristic for each type of marking is listed in the game booklet.<br/><br/>The brief rules suggest that players break into groups and work on figuring out the what markings appear on their hands. Once these have been marked down on profile sheets, all of the sheets are gathered and the interpretations are read from the game booklet. The rules suggest that you read the analysis aloud and let your friends try to guess who is being described.<br/><br/>",

Adds another layer to such a game.<br/>---<br/>Casinopoly: The Casino Party Board Game<br/>Viva Las Vegas! And Atlantic City, too! With Casinopoly, players can play a casino party game or create an add-on feature that's compatible with &quot;the most popular real estate trading board games.&quot; The board just happens to fit snugly into the center of a Monopoly board, and, whether you're landing on Boardwalk or cruising the Strip, Casinopoly's easy dice versions of four casino classics provide plenty of action. Played on its own, the game moves faster than the B&amp;O Railroad: Land on roulette and roll the special die showing either red or black; slots dice roll to reveal a combo of cherries, lemons, and bells; toss the two card-faced blackjack bones to hit 21; or attempt to shake 7 or 11 with the regular craps dice. Should high rollers want to move from the Belaggio to Baltic Avenue, the rule sheet explains how to incorporate the games into a round of Monopoly. Casinopoly lets players go from starvin' to Marvin (Gardens, that is) with a roll of the dice.<br/><br/>",

The players go with their playing piece as party leader on a continuous through Europe. By winning elections in cities they obtain Members of the European Parliament. Cities may be exchanged on a voluntary basis. Players in control of all cities of a member state are entitled to European Ministers each time they pass Brussels.

The designer acknowledges that the game does not use a defined time and space scale, but is instead intended to demonstrate the &quot;relative capabilities&quot; of the various aircraft. The rules were designed for use with 1/100 to 1/365 scale models. Game statistics are given for 8 famous fighter aircraft.<br/><br/>According to the author's introduction, he had worked on the game design since 1967. In the early seventies, the game was used by Spartan International at competitive events, and the game was printed in the Spartan Journal in 1972. One interesting note in the introduction: &quot;When Lou Zocchi saw this game he flipped! He had been working on the same dimensional problems for years, but to no avail. He quickly adopted the 'break-throughs' offered by this game to use in one of his own.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players have to play their cards to the board in such an order that they would form a reasonable sentence. If anyone plays such a card that it turns the sentence unreasonable you could challenge that particular play. The player that played that card must now tell you what the sentence means. These clever explanation/context/twists are where the fun starts.  The player will now have to turn that unreasonable sentence into a reasonable one by describing some impossible situation where this particular sentence would make sense. After the explanation others have to vote if the explanation is reasonable enough for the interpreter to get points.<br/><br/>There are a couple of variations to the game, like playing a blind card, and certain actions allowing a player to place a card leaving a gap in between the sentence (in general, more difficult to fill than the usual sequence)<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    U Board game in 6 interlocking parts<br/>    Roulette<br/>    Cards containing words or short sentences<br/><br/><br/>",

On his turn, the player can choose to either discard a card and draw a replacement, or roll the die and move his pawn. He can only move onto a blue hiding place by discarding the appropriate equipment card for that location, but doing so entitles him to look at the card placed there and, if desired, exchange it with one from his hand. However, to take away a treasure card an additional piece of equipment must be expended; a key for a treasure chest, a spade for buried treasure. At the end of his turn, the player refreshes back to three cards.<br/><br/>Once a treasure card has been procured, the player will need to get it back aboard his ship. To do this he must return to his start square and play a boat card to get the booty aboard. Until he achieves this, he runs the risk of losing it to another player landing on the same square and playing a 'plunder' card. The game ends when all four treasures have been secured offshore and the player who has the most is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Very rare role-playing game of politics, diplomacy and military strength in China. Players take social positions within an agricultural society.  The players are: The Emperor; the Official; Gentry/Landholder; Scholar; Silk Peasant; Rice Peasant; Wheat Peasant; and the Warlord.  Each Player gets a booklet that describes your function in life.  You start your life by choosing a booklet in random. And you act according to the role described in your booklet until you achieve your next position in life.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for the players to move up or down the social ladder.  How you achieve your objective depends on how you play your role in society. For example: how do you solve the social-economic-political problems of a rural society?  How do you feed the people?  Build public works?  Collect taxes? Fight wars?  Defend yourself? Revolt?  Grow crops? Accumulate money?  Become powerful?<br/><br/>The variables involved are as numerous as your personality.  And how you move up the social ladder depends on your ability to interact with the other players.<br/><br/>",

If a player throws red, he/she can move to a tomato for example. Make sure the caterpillar is always headed in the right direction - a string connects his head to his feet so be careful to keep his head in front. To move, a player hold the feet of the caterpillar and moves the head as far as it can reach to the color thrown. Then the feet are moved, but cannot pass the head.<br/>When a player throws the 'caterpillar head', he/she can move anywhere he/she likes.<br/><br/>The player who makes it through the vegetable garden first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was developed immediately after Nixon's first election, and apparently by someone who did not want him to get a second term.<br/><br/>It is a simple Monopoly-type game, but it has an interesting asymmetrical dynamic. Essentially, one player takes Nixon and up to seven play as challengers, with Nixon trying to knock them off one by one as Primary cards come up. Players still roll to land on states and buy them, and other players pay a fee when landing on them afterwards. But buying states requires a combination of two forms of currency: money and media points. Many state spaces also trigger event and media cards, which have different effects on Nixon and challengers.<br/><br/>Key to the game are the four Primary cards in the Event deck. Each time one of these comes up, Nixon rolls off with the top-ranking challenger, and whichever has the highest electoral vote total gets +2 on the 2D6. Loser is out of the game, winner grabs a state of his choice from the loser, and the rest goes back to the bank. There is a &ldquo;saved by the bell&rdquo; re-entry card in the deck that allows a loser to stay in the game.<br/><br/>There also is a provision for the challengers to join forces if Nixon seems about to win, but only if they can agree on which challenger should be the winner instead! The decks include blank Media and Event cards to allow players to customize the game.<br/><br/>",

The board has several rooms which players mark on their score sheets as actual rooms in the place where you are playing, so the Red room might be your kitchen, the Green room might be your bathroom. Players then roll &amp; move around the board and on entering a room another player draws question cards and letter cards from the relevant decks. So you might be asked &quot;To name something you might see in the sky...&quot; with the letter B. The player keeps answering questions and collecting letter cards if they give proper answers. If they fail, or take too long, their turn ends. You keep no more than 5 letters, so if you get a 6th letter, you return one you don't want.<br/><br/>Players also land on Rummage! squares, and must jump up, grab their letters and sprint off the the relevant room in the house. They then snatch objects from that room which start with the letter and return them to the game. So if you have the letter P and B and on the board are in the living room, you might bring back a piano and a buffalo, or maybe just a pencil and a book if that's what you find.<br/><br/>Other squares get everybody Rummaging, or have players swap their collections and sheets. First to get 5 different objects and reach the back door wins.<br/><br/>",

A player may play a story card if it matches the next empty space on the board. A puzzle card may be played in front of the player. A thief card may be played against another player to have all of that player's puzzle card showing placed in a discard pile for that player. Finally, if a player cannot or does not want to play a card, one can be placed directly into the discard pile.<br/><br/>A round ends when the last story card is played onto the board. Points are then tallied. Each player gets a point for each story card that was played to the board in this round. A point is also awarded for each puzzle card that is still face up in front of the player. A bonus point is awarded if the player has all four puzzle cards face up. A point is subtracted from each player who is still holding a thief card in hand.<br/><br/>Further rounds are played, with the player with the least total points going first in each round, until at least one player has scored 21 or more points.

        "description": "from the MGDG website:<br/><br/>Early in the 16th Century, an accident of inheritance joined the Low Countries to the sprawling Habsburg Empire. The local governments disliked threats to their traditions of self-rule, and heavy taxes to support foreign wars. At the same time the Protestant Reformation, which was sweeping Europe, found ready acceptance among the affluent, literate Dutch. There was little enough to bind the independent-minded Dutch to the distant Habsburg possessions in Spain and Austria, but the devout Catholicism of the Emperors and their Inquisition now made war inevitable. When the rebellion commenced in 1566, neither side foresaw either the decades of bloody civil war or the formation of an independent Dutch State.<br/><br/>The Dutch Revolt is a simulation of this conflict. One player commands the Catholic forces of the Habsburg Empire under King Philip II of Spain. The other player commands the Dutch Protestant forces under William of Orange.<br/><br/>",

Lots of pieces representing kids (neutral and factions), candy, sodas, stuffed animals, etc.  A map of a playground is also included.<br/><br/>You start the game with one &quot;troublemaker&quot; and have to convince neutral kids to join your gang: your Smarts + 1d6 vs their Smarts +1d6.  You can bribe them with quarters, candy bars, stuffed animals, etc., to influence the die roll.  You can bash kids in other gangs: your Size + 1d6 vs their Size + 1d6.  You can gain weapons (shake up a soda for a grenade, bop somebody with a stuffed animal, throw sand - for shame!) to influence a fight. Results can vary from broken weapon to running away to being beaten up to running home crying out of the game.  You can soothe beat up kids with candy but suffer severe humiliation for being beaten up with a stuffed animal.<br/><br/>To win you have to control three of the six areas with members of your gang.<br/><br/>From the back cover:  &quot;Remember that Genghis, Caesar and Rommel were all kids once, too!&quot;  And a quote from an anonymous mom: &quot;It's all fun and games until somebody loses an eye.&quot;<br/><br/>",

While laying siege to other lands, you must also defend your own, otherwise the bad people sitting next to you will take them.<br/><br/>The bloodshed goes on and on until someone throws down a time stop card, or runs out of cards in their deck. At that point, everyone gets to take a breather and tally up damage. If a rival player pushed one of your territories over the damage threshold, he gets to take your land.

        "description": "Triple Flips 10 includes Outlaw and Stagecoach, Shark Attack, and Alien Invaders From Space.<br/><br/><br/>     Outlaw and Stagecoach is a 2-player game that simulates a Western chase scene, in which the outlaw tries to chase down and rob the stagecoach.  The stagecoach moves one or two spaces (determined by a die roll) along a fixed path toward East City.  The outlaw moves one or two spaces forward or backward, and may utilize the shortcuts.  Once the outlaw ends a move on the same space as the stagecoach, a gunfight occurs.  The gunfight consists of the outlaw winning three out of three rounds of &quot;Who can roll a higher number on the die?&quot; - re-rolling in the event of a tie.  If the stagecoach wins the gunfight, it escapes with a free move.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Shark Attack sends 2-4 players diving for treasure in slightly shark-infested waters.  On your turn, you roll a die, then move in orthogonal steps, generally toward the treasure.  You may not swim through other pawns.  If you start your turn in the shark attack zone, which is 4/7 of the playfield, then you will also roll and move the shark.  The shark may swim through other pawns, but if it ends its movement on a player's pawn, that pawn goes back to the boat and starts over.  The goal is not only to get past the shark to reach the treasure, but also return through the shark's waters to the boat thereafter.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Alien Invaders From Space is a 1-player roll-and-move with a die-driven squad of aliens hunting you along the path.  A die roll indicates which 3-4 of six rooms are occupied by aliens.  For your attempted escape, each turn, you roll a die.  On an even roll, you move that many spaces; odd, the alien in the current room (if any) moves that many spaces, eventually getting into your path and threatening you.  One exception:  If you roll a 1, the aliens all get reset, and you roll again to determine their new three or four starting rooms.  You simply try to reach your &quot;rocket ship to Earth&quot; without a turn ending you and an alien on the same space.<br/><br/><br/>",

They can get what they need at the County fair, but because the supp of each item is limited as e each brother wants to be the FIRST to stock his farm, the competition is keen and exciting.  In playing MacDonald's Farm Game, you can take the part of one of the Scotch brothers and attempt by &quot;Selecting Stock at the County Fair&quot; -- &quot;Cornering the Market&quot; -- &quot;Trading&quot; and &quot;Unloading Surpluses&quot; to be the FIRST to stock up your own farm.<br/><br/>Each player tries to fill his farm with the exact animals needed. On each turn, you spin the spinner and must take one group of animals, if possible, from the section the spinner lands on.  If you have too many of a specific animal, you may attempt to trade by spinning.  If the spinner lands on a trade space, you may attempt to negotiate a single trade with any of your opponents.  Otherwise, your turn ends.  Once you have all of your needed animals, you get rid of your excess at the county fair.  Again, you spin and if you land on a county fair space, you may return one group listed there to the stock.  Otherwise your turn ends.  However, if you forget to declare that you are going to the fair, you must draw animals as though it were a normal turn.<br/><br/>",

In 2001, Alan Baljeu modified the game into its present form.<br/><br/>The rules (from Wikipedia):<br/><br/><br/>     Black and white take turns placing stones on the line. Unlike Go, this placement is compulsory if a move is available; if no move is possible, the game is over.<br/>     No stone may be placed in a location occupied by another stone, or in a location where a stone of your own colour has just been removed. The latter condition keeps the game from entering a neverending loop of stone placement and capture, known in Go as ko.<br/>     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of enemy stones to no longer have any adjacent empty spaces--liberties, as in Go--then those stones are removed. As the above rule states, the opponent may not play in those locations on their following turn.<br/>     If placing a stone causes one or two groups of your own colour to no longer have any liberties, the stones are not suicided, but instead are safe and not removed from play.<br/><br/><br/>Play continues until a player cannot place a stone on their turn. At this point, the number of stones on the board is counted; the winner is the one with the most stones.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/>     Richard PBeM server<br/><br/><br/>",

First player to exit all 10 pieces wins. The move combinations are very exciting, especially because you can move any piece on the board, not just your own.<br/><br/>",

It is 1942, Japan is at the height of her expansion into Southeast Asia and the Pacific, yet China stands defiantly unconquerable. As the Japanese player, you must carefully pit the Chinese factions against each other while using your superior military machine to bring all of China under your control. As the Nationalist Chinese player, you must cooperate with the Communists (however distasteful that may seem) to drive the invading Japanese from the shores of China before re-establishing your authority as the only central government of China. As the Chinese Communist player, you too are faced with an enemy worse than fellow Chinese. You must first drive the Japanese from China before you can put your superior guerrilla tactics to work against the corrupt Kuomintang.<br/><br/>Player&rsquo;s Value: This is a simple game with undemanding rules (movement two areas per turn, roll dice in simultaneous rounds of combat, each &ldquo;1&rdquo; is an elimination and each &ldquo;6&rdquo; is a retreat, minor variations on this for leaders, air forces, etc.). It hustles right along at six months per turn, with a variable exit point for the Japanese. The game is unusual in that it is designed primarily for three players, any one of which has a good shot at winning the game (if the Japanese player wins, the two Chinese players can play a Civil War endgame to see who comes in second).<br/><br/>",

The hand painted, 15&quot; square fringed game cloth (washable) serves for four games for 2 players, plus a variety of jumping and positional puzzles for solitaire. The title game lets players invade the opponent's castle, capture as in checkers. Another game is an unusual version of &quot;Nim&quot;. And &quot;Caravan&quot; is a desert-crossing trek, with strings attached. The 18 solid hardwood maple disks are hand-tinted in 3 colors. Directions are on a &quot;scroll&quot;.&quot;<br/><br/>Caravan is new to the Kadon edition, as is the three-player game, if different. Son of Solomon is presumably not included in this edition as it requires numbered pieces.<br/><br/>",

One version comes in a standard long box and contains 34 substantive metal ship pieces. A second version comes in an album-style slipcase and serves as a travel edition, with 34 magnetic ship components clearly identifiable via their silhouette, name and classification.<br/><br/>The ship classifications drive the comparative cruising and firing capabilities of the various warships which they emulate.<br/><br/>",

Since only a complete understanding of scoring will allow a player to make good plays, however, it may be a little hard (while reading these rules) to understand when, where and maybe even why a player would place a cards into play. For now, suffice it to say that cards placed next to each other are potentially worth points if the icons on their adjacent sides match up in either shape, number or color. Sometimes a player will want to aim for matches worth maximum points. Other times he may want to form &quot;connections&quot; worth no points at all, in hopes of stopping his opponent from scoring. All the while a player has to keep a close eye on what his opponent is up to!<br/><br/>As far as the design goes, Synapse is my attempt at a real-time game that has no luck and no room for cheating during the fast play. I think it succeeds well on these two accounts.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Patriot Challenge players move their token around the game board, which features illustrations of U.S. postage stamps, and try to be the first to pass the year 2000. In order to move their tokens players must answer questions on cards that are divided by difficulty into three categories: white cards (basic), blue cards (challenging), and red cards (expert). The questions pertain to aspects of American history and culture. Correct responses earn points which a player uses to move his token.<br/>If a player does not know the answer to a question, he has the option of teaming up with another player, and if the team answers correctly the points are split between the two players.<br/>Some of the cards have bonus questions. If a player successfully answers a bonus question, the other players, as a democratic group, must decide how many points to award.<br/>The player who best combines teamwork, strategy, and knowledge will have the best chance of winning.<br/>The game components are: a game board, 650 cards, rules, an answer key, a magnifying glass, and six tokens.<br/><br/>",

There are four suits (Green, Blue and Red each have cards numbered 2-10, and Yellow has cards numbered 2-5) but there are no rules for different suits, oddly enough.  There are also four &quot;Lucky One&quot; cards that don't belong to any suit.<br/><br/>On your turn you either match cards on the table (you start the game with three cards on the table) and so put them into your pile, or play a card that is the sum of two cards on the table and so put those cards into your pile, or add a card to the table.  At the end of the game, the player with the most cards in his/her pile gets 3 points; each Lucky One you collected gets you one point, and the Lucky Two and Lucky Ten are worth two points each (there are only one of each of these).<br/><br/>The cards are illustrated with crudely drawn cartoon images of Laurel &amp; Hardy, alas - photos would have made the game worthwhile for adults, at least as a collector's item.<br/><br/>",

This lower tray is where you need to align four in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) to win.

The gameboard is carved with 12 identical vertical lines, while the dice have six faces carved with the numbers from one to six. First the dice are thrown to determine the steps a player will advance. The player who moves their 15 pieces into the realm of the last six lines earlier is the winner.

If you land on a space with a Cattle Piece, you place it on your Ranch space. At the halfway point you must decide whether to go to the Corral or the Brush (you can't do both). You receive 6 head of cattle for visiting the Corral, but you must land on it by exact spin (thus slowing you down). The Brush need not be landed on by exact count. You then turn and race back to your Ranch, and the player who reaches it first receives a 4-cattle bonus. The player with the most cattle at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a Davy Crockett pawn and a picture disk depicting a bow and arrow. Other picture disks are placed face down and adjacent to various spaces across the board. Starting from the Frontierland space, players use a spinner to move their pawns along the board's wilderness trails. If you land on a space adjacent to a picture disk, you secretly look at it, and if it's an Indian, you capture it by secretly exchanging it with your bow and arrow disk. The first player to return to Frontierland with a captured Indian wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is basically a form of solitaire, played solo or competitively. There are 4 sets of 52 counters. Each player's set consists of 52 counters of the same color, numbering from 1 to 13 inclusive, 4 of each number. One player (the &quot;leader&quot;) turns their counters face down and mixes them up. All other players keep theirs face up and orderly, so they can find the numbers quickly and easily and see what numbers are left. The leader draws a counter and announces the number. All players take a counter of the same number from their set. They may play it to one of 4 columns or one of 4 stacks (foundations). Stacks are started with a 1 and go up sequentially to 13. If a number cannot be placed on a stack, it must be placed at the bottom end of one of the 4 columns. It is most desirable to place counters on columns so that the columns are in descending order. The only way to move a counter from a column is to move it onto one of the stacks. Only the counter at the bottom end of a column may be moved. Continue drawing until all counters have been placed. Your score is the sum of the numbers on the top of your stacks. Each player in turn takes the role of leader and reads off the numbers. Highest score after an agreed-upon number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Then you try to pick your card up with your teeth. You may have three attempts and only your feet may touch the ground. If you fail, you are out of the game. When everyone has had a turn, the top box is removed from the tower and the remaining players attempt to pick their cards up from that level. If the card has been successfully picked up from the lowest level by more than one player, it is next placed on the floor. If there is still a tie after that, the tower is rebuilt and the remaining players continue as before, but standing on one foot. The winner is the last person left in the game.<br/><br/>",

Throughout the house will be four &quot;vaults&quot;, each of which has a face-down card.<br/><br/>The player's goals are to:<br/>- collect 4 cards of their desired type<br/>- determine who burgled from the vaults<br/>- determine who murdered other players<br/><br/>The first step in the game is that players stand in a circle and show two of their cards to the player on the right and the other two of their cards to the player on their left.<br/><br/>When the game begins, players can do several things to improve their hand:<br/>- They can trade cards with another player.<br/>- They can trade cards with a vault.  However, the first player to do so is considered to be burgling the vault.  Future trades with the vault are not considered burgling.<br/>- They can commit murder.  They need a weapon card and they need to get another player alone.  They whisper &quot;Bloody Murder&quot;, and place the weapon card in the victim's name badge.  The murderer may then look through the victim's cards and take one.  The victim lies &quot;dead&quot; until someone finds the body.  The person who finds the body may trade one card from the victim's hand, then the victim is alive to continue the game (with a hand of three cards and an exposed, used murder weapon).<br/><br/>After one hour, the players are brought together to discuss the evening.  Each of the burglaries and murders are discussed.  Murder victims lose points if the murderer is discovered, so it benefits them to keep quiet or to lie about the murder.  Players then records their accusations for the four murders and four burglaries.<br/><br/>Points are totaled as follows:<br/> - Each correct accusation: 10 points for the player, -10 points for the Murderer/Victim/Burglars involved.<br/> - Each clue card that matches the motive of the player: 50 points.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "A self-published game that shares components with Aras An Uachtaran, with both games being themed to Irish politics.<br/><br/>From a review by Stuart Dagger in Sumo Magazine:<br/><br/>This is a 4 hour game, with each player taking the part of one of the groupings in the Irish parliament. Play is split into 15 rounds, in each of which players campaign and fight elections. Seats won translate into victory points (necessary, because this is a game in which the parties are not of equal strength and so each has its own conversion rate), and at the end the player with the highest number of victory points wins. Each party has a percentage share of the vote. At the start these range from 44 for Fianna Fail down to 3 for the Independents, but these will fluctuate during the game as a result of electoral successes and failures and the campaigning attentions of one's opponents. Each 5 per cent, or part thereof, that you have at the start of a round entitles you either to draw a constituency card or to place a marker on the board. Owning a constituency card enables you to decide when the election will be called for the seat, and having a marker in the constituency is necessary if you are to take part when it is.<br/><br/>An election can not be called if a constituency contains fewer than 3 markers. Markers once played can be moved, and there is a limit to the number of markers that can be in a constituency at any one time (with a Civilization-style combat mechanism for removing any surplus). All of which makes for a lot of tactical jostling. When an election is called, players with markers in the constituency collect votes equal to 1d6 plus the number of their markers. An overall majority is needed for victory, and votes of less successful candidates are reallocated until this is achieved. Reallocation is done using a preference list mechanism, which again offers a lot of scope for tactical maneuver.<br/><br/>",

The hand is dealt normally, but a player places his &quot;partner's&quot; cards in a dummy rack that holds the cards at an angle so that he can see them sitting across the table while his opponent cannot. Bidding is normal except that the players can see all the cards in both their hands. The only other difference is that the declarer does not lay down his dummy's cards but shows them one at a time per trick: otherwise three entire hands would be exposed to the declarer's opponent (and thus make the game pointless).<br/><br/>The game is helpful for beginners trying to get a grasp of the bidding process, but also fun for experts who want to calculate their bids with full knowledge of two hands.<br/><br/>",

Players must optimize their route to visit six randomly-dealt places in the Ruhr-Area (&quot;Ruhrpott&quot; is a local slang word for &quot;Ruhrgebiet&quot;) in Germany.<br/><br/>In Ruhrpott Tour, all participants sit in the same car, and therefore they must constantly argue with all other players about which route to take. Each player has a set of destination cards which show the destinations he has to visit. Therefore it must be coordinated continuously whether to continue straight forward, to the left, right, or even backward. The first player with no more places to go wins.<br/><br/>The game has a dark map to represent nighttime, and a light map for daytime.<br/><br/>",

It uses the same board and playing pieces (to represent hounds and jackals), but with a changed rules set.<br/><br/>In the original game, players move their pieces based on the results of a randomizer (in modern days, a die is used), and their goal is to remove their pieces from the board by moving them to the final space on the track (above the tree).  In Hunde und Schakale, the movement of a piece depends on the positions of the other pieces on the board; a piece that moves next to an opponent's forces that opposing piece to be moved in the opponent's next turn.<br/><br/>The goal in the German interpretation is to force your opponent to move all his or her pieces to their final five spots at the end of their track, and thus winning you the game.<br/><br/>",

The box cover has a dramatic picture of the Japanese battleship Nagato slowly turning on its side and billowing smoke while US dive bombers fly overhead ala the USS Arizona. An eye-grabber indeed!<br/><br/>There are four maps in this game, making it the largest AT game size-wise. The maps stretch from Calgary, Canada to Tienching, China and from Attu in the Aleutian Islands to Tahiti in the Society Islands at a scale of 100km per hex. There are 756 counters, ranging from US and Japanese divisions to Chinese and Russian Corps. Even the Germans are represented by the 5th Light and 15th Panzer divisions! There are four PACs (two sets of two identical), some representing task force boxes and the others charts and tables (of which there are many). There is a 32-pg &lsquo;History&rsquo; booklet, along with a 40-pg rulebook.<br/><br/>The game itself has 26 pgs of actual rules and nine scenarios. Turns are ten days (three per month) and lasts from Dec. of 41 through August of 42. The game is decided by Victory Points, which are accrued by ownership of geographic objectives and multiplied by the current value for the turn (VPs x5 early on and going to only x1 starting about halfway through the game). Plane counters are of the &lsquo;change&rsquo; variety, while capital ships are individual and smaller vessels are grouped together.<br/><br/>This has apparently always been a popular title in Japan and commands quite a good price over there (20,000+ JPYN) for mint copies.<br/><br/>",

It features an accurate metal globe on a stand from the 1952 time period, and at the base of the globe, a spinner (that when spun, moves around the globe base until stopping at a number). A set of 4 metal planes are included to act as the markers in the game that race around the world on the globe itself.<br/><br/>The game is played by spinning the spinner and moving the number of miles indicated, being sure to land at a certain city of your choice that you feel gives you the best chance at getting across the globe first. There is fuel (and refueling) to manage, as well as event cards that come into play. The winner is the one that makes it across the globe (or a set distance) in the quickest amount of time.<br/><br/>The game consists, in addition to the globe, spinner base, and planes, paper event cards, tiny paper fuel pieces, and even the game box itself (resembles a normal brown shipping box) is labeled and considered part of the 'whole game'.<br/><br/>",

Strategies of conservative patience are pitted against those of high risk brinkmanship, as profits are realized through shrewd investment in the REAL WORLD, disciplined wagering at the TRACK, or natural luck in either sphere.  While players may choose to concentrate in one area, it is likely that they will test their skills and develop personal strategies for success both in REAL LIFE and at the TRACK.  However, certain compulsions, combined with the defensive play of others, may continually threaten even the best laid plans.<br/><br/>",

Over 100 T-62 and T-55 tanks faced a paltry 20 IDF Centurion tanks, many short of ammunition. It was David vs. Goliath in modern day terms. The only thing the IDF had going for it was the 12 foot deep anti-tank ditch and the three tiered ramp positions for the tanks. The Valley of Tears remains perfect tank country, flat with long range of fire. To add to the confusion, the IDF patch quilt of forces all operated on different radio frequencies making any coordination impossible. For the Syrian, the AT ditch, which stretched out along the front was also littered with mines. Crossing it under fire would prove to be daunting using the mobile bridge laying equipment. Of course, they has Sagger AT missiles, greatly outnumbered the IDF and air support.<br/><br/>Game scale is 200 yds a hex, individual tanks, 20 minute turns, squads of infantry. Over 300+ counters and color 11x17&quot; map. Rules cover Saggers, Artillery, Aircraft, Ammo limits, Forward Observers, extensive use of commands, mines, bridgelayers and more.<br/><br/>",

Matched values are removed and remaining values are scored as hits (minus the value of the 4 sided die.)

        "description": "A magazine game from Jeux et StratÃ©gie #55.<br/><br/>It is 3046. Players build up two Mad-Max-type small naval fleets and fight it out.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a fleet of seven ships: one flagship, one battleship, one frigate, two battlecruisers, and two escorts. The five ship types each have specific speeds, armor, weapons, maneuverability and staff morale.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players spend money to improve fleet equipment and staff. A pilot commands each ship and each pilot is given points to  split between Tactics and Leadership attributes. These characteristics are used to modify dice rolls during combat. A more skillful Admiral commands the flagship.<br/><br/>Each turn is played in one real-time minute. Ship speeds correspond to the physical number of centimeters a ship can move on the table during a turn. Combat is resolved after every ship movement. Depending on ship positions, players can shoot projectiles, ram or board other ships. The success of an attack and the degree of damage are determined by modified dice rolls. Ships sink if their armor score falls below 0 and players overtake ships if there is no more staff on board.<br/><br/>The game ends when one Admiral is captured or dies.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to be the first to reach the end of the path.  On his turn, a player moves the number of spaces he spun on the spinner.  If he ends his move on a space with a face-down animal tile, he guesses what kind of animal is shown on the other side of the tile.  He then turns it over to see if his guess was correct.  If so, he gets to take another turn.  Some spaces show the silhouette of an animal.  If a player ends his move on one of these spaces, he can move ahead one extra space if he can correctly identify the animal shown in the silhouette.<br/><br/>",
