        "description": "Windborne is a connection game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (cells) of an initially empty hexagonal grid of hexagons (board).<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if there are less than three pawns on the board, place a disk of your color on an empty cell and a neutral pawn on an empty cell or onto a friendly disk that does not yet have a pawn on it. Otherwise, follow these steps:<br/><br/><br/>     Move a pawn zero or more times onto adjacent cells in the same direction. Each of those cells must be empty or occupied by a friendly disk only. (You cannot move onto cells occupied by pawns or enemy disks, but an enemy disk on the pawn's starting cell does not impede its movement.)<br/>     Place a disk of your color on a cell that does not yet contain a disk. If the cell contains a pawn, place your disk under it.<br/><br/><br/>You win if, at the start of your turn, there is a group of interconnected disks of your color such that any path that connects more than half of the pawns (i.e. at least two) visits that group. A path need not be a straight line, and may go through any cells regardless of their contents. You lose if, at the start of your turn, your opponent has such a group and you cannot place a disk.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesAs an alternative, a different number of pawns can be used. A small odd number of pawns is recommended. Even numbers may result in connection races. The optimal number might be directly proportional to the size of the board.<br/><br/>Windborne is Omny with moving targets. In Windborne, a player with a massive group running through the center may still lose if, for example, two pawns end up trapped on top of adjacent enemy stones away from the center. This is less likely in Omny. Note that pawns are most easily trapped in the corners of the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prior to his passing, Richard H. Berg was hard at work completing the third volume in his The Ancient World series, Thunderbolt, covering the titanic 2nd Punic War between Rome and Carthage. Mark Herman has teamed up with series developer Alan Ray to finish the game.<br/> Thunderbolt brings The Ancient World system to the mammoth 2nd Punic War. The game covers the action in the Western Mediterranean on updated Italy and Africa maps published in the prior two volumes, plus a connecting full-size map of Spain and western Mauretania, the last map design of Richard&rsquo;s long and illustrious career.<br/> The Ancient World system uses a chit pull mechanic to drive the action with the better leaders having more opportunities to act. There are no movement allowances; instead attrition and the ability of a leader to continue to conduct operations govern how forces can move. Battles are straightforward, resolved with a couple of die rolls and an extensive list of modifiers to account for cavalry superiority, elite status, and leadership, as well as numbers of troops. The Battle Results Table features an &ldquo;Unpredictable Result&rdquo; which can turn the tables on the best laid battle plan. All the trappings around the decisive moment are there as well: Interception, Avoidance, Coordination, Retreat, Pursuit &amp; Butchery, and after battle effects. Sieges are covered in detail, including rules for attrition, assaults, repair and reduction, treachery, and surrender. And what would a Richard Berg game be without random events&mdash;Auguries in this system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is evidenced not only by the ability to lift 50 times its body weight or the presence of the largest brain among other insects, but also by a high level of social communication and self-organization. Thanks to this, insects build anthills of extraordinary complexity, strengthen their power over territories and ecosystems, and during wars with other colonies use sophisticated military tricks that real generals would appreciate.<br/><br/>Players are invited to plunge into the interesting world of ant life and take over the management of an ant colony - build an anthill, organize the collection and extraction of resources, provide an army to protect and spread their influence. Victory will be achieved by striking a balance between the economy and the military, cunning, good tactics and unexpected decisions.<br/><br/>A distinctive feature of the game is the maximum of communication and interaction, dynamism and speed of the games. Each new turn the player gets new opportunities and can play a unique combination of moves and cards that radically affect the course of the entire game.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is victory! The game offers 4 different scenarios. Depending on the choice, players have to fulfill the appropriate conditions for victory: building all levels of the anthill faster than others, capturing the enemy's colony or destroying his anthill.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In a magic contest, you have to roll the dice for the ingredients for all the required potions. Whoever brews the best potions will win the game.<br/><br/>The player whose turn it is takes the 5 colored dice and rolls them up to four times. He may put any dice aside to brew a potion with as many ingredients as possible of one color or a given combination. An extra die, extra rolls or the restart of the turn can be conjured up with spellpower. Spellpower is gained when it takes less than 4 throws to brew a potion. The fewer throws you need, the more spellpower you get. You can also get spellpower in any player's turn if the player rolls at least 3 of the same ingredients in his roll and you are the first to notice this.<br/><br/>Once a player has brewed each of the required potions, the game is over. For each potion that is not brewed, the player gets minus points. The more ingredients a player has used to brew his own potions, the more points he gets.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By August 1905 the Russo-Japanese War had been raging for 18 months, with over a million soldiers, sailors, and engineers in arms,  it had cost the lives of between 100,000 to 200,000 participants and brought death and destruction to civilians. The war had seen the sinking of the Russian Pacific and Baltic fleets, and the great sieges at Port Arthur and Mukden. The world was shaken by the emphatic rise of Imperial Japan as a land and naval power. Russia had been blooded and humiliated.<br/><br/>But Russia was not yet done. Although both sides were financially exhausted it was Russia who continued to funnel troops into the war, while Japan&rsquo;s manpower reserves were depleted. The war might yet continue, with further loss of life and property, and protracted instability in the Far East. With this would come the risk of further Russian humiliation. Both sides needed a way out. The door to that way out was opened by US President Theodore Roosevelt when he invited delegations of both sides to Portsmouth, New Hampshire - to a peace conference through August 1905. But with the sides so far apart on numerous key issues - the Russian Czar had stipulated no territorial concessions or reparation payments, and the Japanese Emperor wanted exactly those things and much more - what real hope was there that both sides could find a mutually satisfactory resolution?<br/><br/>In history, the answer is found in the Treaty of Portsmouth, a complex and significant diplomatic achievement, for which, for his part in facilitating and assisting, President Roosevelt was the first American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. In Peace 1905, you - the players - will have Roosevelt&rsquo;s assistance, but the work of successfully negotiating is down to you. Will you end the war, and bring a peace your governments approve of, or will the conference end in failure, and the war ignite again?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "No two conflicts show the breath and scope of urban warfare the Western Allies ran up against in 1944 than the battles for Aachen and Cassino.  Both campaigns tell a very similar story about the high price of hubris and the quality of courage.  Cities of the Damned (published in ATO #60 magazine) features two challenging solitaire games in which the player must lead his Allied forces to victory in two of the WWII&rsquo;s most intense battles.<br/><br/>Cassino by Paul Rohrbaugh:  In early 1944 the western half of the German &ldquo;Winter Line&rdquo; in Italy was anchored by the town of Cassino high up on Monte Cassino, which also featured a centuries old Benedictine Abbey atop the peak.  The position utterly dominated the surrounding valleys, so much so Allied troops HAD to take it to continue advancing on Rome.<br/><br/>Facing some of Germany&rsquo;s best soldiers, the area was only captured 5 months later after four separate assaults, with the vast majority of the city was destroyed by aerial bombardment and vicious street to street fighting.  Taking the town and heights resulted in 55,000 Allied casualties, with German losses being far fewer, estimated at around 20,000 killed and wounded.  The stubborn defense of Cassino would reveal flaws in Allied tactics and bolster the confidence of the Third Reich to keep fighting.<br/><br/>Aachen by Mike Rinella: Five months later the world would see yet another account of the terrible cost of audacity.  Fresh from a string of victories across the length of France, the US Command set its sights capture of the supposedly weakly held German city of Aachen.  The Americans confidently made plans to surround the city, isolate it, and accept its surrender.<br/><br/>But being the former capital of the First Reich, and the first true German city to fall into Allied hands, the city&rsquo;s propaganda value was simply too great: Hitler forbade surrender.  He even grudgingly authorized releasing forces from his Ardennes Offensive build up to help the defenders. American troops would have to storm the city and take it by force.  Hidden among the picturesque buildings was a fortress of bunkers, gun emplacements, sniper holes and death traps. The GIs advancing into the city would soon be fighting in the nightmare battlefield of Aachen.<br/><br/>The Aachen game uses the popular solitaire system designed by Mike Rinella for the game &quot;Stalingrad: Advance on the Volga, 1942&quot; (Take Aim Designs / Revolution Games).<br/><br/>Contents<br/>Against the Odds (ATO) magazine #60; <br/>Maps - Two full color 17&quot; x 22&quot; mapsheets;<br/>Counters - 176 large 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces;<br/>Rules length - 14 pages;<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages.<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, the vicious alien Dirdir stalk the landscape, hunting the humans tooth and claw. The more ground a crew covers, the more they attract deadly alien attention.<br/><br/>Move your crews across the colorful map, draw Sequin gems from the cloth bag, and roll special three-sided dice to find out how close the hunters come to you -- or perhaps you can lure them to attack a rival crew along the way.<br/><br/>Beware the Excellences, keenest hunters of all, and the eventual wave of aircars that will shut the whole terrain down!

Before the game starts, the Game Master sets the combination to open the padlock, and chooses the puzzle for each wheel to give the correct answer.

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>A crosscut is a 2&times;2 area containing two diagonally adjacent black stones and two diagonally adjacent white stones.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point. If this stone is part of a crosscut, swap it with an enemy stone that is part of the same crosscut. As a result, the swapped friendly stone must not be part of a crosscut any more. If the swapped enemy stone is still part of a crosscut, remove that stone.<br/><br/>Passing is not allowed, but, if you have no legal moves available, your turn is skipped.<br/><br/>You win if, after a full move by either player, there is a chain of orthogonally connected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>Reneo bears a significant resemblance to Alek Erickson's Resolve.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They are designed to be easy to learn and to play and are ideal for a quick game. They are ideal for players who are not very familiar with wargames rules or who don&rsquo;t have hours to play with. Sometimes this type of ruleset is called a &ldquo;beer and pretzels&rdquo; game. Neither beer nor pretzels are required to play, but a game is always more enjoyable with good refreshments.<br/><br/>The rules aim to be representative of how medieval armies fought but aren&rsquo;t an exact simulation. They don&rsquo;t provide for all the different variations in types of soldiers and armies during the Medieval period. For instance, there is an Archers unit that can represent crossbowmen or longbowmen. The rules provide the framework for an enjoyable Medieval wargame that captures the feel of battles in the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>The rules include six scenarios and some sample army lists to help you get started.<br/><br/>",

In a solo game, you control two agents of the Lord. If both are destroyed before you can vanquish your foes, you lose. The primary mechanism of Tribulation is tactical combat via card play and action management. You move your character through 3 zones, play cards from your hand to resolve actions, and rest to regain action points, cards and health at strategic intervals.

It includes statistics for many frontline fighters that saw action during the Korean War and a pilot advancement system for campaign games.<br/><br/>MiG Alley is a standalone rules set. The unique period of early jet fighters and reliance on guns over missiles sets this title apart from other games in the Fly Fight Win series. This series is designed for playability but retains sufficient detail to recreate historical outcomes (with a nod towards the physics of flight).

In order to collect points, you will move around the world and perform specific actions. Cards will allow you to move over land taking a bus, car or train. Flight tickets let you travel faster using connected airports. Reaching a required secret or public destination earns you points and lets you leave your flag there. Every time another player is reaching or crossing a destination with your flag on it, this will earn you additional points. Now isn&rsquo;t that nice? Being the first to visit a desired spot is not the only option to score points: For each continent traveled you will get your passport stamped. A passport page full with stamps gets you extra points. And don&rsquo;t forget to pass by the Betting Office every now and then: Try your luck and place bets on the outcome of a match, the number of goals, or even the exact final score. Correct bets also get you extra points. But beware: Sudden events might throw off your plans and force you to reschedule your route.<br/><br/>So, plan your trip wisely, collect tickets and points, and be the first Groundhopper to reach 100 points and win this exciting journey around the world!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood of Ancients is a tabletop miniature wargame for armies of antiquity. <br/>The game is d10 based with virtually no references to charts to make for a game that plays quickly with rules that are easy to learn. There are a few key concepts which are different from other systems. The contested ground and charge rules are designed to illustrate the push and shove of battles in antiquity. It was a time when armies charged at each other, clashing with only a few casualties. But each charge is a test of mettle and discipline until one side breaks and runs, whence the real slaughter begins.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is charge and maneuver. Don&rsquo;t let an opponent on your flanks! But charge his flank mercilessly when you can. Your cavalry can be a powerful offensive weapon, but shaky in defense. Your troops will last longer in combat when massed together, but ranged weapons are most effective when fired at massed troops, so you&rsquo;ll need skirmishers in your army as well.<br/><br/>Your commander will play a part as well. His army will function best when troops are within his command. Troops which are out of command are unreliable, but your leader can inspire troops under his command to move, defend or attack with greater determination. The leader&rsquo;s timely actions may save the day on a key hill or important flank.<br/><br/>This game doesn&rsquo;t require either a specific scale of miniatures or a particular playing surface. You are encouraged to use what you have on hand. Whether you use stands of 15mm, 10mm, or 6mm figures or individually based 20mm or 28mm figures makes no difference. One stand of 15mm figures or 1 individually based 28mm figure still equals 40 to 50 combatants.<br/><br/>We prefer to use a hex grid (less arguments) on our table surface. Our hex grids are big enough to contain a unit. A unit is composed of 4 to 12 bases or stands of figures. If you don&rsquo;t have or like hexes, we&rsquo;ll tell you how to easily convert this to free form measurements.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fourteen Days in June: the Waterloo Campaign is a two-player wargame played on a hex-grid superimposed upon a map depicting north east France and (what is now) southern Belgium. The game focuses upon the struggle in June 1815 between the French army under Napoleon Bonaparte and the Allied armies led by the Duke of Wellington and von Bl&uuml;cher. The game portrays entire campaign. By doing so, and by means of innovations such as the &ldquo;initial order system&rdquo;, the game reflects the range of strategic options available to each side. For example, the French can decide where and when to strike; whilst the Allies can chose to gamble by second-guessing the French line(s) of attack and marshalling their forces to meet this or, as Bl&uuml;cher and Wellington did historically, adopt a more cautious approach and allocate sufficient force to each likely invasion route along the Franco-Belgium border to delay Napoleon for long enough for reinforcements to arrive. <br/>This uncertainty or &ldquo;fog-of-war&rdquo; which played such a crucial role in campaigns of the period is simulated further by a mechanic allowing players to conceal the strength of their various forces unless and until combat takes place. Even then, it is possible that not all the units in a force will be disclosed. This doubt as to the enemy&rsquo;s  intentions and strength chimes with historical records of discussions about strategy at the headquarters of each side during the campaign. Many of these discussions were concerned with the more mundane &ndash; but, no less crucial - aspects of warfare such as planning routes of march. Such issues, too, are reflected in the game. For instance, Route Blocked Markers are used to reflect the fact that a full corps marching along a minor road would be spread out over several miles. Other friendly units are unable to move through not just the hex occupied by the force counter; but, also &ldquo;preceding&rdquo; hexes through which its rearmost elements are still marching. So, when issuing orders for units to concentrate in a specific area, or planning a combined attack, players need to ensure that two (or more) forces do not trip over each other by attempting to occupy the same road-space at the same time. Other realities of warfare before the advent of aeroplanes and radio are also simulated. For instance, the game incorporates simple mechanisms to reflect the risk of forces losing their way if they leave the principal road network and attempt to march across country; and, the delay between a supreme commander issuing an order and it being received and implemented by a junior officer in command of a force maybe 10 miles distant at a time when such communications were carried by horse.<br/><br/>So, will the Emperor rewrite History by defeating Wellington and Blucher before hoisting the French tricolour over Brussels; or, will the Allies prevail once again, leaving Napoleon to rue what might have been? The decision is yours.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This angered the British government, but Ireland had not participated in the Commonwealth of Nations since 1932.<br/><br/>Ireland was not invaded during the Second World War, but both Britain and Germany made plans to do so. Ireland eventually mobilized two divisions and two brigades, deployed along the border with Northern Ireland to resist a British invasion and along the island&rsquo;s southern coast to fight off an attack by Britain or Germany. The Irish Army - Na Forsai Cosanta - eventually reached a strength of 38,000 and saw no action during World War II, though tens of thousands of Irish men and women volunteered to fight the Nazis in the British armed forces.<br/><br/>Fighting Irish is an expansion for Panzer Grenadier: Invasion that lets you send the Irish into battle anyway, in a small set of scenarios depicting a German airborne assault on the Emerald Isle. <br/>The Irish are tough, but they&rsquo;re not very well-armed.

        "description": "Firefight Tactical is an innovative dice-driven tactical WW2 wargame at the squad level. Quick to play and learn, this compact game follows American forces through 12 scenarios in the weeks after the D-Day landings. The scenarios gradually introduce game features as you progress. Starting with small infantry engagements on tight maps, players will work their way to larger scenarios with multiple phases, artillery, and tank-on-tank action.<br/> The scenarios follow American forces from early skirmishes of the Normandy invasion at St. Mere Eglise and Carentan through to St. Lo and Operation Cobra and conclude with Operation Market Garden. The battlefields will vary from desperate battles over a &ldquo;no man&rsquo;s land&rdquo; devoid of cover like Bloody Gulch to claustrophobic urban battles like Cherbourg. Each scenario can be played 2-player against a human opponent or against a customizable solitaire automa.<br/><br/>The Firefight Tactical system was designed to be quick to play and easy to learn, whilst being packed with tactical decision-making. Its compact size also enables play on relatively small playing surfaces, making it an ideal game to travel with. The core infantry rules are straightforward and can be learned from ~10 pages, including many examples and a glossary of actions.<br/> As a result of the dice and random battle maps, the game has intensely high replayability, even within a single scenario, so players will get tons of enjoyment from the &quot;basic&quot; game. Once you are ready for more, though, you can start adding more rules, covering support weapons, weather, armor, and so forth in the heavier scenarios. Firefight Tactical is the perfect game for those looking for a lot of tactical depth and replayability with a small footprint.<br/><br/>",

For years, you&rsquo;ve imagined what such an event would be like in person, but you have never been rich nor important enough to receive an invitation.  Yet, all of that changes when the hostess of the party, Cynthia Grimm, hires you to uncover the identity of a blackmailer who calls themselves the Pied Piper. The Pied Piper has threatened to reveal family secrets that would destroy Miss Grimm if their demands aren&rsquo;t met. These secrets have the potential to harm not only Miss Grimm but all of the charities she is a part of. Your client believes the Piper will be at the ball and has given you open access to the guests in attendance. This time you have no intention of paying the Piper. Instead, you plan to beat them at their own game!  So, grab a costume, investigate all of the fairy tale characters that have shown up for the evening, and see if you can solve the Mystery at the Fairytale Ball.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CAN YOU WEATHER THE ARROWSTORM?<br/><br/>In this gridded-layout miniature wargame, you take the role of a medieval king, bishop, lord, or commander leading your army on the battlefield. You must choose where and how to focus your troops' actions and control the battle&rsquo;s impetus. The battle is partly fought on the tabletop like other miniature wargames but is also fought just as hard on the Tactics Chart, providing an additional mind-game against your opponent.<br/><br/>Command your units to move and fight in the areas of the battlefield you wish, but leave the actual process of fighting to your unit commanders. This is represented by the random factor of dice and each of your units&rsquo; abstract but often-decreasing Battle Rating. Because of this, your focus is kept where it should be &ndash; out-thinking your opponent by using superior tactics and exploiting their weaknesses on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Arrowstorm is not intended as a heavy simulation of medieval warfare but as an enjoyable, simple, and fast-playing battle game. You&rsquo;ll find that much of the action is stylized and streamlined. Don&rsquo;t think of &ldquo;turns&rdquo; in the usual wargaming way &ndash; in each turn your units may fight or move several times, countered by your opponent after every action, creating a very fluid game but at the same time making cohesive planning difficult to achieve.<br/><br/>Please note that Arrowstorm shares the same basic rules with my Age of Penda book. Period-specific troop types, army lists, special rules, and minor rules differences exist.<br/><br/>THE &lsquo;YOU COMMAND&rsquo; SERIES<br/>&lsquo;You Command&rsquo; is a series of light miniature wargames by Origins Award winner Daniel Mersey (Lion Rampant, Dragon Rampant, Battle Ravens, and many more games). When you play a &lsquo;You Command&rsquo; game, your goal is to defeat your opponent by out-thinking them tactically using the innovative Tactics Chart, and then by out-fighting their model army on the tabletop battlefield.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A powerful and haughty Blood Bowl team that brings their own snacks to the pitch.<br/><br/>Noble Vampires often partake in games of Blood Bowl alongside their human Thralls to showcase their immortal superiority and indulge in a little bloodlust. Due to their wealthy status, these Nobles are adorned in the highest quality gear. Meanwhile, their Thralls are dishevelled and diminutive, wearing little more than basic equipment and blouses &ndash; and their gaunt and malnourished appearances may or may not have something to do with Thralls becoming a mid-match snack for the Vampires when they get thirsty.<br/><br/>Vampires who choose to play Blood Bowl among the underclasses are undeniably powerful, however, their teams can become undone when they occasionally give in to their Bloodlust and feed off their Thralls mid-game! But, if they can keep their hunger in check, their speed and strength make them a match for any other team out on the astrogranite.<br/><br/>This multipart kit allows you to assemble The Drakfang Thirsters, a Vampire team for use in games of Blood Bowl. The team comprises eight Thrall Linemen, two Vampire Runners, two Vampire Blitzers, and two Vampire Throwers. You'll find alternate heads for each of your Vampire players, and an alternate arm for your Thrower, to help customise your team. In addition, there are two double-sided Blood Bowl coins, two turn and re-roll markers, four balls, and a transfer sheet.<br/><br/>Rules for using Vampire teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Spike! Journal 16, which is sold separately.<br/><br/>",

There are 4 action categories:<br/><br/><br/>     Play a pair of the same coloured cards to CAPTURE an available stone (on the board)<br/>     Play 3 of the same coloured cards to attempt to CAPTURE that coloured stone from another player<br/>     Play a pair of GAUNTLET cards to CAPTURE up to 2 available stones <br/>     Play a VILLAIN card on another player.  All 6 Villains have a different impact and can be defended by a different HERO.<br/><br/><br/>Once players have completed their actions they can then choose to discard additional cards, drawing back up 8 cards to finish their turn.  But watch out for rare CHILDREN OF THANOS cards when replenishing!  If players pick up one of these, they must immediately spin the game board and observe the impact- which could result in placing a stone back on the board!<br/><br/>Capture features basic set collection mechanics, many risk-reward trade offs, a slight vindictive edge and has received plentiful positive feedback in our 4 years of playtesting with the Australian gaming community!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Set types include families, social events (based on possessions), generation sets, duos, and murder mysteries.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round has 4-5 stages:<br/><br/>     Each player gets 2 character cards from the deck.<br/>     The game master auctions two character cards and one action card.<br/>     Players have 2 minutes to negotiate and exchange cards.<br/>     At the end of each round, players can use one of their action cards.<br/>     At the beginning of every other round, the game master reveals one announcement card and ask the players to carry out its instructions.<br/><br/><br/>Players use the companion app to add/remove character cards, search/filter for cards they may need, see their completed sets and missing cards from other sets, bid auction amounts and keep track of their digital money, and see updated victory points.

It had more tanks than any of the Regular Army panzer divisions, plus additional weapons from machine guns to Tiger heavy tanks, and additional assault guns and other battalions. Add to that enormous combat experience and unit cohesion (thanks to special perks for Grossdeutschland soldiers &ndash; who, for example, could not be sent to a different unit after a hospital stay, or seized by military police to join an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; unit). On top of all that, the 200 Panther tanks provided for the Kursk operation all went to this one division.<br/><br/>Grossdeutschland at Kursk is a Panzer Grenadier Campaign Study, with 11 new scenarios based on the actions of the German Grossdeutschland Division during the Kursk campaign. There are two chapters, each with a battle game to link the scenarios together.

You are in command of the catapult tender ship &quot;Bussard&quot; (German; &quot;Buzzard&quot;) and her three BV-138 float planes. Your tasks involve, but are not limited to: <br/><br/>     sea rescue<br/>     reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance<br/>     troop transport and evacuation<br/>     mine searching and laying<br/>     bombing runs<br/>     submarine hunting<br/><br/><br/>The game is played on a hex map with each hex representing 200km. Each round, representing roughly an hour, you will move your aircraft around the map in search for radio signals or other suspicious hints to find your objective of the day.<br/><br/>But don't take these tasks easy. Enemy long range reconnaissance aircraft, escort vessels, and bad weather will show you that this work above the hostile arctic ocean is only for the most foolhardy or foolish men.<br/><br/>If you encounter enemy forces, the game will require you to make a check to evade enemy fire. After that it is on you to decide to either counter attack, or get the hell off. Every time you fail to evade, a random system on your aircraft will be damaged, and after a second hit be destroyed. This includes your precious equipment, like radar, radio, and bomb guidance systems, added weaponry, and any passengers you picked up on your sortie.<br/><br/>This game can either be played in single scenarios, as a historically linked campaign, or a randomly linked campaign. Campaigns offer a ascending difficulty, as well as upgrades for your vehicles and crewmen.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The setting for the game: SunFire: Factions Against Fate is set in a vibrant medieval world powered by mana. Throughout the world there are a subset of people who can harness the power of mana in fantastical ways. These people have organized themselves into powerful factions that operate in cities across the continent. The game is set in one such city - Solamar - where six factions existed peacefully, until recently. The survival of Solamar has been challenged by an existential threat, the SunFire. Appearing without warning, the SunFire is a powerful beam of energy from the heavens that strikes down at Solamar and areas surrounding the city, leaving a scorched wasteland in its wake. The populace turned to the factions and their ability to manipulate mana for salvation. Initially, the factions worked collaboratively, designing a powerful arcane device to create a temporary magical shield over Solamar, protecting it from the SunFire. Ozonestones, glowing rocks mysteriously left in the wake of the SunFire, are consumed to fuel the device. Now, amidst increasingly urgent pleas from the people of Solamar to continue to fuel the device, tensions among the factions have been stoked. Their collaboration has turned to rivalry as each Faction believes they are the key to the city's salvation. Factions vie for the support of the people, while keeping Solamar protected from the SunFire.<br/><br/>The gameplay: Each player chooses a faction to lead and must ensure that the city is protected by the SunFire while earning the admiration of the people of the city. Players must guide scouts outside of the city to collect ozonestones and utilize them as currency to recruit new followers, build settlements, and construct buildings. Ultimately, each player seeks to accumulate 13 or more Control Points, which represent their influence over the population, to win the game. Each game is played in a series of rounds made up of five phases: exploration - explore outside of the city and collect ozonestones, donation - determine how many resources will be donated to defense of the city versus kept to enrich the faction, construction - what how new followers and structures to purchase, SunFire - feel the wrath of the SunFire and determine if the city is protected, and rewards - actions are rewarded with additional Control Points.<br/><br/>Players must devote ozonestones to both the competitive - enriching their faction - and cooperative - protecting the city - aspects of the game. Too much devotion to the city and the other greedier players will accumulate Control points quicker, too much greed and the citizens of the city will punish the player's faction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In order to breathe new life, a new game that casts the traditional version in a new light, evoking the rich fauna and flora of the Ardennes, has been designed.<br/><br/>The game components are 32 playing cards, 1 memo card and 16 tokens. The cards have a strength level (from 1 to 13) and they carry some points (from 0 to 4). Cards 9 to 13 are named the triyonfes and are unique : Mite (red), Co&ucirc;ne (blue), Can&egrave;te (green), Mac Mahon (black) and Z&egrave; (red). <br/><br/>The aim of the game is to be the first team to get rid of all their tokens (starting with 3, 4 or 5, depending on the desired length of the game) after playing several rounds.<br/><br/>A round is composed of dealing the cards, announcing the color of the m&egrave;n&rsquo;che (trump card), announcing who has the triyonfes in their hands, playing the tricks and counting the points of each team at the end of the round. Depending on which teams announced the color of the m&egrave;n&rsquo;che, the wining team discards a token or give it to the opposite team.<br/><br/>The game is made for 4 players but variants for 2 or 3 players are also explained in the rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great War has been going on for nearly two years, and the Western Front has become a series of fruitless attacks and counterattacks. Germany must control the air to break the stalemate and win the war. The army turns to the aeroplane manufacturers to build the best planes to drive the Allies from the sky. Wings for the Baron gives you control of one of six companies, competing for lucrative contracts and the prestige of producing the best designs. Can you steer your business to produce the best fighters, bombers, and/or reconnaissance planes? Can you manage rising inflation, outwit your opponents through subterfuge and espionage, and lead your company to success?<br/><br/>Wings for the Baron is a 1 to 6 player game of economic and technological development in the German aeroplane industry during World War 1. The Standard Game focuses on German fighter development, and the Advanced Game adds development of bombers and recon planes. Experienced players can play the Standard Game in about 45 minutes and the Advanced Game in about an hour, making Wings for the Baron perfect for repeat play. The Deluxe GMT Edition adds to the gameplay of this beloved game by adding components and rules for a new sixth company (Siemens-Schuckert), as well as all-new art by artist Tim Allen and deluxe components.<br/><br/>The Standard Game of Wings for the Baron revolves around each company&rsquo;s fighter efficiency as compared with the other German companies. The company with the most efficient fighters attempts to claim contracts first, while companies with less efficient fighters act later in the turn. If all the contracts are awarded and some companies have not rolled yet, they have to wait until the next turn (Hint&hellip;they need to improve the efficiency of their fighter so they roll earlier in the phase!). Companies earn money by using their factories to fulfill contracts. Each fulfilled contract earns a million papiermarks.<br/><br/>Wings&rsquo; Advanced Game adds two aeroplane types (recon and bombers), multiplying players&rsquo; choices. Recon and bombers enable the company to earn even more papiermarks (assuming they have factories that were not building fighters). Recon and bomber contracts, unlike fighter contracts, are unlimited&mdash;you can build all three types to earn papiermarks!<br/><br/>Each turn, a company has five actions they can perform: Build additional factories, conduct Espionage to learn the technologies from another company, increase your plane&rsquo;s efficiency with new Design technology, conduct Research to find new technologies, or take your papiermarks to a neutral country and convert to gold by performing a Bank action. But there&rsquo;s a catch: you can only perform a limited number of actions each turn! You will have to carefully combine these actions with your chosen Events, which can impact rival companies or benefit your own. Events range from obtaining a Talented Engineer for your company (which helps your Design rolls) to improving one of your designs by using technology obtained from captured Allied aeroplanes.<br/><br/>As the war rages on, the specter of Inflation lingers every turn. Inflation is unpredictable, and you may lose none, 25%, or 50% of your papiermarks every turn! Savvy owners will know when to use their actions to convert their papiermarks to Gold and when to risk Inflation. Inflation never causes you to lose your carefully stashed Gold! Additionally, the effects of the war are felt through the resolution of a War Status card which impacts Allied and German Morale, available contracts, and Allied plane technologies.<br/><br/>The game ends when one or both sides&rsquo; morale markers reach zero or when Inflation reaches Hyper-Inflation. Each company then determines their total wealth (papiermarks, Gold, plus such markers they got during play). The company with the most money is the winner!<br/><br/>Wings for the Baron also includes solitaire and 2-player variants designed by Ken Keller which lets you (and a friend) pit yourself against two (or three or four!) other Non-Player Companies (NPCs) in the Advanced Game. This solitaire variant is a tremendous challenge and uses simple procedures to run the NPCs. No flowcharts or complicated procedures necessary!<br/><br/>Components:<br/>    One Rulebook<br/>    One Playbook<br/>    126 Cards<br/>    Six Double-sided Player Boards<br/>    One Mounted Double-sided Game Track<br/>    Three Countersheets<br/>    Eight Dice<br/>    Six Wooden Cubes<br/>    One Solo Player Aid<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players control a university with a bunch of professors and PhD's, vying for positions and publishing the most prestigious articles before their opponents to win.<br/><br/>Each players use action cards to play their 6 persons on the same 3 action spaces, Education (giving money), Socializing (giving more action cards), and Research (giving &quot;writing time&quot;, used to publish articles which score victory points). All persons are played in stacks, and most of the actions cards revolves around placing and manipulating positions on these stacks. All resource gains are dependent on how many and which persons are on a certain action space. You will always give your opponents some resources, and enabling their future turns, so the main challenge of the game is to navigate this with strategy and timing.<br/><br/>Some small examples of the satirical part of the theme:<br/>Among the cards to play are &quot;defamation campaign&quot;, &quot;Sauna with the head of department&quot; or &quot;new coffee machine&quot;.<br/>Among articles to write are &quot;article about the pointlessness of everything&quot;, &quot;incomprehensible article that seems intelligent&quot;, or &quot;AI-generated article&quot;.<br/><br/>The game plays until someone has published a fixed number of articles (decided before start of play, allowing for different lengths of the game).

After years of wandering and losing people, we found a small, defensible spot on the outskirts of a city. We are starting to settle, fortify, and rebuild. Each week, the vicious mobs come to take what little we have left. But we will not go gentle into that good night. We will rage against the dying of the light.<br/><br/>Do Not Go Gentle is a solitaire post-apocalyptic game of worker placement, base building, hand management, scavenging, and survival.<br/><br/>The game is played over six rounds. Your goal is to survive with at least one building left standing and one worker left alive at the end of six rounds. The game is played on a 9 x 9 map. You start the game with three basic building tiles: a basic farm, basic workshop, and basic weapons shop. Each round, you place survivors on building tiles to produce benefits to your compound (food, barricades, weapons, meds, and repairs ). At the end of each round, a vicious mob of marauders will attack the compound. You must strategically place your barricades, assign your survivors, and distribute your weapons to protect and defend against the ravenous marauders. Can you survive six rounds of increasingly more devastating attacks?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Divine Harem is a 2-4+ player strategic card game for lustful people, full of sexy anime girls, just waiting to join your harem. It's simple to pick up and play and yet strategic enough to ensure multiple interesting games between friends.<br/><br/>The goal of the Divine Harem game is to build a complete Harem Pyramid, which is made up of three Harem Girls, two Harem Toys and one Harem Pet. The first player to complete their pyramid wins the game.<br/><br/>During a turn, players can perform 2 actions of the following:<br/><br/>     Draw a Card from the Deck<br/>     Place a Card in your Harem<br/>     Play a Harem Power Card<br/><br/><br/>(players can perform two different actions or two actions the same, as they see fit. E.g. playing two power cards)<br/>Beware: When you place a card into your Harem, other players can attack your card, with cards from their own hand to try and prevent you from placing it into your Harem.<br/><br/>",

However, the whale (Plush game case) swims around hot potato style with a hungry appetite. The whale targets players and occasionally eats them (the cards not the players)!<br/><br/>On your turn draft one card from the Ocean Market. Cards have simple set collection scoring or actions. The card that you draft also determines what the whale will do next! Do you choose the best scoring card but risk a whale encounter? Or do you target the player in the lead while settling for a less valuable card?<br/><br/>While the game lets you target other players it does not feel like &quot;take that&quot;. If the whale eats one of your cards you get some Kelp as compensation. The most Kelp scores big as well! Example cards include Shellfish, Krilling Spree, and Dressed to Krill.<br/><br/>Players always end their turn by flipping a whale card. These include common &quot;whale stuff&quot; like logging (sleeping), swimming around, and eating a target player's cards. The game ends when the last Krilling Time card is revealed located in the bottom 5 cards.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Help your people grow and expand, and send your pioneers to as many territories as possible.<br/><br/>2. Tributes<br/>The competition among your different peoples for resources and power steadily increases, so ask your gods for their help. Whose achievements will find a place in history?<br/><br/>3. Infrastructure<br/>After the founding of cities, trading posts are important for the exchange of goods on important trade routes. Increasingly, these routes alone become lucrative sources of power and wealth, surpassing some cities in their importance.<br/><br/>4. Expeditions<br/>Curiosity and the need to discover new regions lead brave explorers to distant lands where they create new opportunities for their own glory and for the benefit of their people. Expeditions and the development of your population propel your people to unprecedented prosperity and increase your wealth.<br/><br/>5. Trade<br/>As you start to transport increasingly valuable goods over long distances, they become a popular form of currency. Depending on the demand, prices of goods fluctuate, so make sure you trade at the right time to prevent shortages.<br/><br/>6. Progress<br/>Kingdoms are connected by trade networks. Your people continuously develop new technologies and improve skills.<br/><br/>7. Turbulent Times<br/>After years of prosperity, times get a bit tougher for your people. Enemies at your borders and internal unrest, natural disasters, and plagues afflict them &mdash; truly turbulent times! Only together can you fight and overcome these problems, which require you to invest time and resources.<br/><br/>8. New Era<br/>Your people have experienced several changes in fortunes and survived turbulent times. Now they stand on the threshold of a new era! It is time to explore new paths, but each people must find its own way. Only those who keep their population in good spirits, using culture and luxury goods, will acquire eternal glory: Panem et Circenses!

The game includes 18 clue cards divided across these five categories, and to set up, place one card from each category to the side, then shuffle the remaining cards and deal them out as evenly as possible.<br/><br/>When the round begins, start a 15-second timer. Each player has this much time to review their cards, after which they pass them left, the timer starts again, then they can look at their new cards. They keep passing cards until someone grabs the announcement token, which stops the timer. This person announces their guess in each clue category, then looks at the set-aside cards. If correct, they receive a case token that reads 1; if they already have a case token, they win the game.<br/><br/>If they're wrong, they lose a case token (if they have one), then the round continues, with this person passing cards, but unable to guess. Continue to play until someone guesses correctly, or only one player remains, in which case they win automatically.<br/><br/>With the &quot;Doctor Watson&quot; variant, each player takes a vote token at the start of play, and whenever someone announces their guess, each other player reveals at the same time whether they think the guesser is correct. If everyone votes yes, the guesser wins a clue token automatically. If the voters are split and the guess is correct, the guesser wins a clue token and awards a clue token to someone who supported them; if the voters are split and the guess is incorrect, everyone who voted in favor of the guesser is also out of the round. The first player to collect three clue tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

All you need to play is 2 light dice and 2 dark dice, a pencil, the 8-page rules, and any one game sheet.<br/><br/>The game's playtesting and development is documented in: [WIP] Pack-A-Pond - 14th Roll and Write Game Design Contest - Contest Ready!.  It's sort of second in a series to the 2020 Worm & Cozy, which won 'Best Thematic Game' in the 4th Roll &amp; Write Game Design Contest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Combating the tropical setting as well as an enemy determined to battle to the last man, fighting on the islands was completely different than in Europe. The thousand-yard stare was a common trait among the fighting troops in the Pacific due to the strain of these conditions. This Battle Pack represents the hardships facing the men on both sides of the fluctuating front line.<br/><br/>Focusing on situations where the US Army and Marines commonly battled the entrenched Japanese Imperial forces, this Battle Pack highlights engagements on Attu Island (where the first Banzai charge took place), Tarawa, and Guam (where the famous incident of Gen. Smith relieving Gen. Smith took place), among others. The Japanese were experts at night actions, so a number of them are included in this set to illustrate their deadly proficiency.<br/><br/>Four new maps are included which give us another airfield and a new invasion beach, as well as beaches on Tarawa and Wake Island. Ten to twelve new scenarios will include terrain new to the Pacific game (coral, sea wall, and trenches) and a new weapon (AMTRAK).<br/><br/>",

The objective of the game is for 2 or more players to compete against each other using guile and strength of arms to increase their wealth and prestige and ultimately gain control of the Biblical World. They can do this by raising armies and fleets of ships, advancing their economies, and conquering new territories, while at the same time having to react to various favourable or unfavourable events.

These are the imperialistic Hittites of Hatti to the north, Egypt, a military state and land of the pharaohs, to the south and the expanding state of Assyria, a dynamic and ruthless military power, in the east. They all share a common desire to control the Levant to dominate and exploit the economic resources and trade of the region. In addition to contending for control of this vitally strategic region these chariot-using warrior societies struggle to suppress the numerous nomadic tribes and bands of Sea Peoples marauders who pose a threat to law and order. Meanwhile, in the Aegean the warlike Mycenaeans have recently taken over the powerful maritime state of Crete and now look set to launch a major military expedition against western Anatolia (the Trojan War).

Some cards only have one character on them, but others have two (サボ, ボテ, or テン).<br/><br/>Players start with 5 cards in their hand and take turns  playing one card (or two if they either don't own a cactus token yet or have been prickled in the previous two turns) that can help spelling &quot;サ ボ テ ン&quot; the right way.<br/><br/>If  the player can't play a card from their hand, they have to either draw one card from the draw deck and eventually play it if possible or draw the card on top of the playing area.<br/><br/>If the current player can't play any card on their turn turn despite drawing from the deck, one adequate card can be played by any other player, but they'll have to be the fastest one to do so.<br/><br/>There are also several special cards - the Prickly Cactus (with all four characters on it) and the テン (TEN) card. When a player plays them, all the other players have to grab a water token from the center of the table, and the one who didn't manage to get one gets prickled. If the card was a Prickly Cactus, all players give one of their cards to the prickled player (there is a hand limit of 10 however). If the card was a TEN, the prickled player must instead draw cards until they have ten in their hand.<br/><br/>Once a player gets rid of all their cards for the first time, they get a flowerless cactus token, and on the second time, they flip it over, making the cactus bloom and winning the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This pack is the 3rd Volume and final volume of the Wacht am Rhein saga, picking up from where Volume 2 left off in January 1945.<br/><br/>WaR 17 - CHENOGNE, BELGIUM, 1 January 1945:  As the New Year dawned, the Americans faced a formidable challenge on Bastogne's western flank. Major-General Troy Middleton's VIII Corps launched a vigorous offensive, aiming to secure Chenogne village and the Bois de Fragotte woods. The 21st Armored Infantry Battalion, backed by the 22nd Tank Battalion were tasked to take Chenogne. But their real test waited for them in the village's outskirts, where a fierce battle would unfold. Game Length: 7&frac12; Turns; Boards: 4, 56; Estimated time to play: 8 hours 39 minutes.<br/>WaR 18 - MAGERET, BELGIUM, 2 January 1945: The clash near Bastogne in early January 1945 emerges as a pivotal moment. The Germans, their hopes of a swift Ardennes victory dwindling, devised a new plan, threatening Bastogne from an unexpected direction. Meanwhile, on the American side, Major-General Robert W. Grow's 6th Armored Division received orders seemingly out of sync with the evolving situation. When the German counterattack struck on January 2nd, the outcome hung in the balance. Would the Americans, despite initial setbacks, regain their footing, or would the resurgent German forces pose an even graver threat? The fate of Bastogne, and perhaps the broader Ardennes campaign, teetered on a precipice. Game Length: 8 Turns; Boards: u, 4; Estimated time to play: 6 hours 24 minutes.<br/>WaR 19 - BURE, BELGIUM, 3 January 1945: A critical juncture in the Ardennes campaign. Field Marshal Montgomery's grand offensive, poised to alter the course of the battle, encountered a formidable obstacle in the battle-scarred 2nd Panzer Division. The clash at Bure on that fateful January 3rd revealed the harsh realities of war &ndash; tanks, paratroopers, and panzergrenadiers locked in a brutal struggle amidst the village's narrow streets. Yet, the outcome remains uncertain. Will Montgomery's forces regroup and persevere, or will the battle-worn 2nd Panzer Division prove insurmountable? Game Length: 7 Turns; Boards: 42, 10a, 39; Estimated time to play: 5 hours 37 minutes.<br/>WaR 20 - GORONNE, BELGIUM, 7 January 1945: In the frozen crucible of the Ardennes, a gripping showdown between two battle-hardened commanders unfurled. The unyielding American paratroopers, led by the intrepid Lieutenant-Colonel &ldquo;Vandy&rdquo; Vandervoort, launched an audacious assault against the formidable defenses commanded by Oberst J&uuml;ttner - a seasoned Eastern Front veteran. Would the 82nd Airborne Division's indomitable spirit endure, or would the resurgent Germans rally to defend Vielsalm? The outcome of this pivotal Ardennes confrontation hung precariously in the balance. Game Length: 7&frac12; Turns; Boards: 10a, 39, 42; Estimated time to play: 5 hours 58 minutes.<br/>WaR 21 - HILL 510, West of MAGERET, BELGIUM, 8 January 1945: In the midst of the bitter Ardennes winter, the tide of battle swayed unpredictably. The resurgent German counterattacks had already reclaimed territory from the Allies. Now, the stage was set for a pivotal showdown on Hill 510. As the 12th SS-Pionier Battalion, supported by panzers and artillery, clashed fiercely with American defenders, the outcome hung in the balance. Would the Germans secure this vital strategic height, or could the American forces muster the resilience to hold their ground? Game Length: 7&frac12; Turns; Boards: 17z, 84; Estimated time to play: 5 hours 42 minutes.<br/>WaR 22 - TILLET, BELGIUM, 9 January 1945: Amidst the unforgiving Ardennes landscape, a clash of wills and valour unfolded. The resilient US 87th Infantry Division, backed by the indomitable 761st Tank Battalion nicknamed the &ldquo;Black Panthers&rdquo;, faced off against the elite F&uuml;hrerbegleitbrigade &ndash; formed from Hitler&rsquo;s personal bodyguard. In the midst of the snow-covered landscape, Captain Charles A. Gates and his Company C, 761st Tank Battalion led a relentless assault. Among the chaos and carnage, the question remained: Could the Americans secure Tillet, or would the relentless Germans stage a counteroffensive to defend their territory? Game Length: 9 Turns; Boards: 56, 57, 84; Estimated time to play: 9 hours 42 minutes.<br/>WaR 23 - TAILLES, BELGIUM, 12 January 1945:  As January deepened, the northern flank of the Ardennes Bulge remained engulfed in the fires of battle. Major-General &quot;Lightning Joe&quot; Collins led the US VII Corps, determined to break through the staunch German defenses. Tailles, a critical crossroads south of the Baraque de Fraiture, became a deadly focal point. The 2nd SS-Panzer Division's steadfast defense and the stubborn resistance of the 12th Volksgrenadier Division presented formidable challenges. Lightning Joe concentrated his forces for a decisive assault on Tailles. With the battle's outcome teetering on a knife's edge, the clash continued into the night. Game Length: 8 Turns; Boards: 49, 57; Estimated time to play: 7 hours 42 minutes.<br/>WaR 24 - THIRIMONT, BELGIUM, 13 January 1945: As the battle for the northern flank of the Ardennes raged on, Major-General Matthew Ridgway's XVIII Corps faced a pivotal moment. Despite their initial success in dislodging the Germans from the Salm River's northern side, the American offensive had stalled. With the newly arrived 75th Infantry Division yet to enter the fray, the 30th Infantry Division, veterans of Normandy and defenders against Kampfgruppe Peiper, launched their attack from Malmedy. However, standing in their way was the battle-hardened 3rd Fallschirmj&auml;ger Division, led by Generalleutnant Richard Schimpf, determined to hold a formidable defensive line. Game Length: 7 Turns; Boards: 3, 17z; Overlays: O3, and OW1; Estimated time to play: 9 hours 42 minutes.<br/>WaR 25 - OBERWAMPACH, BELGIUM, 17 January 1945: As the battle in the central sector of the Ardennes Front began to ebb, the southern region witnessed a gripping struggle for control. With the Americans inching closer to severing the German supply lines, General der Panzertruppen Hasso von Manteuffel ordered the 1st SS-Panzer Division to recapture Oberwampach. Despite their fierce efforts, they couldn't dislodge the determined US 90th Infantry Division. With the situation hanging by a thread, the 2nd Panzer Division was tasked with forming a battle group to stop any further American advances. Game Length: 8 Turns; Boards: 4, 53, 57; Estimated time to play: 8 hours 59 minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Short Circuit is an abstract tile-laying game in which the players race their meeples across a board to pick up point-scoring tiles. At setup, piles of point tiles and the players&rsquo; meeples are placed on the board according to the number of players. The players define the length of the game by choosing what number of score tiles collected by at least one player triggers the end of the game. The recommended number is six. You can score additional points depending on the order in which you collect the score tiles. The winner is the player with the highest number of victory points.<br/><br/>At the core of Short Circuit are tiles that form paths along which you can move your meeple. On your turn, you can place up to three path tiles on the board and use them together with the path tiles placed in previous turns by all players to reach and claim score tiles. Instead of placing path tiles on empty cells of the board, you can also use them to replace, rotate, or remove tiles that are already there.<br/><br/>Action cards help you collect score tiles by allowing to break some of the placing and moving rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Usually, the greatest shareholder of a company will become its director. As director, the player will decide all operations the company will make, such as laying track and stations, running routes, managing the earnings and purchasing trains.<br/>Play consists of an indefinite number of sets of rounds, these sets consist of a stock round and one to three operating rounds. The game will end when the most powerful trains come into play, and the richest player will become the winner, counting cash and the share portfolio.<br/>In addition, as special features 18Espa&ntilde;a has a lot of mines, two maps that differentiate the zones in which narrow and broad gauge track were built, mountain passes that connect these two maps, major and minor companies, takeovers, different type of trains, etc.<br/>Although it is not feasible to do it completely, 18ESP has been designed to be as historically accurate as possible.<br/>Finally, the game presents a variable randomized setup, which means the game will be different each time it is played.<br/><br/>",

They rally a company of knights and Arthurian personalities, deploying them to construct Camelot, repel invader hordes, and quest for the Holy Grail. Through their choices, players sculpt a unique narrative and unlock new modules until the grail is discovered, and a winner is crowned high king!<br/><br/>The game features dozens of silkscreened wood pieces, a huge game board, and a 3D castle that players build during play. Multiple game modules allow for high variability and replayability across many aspects of Arthurian myth, with the intertwining of themes and mechanisms allowing players to organically create their own spin on these legends.<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt a mix of adorably bright gummy bear and worm cards with the goal of being the first to get rid of all of them. Worm cards only take effect when three consecutive worms have been placed. These activate UNO-like powers - skip, reverse, pass all, pass 1, and take a new hand - you pass the cards in your hand though, and not people! Each turn, draw a new card as you try to make two sets in order to go out. Sets can either be a 3 or 4 of a kind (split bears and wild rainbow bears count for these sets)or a set (run) with 4 different bears (split bears and wild cards don't count for this set of 4). Be the first to play all seven cards in two sets to win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The First Great War ended in December 1916 with Wilson&rsquo;s Peace, a negotiated settlement that left all parties vaguely dissatisfied (except those no longer called on to die by the millions). The Second Great War erupted in August 1940, with Serbian, Russian, French and Italian armies attacking the Central Powers in a naked grab for territory and power.<br/><br/>The Imperial Russian Army, equipped and trained for new tactics known as molniyenosnaya voyna, launched an unprovoked invasion of Central Powers allies Poland and Lithuania. The defenders had no answer for the masses of Russian tanks supported by helicopters and rockets. But they hung on grimly nonetheless, waiting for help to arrive from their Imperial German allies.<br/><br/>The Germans dispatched their most secret weapon to blunt the Russian advance: the massive mobile fortresses known as Land Cruisers. These huge, crawling machines bristled with heavy cannon and automatic weapons, and even carried their own dedicated troops.<br/><br/>Land Cruisers: The Lithuanian Campaign is an expansion set for Panzer Grenadier: Land Cruisers (which is itself an expansion, but that&rsquo;s okay). It comes with 88 new playing pieces plus a set of 10 scenarios so you can play with them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In May 1940, German panzer divisions attacked the Soviet Union, beginning a two-year campaign that finally ended in the summer of 1942 with the defeat of the Stalinist regime. Immediately afterwards, Germany&rsquo;s supreme leader turned his attention to the Western allies, Britain and France, beginning the lengthy conflict that would become known as the Long War.<br/><br/>1942: Moroccan Division is a Panzer Grenadier expansion, set in this alternative history (it&rsquo;s a sequel to 1942: The Defense of France). The Moroccans, seen in our 1940: Swallows of Death book (which covers their actual battles in 30 scenarios), have received the weapons the French Army hoped to soon issue to its troops. The French defeat in 1940 precluded that, but that&rsquo;s not the case here: the Moroccans (and the French, too) have the MAS40 semi-automatic battle rifle, the AMX38 light tank, the 75mm TAZ 39 anti-tank gun, and better artillery, too. They can stand toe-to-toe with the Germans, and in these scenarios, that&rsquo;s exactly what they proceed to do.<br/><br/>To play those scenarios, you&rsquo;ll need a few other items:<br/><br/>1940: The Fall of France. This is a large, complete Panzer Grenadier game with 40 scenarios of its own plus eight maps and lots of pieces. This is where you&rsquo;ll find the game rules and the maps you&rsquo;ll need, plus a lot of the pieces.<br/><br/>Kursk: Burning Tigers. This is also a large, complete Panzer Grenadier game with 40 scenarios from the &ldquo;northern flank&rdquo; of the June 1943 Battle of Kursk; you&rsquo;ll need this game for some German pieces.<br/><br/>Elsenborn Ridge. This is another large, complete Panzer Grenadier game with 40 scenarios from the &ldquo;northern flank&rdquo; of the Battle of the Bulge; you&rsquo;ll need this game for some German pieces.<br/><br/>1940: Swallows of Death. This is an expansion for 1940: The Fall of France, a book with pieces for Moroccan troops fighting for France and 30 more historical scenarios.<br/><br/>1942: The Defense of France. This is a downloadable expansion for 1940: The Fall of France, with 88 pieces that you&rsquo;ll have to assemble yourself (just like the pieces that come with this expansion), and ten more scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Can you limit yourself to the essentials in time to save the village?<br/><br/>Seers Catalog is an almost-shedding card game in which each player tries to get rid of almost all of the cards in their hand. Each round, players have a unique set of artifacts that give them asymmetric abilities to help manage their hand of cards. When one player runs out of cards, the round is scored: Each card is worth -1, but if you have five or fewer cards in your hand, the lowest value on those cards is worth positive points! However, once you have five or fewer cards, you can no longer voluntarily pass, so holding on to a high-value card near the end of the round hoping for a big payout can result in total failure.<br/><br/>",

The Race to the Moon board game and its computer game, Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space (1994). LIFTOFF! 2.0 is packed with additional content based on actual and proposed technologies that make this the most highly researched and complete simulation of man&rsquo;s journey into space. Relive the Apollo 11 landing on the Moon!<br/><br/>Up to 4 players compete to be the first nation to land a man on the moon, and successfully return them home again.<br/><br/>During the activity turn all players receive their current income, an event card which may help or hinder, and can buy new hardware (rockets / satellites / capsules etc), try and develop the reliability of systems they already have (by buying dice and adding the total to the current safety), hire astronauts, and secretly plan future missions.<br/><br/>The launch phase sees players carrying out their missions in turn (as being first to achieve certain mission goals such as 'first man in space' is rewarded). The relevant hardware must be purchased, including a rocket powerful enough to lift the weight of the other items involved. The mission is carried out by following a series of steps, and rolling percentiles against the safety rating of specific items each turn - e.g. liftoff roll against rocket, orbital burn roll against space capsule, space walk roll against space suit etc.<br/>If a player fails a safety roll, the advanced game contains several possible failure outcomes (requiring one or more further rolls) ranging from a bulb failure to a catastrophic explosion, which will reset the safety factor of your equipment!<br/><br/>Once missions are completed, players&rsquo; incomes are adjusted depending on successes / failures, and the next year begins.<br/><br/>",

However, be careful, as cures can have consequences too! The goal is to be the healthiest player in the group when the first player dies.

Assemble your hand to give a set of symptoms to your opponent, and watch out for the sets your opponents give you! Use both your real world pathology knowledge and your in-game strategy to dish out more diseases than you take.<br/><br/>Symptomatic, much like real life, requires critical thinking, strategy, and a bit of luck to stay healthy as everyone else suffers.

        "description": "The Last Command is a detail-oriented space combat strategy game, lovingly crafted to simulate the relationship between a starship and its crew. Whether playing as the Federation Remnant or the Sunder, victory hinges on maximizing the potential of your crew and ship systems with gameplay utilizing dual deckbuilding, worker placement and resource management!<br/><br/>Ready your crew and Man all stations!<br/>At the heart of The Last Command is an intuitive dual deckbuilding system that has players constructing a powerful ship system deck and a second deck consisting of crew members that can maximize those systems potential and provide the energy to power them. Multiple system cards can be played into a ship location, but the topmost card has the potential of unlocking powerful end of turn bonus abilities if crew with matching expertise are present in that system.<br/><br/>Become A Legendary Fleet Captain!<br/>Cards played to your ship remain in play until you attempt to draw from their respective deck and that deck is empty. To achieve victory, captains must learn when to push their system&rsquo;s limits and when to recall them. If a captain is able to reduce the hull strength of his opponent&rsquo;s ship to zero, then the battle has been won and glory and honor is theirs!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Both modes can be played from 2 to 10 players, but for 6 or more players the party game mode is probably the best choice.<br/><br/>Players are miners that start to mine Bitcoin at home, by betting energy and selling Bitcoin to get more energy. When played as a party game, the game requires very little room for the game board and just few components: players can sit around the board, or even few meters away, since the main mechanics are just bidding energy to get Bitcoin cards and sellig cards to get energy. A complete game is played in 4 eras, where each era represents one 4 years cycle (Bitcoin's halvings). Players can agreed to play just 1, 2 or 3 eras.<br/><br/>The party game and standard game modes shares the same mechanics, the only difference is that when the game is played as party game the Bitcoin cards are used just as victory points, that is: the text printed on the cards is ignored. On the opposite, when played as a standard boardgame, an Action phase is added to end of each game turn. During this Action phase players can play the cards they collected to get benefits and trigger special effects. This adds more strategy to the game experience, and reduce luck dependances.<br/><br/>The standard boardgame leads each player to become aware of his approach to Bitcoin. Depending by the cards and the strategy, each player can decide to use Bitcoin just as an economic asset, or to improve it as software developer, or to mine more Bitcoins improving his rigs, or even as a human science expert, exploiting the social and psychological aspectes of Bitcoin. Specializing in just one aspect it's not easy, therefore usually each players will build a mixed profile with all these skills.<br/><br/>Because investing time it's often better than investing money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RAF Bomber Command: Lancaster (Expansion 4) is a tactical-level, narrative-style solitaire wargame expansion using a tables-based game engine simulating the British RAF Bomber Command nighttime bombing campaign against Germany during 1943-1945.<br/><br/>As the pilot of an RAF Avro Lancaster heavy bomber, your ultimate goal is to survive a 30-mission tour of duty. You and your crew will be assigned with taking part in nightly area bombing raids against various German cities from 1943 to 1945 in an attempt to break the will of the German people. But it won&rsquo;t certainly be a cake walk, as Luftwaffe night fighters will be hunting your bomber streams, not to mention navigation challenges over open water and deadly FLAK you will encounter over the target cities.<br/><br/><br/>     One D6, one D12, and two D10 dice are required to play.<br/>     5 minute game setup and breakdown times.<br/>     A medium size table is recommended for game setup.<br/>     Total play time to complete a full 30-mission tour of duty takes approximately 10-15 hours, with a typical mission averaging 20 minutes.<br/>     Adjustable starting difficulty based on player's skill level.<br/><br/><br/>With most of the rules integrated into the tables, there is practically no learning curve or rules memorization. And with detailed damage modeling, fuel management, numerous crewmen skills, mission weather effects, random events, and a multitude of table modifiers, RAF Bomber Command: Lancaster (Expansion 4) offers memorable experiences and high replay value.

        "description": "It seems the Quar have always been at war. When the first wandering clans of insect gatherers built their low, mud-walled buildings, it was as much to keep out other Quar as the wild animals. As they first learned to make tools to get food, they quickly learned to make tools to defend themselves. The mud walls quickly became fortified citadels, and then city-states. In five thousand years of civilization, the only constants of their culture have been the changing of the seasons and the threat of war.<br/><br/>Quar are just like you and me - perfectly normal creatures, bereft of magic or supernatural powers or other-worldly technologies. They do eat bugs, though, and lots of them. Most quar, when they&rsquo;re not fighting each other over slights real or imagined, are farmers, or traders, or merchants. Mostly they live simple, happy lives full of hard work, ale and the occasional overeating of mothcakes.<br/><br/>But there are other quar - ambitious, striving quar - for which a mere warm bed and full belly are not enough. These are the ones that scheme, that connive, and their machinations bring whole nations and kingdoms into conflict. Constant conflict, brutal conflict, for the history of Alwyd is written in blood.<br/><br/>The Long War is entering a new phase. Gather your weapons, choose your side, and prepare to begin your chapter in the history of this grand conflict.<br/><br/>This is a two-player game that features 24 hard plastic Quar (12 Crusaders and 12 Coftyrans), 24 hard plastic dual-use bases, 10 activation cards, 6 D6 dice, and a 48 page rulebook. There is also a selection of cut-out terrain on the box sides to help bring your battlefield to life!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the mythical realm of Elemental Dragons, players embark on a journey to harness the powers of the four elemental suits: earth, water, fire, and air. The goal? To amass a hoard of precious dragon gems, the coveted currency of this world. But beware, for amidst the riches lie hidden dangers in the form of dragon eggs, which bring negative scores to those unfortunate enough to acquire them.<br/>In Elemental Dragons, players engage in a battle of wits, employing elemental powers to outmaneuver their opponents. Each round, players compete to win tricks by playing cards of higher value and utilizing the unique abilities of the powerful dragon cards.<br/>At the outset, a dominant suit is randomly determined. Then, the first player to play a card sets the lesser dominant suit if their played card does not belong to the dominant suit. Thus, the order of precedence emerges: dominant suit, followed by the lesser suit, with the remaining two suits only useful in this round for their powers. The dragon's powers will enable you to change the dominant suit, steal gems from the trick, and poison the trick with eggs among other things. Each player plays a card either to try to win the trick, or to play a useful power for them, or both. Then there is a second round of card exchange, offering players the opportunity to exchange their initial card for another, only if the new card can win the trick. Players also can choose to &quot;downgrade&quot; their card for an egg card, poisoning that trick for the winner by nullifying gems from the final score.<br/>This mechanic injects an element of bluff and double-bluff into the gameplay, as players must carefully consider when to reveal their most potent cards and when to conceal their true intentions.<br/>As the game unfolds, players must carefully balance their pursuit of dragon gems with the risk of acquiring detrimental dragon eggs. Enter the world of Elemental Dragons and unleash the power of the elements in this thrilling trick-taking adventure.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>En el reino m&iacute;tico de los Dragones Elementales, los jugadores emprenden un viaje para aprovechar los poderes de los cuatro palos elementales: tierra, agua, fuego y aire. &iquest;El objetivo? Acumular un tesoro de preciosas gemas de drag&oacute;n, la codiciada moneda de este mundo. Pero cuidado, porque entre las riquezas yacen peligros ocultos en forma de huevos de drag&oacute;n, que otorgan puntuaci&oacute;n negativa a aquellos desafortunados que los adquieren.<br/>En Dragones Elementales los jugadores participan en una batalla de ingenio, empleando poderes elementales para superar a sus oponentes. En cada ronda, los jugadores compiten para ganar bazas jugando cartas de mayor valor y utilizando las habilidades &uacute;nicas de las poderosas cartas de drag&oacute;n.<br/>Al principio, se determina aleatoriamente un palo dominante. Luego, el primer jugador en jugar una carta establece el palo subdominante si su carta jugada no pertenece al palo dominante. As&iacute;, surge el orden de precedencia: palo dominante, seguido por el subdominante, con los dos palos restantes solo &uacute;tiles en esta ronda por sus poderes. Los poderes de los dragones te permitir&aacute;n cambiar el palo dominante, robar gemas de la baza y envenenarla con huevos, entre otras cosas. Cada jugador juega una carta ya sea para intentar ganar la baza, o para jugar un poder &uacute;til, o ambos. Luego hay una segunda ronda de intercambio de cartas, que ofrece a los jugadores la oportunidad de cambiar su carta inicial por otra, s&oacute;lo si la nueva carta puede ganar la baza. Los jugadores tambi&eacute;n pueden optar por &quot;rebajar&quot; su carta por una carta de huevo, envenenando esa baza para el ganador al anular gemas de la puntuaci&oacute;n final.<br/>Este mecanismo introduce un elemento de enga&ntilde;o y doble enga&ntilde;o en el juego, ya que los jugadores deben considerar cuidadosamente cu&aacute;ndo revelar sus cartas m&aacute;s potentes y cu&aacute;ndo ocultar sus verdaderas intenciones.<br/>A medida que el juego avanza, los jugadores deben equilibrar cuidadosamente su b&uacute;squeda de gemas de drag&oacute;n con el riesgo de adquirir perjudiciales huevos de drag&oacute;n. &iexcl;Entra al mundo de los Dragones Elementales y libera el poder de los elementos en esta emocionante aventura de captura de bazas!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, if you want to get the single vacancy in the company, you will have to compete to determine who is able to create the perfect frames in the best animation sequences.<br/>In Keyframes, you will have 3 rounds to prove that you deserve the vacancy. To achieve this, each one will have a hand of frames (cards) and another 5 frames will be placed in the center of the table. In each turn you must play a card from your hand, which you will reveal simultaneously to determine the turn order of the next phase. In this second phase, we will build sequences by selecting one of the available frames, among which will be those used from the players' hand to determine the turn order. But pay attention! You can only have 2 projects open at the same time on your work table, and the sequence you add must be correlative with the ones you have, moreover, you can only add it if it is the prior or subsequent frame form the one you were working on previously. If it is not possible to add it following this rule, you must close your current project to start a new one, which will penalize you in the final scoring. If you are able to make more and better sequences than your rivals, the job will be yours!<br/>Keyframes is a game created by the acclaimed Shei S. and Isra C., creators of titles such as The Red Cathedral, The White Castle, Shinkansen: Zero-Kei,1987 Channel Tunnel, Ramen... among a good handful of other great games, and illustrated by the amazing animation artist Cristina Achaui. Keyframes is a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; with very simple rules, which combines turn order bidding with a restrictive set collection which will force you, each turn, to calculate the best time to play which card, and which card to add to your sequences.<br/><br/>A game of Keyframes takes about 15 minutes to play, and can be played with 2 or 3 people individually, or 4 with a special 2 vs. 2 team system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

While individual players are hardly paragons of athleticism, their mastery of magical illusions and the befriending of forest beasts gives them certain advantages not enjoyed by less gloriously bearded teams.<br/><br/>This multipart plastic kit builds the Glimdwarrow Groundhogs, a Gnome team for use in games of Blood Bowl. The team comprises eight Gnome Linemen, two Woodland Foxes, two Gnome Illusionists, and two Gnome Beastmasters. You'll find four head options that can be used with any of the four different Lineman bodies, as well as two alternative heads for each of the other positions. The Beastmasters have a choice of staff toppers, as well as either goose or badger friends. In addition, there are two double-sided Blood Bowl coins, two turn and re-roll markers, four balls, and a transfer sheet.<br/><br/>This kit comprises 102 plastic components, and is supplied with 14x Citadel 32mm Round Bases and 1x Gnome Team Transfer Sheet. These miniatures are supplied unpainted and require assembly.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome aboard the SS Royal Line, a luxurious ferry setting sail between the shores of Immingham, England, and Gothenburg, Sweden. The story begins with a grisly discovery - a Swedish gentleman by the name of Johan Dahlberg, known to many as a distinguished passenger of the SS Royal Line, lies lifeless in his private booth, a victim of a brutal homicide. As you arrive, one of the first people at the scene, you are taken aback by the sheer brutality of the crime. The aftermath leaves you gasping in disbelief, and you can&rsquo;t help but need a moment to yourself before continuing the investigation.<br/><br/>When your initial shock settles, the fact that the assailant committed the act in the midst of a ferry journey brings to mind the mythic tales of Charon, the boatman from Greek mythology who ferries the souls of the dead across the river Styx to the afterlife. With this thought resting in the back of your head, you dive into your detective work. The ferry has been sealed by the police to keep all passengers and crew members onboard during the investigation, including the perpetrator. However, they can&rsquo;t keep people onboard forever. You need to figure out who committed the crime, and time is running out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So think fast and bet smart - the quicker your wager, the bigger your payout!<br/><br/>When the pot of gears runs out, the player with the most claims the victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But beneath the thin veneer of legitimacy, lies a plague of desperate, corrupt, and highly motivated criminal syndicates. Here, success is for the sinful, and fortunes are won through daring heists and ruthless raids. Rub shoulders with the street thugs, corporate operatives, and two-faced humanitarians as you build your syndicate from the underbelly of society, to establish your influence over Shadow Moon.<br/><br/>In Shadow Moon Syndicates, 2-5 players take on the role of a syndicate crime boss.

How players manage their cards is the key to placing influence in the most effective way to gain lucrative credits, complete missions, and overcome their rivals for ascendancy. The player who accumulates the most credits by the game's end is deemed the winner.<br/><br/>Will you be the one to rise above the rest, turning sin into success, to become the Sovereign of Shadow Moon?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You are thinking Yes, I can raise dead, but they only last a couple of hours or so&hellip;that is not enough to make a dent in the World. And so, you venture forth to become an even more knowledgeable and skilled necromancer. In this solo print-and-play 10&ndash;15 minute card game, you have to complete a Master&rsquo;s degree in Necromancy in two semesters by completing courses and raising dead study buddies. However, completing courses drains your sanity. Will you succeed? Or will you become an insane fiend haunting the university&rsquo;s corridors?<br/><br/>To graduate in necromancy, you have to a) collect at least 45 credits from the completed courses, b) finish your thesis, and c) avoid insanity in the process of the academic year consisting of two semesters. Each turn you draw a card from the current semester deck. If it is a course card (which is mostly the case) you decide whether you:<br/><br/><br/>     sign into a new necromancy course but you lose some sanity,<br/>     discard the card to raise dead to get a bonus from an already completed course,<br/>     discard the card to push forward your thesis a bit,<br/>     put the card on the &quot;Maybe later&quot; pile that gets shuffled later into the second-semester deck.<br/><br/><br/>In terms of categorizing this card game: It is a light-weight engine-building game since your completed courses allow you to sign in to courses with higher requirements but bigger rewards; it is a push-your-luck game since you can strategize but you also don't know what is coming next in the deck; there are deck-building elements involved in the creation of the &quot;Maybe later&quot; pile that gets shuffled into the second-semester deck; finally, Graduate in Necromancy is highly replayable - the two semester decks are different every playthrough.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Skirmish Wars: Blitz is the first expansion for the lightweight, tactical wargame based on the wildly popular turn-based strategy game series Advance Wars, originally released on the Game Boy Advance by Nintendo.  Skirmish Wars is a print-and-play game that uses a modular, customizable map system for endless replayability, and simple mechanics to streamline gameplay.<br/><br/>While the objectives of a given game of Skirmish Wars will vary from scenario to scenario, The classic objective is to win by capturing your enemy's HQ or failing that, by eliminating all of his units.  To do so, a player must manage and secure new sources of limited funds, think quickly to out-maneuver, out-produce, or out-gun his opponent, and be ready to counter enemy strategies and units with their own.<br/><br/>Skirmish Wars: Blitz introduces several new units including aircraft (all based on their counterparts from the original Video Game series) and eight new COs.  It also introduces new rules for repairing units, rules for units with limited fuel (like air units), and finally a fifth side that may be played.<br/><br/>",

Before play, each player sets up their defenses to best withstand the oppenent's onslaught. They then take turns launching projectile caroms at the opposing defenses.<br/><br/>Opponents agree before play on any of the four official winning conditions. Alternatively players make up their own rules, or simply blast away at eachother's defenses until the enemy's force is annihilated.<br/><br/>The Trojan Horse (Vikings) and Battle Shield (Barbarians) are weapons used to propel caroms at the opposing forces, similar to the standard catapult and crossbow respectively.  But they also serve as tempting targets for the enemy. When struck, internal mechanisms spectacularly expel warrior figures or caroms.<br/><br/>",

If we believe his propagandists, he was always vastly outnumbered, yet he and his elite army were never defeated, always winning a decisive victory. &quot;It is a sobering thought,&quot; says Table Battles designer Tom Russell, &quot;that by the time he was my age, Alexander had conquered the Persian empire, made his incursion into India, founded city after glorious city, and had been dead for four years.&quot;<br/><br/>Table Battles: The Age of Alexander recreates that famous Macedonian's major battles, as well as two battles of the Diadochi. In almost all of these battles, the Macedonian Player has no room for error - the routing of a single Formation is often enough to lose the game. The opposing side has more leeway and more sticks, but generally comes up short in the quality department. Careful, nuanced play from both sides is require to stay competitive and to win the day. Most of these are larger engagements, with lots of cards and reactions for each side.<br/><br/>The seven battles in this set are:<br/><br/>Chaeronea (2 August 338 BCE)<br/>Granicus (May 334 BCE)<br/>Issus (5 November 333 BCE)<br/>Gaugamela (1 October 331BCE)<br/>The Hydaspes (May 326BCE)<br/>Gabiene (316BCE)<br/>Ipsus (301BCE)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The family patriarch and rich businessman Anthony Westongrove had invited his children to the grand family manor to celebrate his 70th birthday yesterday.<br/><br/>All of the family members arrived at the manor on Friday afternoon, and an extravagant feast was served at 7:00 pm. It promised to be a wonderful evening &hellip;<br/><br/>But the birthday celebration came to an unpleasant end when Anthony was rushed to the hospital during the night after falling very ill. Concerned, the entire family stayed at Westongrove Manor and waited for the patriarch to make his return. Today, on Saturday afternoon, Anthony was finally released from the hospital. His unconsciousness turned out to be caused by poisoning. It would appear that one of the guests was after his blood.<br/><br/>Anthony wishes to resolve the matter within the family, which is why everyone who was present has come together again this evening. The question is: What happened yesterday night? Who tried to kill Westongrove?<br/><br/>What is a murder mystery game?<br/><br/>You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.<br/><br/>You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.<br/><br/>Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.<br/><br/>Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENT:<br/>1 Game Manual, 8 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 8 name badges, 1 support code<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Japan entered the modern age in 1868, with a new young emperor determined to make his island nation a world power. After decades of steady progress, Japan began its own practice of colonialism, defeating China in 1894. As the Japanese began to infiltrate the semi-independent Kingdom of Korea, they ran into Russian agents doing the same. Despite Japanese offers to negotiate, elements within the Russian Empire were set on war.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War covers the naval aspects of the resulting conflict, which opened with a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet&rsquo;s base at Port Arthur in northern China. There are 50 scenarios, including the climactic Battle of Tsushima, as well as hypothetical actions ranging from an early dispute resulting from the 1895 &quot;Triple Intervention&quot; to a showdown in 1906 with greatly reinforced Russian and Japanese fleets.<br/><br/>The Russian fleet is a mixed bag of modern battleships and ancient ironclads better suited for a museum. The Pacific Fleet that begins the game in the Far East has modern ships stationed at Port Arthur and a cruiser squadron in Vladivostok. Between them lies Korea, occupied by Japan. The Russian strategic situation is difficult.<br/><br/>The Japanese have a better fleet; though not as large, their armored cruisers outclass their Russian counterparts and their torpedo boats are more numerous and more effective. They are also better-led after the death of the Russian Admiral Makarov.<br/><br/>The map covers the Japanese home islands and the seas around them. As with other games in the series, it&rsquo;s divided into zones 32 miles across. Fleets attempt to locate one another on this map. When contact is made, play moves to a tactical map where ships maneuver and fight.<br/><br/>The previous edition of this game (Great War at Sea: 1904-1905) won the Origins Award for Best Historical Game due to play balance and simplicity. Without aircraft, play is even faster than in other games in the series. The strategic situation is challenging to both players, and competitive balance is keen without sacrificing the historical accuracy of the game as a simulation. Unlike most wars, the Russo-Japanese naval war took place between opponents reasonably matched in terms of vessels and numbers (albeit not in training), and that makes for a tense and exciting game.<br/><br/>Russo-Japanese War includes:<br/>&bull; One 34 x 22-inch operational map<br/>&bull; One 22 x 22-inch tactical map<br/>&bull; 210 playing pieces<br/>&bull; A game booklet including 50 scenarios<br/><br/>",

Under the blazing sunlight, there was Alexia, mocking, taunting Marow as he was standing wounded and silent. This was the grand finale everyone was waiting for. You could feel how fired up the crowd was, shouting for more. Marow`s artifact burst into scarlet energy as we cheered for him, breaking his silence into a violent battle cry rushing towards Alexia. A clash we will never forget unfolded before our very eyes! All these moments, carved into our minds for an eternity to come. This is the battle of eternal moments!<br/><br/>In FIRED UP! Eternal Moments you take on the role of a spectator in an arena where combatants from all over the lands gather, with the sole purpose of creating unforgettable moments for all to see. As the spectator, you can influence Fighters with your energy and excitement, in order to alter the outcome of the battle to your liking.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to leave the event as fired up as possible. Therefore the winner of the game will be the player who will manage to gather the most Fired up Points. <br/>The game is played over several Rounds. Each Round consists of the following 3 Main Phases:<br/><br/>a) Planning Phase:  All players may simultaneously place face down in front of them 1 or 2 Moment Cards. These Cards represent specific situations that the player, as a spectator, anticipates and wishes to experience in this Round.<br/><br/>b) Influence Phase: Players roll the dice and choose which Fighter and in which way they want to influence. The goal of each player is to increase the odds of what he/she has bet during the Planning Phase. The players can influence the target opponent of each Fighter, the Speed of a Fighter, his/her Defend or Attack Power and his/her Morale.<br/><br/>c) Battle Phase: During this phase, battles between Fighters take place, rolling the respective attack and defence dice. In the duration of this phase, players may reveal their successful Moment Cards and receive the corresponding Fired Up Points.<br/><br/>The game ends when there is one or none Fighter left in the arena!<br/><br/>&quot;FIRED UP! Eternal Moments&quot; took the 1st place in the 6th annual Greek Board Game Designing Contest (2015) under the name &quot;Nauthriva&quot;.<br/><br/>The publisher of this game, &quot;Purple Games&quot;, closed due to personal reasons and all the rights of Fired Up returned to the designers.<br/>If you are a publisher and interested in this game contact &quot;Theofilos Koutroubis&quot; in bgg or in the following e-mail: theofiloskoutroubis@yahoo.gr <br/>A lot of love and effort was put in this game and we hope that it finds another warm home.

        "description": "This new boxed set includes the main quests of all six games, remasters every single card and is packaged in a premium set. it also includes over 25 completely new cards, some replacing older cards that needed updating. <br/><br/>THE Ultimate Drinking Quest Collection!<br/><br/>Like a typical Role Playing Game you have a character sheet, roll for saving throws, fight monsters and find treasure BUT when your character dies in the game you have to chug your drink in real life! It adds a real level of tension and excitement to the battles. Everything matters.<br/><br/>The battles are a series of one-on-one fights to the death. You either kill the monster earning coins and XP or your character dies and you must chug your drink! The cards act as the GM (So everyone can drink) and the heroes go through four themed quests in each game - each getting progressively difficult and more likely to drink. However as this is a light RPG and a light Drinking Game there is a one chug per quest maximum which prevents Drinking Quest from being a &quot;Pass out in 10 minutes&quot; kind of drinking game. Over the course of 2 or 3 hours, a typical game averages 2 or 3 chugs.<br/><br/>Whoever gets the most XP wins! Whoever loses had to chug the most so it's sort of like everybody wins.<br/><br/>",

The battle is fought at regimental level at a scale of 250m per hex, and in 30-minute game turns.

Players learn, have fun, converse and connect with each other.<br/><br/>This first game is targeted at Couples seeking more emotional and physical intimacy.

(Answer or act out, or lose places)<br/>     True or False? (Trivia style)<br/>     Trust And Touch (Blindfold guessing)<br/>     Name If Game (Picture cards to name what it is)<br/>     Perform or Pamper (Personal Challenge cards selected at the end of the game)<br/><br/><br/>150 of the main cards are ranked 1, 2 or 3 chili's to identify the difficulty and lower or higher places forward on the board. There's an additional 25 x 4 chili cards in a sealed tuckbox. These contain images to guess and name, but are product photo's or illustrations so sexual in nature but tasteful and not graphic.<br/><br/>Players can be one couple or two couples playing against each other. The cards are placed into 3 decks depending on the chili rating (chilli in UK spelling) and people choose an easier 1 chilli to start the game, then work up eventually to the tougher conversations and topics. Questions are asked and based on your answers, you move your marker the respective moves on the board to hopefully be first to the finish/ Win!!<br/><br/>The WINNER then selects a 'Perform or Pamper' card for themself and for the losing player, and all of this while receiving a 1 minute shoulder massage from the Loser. Each card has an activity they must complete within 14 days OR they have to give extra special attention to the other person, in whatever 'reasonable' way they want.<br/><br/>Each game is designed to last 30 - 60 minutes depending on how much extra conversation ensues about the cards. The cards should give about 5 unique games, but many answers are unique, so it can be played multiple times.<br/><br/>The game content has been professionally reviewed by a psychologist for suitability.<br/><br/>",

Cartzzles are pictures you must first piece together by laying cards on top of each other (with or without the template, depending on your dedication). Then, start again, using challenges this time! Removing cards, flipping them, and laying them elsewhere will change the picture and also allow you to meet some challenges.<br/><br/>",

With fighting skills learned in the finest academies and tempered by the ancient code of bushido, the MechWarriors of the DCMS  know no equals. Their loyalty and skill are legendary, and their tenacity has won them hundreds of battles across known space. This classified field manual, seized from the Combine's Internal Security Force, reveals the inner workings of the Draconis Combine military, from district regular units to the elite Sword of Light regiments. This document is an invaluable resource for both allies and enemies of the Combine.<br/><br/>Battletech Field Manual: Draconis Combine contains extensive information about all aspects of House Kurita's military. Every BattleMech regiment of the DCMS is described in detail, including their history, officers and tactics, special rules reflecting the unique abilities of each regiment are included as an optional expansion to BattleTech play. Among the many other features of the book are new weapons, equipment, and BattleMechs unique to the Draconis Combine.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>The most detailed and expansive sourcebook for matters relating to House Kurita and the Draconis Combine since the House Kurita sourcebook ten years earlier, this BattleTech expansion features much more by way of rules and game material than it's predecessor, and provides detail on every major 'Mech unit in serice with the Combine at the time.

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/>Middle-earth and The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game are full of adventures, and your road goes ever, ever on. Sometimes, when the mood strikes you&mdash;or when your heroes take a wrong turn&mdash;you may see that road darken&hellip; and then darken again.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios recast within the darker and deadlier shadows of Nightmare Mode. Each Nightmare Deck introduces new encounter cards that you exchange with specified cards from the adventure's standard encounter deck. The result is a more challenging adventure that comes full of novel and thematic new twists.<br/><br/>The heart of Celebrimbor's Secret is the tension of the race to locate Celebrimbor's abandoned ring mould among the ruins of Ost-in-Edhil. As your heroes explore the ruins and its various locations, the Dark Lord's forces conduct their own search, led by an agent named Bellach. If you don't quickly explore the locations that make their way to the staging area, Bellach and his Orcs might explore them first. While your exploration places progress on locations as normal, your enemies' exploration of locations places damage on them, and any locations with damage equal to their printed quest points are placed facedown underneath The Orcs' Search (Celebrimbor's Secret, 125), where they force your threat to rise more sharply at the end of each round.<br/><br/>By providing Bellach and his Orcs with even more ways to damage locations and add them to The Orcs' Search, the Celebrimbor's Secret Nightmare Deck forces you to act with more urgency than ever.<br/><br/>",

Wolfpack is set in the vast North Atlantic from late 1941 to early 1943.<br/><br/>Wolfpack is a 1-4 player solitaire/team game. When playing solo, the player will command 2 - 4 submarines. In a team game, players will command 1 - 2 submarines depending on the number of players. The convoy merchant ships and escorts will be controlled by an AI system. In Wolfpack, players will assume the role of a German WWII submarine commander. Players will need to work together to achieve victory.<br/><br/>In a game of Wolfpack, players will start by approaching the Allied merchant ship convoy while trying to make it through the escort's screen undetected. If successful, your submarine will make an attack run on the convoy. As the commander, you will make many decisions like maneuvering your submarine to the best firing angle while making TDC (torpedo data computer) calculations for each of your torpedos, trying to achieve your best shot. You will issue orders to your crew to deal with any damage that your submarine may have sustained. Should we run silent? Do we press the attack? The decisions are up to you. Do all of this while trying to sink as much allied merchant ship tonnage as possible and avoid being detected and sent to the bottom by the allied escort ships.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You can improve their happiness by sending them to one of the four temples; at the end of the round, the most pious at each temple will get the biggest happiness boost. You may find it more efficient to bus them from the temples to the local bar, casino, or market for some immediate happiness. Even better, you might get them to come back to the temples again afterwards.<br/><br/>Players start with an identical supply of six action cards, and there are six different action cards in the pool. In each of the four rounds, players assemble a hand of cards to play from their supply. Then, one card at a time, they choose a replacement card from the pool (getting a bonus from the top of the card) to go to their supply, before playing one of their hand cards and discarding it to the pool.<br/><br/>Once per game, a player can enlist one of the six advisors for a unique and powerful advantage. Timing is tricky: Some are better if taken earlier, some later, but each player may only take one, and each may only be taken by one player.<br/><br/>The game is played over four rounds, with two to six actions per player per round.

Sometimes, when the mood strikes you&mdash;or when your heroes take a wrong turn&mdash;you may see that road darken&hellip; and then darken again.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios recast within the darker and deadlier shadows of Nightmare Mode. Each Nightmare Deck introduces new encounter cards that you exchange with specified cards from the adventure's standard encounter deck. The result is a more challenging adventure that comes full of novel and thematic new twists.<br/><br/>Bundled as one sixty-card product, The Road Darkens Nightmare Decks modify each of the three scenarios from The Road Darkens Saga Expansion. Because each Saga Expansion endeavors to stay as faithful to the books as possible, it may sound like a daunting task to create sixty new cards to reshape the Fellowship's travels through the second half of The Fellowship of the Ring, but lead developer Caleb Grace assures us that the Nightmare Deck afforded him a welcome opportunity to include many of the story elements he was pained to cut from the scenarios in Standard Mode:<br/><br/>I'm always excited to design Nightmare Decks for our Saga Expansions because there are always things that I had wanted to include, but we simply didn&rsquo;t have the room. While working on The Road Darkens, I found myself saying things like, &ldquo;This will have to go in the Nightmare version&rdquo; whenever I had to cut something that I liked. For example, serious fans of The Lord of the Rings may have lamented the exclusion of the Watcher in the Water&rsquo;s many tentacles, or the absence of the Balrog&rsquo;s fiery whip and flaming sword. Nightmare Decks give us the opportunity not only to increase the difficulty of the scenarios, but to appeal to our fans by introducing more of these memorable parts of the story.<br/><br/>",

Millions have been left homeless, driven from the charred carcasses of once great cities. Millions more cower beneath the iron heel of foreign rule. Awesome weapons of destruction rain down upon the earth, blasting the land itself into a blackened cinder. Mankind stands on the edge of midnight as the wheel of history turns toward its darkest hour.&quot;<br/><br/>AE-WWII is a alternate-history WWII game played with metal miniatures- the miniature range is currently very new, but several new releases are planned for 2007.<br/><br/>",

Both players starts with 21 pieces divided in 7 single use columns of 3 pieces each and the goal of the game is strategically move them all from the upper to the lower floor, one by one, looking forward to become the first to get just one piece left.<br/><br/>Three kinds of actions are allowed:<br/>1. Exit - Progress a single piece from upper to lower ground.<br/>2. Move - Move a column of 1 to 3 pieces to one of the nearest spaces (one square, orthogonal and diagonal).<br/>3. Merge - Merge a column with another one standing in the nearest spaces (columns are exclusive and no one can be split or have more than 3 pieces).<br/><br/>What firstly seems an easy task suddenly becomes a mess, with both players trying to take profit from opponent positions, while saving the best exit spots for themselves. Once a piece reaches a lower floor position it cannot be moved and that exit spot cannot be used by the opponent.<br/><br/>Wins the game the first player to have only one piece left on the upper field, however, it isn&rsquo;t finish yet, as the other player needs to take the necessary moves until also finishes the game (the number of used moves is the score of the winner). The first to reach 7 or more points wins the match.<br/><br/>",

The collected animals will be placed in available pens on your ranch. Each pen can hold only one type of animal. The more of a single species you collect, the more profitable your ranch will be. Collect only a few of a species, and you might lose money.<br/><br/>While collecting animals, you'll also encounter space cats, which will cling to some of the animals you collect. Collect one or a bunch to earn points. Collect a few or none, and you'll lose points.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Set in a dystopian cyberpunk future, players take on the role of a data-jack, a mercenary hacker who leads a small team of trusted operatives and disposable freelancers. Funded by shadow backers, the data-jacks accept jobs from faceless clients for profit, glory, and better chrome ... always better chrome.<br/><br/>Battles take place in the concrete jungle known as the Sprawl, but data-jacks must remain wary of the threat posed by Cyberspace. Hacking rules are pivotal to the game, with data nodes, robots, machines, and even enemy chrome presenting potential targets for a cunning data-jack. No-one plugged into Cyberspace is entirely safe from intrusion, and the electronic sprites and digital djinn you can deploy alongside your team can be just as dangerous as any mercenary or assassin.<br/><br/>Gameplay focuses on individual characters, with each skirmish offering you the opportunity to earn experience and equipment for your data-jack and operatives. A wide range of items and upgrades are available, from advanced weaponry and synthetics through to cyber-implants, biological enhancements, clones, and much more. This is a world obsessed with whether something can be done, not whether it should.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The Gloster Gladiator Mk.I was a British-built biplane fighter, used by the RAF and the Royal Navy (as the Sea Gladiator variant). It fought against stronger foes during the early days of the WW2, but it acquitted itself reasonably well in combat. The Gladiator saw action in almost all theatres during the WW2 with a large number of air forces. One of the best-known campaigns fought by Gladiators was the siege of Malta in 1940. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft were Dag Krohn, Marmaduke &quot;Pat&quot; Pattle and George Burges. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW2 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW2 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

Yes, sometimes life could be really good. Her lair was nice and damp. Her mates&rsquo; leg bone was still juicy. Her babies skittered around the web-lined tunnel, too small to do any harm, but big enough for a sweet meal soon. Life has its moments.<br/><br/>A spiderling abruptly turned and ran towards her. Happy days! Her claw snapped out to pierce its abdomen. A succulent dessert would be the perfect end to the meal. As she raised the oozing creature to her mouth, she caught sight of a disturbance near the entrance to her web tunnel. It was not just this one spiderling that was running wild, the whole brood was acting up.<br/><br/>In the dim light, she finally saw it. A slight swirling disturbance in the air, slowly advancing towards her. Was some crazy witch attacking her, in her lovely home?  The audacity! Then suddenly it gained pace, sweeping down the passage towards her. It cleared everything in its path, all the bones, bodies and babies disappearing into the swirling void. With nowhere to go and no time to think, Karakurt stared at the portal, venom dripping impotently from her fangs, as the Conjunction encompassed her.<br/><br/>Suddenly the pain was dreadful!

        "description": "Kellia is a cooperative strategy game for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>Players work together to survive in the Egyptian desert and build their hermitages (kellia). Every turn, they start from their kellion (singular of kellia) at the edge of the board and wander into the desert to explore, build, and gather food and water to survive the night.<br/><br/>The turns have two phases: day and night. Each day, players have three actions, which they can use to move to an adjacent square (and reveal it, if it is face-down), get 'attention to nature' cubes by contemplating the desert, or spend cubes to either build their kellion, improve a resource square or construct a building or resource in the desert. Furthermore, they can exchange cubes with other players they meet or end their turn prematurely by begging for food or water at the church in the center of the board. Players can buy additional three actions by spending an 'inner life' cube. Due to the limited number of actions, turns have to be as well planned in advance as is possible with the hidden information.<br/><br/>During the night, players gain 'inner life' cubes and have to give away food and water. The players often need to cooperate: if one player fails to end the day with at least 1 food and 1 water, the game is lost for everybody. Before the next day starts, an incidence card affects the game: either a sand storm, famine or drought destroys or disables a part of the board, which is chosen randomly by rolling a dice, or bandits, fasting, or akedia affect the players.<br/><br/>The game ends, if one player has no food or water during a night (lost), all players built their kellion and survive the following night (won), or the 9th, 10th, or 11th day is passed without everybody having built their kellion (lost, the number of days depends on the 'difficulty' option).<br/><br/>Kellia is created and illustrated by the Brothers of the Taiz&eacute; Community, which is inspired by the lives of the desert fathers and mothers. It combines spirituality, mutual help, and ecology.<br/><br/>",

Achieve this by tactically building your deck and choosing your actions wisely in the board game, Kings of Serbia.<br/><br/>Basic Information:<br/><br/>This game comes with a rulebook, over 200 cards, resource tokens, and exploring markers. Each player begins with a Personal deck of cards, that represents their people (workers, explorers, soldiers) and a set of Action cards. Each round players place all the cards from their hand onto their Action cards to discover new territories, conquer discovered territories, produce resources, and later sell them at a higher price.<br/>Gold is used for adding cards to your deck, by buying new characters from the market and bringing them to your kingdom.<br/>Character cards have symbols that signify the character's abilities. Each character can be placed on any Action card, but if the character's symbol and action card match, bonus points are granted.<br/>Important aspect of the game is exploring and conquering territories which bring you needed resources and great abilities. What is also interesting about the game is the law of supply and demand of resources because the resource that is offered by more players has a lower price.<br/>The game ends with the round during which a certain number of Territory piles is used up, which depends on the number of players. Then the players count their points from their Personal deck and conquered territories. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>This game has unique mechanics: the cards which you buy and with which you build your deck are also the workers you put on your action cards to activate them.<br/><br/>",

Morale ratings from 11-66. 12 point unit facing and flexible extended line options.  As a result of a morale check a unit can take cover, become shaken, rout, or rout move. Simple but effective command and control rules:  the further a unit from its HQ, the lower its movement allowance.  A unit moving more than half its MA loses firepower during the enemy portion of the turn; if it moves more than its printed allowance (fatigue rules), it can't fire during the enemy portion of the turn.

        "description": "From the publisher web page<br/><br/>Convoy is an operational-tactical game of the Battle of the Atlantic in WW2. Combining large-scale map movement with a fast-play set of tactical rules, the game lets players follow a convoy from embarkation to destination in a single play session.<br/><br/>In the &quot;map game&quot;, convoys move in eight-hour operational turns, rolling for engagements with U-boats, blockade runners, raiders, and even weather. A large-scale map and tables generate one or more events each turn. Some events are resolved immediately with a few die rolls. Others, such as attacjs by U-boats or raiders are resolved with the fast-play tactical rules.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Atlantic is broken down into several areas and periods, each covered in a seperate map/game module. Deadly Waters is the first such module, covering the Gibraltar Run from January 1941 through December 1942. Each module includes a CD-ROM with full-color damage cards for all the ships and subs needed for convoy battles in that period.<br/><br/>Convoy will be supported by other map games currently under development. These cover other parts of the Battle of the Atlantic as well as the desperate Murmansk/Soviet lifeline. Designed by Mal Wright, the game system incorporates Mal's thorough research of published sources including interviews with veterans from both sides of the conflict, and illustrates the operational realities of the Battle of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Both the map game booklets and tactical rules emphasize simplicity and fast play. Accompanied by sidebars and historical background, they are an excellent introduction for a gamer new to naval warfare, or one who wants to deepen his understanding of this critical naval campaign.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the players act with one Gang member at a time, then the other player acts with one Gang member and so on. Each character can make two actions per turn, except leaders who have three. These actions include moving, shooting, entering into melee, hiding, or Waiting and Watching, which allows the character to act out of turn sequence if an enemy moves within their line of sight.<br/><br/>Campaigns are made up of three basic game types: Loot, in which the object is to find and lay claim to Loot (with which to upgrade characters and weapons in between games), Territory games, in which the Gangs fight over specific Objectives, and Grudge matches, in which the sole aim is the elimination of the other team.<br/><br/>Gear, skills and injuries are persistent throughout campaigns, which are Won by controlling a number of territories on a map, each representing an area in which a battle is fought for control<br/><br/>",

The player commands the Japanese forces, with the Allies are controlled by the game system. The player's objective is to accomplish campaign objectives ahead of the original schedule, thereby forestalling the inevitable US-led Allied offensive. A critical factor in the game is victory fever. The more the Japanese are winning, the greater the chance they will have to attain additional objectives to win the game. Another factor is the game ends before the Allied counteroffensive in the Solomons, so there are no Allied amphibious operations. Most ground units in the game represent divisions, brigades and regiments. Aircraft units represent one to three air groups or regiments (three to nine squadrons). Distances between each space on the map vary depending on location and strategic importance, with the distance varying from 1,000 to a few hundred kilometers. Each turn represents one month of operations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Published in &quot;World At War&quot; magazine, issue #75<br/><br/>",

During the game, each player takes on the role of a unique chicken with asymmetric abilities and works together to drive off the invading predators before the third season ends.<br/><br/>Every turn, players choose their own strategy to progress their cause by selecting two of their eight available actions. Along the way, players will also have to manage leveling up, predator loot drops, traveling grubs, and adverse weather conditions. However, players must plan carefully, because as the seasons change, every predator that is still alive grows stronger and gains new abilities.<br/><br/>With eleven asymmetric characters to play and ten unique predators to defeat, Flock Together offers immense replayability that can be enjoyed with quick turns and an experience that lasts 25 minutes per player.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OMWESO is part of the Mancala Family and this version from Cheatwell Games is said to be the variant coming from Uganda.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>&quot;Originating from the time of the Ancient Pharaoahs, Omweso is a game that spread with trade along the Nile and became established as an important cultural pastime in the Kingdoms of Uganda.  Played on a carved wooden board with seeds from the Emkipi Tree, the game was ritually used in the coronation ceremony of each new Kabaka.  Enjoyed throughout the Kabaka's palace, it was played by the King with his principal wives and chiefs.&quot;<br/><br/>As in other versions of this game the essential strategy of Omweso is to capture your opponent's marbles without leaving yourself open to capture.  All of the marbles are kept in play during course of the game, being captured and recaptured across the board.<br/><br/>Like Bao the game is played on a board with 32 pits with each player having an inner and outer row of 8 pits each.<br/><br/>A move consists of collecting all the marbles from a pit and placing them one by one in subsequent pits in an anti-clockwise direction (or optionally in a clockwise direction if from a player's four left hand pits).  If the last marble is dropped into a pit containing marbles, all of these are collected up and play continues.  This continues until the last marble of the move is dropped into an empty pit.<br/><br/>Marbles present in both the inner and outer rows are vulnerable to capture, and, in order to capture a player must drop the last marble of a move into any occupied pit opposite vulnerable marbles.  Captured marbles come across the board and play continues.<br/><br/>The game is won when the opponent is left with empty pits or pits containing only single marbles.<br/><br/>",

You begin as one of the Ascended Kings, when your character falls in combat, you return as an entity known as a Revenant. Every time a Revenant is slain, that Revenant continues to return, providing each player the opportunity to win regardless of the number of times they return from death. Each player begins with a dormant bloodstone, an item that the Kings are desperately attempting to repower. The objective of the game is to obtain all 4 of these bloodstones by slaying your rivals. The fires of immolation are ever advancing forward, forcing players further into combat.<br/><br/>Once a player has reunited all 4 of the bloodstones the Omega Stone will appear, a symbol of ultimate power. The holder of the 4 bloodstones will attempt to claim Omega in order to win the game while their opponents seek to strip the bloodstones from them in order to claim Omega for themselves!<br/><br/>",

Interaction among the players is stressed, with everyone participating. Including stats for 198 different aircraft models. So strap on your Mae West, grab your flying goggles, and scramble to play the game!&quot;<br/><br/>2 teams of 2 or more players construct an air combat engagement using PBVs from the 198 different aircraft stats provided for miniatures. Players simultaneously plot movement and altitude within the performance parameters of the aircraft and take alternating turns executing the movement plot ( braking as needed) then followed by firing.<br/><br/>",

The introduction of VK engines has permitted the Axis' newest aircraft to fly faster and climb higher than anyone believed to be possible just a few years ago. The latest generation engines even allow for near-stationary flight and vertical take-off and landing (VTOL).<br/><br/>The HO-347 Fledermaus III is both a fighter and a very effective ground-attack plane. Its light cannons can destroy other flying units in mere seconds. Its larger 75mm gun is perfect for attacking tanks or walkers at their weakest point &ndash; their thinner top armor.<br/><br/>The fighter/bomber variant of the new Horten, the HO-347 Fledermaus IV carries numerous bombs under its fuselage. Despite their relatively small size, these bombs can be devastating when dropped directly on a target during a screaming low altitude run.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Mythos, a H.P. Lovecraft inspired 1920&rsquo;s horror skirmish game.<br/><br/>In Providence U.S.A a City like many other, the stage is set for what could be the first battle for the very survival of every last man, woman and child of Humanity. A war is coming, though not like the one that ended but a few years ago. An ancient being stirs in the deep, something so powerful that if it were to awaken, it would wipe out Humanity in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>​The Sea Queen has been given the task and sent forth her best, they have made their way to land and now walk amongst you attempting to blend in as they scout this world above the water.<br/><br/>Other creatures born in the wild have been drawn to the area, the woods and forests are their realm and they are fiercely protective of them. They strengthen their numbers with sacrificial magic and awaken the old things of the forest best left sleeping.<br/><br/>Guardians from a long past age have been shipped by chance or fate to the town, their chittering growing in volume as they begin to awaken from their hibernation.<br/><br/>Cultists find key points of power for summoning. Their decades long work finally paying dividends as they close on the secret to moving beyond human form and finding the path of enlightenment that will see them become gods.<br/><br/>And finally, the defenders of Humanity, long since forgotten but still ever vigilant. The prophets have spoken, the signs of something dark and powerful are plain to see and they will not stand idly by but will fight to their dying breath against the coming darkness.<br/><br/>This skirmish game will see two or more players take to the table top to play one of the core game types, or one of the story solo/campaign games of Mythos.<br/> Each faction member is unique, coming not only with their own stats, Mythos abilities and traits but also a second side to their nature. Some will reveal this as insanity takes hold, others will be triggered by certain effects and interactions. Each turn players will alternate their activation's using up all the action points of each character. &lsquo;Live combat&rsquo; will see that not every fight goes your way even if you started it, blasting your foes with ranged or arcane attacks may see them dodge away, taking that valuable item with them as they do.<br/><br/>Balancing your Mythos use will be key, as each point spent also takes away a point of sanity and once you go insane there&rsquo;s no coming back but it&rsquo;s not always a bad thing.<br/><br/>So, are you up for the challenge, to take the fight to your faction&rsquo;s enemies, to put the objective before all else and push past your sanity threshold until all you see is red and insanity takes you?<br/>​<br/>Yes, then welcome to Mythos!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, the mass of ice is melting and everything will sink into the sea if everyone gets on the same ice.<br/><br/>The game consists of 3 rounds, and the players go hunting 4 times on each round.<br/><br/>On each round, 5 prey (ice) cards are placed in a row. Each player places a polar bear token on their lock-on card behind their screen to secretly indicate which preys they are aiming at. When everyone is ready, they remove the screens and reveal where they are going to place their tokens with the shout &ldquo;Three, two, one, Zappaaaan!!&rdquo; and move the tokens onto the prey cards.<br/><br/>Except for the 1st hunting, the prey (ice) card with the most tokens on it melts and sinks after hunting. The players can also use penguin (hindrance) tokens to make other prey cards sink more easily so that the one they want does not sink.<br/><br/>After the 4th hunting is over, each player gets VPs equal to the value on the remaining two prey cards multiplied by the number of their polar bear tokens on them. At the end of the 3rd round, the player with the highest VPs (polar bears that ate a lot of preys) wins.<br/><br/>After the 4th hunting is over, each player gets VPs equal to the number written on the remaining two prey cards multiplied by the number of polar bear tokens.<br/><br/>At the end of the 3rd round, the player with the highest VPs (the polar bear that has eaten the most preys) wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>舞台は、シロクマとペンギンが仲良く暮らす氷の国「Meltyland（メルティランド）」。<br/>お腹を空かせたシロクマ（プレイヤー）たちは、氷の上で油断している大好物のエモノの群れを見つけました。<br/>でも氷は今にも溶けそうで、みんなが同じ氷にのるとエモノごと海に沈んでしまいそうです。<br/><br/>ゲームは全3ラウンドからなり、プレイヤーたちは各ラウンドで4回の&ldquo;狩り&rdquo;を行います。<br/><br/>ラウンドごとに、点数となるエモノカード（氷）が場に5枚並べられるので、各プレイヤーはシロクマチップを使ってどのエモノを狙うかを秘密裏に指定します。<br/>全員の準備が整ったら、「せーの、ざっぱ〜ん!!」のかけ声とともにチップを互いに公開し、エモノカードの上にチップを移し替えます。<br/><br/>（1回目を除く）狩りが終わるたび、のっているチップが最も多いエモノカード（氷）は溶けて沈んでしまいます。<br/>プレイヤーたちは、自分の狙ったエモノカードが沈まないように、ペンギン（お邪魔）チップを使って、他のエモノカードがより沈みやすくなるよう仕向けることもできます。<br/><br/>4回目の狩りが終わり、最終的に残った2枚のエモノカードに書かれた点数&times;のっているシロクマチップの枚数が、プレイヤーの点数となります。<br/>3ラウンド目が終わった時点で、最も多くの点数を獲得したプレイヤー（エモノをたくさん食べたシロクマ）が勝利します。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

It was simply the largest carrier battle of all time which will never be surpassed.<br/><br/>Clash of Carriers, by designer Mark Stille, portrays this epic battle. The historical result saw the Japanese carrier force shattered, never to recover for the rest of the war. While this showdown is almost always treated as a one-sided affair, in this game players will have every opportunity to better the historical outcome or maybe even even reverse history.<br/><br/>The Japanese player can use the superior range of his carrier- and land-based aircraft in coordinated waves to hit the US Navy while his fleet maneuvers out of US aircraft range. Historically, despite poor aircraft coordination, many Japanese aircraft broke through the US fighter screen to attack US carriers. What could better coordination accomplish?<br/><br/>The American player can opt for an offensive strategy with a number of task groups to try and inflict even more massive losses on the Japanese naval force instead of settling for defeating the Japanese air strikes. US submarines inflicted losses and tracked Japanese fleet movements -- can they do so again, or will Japanese counter-measures foil historical results?<br/><br/>Against the Odds #58 (January 2023)<br/><br/>",

It embraces the concept of Japanese home decoration and transforms wood art into an artistic and interactive tabletop game. This new version is inspired by both Romanian and Japanese Culture. While the Woodas rock are inspired by the traditional Japanese rock garden, the Endless Column are inspired by the Romanian infinite column. By combining both the rock and the column together, it has become a masterpiece featuring the beauty of both the East and West.<br/><br/>The game combines balance, patience, reaction and a bit of luck together. It is a wonderful tabletop game and, at the same time, a beautiful decoration for your home. Look at the amazing art work: Do you feel like being in Japan?<br/><br/>For The Endless Column, building a tall tower is not enough. You need a solid one! And as always, beware of incoming attacks! I mean real physical attack! Are you ready to get your Endless Column and build your own endless tower now? Let&rsquo;s go!<br/><br/>Regarding the general gameplay, in each round there will be 3 active players with different roles: Dark Stacker, Pale Stacker and Invader. The Stackers need to compete to be the FIRST to COMPLETE the mission they got from the card(s) in order to score marks. At the same time, the Invader will roll the dice and attack the Stackers based on what they get on the dice. There will be some fun physical movement like firing the dice to attack the tower! Each player take turn to compete and the game goes on until the first player scores 20 marks.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Things are simple &ndash; choose words from different categories, write your own verses on any subject (as long as they rhyme), rap them on the beat, and collect points. At the end of four rounds you will have created your masterpiece: your 16-bar rap song! The player who accumulates the most points wins.<br/><br/>In Rhyme: The Rap Challenge players are aspiring rappers competing to find out who can create the best rap song.<br/>In order to do that, players have 4 rounds in which they must write 4 verses &ndash; 1 in each round. As this is a rap song the 4 bars in each verse must rhyme.<br/>Each round players must draw 3 cards from 1, 2, or 3 of the different categories in front of them and choose 1 word from each card &ndash; 3 words in total. They have to use those words in order to create their verse in 3 minutes time.<br/>In the first round that might seem quite easy as they can write about anything they wish &ndash; which will probably be funny anyway.<br/>The real fun begins after the first round because players have to choose 3 new words from different categories on each successive round and use them to create their 2nd, 3rd and 4th verses while trying to keep a thematic cohesion with the first verse &ndash; they are writing a song after all.<br/>This is easier said than done as the categories do not match between them e.g. pirates, purse, body, house, football, fairy tales, farm and more, so things get easily out of hand resulting in lots of fun and laughter from the verses created.<br/>The best part though is that in the end of each round players will have to rap their verse on one of the beats, which will be available to choose from the game&rsquo;s website. Then players will vote, by simultaneously pointing at the player with the best verse in their opinion.<br/>Scoring - Each round players have the ability to gain points as follows:<br/>1 point for each word that was used in the verse,<br/>3 point, instead of the 1 above, for each word that was used to rhyme,<br/>1 point for the player who finished first each round,<br/>1 point for each vote for the best verse, at the end of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd round.<br/>At the end of the 4th round players will rap their whole song and then have the final voting for the best song. The player with the most votes scores 3 points.<br/>When the 4 rounds are over the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The pieces represent many of the ships of the High Seas Sea Fleet: modernized older dreadnoughts, modernized versions of the ships not completed, and some of those planned or discussed but never built.<br/><br/>There are also two dozen new scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Imperial German Navy in the North Atlantic and North Sea.  This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bismarck and Bomb Alley to enjoy most of the scenarios, and Arctic Convoy and East of Suez to enjoy them all.<br/><br/>This expansion is considered to be part of the Avalanche Press Second Great War alternate history setting.<br/><br/>",

It's popular enough to merit its own weekly TV show, Samschtig-Jass on Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen.<br/><br/>Mostly from David Parlett's The Penguin Book of Card Games:<br/><br/>Deal three batches of three cards to four players, or four batches of three to three players, and turn the last for trumps. Melds don't count, only-trick points, which are the usual 157. Each in turn [starting with Forehand] bids to win an exact number of trick-points. Play as at Handjass. And the end of play, each scores the difference between what he or she bid and what he or she took. The winner is the player with the lowest score after 12 deals. A player who fulfills his or her bid exactly deducts 10 points from his or her total, provided that he or she won at least one trick.<br/><br/>Variant: Players may instead keep their bids secret by writing them down.<br/><br/>",

It is similar to the supply cards, but with double value! He is always strolling around the Gates. Catch him if you can!<br/><br/><br/>    NCBC is a collection of mini expansions based on neutral big scale figurines, which are designed to enlarge the immersive Battalia universe, introducing a whole bunch of new strategic possibilities to the players and adding completely new adventure elements to the basic competitive plot. In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity.

Will you manage to attract more visitors than the other players?<br/><br/>Pretpark Tempo is a card-drafting game with a unique twist. Cards can be played as an attraction or as a potential visitor.<br/><br/>The game consists of two phases. The first phase lasts two rounds. Every turn each player chooses two cards form their hand and then pass the remaining cards to an adjacent player. All players simultaneously show which card they play as an attraction, place it in front of them and activate its special ability. All build attractions stay in play in front of each player to form their own theme park. Attractions all have a type and a theme which contribute to attracting visitors in the second phase of the game. The second card chosen is placed face-down in a shared pile which is called &quot;the visitors' row&quot;. All visitors in this pile will make their appearance in the second phase of the game to choose a theme park to visit.<br/><br/>Whenever one or more players have no cards to pass to an adjacent player - the round ends. A new hand of cards is dealt to each player and a new round starts. After two rounds the first phase of the game comes to an end.<br/><br/>In the second phase of the game the visitors in the visitor' row are revealed one by one. All visitors have a preference toward a certain theme and type of attraction. Players compare their theme parks to find out who has a majority in attractions that are preferred by the visitor to decide which player attracts the visitor. After all visitors are assigned you count how many visitors came to visit your park and add bonus points for your attractions with certain special abilities. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Pretpark Tempo is a contest for majorities. Therefore, it is essential to keep close track of what your opponents are building and make well-considered decisions during the drafts. It plays best with 3-5 players but also contains a solid ruleset for a 2-player game and a solo variant.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dearest Player, you have been invited, at the behest of your titled host, to make your debut during the 1851 social season of Victorian London.<br/><br/>Apistocracy is a 2-4 player game featuring worker placement, as well as a trick-taking game based on Whist. Each player has a season host with a unique ability. The hosts provide influence to open the first doors of the season, but players must make connections, thus building influence, to gain invitations to the most coveted events. Over the course of four weeks, players climb to the top of the social beehive to become Queen Victoria's favorite, commission painting sets in the gallery to become the artist's muse, make valuable connections in the ballroom to become the favored guest, learn secrets in the tea room, and curate their hand for the final whist game in the parlor. The player with the most Victoria points at the end of the season is named the &quot;season's favorite&quot; and wins.<br/><br/>The game offers players nuanced action selection, with opportunities for strategic decision making. Do you spend your resources to move up the beehive? Do you dance in the ballroom to gain a valuable card for your player mat? Do you commission your portrait and complete your painting set? Regardless of your choice, the main goal is to have fun! If you happen to create a buzz and become the season's favorite in the process, then bravo! If you do not achieve the coveted title, you need not give up &mdash; there's always next season!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grand Tactical Rules for the mid-19th century Europe wars of transition<br/><br/>1870 covers the Franco-Prussian War. The rules were designed specifically to accommodate the many large-scale engagements of this important war - from a few divisions to several corps per side.  The intention was to enable gamers to recreate very large battles without getting bogged down in extraneous details more appropriate for regimental-size skirmishes -- indeed, the normal command per player in most games is a corps or two: two to six infantry divisions.  Extensive morale and fire modifiers, multiple movement and fire opportunities, and national or troop type nuances have therefore been kept to a minimum in the interest of finishing a reasonably faithful approximation of a large historical battle in an afternoon.  A half-scale variant of the basic rules enabled smaller engagements to be fought simply by doubling the number of stands per unit in 1870.<br/><br/>Besides the rules, 80 percent of the booklet is devoted to detailed historical notes, background information, orders of battle, and an extensive annotated bibliography which provide ample reference material for custom designing additional campaigns or battles <br/>Fourteen exhaustively-researched historical battle scenarios are included in the book; these cover both the Imperial and Republican phases of the war. Enabling gamers to accurately recreate the wars' most interesting battles. Each scenario also includes &quot;what if&quot; variants positing historically plausible alternative missions or forces.<br/><br/>The book is extensively illustrated in color throughout, and contain ample diagrams and examples of play, formation diagrams, and game board photographs to help the gamer understanding the nuances of formations, maneuvers, and tactics, as well as visually differentiating the three different playing scales available.<br/><br/>Later expanded by 1859. This book consists of two parts: &quot;1859&quot; and &quot;1864&quot;.<br/>&quot;1859&quot; depicts the Second Italian War of Independence between Austria and France/Sardinia. Same scale as &quot;1870&quot;, though the 'Double Scale' in 1870 is renamed 'Half Scale' here. 7 scenarios.<br/>&quot;1864&quot; depicts the Second Schleswig War between Denmark and Austria/Prussia. New Quarter Scale is introduced and used in 2 of the 7 scenarios (the remaining scenarios are at Half Scale).<br/><br/>Summary &quot;cheat sheets&quot; are included with both books.<br/><br/>",

Players alternate playing cards and moving pieces. The game sequence is very interactive, with NO down time waiting for the other player to take his turn. The combat system has both players rolling dice in each combat.<br/><br/>In this two player game each player starts the campaign game and 1914 scenario with cards that also represent the prewar stocks of ammunition, reserves and planning that allows the war to start off with a large bang. After players expend this allotment of cards, they must purchase more cards along with new units. Each player's resources are limited, so players often will not be able to launch large offensives every turn. They'll need to husband their resources. This represents the preparation for the next &quot;Big Push.&quot; All of this leads to difficult game decisions all the way through the game.<br/><br/>There are scenarios for each year of the war from 1914 to 1917, along with a hypothetical 1918 scenario. Also included are the many war plans conceived prior to the war and their appropriate set-ups.<br/><br/>Rules include: Great Offensives, Stosstruppen, tanks, gas attacks, cavalry, huge dogfights, reserves, siege guns, forts, events on other fronts, and much more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the world of Inside the Paint Basketball (ITP) !<br/><br/>The game is driven by double-sided FACs where players make plays and the defense can make defensive stops on the floor or on shots possibly taking away great plays/shots from the offensive player. The use of FACs keeps the action moving along at a pace simulating the real sport.<br/><br/>All of the action comes from the players&rsquo; cards with no chart lookups needed. In ITP, each player will have 3 columns per card showing regular offense, offensive rebound and fastbreak sections. In each section the players frequency of 2/3 FGA, drawing fouls, turnovers and assists come into play. For the Dennis Rodman types when the offense does come his way a simple PASS may be the outcome. Each player has separate GOTO ratings where the more they are involved in the offense the better chance you will see him be called upon to make a play. You often see players that don't have great offensive stats (FG%, TO) but these are often guys that have to create offense. If you don't have a any offensive weapons (good or bad) on the floor then you will see the offense bog down in ITP.<br/><br/>Defense in ITP is not an afterthought and is intertwined into the game at all points. Players are rated separately for steals, blocks, committing fouls and overall defense. A special DENY rating for defensive players works with the aforementioned GOTO ratings where good defenders can actually keep a player from being able to take an action on the court. The defensive ratings come into play in what are called possible defensive stops. There are special notations on the FACs that can possibly stop an offensive action or affect a shot.<br/><br/>ITP keeps the action moving with a fastbreak system that is simple yet effective to use. The run-and-gun style teams will feel that way as will the plodders. Each player gets a fastbreak rating that shows his propensity to get out on the break and, when he does, his card has a column just for that event.<br/><br/>The special Momentum Factor (*MOM) is built into the FACs and either gives a team a boost or causes them to miss some shots. The use of timeouts can readjust this factor and keep the game on an even keel but you must use them wisely as timeouts can be very useful towards the end of a game allowing you to call plays and get extra time when you may need it. Managing timeouts can be very challenging. If you use too many timeouts for momentum swings then you will be limited to using your TO's for subs and especially late in a very close game when you want to call a designed play to a specific player. However, not calling timeouts on a momentum run can cause the game to get out of control, thus hurting a teams' chances to win.<br/><br/>So, if basketball is your game, get out of your seat and get Inside the Paint!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 103 AD, Rome's important port, Ostia Portus, received large quantities of supplies from all over the empire. This port played an important role in transporting food to inland Rome. As the owner of a large fleet, players lend ships to merchants and aristocrats to expand their business.<br/><br/>In Ostia Pirates, powerful pirates await players when they step outside the safety of the Mediterranean Sea.<br/>Players must collect weapons and soldiers and eliminate obstacles that get in the way of their business.<br/>If you can successfully develop a trade route, you can expect to earn enough income to be worth the risk.<br/><br/>Of course, we also need to look domestically.<br/>You can learn about Roman fashion by visiting Trajan's Market. If you capture the public's heart by capturing trends, you may not only improve your reputation but also shed the stigma of the past.<br/><br/>In Rome, people's connections are valued, and factional networks called &quot;familias&quot; are established.<br/>If you can successfully infiltrate a powerful family, you will receive greater benefits from your patrons.<br/>Additionally, merchants form &quot;unions&quot; based on their hometown. Unions have their specialties, so if you can utilize them well, they can be of great help to your business.<br/><br/>Ostia attracts people from all over the empire.<br/>The people who gathered can no longer be accommodated in the current facility. Listen to the requests of the councilors and build facilities for the citizens in the city. Investing in public facilities will not strengthen you in the long term, but it will bring you honor!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Signum Mortis is a game for 3 to 6 players lasting between 3 to 5 hours aimed at more mature gamers. The game - even though cynical and satirical - is based in part on the historical facts as outlines by Marcus Tullius Cicero in his famous speech in defense of Sextus Roscius. Even though you can trust Cicero - as lawyer that he was - to illuminate the 'facts' in a specific light, also according to other sources the proscriptions were every bit as bad and corrupt as shown in this game.<br/><br/>Players take the role of Chiefs of Roman gangs from the Aventine Hill during Sulla&rsquo;s reign of terror and proscription of 82BC. On one hand the players are building a reputation for being most daring, bringing proscribed but highly influential Senators or Equites to 'justice' (by chopping of their heads). By this they gain blood money as bounty while also plundering the homes of those unfortunates. Still, some of that money should better find its way back into Crysogonus&rsquo; coffers. The freedman Chrysogonus was Sulla's right-hand man in this and his 'secretarius' meticulously notes down your name and the bounty paid. Chrysogonus does not look favorable on those lacking generosity in their presents. On the other hand, the gangs also raise money by extorting the grain merchants or the red-light district. Player&rsquo;s might also prey on each other in an attempt to rob the other gangs of their ill-gotten wealth either on the way home or by besieging or storming and plundering their lair. But beware Sulla&rsquo;s veterans patrolling the streets and your competitors as bounty hunter, Sulla&rsquo;s freedmen the Sullani. Players use their boss and his three lieutenants, all of them being specialized for different roles, and beef up their gangs by rogues lending numbers, muscles, speed or stealth. Sometimes guile succeeds where brutal force fails. The hulking brute - worth 3 normal men in a fight - might be hard-pressed to blend into the crowd if a patrol of Veterans enters the city quarter. Players might try to bribe officials to influence the Civil War, steer the patrols or 'ameliorate'their records with the 'secretarius' while influencing the proscription lists. They use prophecies by the witch (the 'Stryga') to influence and scare their superstitious opponents. The overall goal is to become the richest and most infamous of all bosses. Still, finally peace will come. Depending on the outcome of the civil war which the players might vigorously try to influence, the Chief having killed the wrong people and the Chief not having parted generously enough with his money, &quot;unfortunately&quot; will be executed.<br/><br/>This will leave only those of the rich and infamous who survived, to finally win the game.<br/><br/>",

But the aeons-worn ruins of pre-human civilizations hold nameless horrors against which even the miracles of modern science offer little protection...<br/><br/>The Door to Saturn is a fan-made expansion for the Fantasy Flight Games board game Arkham Horror. It's a fan expansion, so players need to print the components themselves. The expansion doesn't really have anything to do with the planet Saturn; it's just a good name.<br/><br/>The expansion adds new Ancient Ones, items, spells, allies and monsters, as well as a new item type - Scientific items. The expansion also introduces the 'Expedition variant', in which Arkham's supply of Clue tokens depletes as Clues are spent, and the players have to venture on to an Expedition mini-board to replenish the supply. The four Expeditions included are &quot;Antarctica&quot;, &quot;Arabia&quot;, &quot;Oceania&quot;, and &quot;Mars&quot;; taking inspiration from Lovecraft's At The Mountains of Madness and The Nameless City, Abraham Merritt's The Moon Pool and Clark Ashton Smith's The Dweller in the Gulf and The Vaults of Yoh-Vombis - among many others.<br/><br/>",

Will you answer the call?<br/><br/>Adventure IN! invites you and up to 4 more Adventurers to explore dungeons in the quest to find treasures and brag about your exploits!<br/><br/>As you journey you will stumble upon Encounters, cards featuring some sort of creature or hazard.  You typically must defeat at least two in order to face the Guardian of the Treasure Horde, the ultimate Encounter!  Each time an Encounter is defeated* you level up, gaining the ability to use more powerful Treasures, such as items which heal and grant special abilities, and equipment and weapons that boost your abilities.<br/><br/>Adventure IN is two games in one!  The base game is a quick, competitive Tournament through a randomly selected Dungeon.  The first Adventurer, or Adventurers, to reach and defeat the Dungeon Guardian will be victorious.  You may choose to cooperate at strategic points in the game, especially at the final Encounter where you may have to choose between winning with a friend or losing to your opponents.  To add variety, Adventure IN also includes a fully cooperative Campaign.  In the Campaign, you and the other players work together to try and beat a series of Dungeons.  Each Dungeon has a unique layout, usually requiring that you defeat several Encounters before facing the Dungeon Guardian.  This mode offers more strategy and depth, but also takes longer to play.<br/><br/>The Game features multiple Dungeons, various character combinations and a large variety of Treasures and other rewards that augment character abilities.  All of this giving the game excellent replay ability!<br/><br/>Are you ready to Adventure IN?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Soul Spire, the first major expansion to Perdition's Mouth: Abyssal Rift, brings new strategies, tactics, elements and such, most of which fans have asked for at one time or another. The expansion includes a newly designed map system, based on tile-able maps, three new factions, at least six new heroes, and a completely new scenario system.<br/><br/>Continuing on from the story in Perdition's Mouth, Soul Spire moves us to an entirely new location with its own rules and problems. Soul Spire comes with three different playable factions that the players can ally with, each having their own story path that describes the events based on your progress.<br/><br/>Scenario 1 introduces the players to new mechanics before branching off down the path of your chosen faction. Your decisions affect how the game progresses and how much more difficult future objectives become, where even victory in a scenario for your faction can ultimately lead to another faction winning the game overall. Each faction has a mini-campaign over at least 3 scenarios, which combined with multiple hero options gives some serious replayability to a more tactical, strategic dungeon crawler.<br/><br/>Expands on the rules first introduced in Perdition&rsquo;s Mouth bringing some entirely new ideas to the dungeon crawler style game.<br/><br/>",

The players move their heroes, the common enemy on the game and the board itself.<br/><br/>It is a game where you are a Greek mythology hero in a quest to win a challenge: be the first hero to defeat the minotaur inside a mobile labyrinth, inspirited in the myth of Teseu and the Cretan Labyrinth. The game objective is enter in the labyrinth's centre without being captured by the minotaur, pick up the Artefact that will give the power to unlock one of the dagger replicas that Teseu used to kill the minotaur. With the possession of the Artefact, return to the labyrinth, without be captured by the minotaur and then, exchange the Artefact for one of the Teseu's Dagger. Equip the dagger and enter the labyrinth again to find the minotaur and then defeat him.<br/><br/>In your turn, the player need make 2 actions: (1) move your hero through the labyrinth until 3 spaces and (2) use the amphora's power (a Gods' magic artefacts) that can help you to move more easy on the path or make your foe's path more difficult. At the beginning of each round, each player buy a MDF card (in amphora format). In the game, exist 6 cards and this cards give 4 different powers:<br/><br/>- Run: your hero can move more 1D6 spaces on the board;<br/>- Move adjacent wall: your hero can move one labyrinth's door, in the adjacent wall. The door move 1D6 spaces on the board and before the dice roll, you need to choose the direction which the wall will move;<br/>- Move non-adjacent wall: your hero can move one labyrinth door, in the non-adjacent wall. This door move 1D6 spaces on the board and  before the dice roll, you need to choose the direction which the wall will move;<br/>- Move the Minotaur: the Gods allow you to influence the Minotaur and you must move it 1D6 spaces through the labyrinth.<br/><br/>If Minotaur find an hero and enter in the same space, two possible events happen: (1) if your hero don't have the dagger, the Minotaur send him to the other side of the labyrinth and the outer level and the hero need start again your path. At the encounter moment, the hero need to leave the Artefact, if it has it.  (2) If your hero have the dagger, you defeat the Minotaur and you are the winner.<br/><br/>",

Now they have to keep exploring the labyrinth, taking all they can carry while they seek a way to escape from this place; but at the same time, they have to watch their backs from themselves as just the one who recovers more treasures will be the real winner of the game.<br/><br/>In this game, all players are represented with a unique token that represents the whole expedition. What happens to this token is decided through anonymous voting using cards, in which every choice is represented with a color.<br/><br/>The game board is built base in tiles of chambers of the tomb. Every tile has a color that shows it&rsquo;s risk level, in a range of 5 colors going from blue to red. The more dangerous a chamber is, the better chances you have to find treasures.<br/><br/>The players decide voting to which type of tile go next, choosing the color of the tile, then placing it connected to the previous one forming a maze that the expedition must explore. In these chambers you can find different types of events that the players must confront to continue, from finding new treasures, facing hard decisions that compromise the group integrity or falling into traps.<br/><br/>In order to escape the tomb, the player will need to find an exit and 4 keys hidden among the treasures to open it, all this while being chased by the tomb&rsquo;s guardian and surviving critical injuries.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marijampolė is an educational strategy inspired by the history of the city of Marijampolė. In the game, 2-4 players are tasked to build a thriving city. However, as history teaches us, every city builder has its own vision and agenda, so it's not an easy task. And in some cases, it can become quite competitive. By building historical buildings, establishing companies, using the strengths of famous Lithuanian historical figures, and surviving the difficult times that affected the whole of Europe, Marijampolė players are able to shape this city as a trading stop, an industrial metropolis or a cradle of culture.<br/><br/>The game features two distinct rule sets. The beginner's version will allow the whole family to take part in building a city while the advanced rule version is for board game enthusiasts who don't mind longer and more strategic play sessions. In addition, &ldquo;Marijampolė&rdquo; can also be a good educational tool. Each card in the game is a real historic building, event, or person and has a detailed fact-checked description. All players build their own vision of Marijampolė but the most prosperous player wins the game!<br/><br/>During the game, players take turns collecting cards from a shared market and playing those cards in front of their tableau by paying the required resources. Game cards are also treated as resources so hand management is an important mechanism in &quot;Marijampolė&quot;. Greater points are scored by having the most cards in the tableau corresponding to the state of the city, that will often change depending on what cards are being played. Sometimes a player will gain points by building wondrous churches while at other times initiating commerce will grant the most progress points.<br/><br/>The game also has Leader cards that grant players unique powers helping to achieve their goals and manipulate the board. In order to slow down the opponent's progress, the player can play special Crisis cards that trigger hardships for the city. It may be used to stop other players from gaining points but prolonged crises can also continue for multiple turns. In the game, each action has a strong effect on other players' scoring potential. Players can cooperate with other players to gain more progress points or counter them by going in a different direction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Reveal the nests of other birds to learn their goals and steal their coveted treasures.<br/><br/>On a turn, the player must flip ('peck') a card- defined as lifting, flipping, then setting it down. This can be done chaotically or with great care, flipping, pushing, and otherwise disturbing cards and feather tokens on the playmat. Once done, the player chooses any card to keep that is not covered by another card, taking any feathers it is touching. Most cards have abilities and combo effects, and as the pile shrinks, players will uncover each other's hidden nests. Uncover a nest to steal from that player, and flip cards to cover up your own. As the pile dwindles, stealing, blocking, and chaining actions becomes critical as you each race to get the most points possible, topped off with bonus points from the type of bird you were secretly playing as.<br/><br/>Get in touch with your inner crowbrain and peck your way to victory (and the shiniest collection of trash)!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The new pieces are taken from Xiangqi (Chinese Chess).<br/><br/>Elephants are added on the outside of the rooks. Elephants move one or two squares diagonally. When an elephant moves two squares, it is allowed to jump.<br/><br/>the two ranks of pieces are moved up, so sit as they would on an 8X8 board. the rank closest to the player is empty except for two cannons on the outer most squares.<br/><br/>Cannons move without taking like rooks, and they move with taking by going in a straight horizontal and vertical line and jumping over exactly one piece: when a cannon takes a piece, there must be exactly one piece between the original and final square of the cannons move - this piece may be of either color. (This is identical to the move of the cannon in Xiangqi.)<br/><br/>Other pieces move as normal. Win is by checkmate<br/><br/>",

Even though the battle was insignificant in numbers of forces engaged compared to other battles fought during World War I, it represent a master-piece of exercising modern military strategy.

Well it covers the Lincoln County War, the unpleasantness in Tombstone. The Demise of the James/Younger Gang, the gold fever in the Black Hills that led to the Great Sioux War of 76 as well as the founding of Deadwood, lots of Apache trouble, the Nez Perce, the flight of the Cheyenne from Indian Territory...and a bunch of other stuff.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re talking Billy the Kid, Pat Garrett, Wyatt Earp, Doc Holiday, Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand, Geronimo, and Wild Bill Hickok to name a few. This is the time period that made the Wild West wild and burned it into the hearts and minds of every kid growing up. Except in Six Gun Sound we dig deeper into it to let you &ldquo;live&rdquo; the time period. How so? You choose what you want to be. Marshal, Outlaw, Ranger, there&rsquo;s up to six different professions. So different that each one has a unique Encounter system that allows you fight the battles that these Gunfighters, Cowboys, and others would fight. What&rsquo;s the &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo; system? It&rsquo;s what tells you who, what, and when you&rsquo;re going to meet when it&rsquo;s fighting time. Now add this to the &ldquo;Campaign&rdquo; system and you&rsquo;re not just gaming the Wild West, you&rsquo;re living it!<br/><br/>With the &ldquo;Campaign&rdquo; system you can travel all across the US and into Canada or Old Mexico if you like. We&rsquo;re talking about 22 different areas that you can travel through. Each one is rated by how &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; it is&hellip;or not. For example, so when you go through Indian Territory expect to find&hellip;you guessed it, Indians. All the work of dreaming up your next bank robbery, gunfight, cattle drive and many other encounters are already done. We&rsquo;ve done all the work, we&rsquo;ve built and populated your world, and all you have to do is enjoy and play the game!<br/><br/>",

A firm favourite with the fans despite (or because of) his brutish, ugly and stupid demeanour, he&rsquo;s the Star Player of choice for Blood Bowl coaches who just want to get the job done. Nothing fancy &ndash; just a trail of smashed faces leading to victory.<br/><br/>Add The Mighty Zug as a Star Player to any Human Blood Bowl team &ndash; not just the Reikland Reavers &ndash; with this resin kit. He can be built clutching the ball in his left arm, or modelled without; all the better for smashing faces in with a swipe of his enormous forearm. His rules, which mostly involve moving forward with the unstoppable grace of an angry continent, can be found as a Star Player card included with the Blood Bowl boxed game, and also in the supplement Death Zone Season 1. This resin kit comes in 7 components, with a 32mm round base and a 32mm round Blood Bowl base, featuring a slot for the ball.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each player then puts one card face down on a yellow space found on the game sheet. On their turn, players put one of their two markers on a small number space (1 to 7) or on a Bonus picture space (All 0's, All 1's or All 2's). Once each player has placed one marker, the process is repeated so players can place their second marker on an unoccupied space. Cards are then turned face up and the total value of the four cards is added up. If there is a marker on the winning number, its owner wins the round and picks up the four cards which he places face down in front of him. When all four cards are the same, this is a Munster combination. If a marker is placed on this combination, its owner collects the four cards and a 10 points bonus.<br/><br/>Scores are added once all cards have been used. One point is scored for each face down card in front of the player and 10 points are scored for each Munster combination. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dark Village is a role-playing game where simple Citizens are terrorized by Werewolves, Witches, or Demons each night.  With <br/>suspicions running high, the Citizens choose a person to lynch each day.<br/><br/>Objective<br/>Good and Evil are at odds.  The Citizens must attempt to rid the village of all the evil players by lynching who they suspect to be causing the nighttime murders. If the village is successful <br/>in lynching all the Werewolves, Witches or Demons during the day, the Citizens win!  If the Evil players succeed in killing all the Citizens, they are victorious!<br/><br/>Components<br/>Dark Village is played with a deck of cards that includes 10 Evil roles and 26 Citizen roles.<br/>          <br/>Setup<br/>A game of Dark Village is easy to get started. Just gather a group of people and have them sit in a circle.  You can be just about anywhere&hellip;on chairs, on the ground, around a table, or on the couches in the family room.  A person who is familiar with the game is chosen as the Narrator.  Cards to be used are <br/>chosen with there being around one Evil player for every 3 Citizens.  The Narrator deals each player a card that becomes their secret role for the game.  A basic game begins with a Narrator, 2 Evil characters and 6 Citizens.<br/><br/>Roles<br/> Narrator<br/> Citizens (Good village folk)<br/> Werewolves, Witches, and Demons (Evil villagers who win by killing off and outnumbering Citizens)<br/> Seer/Detective (Citizen-sided, can inspect for Evil members)<br/> Doctor (Citizen-sided, can choose a player to save at night)<br/><br/>Nightfall&hellip;<br/>The Narrator begins the game by having everyone close their eyes and be silent.  He controls all the actions in the form of a story. (&ldquo;Nighttime has fallen and all the village has <br/>gone to sleep&hellip;&rdquo;) This begins the nighttime phase of the game. Each night, the Narrator has characters awake and perform their actions. He instructs the Werewolves to &ldquo;awake&rdquo; (open their eyes) and see their fellow members.  They kill off one of the Citizens by silently gesturing who they choose.  They must all be in agreement. The Narrator asks one Werewolf to gesture his <br/>battle sign and makes note of it.  The narrator then has the Werewolves go back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; (close their eyes). The Narrator, then, instructs the Seer to &ldquo;awake&rdquo;. The Seer points at a player he suspects of being Evil. The Narrator nods if the Seer is correct.  The Narrator has the Seer go back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;. The Narrator, next, instructs the Doctor to awake and select a person to save.  The doctor silently points at a player goes back to &ldquo;sleep&rdquo;. Last, the Narrator instructs all Citizens to gesture their battle sign and makes note of the sign of the player who was attacked.<br/><br/>Daybreak&hellip;<br/>The Narrator has everyone &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; to begin the daytime phase.  <br/>Unless the Doctor has saved the player the Werewolves attacked or the player has defeated the Werewolves with his battle sign, a murder is announced to the group.  The Narrator tells a story of that character&rsquo;s death.  The dead player may no longer participate in the game in any way.  All the players may now discuss who they suspect as one of the killers.  After enough time has passed, the Narrator calls for a vote on who the village will lynch.  The majority vote causes that player to be hung and killed at dusk.<br/><br/>The Second Night<br/>The Narrator continues the night and day phases until, all the Citizens or all the Evil players have been killed.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>When either all Good or all Evil is left, the game is over and that group wins. Remember, even though you may die, the things you said might provide valuable information to help your group win.<br/><br/>Battle<br/>A Battle occurs between the Werewolves and the player they attack.  A player may only use a sign that is shown on their card.  The outcome is decided by one of the most basic <br/>systems known to man:<br/> Paper beats Rock<br/> Rock beats Scissors<br/> Scissors beat Paper   <br/> Evil wins all ties<br/><br/>Additional Roles<br/>Dark Village includes several additional roles to enhance traditional gameplay. <br/> Priest &ndash; Sees the role of a dead player each night<br/> Mason &ndash; Learns the identity of the other Mason <br/> Dentist &ndash; Every third night chooses a player to silence for one day<br/> Star-Crossed Lover &ndash; Chooses a lover the first night.  If one dies, both die.<br/> Fortune Teller &ndash; learns one player&rsquo;s role a night<br/> Hunter &ndash; Kills another player when he dies.<br/> Peeping Tom &ndash; May peek while the Evil players are &ldquo;awake&rdquo;<br/> Thief &ndash; Steals the role of one player the first night.  The player is dealt a new role.<br/> Lawyer &ndash; Chooses one person to save from lynching each night<br/> Sheriff &ndash; Vote to lynch counts twice<br/> Farmer &ndash; If the farmer dies, the Citizens have 3 days before they starve and die<br/> Scholar &ndash;  learns if an Evil is beside him<br/> Scientist &ndash; learns the number of  Evil alive<br/> Magician &ndash; Dies on second successful attack<br/> Village Idiot &ndash; May only speak gibberish<br/> Gravedigger &ndash; Buries a player alive during day<br/> Serial Killer &ndash; Kills at night on his own. Not part of either group.<br/> Psychiatrist &ndash; Suspects one player of being the Serial Killer each night. If correct, the Serial Killer is &ldquo;cured&rdquo; and becomes a normal Citizen.<br/><br/>Based on Mafia by Dimitry Davidoff and Werewolf by Andrew Plotkin<br/><br/>",

These wars were truly a world affair, with European powers fighting battles not only on the mainland of Europe but as far as India, Egypt, the Caribbean and America.<br/><br/>The greatest generals of the age finally faced each other on the field of battle; The Duke of Wellington, rooted to a little-known ridge, faced, the Emperor of the French. Napoleon Bonaparte, master of the attack, opposed brigades of British, Germans, Dutch and Belgians; brigades of an infamous army that, despite horrific casualties, clung to the ridge for over nine hours to ensure that the arrival of Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussian army would put the Duke&rsquo;s victory beyond doubt.<br/><br/>The Battle of Waterloo became a true landmark in miltary history, one that will never fade, and nothing on such a grand scale would be seen again.<br/><br/>This supplement for Black Powder overviews the main battles, armies and personalities of the Hundred Days campaign, and includes army lists, scenarios and special rules to enable you to re-fight them using the Black Powder rules.<br/><br/>Featured conflicts include:<br/>&bull; Quatre Bras &amp; Ligny (16th June 1815)<br/>&bull; Hougoumont (18th June 1815) <br/>&bull; Waterloo (18th June 1815)<br/><br/>132 pages of Napoleonic army lists, background, troop stats and scenarios make this an absolute must for lovers of Black Powder, of Napoleonic gaming or simply of gloriously produced wargaming books!<br/><br/>You will need the Black Powder rulebook to use Albion Triumphant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Black Eagles Over Belgium: Blucher vs. Napoleon, 1815 is a hex-and-counter wargame covering the Belgium led battles taking place near Waterloo. The game includes three scenarios, the Battle of Ligny, the Battle of Wavre, and the Battle of Plancenoit. A combined campaign is also included with additional rules for movement between the maps.<br/><br/>Black Eagles Over Belgium uses a unique chit-pull mechanic that randomly determines turn length. Each turn, players will draw activation chits that allow a certain number of actions until each player has pulled an &quot;End of Turn&quot; chit and a third &quot;End of Turn&quot; chit is pulled. Players must optimize their actions because they never know when a turn is going to end. Some turns will be as short as 2 movement and combat phases and others could last 8 or 9 phases.<br/><br/>",

Several adventurers have been brave enough to attempt to discover the secret of the temple, yet none returned to tell the tale. What could this secret be? Why do so many go about risking their lives? Are they aware of what lies ahead of them?<br/><br/>The Kingdom of Artheastam has come to the decision to send its three most excellent warriors to face the peril. This will surely not be watched from the sideline by either the offsprings of darkness or the Mountaindeep or by the dispersed spacebenders. The future of their world is at stake, and they want to get hold of their legacy.<br/><br/>In Magitics, a team of heroes controlled by a player must confront the other players' heroes in a diverse arena. Their aim is to be the winner of this fight and get a piece of a crystal that involves magical powers, hidden by Sethemet, the space-time magician.<br/><br/>In this conflict, all players control separate hero troops. During these battles, they may get spells, magic items and valuable loot, which strengthen them. They may receive different benefits, too. Players choose heroes that they want to activate; these heroes can perform various actions up to their available action points. The players' goal  is to ensure that with the right tactical decisions their resourceful heroes prove to be stronger than others or completely overcome their opponents by the end of the round. If all players activated their heroes, a new round begins.<br/><br/>",

The quill is dipped into a container of water and the players attempt to, without verbally communicating, draw a certain symbol on a special sheet of paper where the water appears as black ink, but will dry without effect after a short period of time.<br/><br/>After several drawing strokes, the players choose who, if anyone, to accuse of having been trying to draw a different symbol, and then points are awarded.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ZAG is a visual game about solving graphic puzzles in zig-zag.<br/><br/>Each player has a mini-board, five double-sided tiles and a deck of cards showing visual challenging patterns to solve as fast as one can.<br/><br/>Each card shows a number of tiles to be placed and solve its pattern, from only two to five tiles. But don&acute;t be fooled. Sometimes, a two piece puzzle may be surprisingly challenging.<br/> The deck comes with tutorial cards that help players learn the tile placing rules and practice a little bit before diving into the real ZAG. First: be careful, the board has a specific orientation. Second: tiles are always placed on the board inside its limits. Third: tiles are always placed parallel to the board&acute;s sides, so they are never placed diagonally. And fourth, tiles never overlap!<br/><br/>The game comes with two decks of puzzles: a beginner&acute;s set of 12 cards with hints that show a thumbnail of each tile used to solve that puzzle. Once those cards become too easy, and one might look for a more challenging experience, there is a set of 45 cards showing only the puzzle, without any hint whatsoever.<br/><br/>A game of ZAG is played in rounds. <br/>Each round, give each player a card and they have to solve it simultaneously.<br/>When someone has finished, flip the card face down and say: - ZAG!<br/>Wait until everyone finishes, check if the puzzles were correctly solved and earn the card as points.<br/>After a round for each count of tiles, from 2 to 5, the game is over.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

The Southwest Front of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants struck back, resulting in World War II&rsquo;s largest tank battle.<br/><br/>Fire in the Steppe is a complete Panzer Grenadier game based on the early battles of Operation Barbarossa in Ukraine: the huge tank battles around Brody and Dubno.  There are 42 scenarios based on these battles, organized into &ldquo;battle games&rdquo; that allow you to play the scenarios in sequence toward your army&rsquo;s operational goals. Plus a solitaire campaign game!<br/><br/>Fire in the Steppe includes 562 playing pieces, most of which originally appeared in our old out-of-print Eastern Front game.  There are eight heavy cardstock maps: new versions of those which appeared in Eastern Front, with completely new artwork by Guy Riessen so they match up nicely with those from games like Broken Axis and Burning Tigers.<br/><br/>",

The third force (zombies) heeds the call of whoever holds the Green Skull.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player may move one of their pieces one space in any direction or may make any series of jumps, removing one piece each time. If the holder of the Green Skull jumps, the Green Skull goes to the opponent; otherwise that player chooses a move for the zombies. If the zombies jump, the Green Skull goes to the opponent.<br/> At game end, each force (including the zombies) gets 2 points for each of their own pieces at the far wall and 1 point for every opponent&rsquo;s piece that has been taken. The game ends when all of one side are against the wall or off the board: since the game can end when all the zombies are dead, players may be strategic about the zombies&rsquo; survival.<br/><br/>Each player must judge whether a jump warrants the loss of the Green Skull. So while your opponent has the Green Skull, you can taunt them and dare them to jump, giving you the Green Skull.<br/><br/>",

During the game, the monsters randomly move around the board fighting each other, fighting military units, and destroying cities.  The players lose if the monsters cause too much destruction.  To prevent this, players need to move around the board investigating various locations to uncover a plot.  Once the players have done enough investigating, one of numerous plot cards is drawn.  The plot provides a win condition for the players but also makes the monsters more powerful.  The players must then race to meet the win condition before the monsters destroy Japan.  Aside from uncovering and resolving a plot, players may also build and mobilize military units to prevent the monsters from damaging the cities and buy valuable time.<br/><br/>",

If the characters wish to survive they have to do it themselves by escaping to the outskirts of the town.<br/><br/>In Posthumous, half the players will command a single cliche character apiece, while the other half direct hordes of themed zombies. The town's layout, characters' and zombies strengths and weaknesses are all randomized each game, making every play through a distinguished experience. While on the surface, Posthumous's humor celebrates the proud history of the Zombie Flick, the game is at its core one of cunning and tactical use of your entire team's abilities.<br/><br/>Posthumous's unique mechanics reduce downtime and keep the players plotting, laughing, and guessing.

She excels at fighting multiple opponents, being able to dart into combat using her own constructs as stepping stones, once engaged she can move from opponent to opponent laying down damage and burning tokens. Mei Feng can combo her spells and strikes together into chains, which though card intensive allow her to pull off some impressive feats.<br/><br/>When starting a Mei Feng crew, you will have to buy the Rail Crew box set (Mei is not available to purchase individually at present). This allows you to build a crew for either Arcanists, or 10 Thunders, which will affect which other models you may wish to purchase. The Rail Crew contains Mei Feng, Kang, the Emberling, and 3 Rail Workers. This is all that you need to play either an Arcanist crew, or 10 thunders crew at the 25 soulstone level.<br/><br/>Mei can hire fire gamin, metal gamin, Willie the demolitionist, and a Rail Golem regardless of which faction she is used with. She may never use any models which have the frozen heart ability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aurelian is a tabletop game about the Crisis of the Third Century, the period during which the Roman empire nearly disintegrated in constant civil war and foreign invasions.<br/><br/>Players take one of four roles: a Roman, Germanic, Sarmatian, or Persian commander. Any number of players can conduct a campaign, in which each type of army has a different set of victory conditions. While holding off Rome's many enemies, the Roman players are also trying to defeat each other and ultimately become (and remain!) emperor.<br/><br/>The Persians are trying to carve away provinces in the east and add them to the Sassanian monarchy. The barbarians are trying to raid and carry away as much loot as possible while amassing glory from victorious battles over any sort of enemy, even one's own tribe. Every battle is therefore a balancing act, in which the military and political context is constantly shifting.<br/> Aurelian can be played with miniatures, or with &quot;unit tiles&quot; on any flat surface, much in the same manner as Bl&uuml;cher's unit cards. The centerpiece of the game is the campaign, in which each player manages the fortunes of his character and faction, much in the manner of the campaigns in Maurice and Longstreet. <br/> Unlike most Ancients games, which attempt to span the millennia from Moses to Columbus, Aurelian concentrates on a specific period of roughly 70 years. Players fight a series of nine battles against a variety of enemies, often from one's own side. The composition of their armies changes. Veteran Roman legionaries become incresingly scarce and irreplaceable as the Roman players cobble together vexillations and recruit barbarian foedorati and tributarii. Will the Persians squander their expensive elite cataphracts and elephant units in early battles, or hold them in reserve? Will a barbarian warlord play it safe and not raid as deeply into the empire, at the risk of not bringing back enough treasure and glory to maintain the loyalty of his optimates?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>In 1951, Canada created a brigade to serve as its contribution to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization&rsquo;s defense of West Germany against potential Soviet aggression. Initially designated as the 27th Infantry Brigade, the unit would go through a number of re-namings and re-structurings over the years that followed until the withdrawal of Canadian troops from Germany in 1993.<br/><br/>Composed of long-service volunteers rather than the conscripts who manned other NATO formations, the Canadian Brigade set a standard for excellence in the Alliance&rsquo;s ground forces, and would eventually be assigned a &ldquo;fire brigade&rdquo; role in planning for a potential ground war against the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Iron Curtain - Maple Leaf Brigade introduces the Canadian Army to Panzer Grenadier. It&rsquo;s part of our Iron Curtain setting, looking at a Cold War turned hot in the early 1950&rsquo;s. There are 88 new playing pieces showing the Canadian Brigade in its configuration of that era, with a complete armored regiment and a small helicopter squadron as well as its tough infantry. Plus you get a set of 10 scenarios to use them (that&rsquo;s as many as some publishers will give you in what they call a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; boxed game).<br/><br/>Iron Curtain - Maple Leaf Brigade is a supplement for Panzer Grenadier: Elsenborn Ridge. It is not a complete game: ownership of Elsenborn Ridge, Iron Curtain - Hammer &amp; Sickle and Road to Berlin is necessary to play all of the 10 scenarios included. Iron Curtain - Maple Leaf Brigade also includes 88 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces.<br/><br/>",

In order to take the treasure, player must successfully face off against the pirate ship.<br/><br/>Setup: Place the pirate ship token in one of the extra standees. Place the pirate ship on the Ratnest sea region. All sea boards should be facing the same direction as normal, but it is important in this variant to assure this when determining pirate ship movement.<br/><br/>Rules: As an action, if a player moves to the region that contains the pirate ship, the player may attempt to take it's treasure (which are the coins on the treasure map on the renown board). To succeed, the player must successfully attack the pirate ship. The pirate ship has a strength of 6-8, depending on the number of players (8 in a 2-player game, 7 in a 3-player game and 6 in a 4-player game).<br/><br/>Combat against the pirate ship works differently from the standard combat rules. To fight the pirates, the player rolls a 6-sided die. the player then adds 1 for each pirate and sea serpent in their possession (these are not spend in a pirate attack, simply counted toward the attack total). If the total is equal to or greater than the pirate ship's strength value (depending on the number of players playing) then the attack is successful and the player loots the pirate ship! If a player &quot;succeeds&quot; they take all the treasure from the renown board. This works just like &quot;Hunt for Treasure&quot; but in addition to coins, the player also collects all the fish, wood and book tokens on the treasure map.<br/>After the ship is defeated, the pirates &quot;flee&quot; and move to a new sea region. The player who  defeats the pirate ship chooses one adjacent sea space and moves the pirate ship to it.<br/><br/>After moving the pirate ship, the pirate ship plunders all players' ships in the new space. Each player who's ship is on the sea space where the pirate ship landed must lose 2 resources. Players may choose to lose coins, fish, wood and book tokens in any combination. If a player does not have 2 coins/resources, they do not lose anything. If they only have a coin or a single resource, they lose all they have.<br/><br/>NOTE: Players may not hunt for treasure and collect the coins from the treasure map as per the normal rules; they now must instead try to face-off the pirate ship. NOTE: As an action (after moving), a player may collect a single coin from the bank (like the &quot;Hunt for Treasure&quot; action in the standard rules when no coins are found on the renown board).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chameleon is a chess-like strategy game, played on a 5 x 5 grid,  where each piece's movement capability changes based on the color of the tile where it lands.<br/><br/>In traditional Chess the black and white checkerboard pattern only determines starting positions.  Chameleon's pieces each have a central color or nature.   This nature changes the way each piece can move based on the tile where it sits.  Like a Chameleon, each piece changes based on it surroundings creating a dynamic and fun game experience.<br/><br/>All pieces can always move one space in any of eight directions like the King in Chess. But they have additional Chameleon movement capability that changes according to their nature color and tile color where they are placed - either like a Bishop when on a like colored square, or a Knight when on a square of the opposite color.<br/><br/>There are three winning goals:<br/><br/><br/>     A player who captures all opponent's pieces wins the game.<br/>     A player who moves any one of their own piece to the opponent's area (farthest five tiles), and it isn't recaptured immediately, wins the game.<br/>     If a player who has only one active piece on the board and moves it onto the opponent's area they win the game immediately without waiting for the opponent's next turn.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At stake: the fate of North America!<br/><br/>One side commands the Imperial forces (Maximilian and his French allies), and the other the Allies (US and Mexican Republic).

Combat units represent divisions, brigades, regiments, and groups of partisans/bandits. Infantry and cavalry units include attached artillery, pioneer and logistic support.

Because of its great speed, when it was first introduced, it could be intercepted only from above. It was also used in a fighter escort role and had a crew of two, pilot and observer/gunner. It was flown by a number of famous German aces, including The Red Baron, Manfred Von Richthofen.

Explore the ever-changing island of Dead Cells in this ruthless dungeon crawler. Explore. Kill. Die. Mutate. Repeat.<br/><br/>Choose one of the four Beheaded (Woah, hold on... Isn't it supposed to be only one of these guys? Is this one of those stupid time-loop plots?) As you resurrect with very little clue of what&rsquo;s going on, you will...<br/><br/>&bull; Explore Biomes. Choose your path wisely within a sprawling, ever-changing castle! Will you upgrade one of the character powers with a scroll? Or will you choose a chest to equip a new weapon? Will you find the hidden runes that will open new paths and access new biomes? This won&rsquo;t be a walk in the park, though. Because the island is infested with the abominations born from the Malaise, be ready to&hellip;<br/><br/>&bull; Kill Enemies. Each character class has unique power sets and a deck of action cards. For each enemy encounter, you will only need to pick one action card to cover all three phases of a fight. Loot equipment, gold, scrolls, and Cells from the corpses of your enemies and get stronger, but beware... Your health pool is limited and sooner or later you will...<br/><br/>&bull; Die. Wandering through enemy-infested dungeons isn't the safest activity, even for your beheaded heroes. There will eventually be one monster too many, or you could step on a fatal trap and lose all your scrolls, equipment, and accumulated gold. But this is far from the end for you! Even in death you will be able to keep your precious Cells to&hellip;<br/><br/>&bull; Mutate. The Collector will let you spend your Cells to buy permanent mutations that will give you more power... forever! Choose cards to buy from three different decks: Brutality, Survival, or Tactics. Get action cards to enhance your card deck. Find blueprints to grow your loot deck. Increase your health pool. Unlock additional item slots, and much more&hellip; Unless you prefer to throw your Cells into this mysterious well... It seems like a pretty stupid thing to do with your hard-earned Cells, but hey, you do you, bud... Death is no excuse to take a nap, so...<br/><br/>&bull; Repeat. Death is not the end either! You&rsquo;ve already lost your head, remember!? As the day starts again in a new loop, use your new permanent mutations to exact revenge on whatever killed you last time. Go further and deeper into the island and kill the bosses to access new starting biomes. Previously-played biomes keep changing as stronger monstrosities spawn in them, along with powerful new items. (Damn! Will this game ever end?)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the late 18th to the middle of the 20th century, the Indian subcontinent was perhaps the most valuable overseas possession of the British Empire, commonly referred to as &ldquo;the brightest jewel in the Crown.&rdquo;  Defense of the critical trade routes connecting this jewel to the other reaches of the Empire and Great Britain herself fell primarily to the ships of the Royal Navy Indies and China station squadrons.  While the surrounding waters of the Indian Ocean were essentially a &ldquo;British Lake&rdquo; by the early 20th century, during the Great War German raiders still made several daring forays into the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, successfully interdicting vital commerce and tying down Allied naval resources.<br/><br/>Bay of Bengal is a 64-page supplement for the Great War at Sea series that examines situations of naval combat arising in and around the northeastern part of the Indian Ocean, as the British attempt to defend the trade routes and ports of their colonial prize from enemies historical and hypothetical.  Nine battle and twenty-one operational scenarios examine situations ranging from the adventures of the famous German raider Emden to pre-dreadnought era battles against rival colonial powers, and on to possible later conflicts with the Japanese feared by some members of the British government.<br/><br/>This supplement contains no pieces or maps, but requires ownership of Mediterranean, Cruiser Warfare, Jutland and Pacific Crossroads as well as the operational map from Second World War at Sea Eastern Fleet to play most of the scenarios, while Plan Gold and Sea of Troubles are needed to enjoy them all.<br/><br/>",

Players use hand-picked teams of extraordinary creatures to battle until one player has no one left.<br/><br/>Learn the game in 3 minutes, play a match in 5-15 minutes.<br/><br/>Players begin a standard match with a team of creature cards and 4 button cards representing A, B, X, and Y actions.  A single creature card is the active combatant for each player while all others sit on the side awaiting use.<br/><br/>All creatures in the game possess types, a weight, a passive ability, and a special action tied to one of the four button cards.<br/><br/>Each round, players secretly and simultaneously select a first and second action card.  Players reveal and resolve their first action and then reveal and resolve their second.  When directly contested actions occur, the lighter weight creature acts first.<br/><br/>By default, the A action deals damage, the B action prevents damage and then deals damage back to the attacker, the X action switches out a player's active combatant for a different one, and the Y action prevents future blocking or takes control of an opponent's attempt to switch.  A creature's special action entirely replaces the default effect of one action button.<br/><br/>Types have no innate effect on gameplay (so players don't need to remember special rules based on types) but are sometimes referenced in passive abilities or special actions.<br/><br/>The most important effect in the game is damage.  Rather than dealing with health totals, chits, dials, or dice, a creature is either damaged or it isn't.  When a creature becomes damaged, it is flipped over to its damaged side.  If a creature that is already damaged becomes damaged again, it is defeated.<br/><br/>When a player's last creature has been defeated, so has that player.<br/><br/>",

In the Battle of Trafalgar, she achieved glory under commander Don Cosme Damian Churruca and provided an incredible example of Spanish heroism, fighting British ships after the loss of over 400 officers and crewmen. Ultimately, she was captured and renamed by the Royal Navy.<br/><br/>This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish Nepomuceno class &ldquo;San Francisco de Asis 1767.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guan Dan (掼蛋), or &quot;Throwing Eggs&quot;, is a 4-player, fixed-partnership climbing card game. It is played with two standard decks and each player starts with a hand of 27 cards; these are typically held in a jagged 2-dimensional array with each rank grouped together--vertically--and then arranged in ascending rank order--horizontally.<br/><br/>The game is related to Zheng Shangyou and other climbing games. Its main distinguishing feature is its scoring system: Each team's score is expressed as a card rank, starting at 2 and progressing up to Ace. This is similar to the trump promotion system in Chinese trick-taking games like Da Bai Fen. In Guan Dan, however, instead of determining trump, the highest card rank score determines the rank that beats an Ace, and two cards of that rank (the Hearts) become wild cards. The first team to win a hand 1-2 or 1-3, when their score has reached Ace, wins.<br/><br/>Like many climbing games, Guan Dan's playable combinations include Singles, Pairs, Triples, Full Houses, and Straights. There are also Plates and Tubes, which are consecutive pairs or consecutive triples, respectively. Finally, there are a variety of bombs ranging from 4-of-a-kinds to 10-of-a-kinds as well as straight flushes and the 4-Joker bomb. Given each player's hand size, the variety of combinations available, and the inclusion of wild cards (which can be used to form bombs), the options presented to players at the outset of a given hand are particularly numerous.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

But only 8 of these cards are used in each game; these are selected by the players using a secret drafting method, so nobody knows exactly which cards will be part of the set.<br/><br/>Players are dealt character cards of lower or higher value. Each round, a scene card is flipped over. Players can play a card to the corresponding scenes in which the specific character appears. But choosing the right moment is crucial because character cards become more valuable in the later rounds! The question is whether there will be another matching scene coming up later! Otherwise, players risk penalty points for cards remaining in their hand at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The winner will be the player with the highest score &ndash; ultimately the one who is most successful in playing the right cards at right moment.<br/><br/>In the year of its release, the game was awarded the Game of the Nation 2021 (Orsz&aacute;g J&aacute;t&eacute;ka) joint professional prize in family &amp; party category, as well as the JEM Board Game Award (JEM T&aacute;rsasj&aacute;t&eacute;k D&iacute;j) in national development category by most popular Hungarian board gaming magazine JEM.<br/><br/><br/>Gyors &eacute;s izgalmas k&aacute;rtyaj&aacute;t&eacute;k, melyben Rumini &eacute;s bar&aacute;tai kalandjai elevenednek meg. 32 jelenetk&aacute;rty&aacute;t tartalmaz a j&aacute;t&eacute;k, ezek mindegyik&eacute;n n&eacute;h&aacute;ny Rumini karakter szerepel.

They have their own team of competitors who they train, equip, advertise and so on.<br/>But they also have somebody else up their sleeve. The Hunters &ndash; psychopathic murderers, empty of any feeling or emotion, human monsters. But they are monsters who are bigger stars than any other celebrity.<br/>The aim of the player is of course quite obvious &ndash; make the most money and gain the most fame and prestige. Oh, and remember &ndash; do not let the competition outsmart you!<br/>The fight to stay on screen and be loved by the crowds is neither easy nor simple. And it&rsquo;s not a fair fight by any means.<br/>Intrigues, betrayals, temporary alliances and broken deals. The producers will do anything to reach their goal.<br/><br/>How the gameplay looks:<br/> When creating their teams, players also build their own deck of Action Cards. Action cards allow you to move characters on the board, build a pool of &quot;fans&quot; or use special actions (buying new contracts, weapons, using special abilities of characters, etc.). Action cards also determine the order (initiative) in which players can move.<br/> The game is divided into 12 rounds. In each of them, players draw 4 cards and, by playing it alternately, make their moves according to the initiative and the actions assigned to them. They can also use Intrigue Cards - which make the game more difficult for other players. At the start of each new game round, an Event card is drawn that describes &quot;what's new&quot; happened in the program and what circumstances need to be resolved - but this is also possible during the round (players can also initiate their own events themselves).<br/> Characters moving on the board can fight each other. Fight is done by using and influencing a pool of dice (re-rolls, changes to results due to character and / or weapon abilities, etc.). Players earn points for eliminating characters and completing contracts. They can also earn special bonuses for special achievements (most participant eliminations, top performer, last survivor, etc.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It covers the Allied invasion into Italian Eritrea in the north where the most intense fighting took place, especially around the town of Cheren. The Allies invaded Eritrea with two Indian Divisions and some Free French units. The defending Italians consisted mostly of colonial Brigades, recruited among Ethiopians and Eritreans. They also had two metropolitan Divisions in reserve among which several elite battalions from the &rdquo;Grenadiers of Savoy&rdquo; Division were sent north to Eritrea. These battalions (Alpini and Bersaglieri), together with loyal Eritrean colonial troops held both Allied Divisions at bay for eight weeks at Cheren before the survivors were finally forced to retreat towards the Eritrean capital Asmara. The battle of Cheren is seen as an hour of glory in the Italian army. The game introduces a dynamic Order chit system. You decide in advance during each Order Segment a set of Orders, each one with a certain priority value, and so does your opponent. The Priority value decides which Order will be executed. You will have to choose wisely depending on what forces you have at hand, when you wish things to happen, and what you suspect your opponent will choose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On their turn, Runemasters roll four unique dice and combine their results in various ways to attack enemies, move around the temple, prevent monsters from advancing, use their individual powers, or trigger powerful one-time effects.<br/><br/>Evil forces are relentless and will keep coming until dawn arrives. Werewolves, warriors, skeleton archers, trolls &mdash; all have their unique abilities, and you need to adapt constantly to new threats if you want to have a chance to survive until dawn. Runemasters have their own abilities, too, some particularly efficient at eliminating enemies while others focus on healing and protecting their teammates.<br/><br/>The game ends in victory if Runemasters successfully protect the temple until dawn (a special card placed among the final four cards of the deck) or in defeat if the Runemasters are killed or the temple destroyed.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>Ravaged during the Succession Wars and poorly governed by paranoid Chancellors, the Capellan Confederation has languished at the mercy of its more powerful neighbours for centuries. However, the time of Xin Sheng has arrived. A new birth. The devious and brilliant Sun-Tzu Liao leads his people into a glorious era of national pride and prosperity. Through subterfuge and warfare, he is driven to reclaim everything the Confederation has lost.<br/><br/>BattleTech Field Manual: Capellan Confederation provides an in-depth look at the rising power of House Liao, including profiles on every Confederation regiment and the regiments of the newly conquered St. Ives Compact. Special rules reflecting the unique abilities of each regiment are included, along with new equipment and 'Mechs exclusive to the Capellan Confederation.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This sequel to the earlier House Liao (The Capellan Confederation) follows the same format as the other BattleTech Field Manuals in that it focuses largely on the military structure of the Capellan Confederation before introducing a scattering of new equipment, 'Mechs, vehicles, a Warship and some Battle Armour.<br/><br/>While this sourcebook is out of print, it has been released in an electronic format by the new license holder, Catalyst Game Labs, making it much easier to get hold of than some of the other Field Manuals.<br/><br/>",

The place is a remote swath of empty terrain in the Chu Pong Massif foothills. There's one problem...almost an entire NVA Battalion is streaming out of the foothills toward you and your men. It's November 1965 all over again and YOU are under fire on a 'Hot LZ' and there is only one way in and one way out...by air. New counters join the system in the form of multiple helicopter models, the 'Thumper Gunner', M60 machine-guns, and more.<br/><br/>With ATS LZ X-RAY you'll be brought in....and hopefully back out again in a series of scenarios that depict the action from initial landing to Hot LZ and then some. Moore, Plumley, and all the valiant soldiers depicted in the book and movie &quot;We Were Soldiers Once&quot; are there and back in action again, facing a determined enemy with one goal: overrun the LZ and the men of the 7th Air Cav. You'll find all the termite mounds you can handle, NVA Regulars, historical leader counters, and Hueys...Hueys...Hueys...in various models. All with DETAILED COLOR MILITARY ART used for the die-cut counters.<br/><br/>LZ X-RAY provides all the combat counters you need to play, just bring your own ATS marker counters, ATS rulebook and standard play aids.<br/><br/>",

The French II Corps, reinforced with the Light Cavalry of the Imperial Guard, is ordered to take the crossroads and send some troops to the east to help Napoleon, who is fighting the Prussians.

The French must take the town of Thyle and the British must hold it.  Counter density is very low.<br/>    Hooves of Destruction - where the French Cuirassiers and Lancers of Pire's 2nd Cavalry Division manage to catch a British Battalion unprepared for a cavalry charge and the unthinkable happens.<br/>    The Guard Attacks - the British Guard has popped out of the Bois de Bossu and is hitting the French to push them south.

No longer are the days of going to school, working for the same company, and having 2.4 children with your heterosexual spouse. In FML! The Game, your life can go any direction: will you be a transgender hooker or a divorcee doctor with 9 kids? Every new game is a new experience!<br/><br/>To play, you first choose your gender, hop in your car, and start on either the college or burnout track. From there, simply roll the die and perform the action of whatever space you land on. If you land on a space that contains the FML! logo, draw an FML card. These are wild cards have instructions from paying money to singing a song.<br/><br/>After retirement, all players tell their &quot;FML Life Story&quot; - a hyperspeed explanation of why your life was the most unforgettable. How did you make your millions? Who did you father? Any interesting injuries or lawsuits? When everyone has finished, vote on the winner.<br/><br/>",

In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replayability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files. The miniatures are distributed in small packaging boxes with custom artwork as separate items or possibly in bundles.<br/><br/><br/>",

Players must start new railroads, they may expand existing railroads and they are able to trade stocks in the railroads.<br/><br/><br/>There are 6 colors of wooden locomotives, each color representing a railroad. Players are dealt random hands of 5-10 (depending on number of players) locomotives, which are essentially a stock portfolio; the rest of each color are placed in a pool. On your turn, you can start a railroad or increase the value of a single railroad by placing 1-5 locomotives from the remaining pool of that company or you can trade one locomotive in your portfolio for one or two locomotives from the remaining pool in a railroad.<br/> The game board is a map of Germany, with cities worth anywhere from 1-8 points. Connecting to a city adds to a company's value. The game holds 3-6 players for about 30 minutes.<br/> The game ends when there is a railroad in every purple city or when it is agreed that this is not possible. Players' scores are determined by the value of each railroad at the end of the game, multiplied by the number of stocks the player has for that railroad.<br/><br/>Berlin Connection uses the components found in Queen Games&rsquo; Paris Connection game. The Berlin Connection game comes with 2 11x17 maps of Germany that require trimming and the rules necessary to play Berlin Connection. You must own Paris Connection to play this game.<br/><br/>",

And neither carriages nor the vaults guarded by the sheriff are safe from them. Which of the players will manage to scam the most money through cleverly planned moves, good card management and a little luck?<br/><br/>In Showdown players either use their turn to take a new card or play cards from their hand. A card always show 2 out of 5 possible actions. When playing cards players can play a number of cards of their choosing as long as all played cards share the same symbol and that symbol is visible at least 3 times on all cards played.<br/>The active player then activate ALL symbols on the played cards, grouped and in order of their choosing.<br/><br/>The symbols have a variety of possible actions and let you move your bandit to the next spot or send the sherif off to guard the next vault of the bank in the middle of the board. Players can steal from a carrier or from other players by rolling dice and players can even save some of that well earned money so it can't be taken away from them ever again.<br/><br/>But the sheriff of Slingshot Canyon is always vigilant and once he reaches his lookout, players not in hiding or in disguise will lose some precious coins. <br/>As the game progresses the path the sheriff takes gets shorter and shorter and players have to play their hands smart to not lose it all. The player who leaves the Showdown of Slingshot Canyon the richest, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It also brings you thirty-one tiles, a Zverograd city poster, a map of the Zverograd metro, six new scenarios, and over two dozen objectives to serve as the basis of your own scenarios. Finally, Operation &quot;Hades&quot; marks the arrival of Winter Child, the game's first superhuman soldier.<br/><br/>Operation &quot;Hades&quot; introduces new rules for underground fighting, as well as rules more specifically designated for scenarios fought in Zverograd&rsquo;s sewers and metro.<br/><br/>During underground combat, troops must cope with dim lighting and confined quarters. There is very little light beneath the city of Zverograd. Units can hear enemies coming, but they are hard to make out in the darkness. As a result, it's not uncommon for soldiers in such tense conditions to fire blindly into the shadows ahead of them when they hear enemies approaching. The darkness of the underground grants a unit increasing levels of cover the farther it is from an attacking unit, and units cannot target foes with four or more spaces between them.<br/><br/>",

This is a moderate complexity wargame with detailed naval and supply rules, and a map and order of battle representing the authoritative treatment of the campaign. The overall game presentation is enhanced with a mounted game map and larger 9/16&quot; counters.<br/><br/>Heia, heia Safari! was a call which for four years echoed throughout East Africa. With this call the officers of the Schutztruppe in German East Africa rallied and encouraged their askari in the defense of their country during the First World War. This small force, whose strength never exceeded 3,000 white and 12,000 black soldiers (askari), was opposed by some 300,000 men (150,000 at any one time), comprising British, Indian, Rhodesian, Nigerian, Gold Coast, South African, Belgian and Portuguese troops. Led by Major-General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, the Schutztruppe fought within its own home territory for the first three years of the war. During the final year von Lettow-Vorbeck transferred his resistance to Portuguese East Africa and trekked south to within 60 km of Quelimane. He reappeared in Northern Rhodesia in November, 1918, and that is where news of the general armistice that ended the war reached him.<br/><br/>With more than 20 published designs including many on relatively obscure topics, Dennis Bishop delivers a compelling game experience and intriguing look at the East African Guerrilla war, 1914-1918. Forces represent the German, British, South African, Portuguese, and Belgian combatants. Special rules provide a game that is highly-playable yet rich in historical detail featuring weather effects, supply and supply depots, replacements, provisional reinforcements, rail movement, naval transport, naval battle, amphibious assault, aircraft, blockade runners, garrisons, German retreat movement, Allied ambush, infiltration movement, land and naval reaction, artillery bombardment, and more.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 8 out of 10 (no hidden units)<br/>Time Scale: 1 month per turn<br/>Map Scale: 30 miles per hex<br/>Unit Scale: Divisions<br/>Players: one to two, best with two<br/>Playing Time: 3-4 hours<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On a player&rsquo;s turn she can use the power of any one of her pieces on the board (which generally involve movement, pushing and killing enemy units, or adding new units to the board).  She could also use the powers of multiple pieces if those pieces occupied the same space on the board and formed a stack.<br/><br/>Knowing when to stack and unstack pieces and clever tactical use of the powers of the pieces are key to winning the game.<br/><br/>",

Under the command of Cranston Snord, an officer disgraced and discharged from Wolf's Dragoons, the Irregulars gained a reputation for unorthodox tactics and a fetish for collecting lost artifacts and treasures. Now, 43 years later, Cranston has given his daughter Rhonda active command of the Irregulars. Under her leadership, the Irregulars have grown in size and reputation.<br/><br/>The Federated Commonwealth command used the Irregulars against House Marik with satisfying results, and they looked the other way when the Irregulars went collecting. Now, the battered Federated Commonwealth wants the Irregulars to conduct raids into Clan-held territory. The Irregulars are willing to take on the Clans, but they have another objective in mind; a Star League naval base believed to be deep inside Clan-held territory.<br/><br/>Rhonda's Irregulars is a BattleTech scenario pack chronicling the Irregulars' history from Cranston's discharge from Wolf's Dragoons, to their actions in the Fourth Succession War, to their battles, including Operation Merlin, the Irregulars' foray into Clan territory. Also included are new 'Mechs and vehicles used by the Irregulars, unit rosters, and personnel files.&quot;<br/><br/>This BattleTech scenario pack follows on from the BattleTech: Cranston Snord's Irregulars scenario pack, updating the unit roster and history.

        "description": "Post Captain is a solitaire PNP game of sailing, sea chases, and espionage during the Napoleonic Wars. You take on the role of a young captain who has just been given command of his first ship. The game's missions revolve around the the tangled web of political intrigue surrounding Napoleon's plan to invade England.<br/><br/>The game play focuses on navigation, 1 on 1 sea battles, and assaults by landing parties. The dramatic chases of naval literature are reproduced using an abstract system that represents the relative speed and position of each ship. Each turn the ship that has the highest maneuverability is considered to have the &quot;wind gauge&quot; and gets to move (closer or farther away) and/or attack. The captains navigational and crew assignments choices define his ships maneuverability each turn.<br/><br/>The primary game play mechanic revolves around the orders you give to your crew. You assign crew to different positions on the ship in anticipation of where you think the wind or the enemy will be. The game is divided into two segments. A &quot;Mission&quot; segment where you navigate on a large map attempting to reach objectives on time and a &quot;Chase&quot; segment where ships engage each other.<br/><br/>The goal of the system is to simplify naval combat to focus on dramatic storytelling rather than focusing on charts, modifiers,  counters, and complex rules. All conflict resolution is handled by drawing colored cubes from a cup.  This will tell if a test was successful and in combat it also tells what part of the ship is damaged. As a solitaire game the goal is to achieve enough mission objectives to earn renown in order to increase your rank and upgrade your crew.<br/><br/>",

After fighting during the American War of Independence and in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780), she took part of the Napoleonic wars, where she fought at the Battle of Algeciras in 1801 and the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. In Trafalgar, under the command of Felipe Jado and Cagigal with 711 men aboard, she was surrounded by several ships of Nelson&rsquo;s squadron. They fought for hours, but after the third approach, she was after being dismasted and with 180 dead and 200 wounded, the British offered terms to surrender. The ship was burned on October 29.<br/><br/>This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish 74-gun ship-of-the-line class &ldquo;Bahama 1780.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brian Train's District Commander is a series of operational games on counterinsurgency situations. The players alternate activation of groups of units (stacks) to perform discrete operations (missions) through the expenditure of Task Points (TP). Some missions are Tactical Missions - straightforward military tasks such as performing patrols, ambushing or attacking enemy forces, or moving from one place to another - and these may be performed multiple times by a stack during a turn. Other missions emphasize the &quot;non-tactical&quot; end of the campaign, establishing friendly influence, control, and infrastructure in an area, reducing the enemy's claim to the same, and recruiting or training troops. These missions take more time to perform and so unlike the tactical missions may be the only mission performed by the stack during the turn.<br/><br/>Missions are resolved by play of secretly-held Chance Chits, each with ratings that are better or worse for certain types of operations. Chits are played simultaneously and the ratings compared, modified by units, assets, and the current board state to determine the outcome. Using the right chit at the right time - knowing when to save a good chit for later and when to use it, and trying to determine if your opponent is going all-in or holding back - will require steely judgment in an atmosphere of doubt and deception.<br/><br/>All this is done in pursuit of objectives handed down to you by your superiors (i.e., chosen randomly) and kept secret from your opponent - objectives that may even change over the course of the game. Within this framework, the two sides - Government and Insurgent - play very differently, with the Insurgent player, in particular, depending on bluff and deception to achieve their goals. A large number of variant rules allow you to turn the game into a sandbox for exploring counterinsurgency doctrine and practice.<br/><br/>This first volume is District Commander Maracas. It takes as its subject counterinsurgency operations in a megacity - the urban battlefield of the future, and the cutting edge of modern doctrine. The sudden departure from power of Jesus Shaves, charismatic leader of Virtualia, has created a power vacuum in the streets of Maracas, capital city with a population of over 3 million people. The Virtualian Liberation Movement is exploiting this situation by organizing areas of the city against established authority, sabotaging civic services, and staging attacks on symbolic objective points. The local security force commander must contend with not only the urban guerrillas of the VLM but also private neighborhood armies and criminal gangs running amuck.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Space Lane Trader, you are playing a character in control of a cargo ship, trying to make a fortune in the newly opened up shipping trade. You buy and sell goods transporting them between planets within the Terran Federation, preferably to where demand and prices are high. The main objective of the game is to earn money (credits) faster than your competitors and return to show off your success.<br/><br/>During the course of the game, you can fit your ship with upgrades that will make it go faster, attack harder and defend better &ndash; all with the goal to ensure that you manage to beat your competitors to the goal. You can also buy new ships with better capabilities, that can carry more goods for you, go faster or fit more upgrades.<br/>Your character will develop during the game &ndash; from the inexperienced person starting play at Terra station in the Solar system, to a grizzled space ship captain with much improved skills. You develop your character by spending Experience Points (XP), that are earned by drawing Event cards as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The most obvious way of earning money is buying goods, transporting it to another planet and selling it there. Another way however, is attacking your competitors and take what should have been yours anyway. Winning combat against another player will allow you to either steal cargo from your opponent or take loot in the form of Debris cards. Debris cards can either give you valuable salvage that can be sold on planets, or the best equipment in the game that will improve your ship beyond the capabilities of your competitors.<br/><br/>Not all parts of space are safe. Planets away from the most busy parts of space are characterized by a wild west mentality and the Terran Federation security forces don&acute;t have the capacity to uphold law and order everywhere. This is reflected by two different security levels in the game &ndash; green and yellow. Green  security level planets are safer, and although bad things can happen, the negative consequences are not so extensive. On security level yellow planets however, the dangers are higher but also the rewards.<br/><br/>",

Collecting the prize knowing they have pulled off the impossible. This game for 2-5 players aims to recreate the tension and thrill of planning and executing high-stakes heists, with cards and actions inspired by these movies and shows, as you and your fellow players take on the role of Masterminds.<br/><br/>Combining drafting, dice-rolling, and a strategic press-your-luck style of mission completion, Masterminds - Heist Society will test your risk/reward intuition as you play. Players can take it safe &amp; slow to skip the die rolling and guarantee a win, but another player may swoop in and grab the prize out from under you with a more reckless luck-oriented plan. Either way, the prize goes to the first team to complete each heist&rsquo;s combination of challenges.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Panda Spin, each player attempts to be the first to rid their hand of cards, collecting bamboo in the process to keep their pandas well fed.<br/><br/>In more detail, Panda Spin is a climbing game played with a special deck of &quot;double-headed&quot; cards. All cards start with the orange animals toward the top. Each player receives a random wind card &mdash; each of which has a unique playing condition &mdash; and a hand of eleven cards, with the remaining cards placed in a deck.<br/><br/>During the game, players lay down cards to tricks as singles, in sets, in runs, or in formations (two consecutive pairs, two consecutive triples, etc.) If you're the first player in a trick, lead what you wish other than a bomb, that is, four or more cards of the same value. In turn, players must play a higher matching set of cards, e.g. a higher three-of-a-kind on a three-of-a-kind, or pass, after which they can no longer play in a trick. (A bomb cannot be lead, but can be played on any card combination.)<br/><br/>When you pass, if you've played cards and all of those cards have orange animals at the top, flip the cards so that the blue animals are at top. Each time you flip a card, you change its value depending on its suit: e.g., the water 4 becomes a pair of Qs, the wood 6 becomes a A+bamboo (and each time you play a card with bamboo, you take a bamboo token from the reserve), the earth 8 becomes a Q+panda (with you stealing a bamboo from an opponent for each panda you play), the fire 3 becomes a 10+fire, with the fire being a value of your choice when played.<br/><br/>If you pass and the cards you've played have at least one blue animal, you discard all of those played cards. The winner of the trick always discards all of their played cards, then they lead to the next trick. When you play a wind card &mdash; the south wind, for example, beats a run or formation with 3+ different numbers in it &mdash; you draw two cards from the deck; subsequent players need only beat the card combination played prior to your wind. If you play a wind, you always discard all cards you played to the trick.<br/><br/>When a player runs out of cards &mdash; that is, they &quot;show out&quot; &mdash; they score bamboo equal to how many cards are held by the player with the largest hand. When all but one player have shown out, the round ends, then you shuffle all the cards (including the winds) and deal everyone a new hand. A player immediately wins the game when they have at least twenty bamboo &mdash; but they must score their 20th bamboo by showing out; playing wood and panda cards scores you no bamboo when you have nineteen bamboo.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kokoda Trail is a 64-page book supplement to the Panzer Grenadier series, focused on the fierce fighting that took place in the Owen Stanley Mountains in 1942. Designer Dave Cheever has crafted 30 new scenarios based on these battles, taking place on two new mapboards with artwork by acclaimed wargame artist Guy Riessen. There are three background articles: Australia's Armies, Japan's Special Naval Landing Forces, and War on New Guinea. The former two include unit organization diagrams.<br/><br/>This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Afrika Korps: The Desert War – Platoon Level Combat in World War II: A Panzer Grenadier Game and Guadalcanal: Semper Fi Series to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>Additionally, one scenario requires U.S. Army pieces which can be drawn from Battle of the Bulge: Platoon Level Combat in World War II – A Panzer Grenadier Game.<br/><br/>",

She does not care what sacrifices it takes to complete her machines. Her mechanic requires you to have played cards(not discard) in order to complete the required components(the card type determines what components it counts as). She is the hardest megami to learn , and will remain that way according to the designer.<br/>Thallya is a megami who was formerly a human from another land/country. She rides a motorcycle and fights with a &quot;sword-whip&quot;. Her mechanics revolve around her &quot;fuel&quot;, an extra resource that many of your cards require to use, or can make use of. She also has the ability to gain unique basic actions via transforming(utilizing her S4 special card)While she has a high skill cap she is easier to approach than Kururu.<br/>This expansion adds more difficult mechanics than prior expansions, according to the publisher it will likely remain the most mechanically difficult expansion.<br/><br/>Sakura Arms is a Japanese dueling living card game made for 2 players, in which players build 10 card decks from a limited pool in order to reduce the opponents life to zero.<br/><br/>",

In this way, the Poles blocked the only escape route for German troops locked in the so-called Falaise Pocket.<br/><br/>The game Hill 262 - Chambois, 19 - 21 August 1944 presents the Allied fights during closing and defending the Falaise Pocket. The main hero is the 1st Armored Division of general Stanisław Maczek. In addition, there are American and Canadian units.<br/>There are 6 scenarios in the game. 4 of them are short clashes to familiarize yourself with the procedures of the system &quot;Great Battles of Small Units&quot;. The main subject is the defense of the Allies and German attempts to get out of the pocket. The chaotic organization of the German army in this battle is shown in a simple way. At the beginning of the game a German player chooses battle groups that he will try to move out of the board. The Allied player does not know the opponent's plans. Only during the game it turns out which units appear in the game.

The gameplay is driven by the railroads which formed the territory and later the state. The boom-and-bust cycle directly impacts the towns and cities of the state and therefore the revenue of the railroads. Coal and Oil Companies in this game do not necessarily represent coal or oil discoveries, but instead represent investment for development in the area &ndash; indirect drivers of revenue. The map is reflective of the immense emptiness and its widely varied and rugged terrain.<br/><br/>",

But if you feed it the best human food we have to offer, you will curb its human hunger and help it become the most powerful monster in the wild. Luckily, you&rsquo;ve discovered the scenic hills of West Virginia - the one place in the world where the food is delicious enough, the people are friendly enough, and the landscape is majestic enough to take the edge off any monster&rsquo;s human hunger. Here, your monster will take part in a weekend of feasting on the world&rsquo;s best cuisine. But be careful, your fellow humans may try to sabotage your monster&rsquo;s next meal and leave you to become a human corn dog.<br/><br/>Each round the humans will submit dishes to a meal that the hungriest monster will eat. The hungriest monster is decided by the Hunger Level tiles which the humans will secretly choose for their monster before each meal is revealed. The meal will be revealed and the humans will then play Monster Power cards to sabotage other monsters or help their own. The Hunger Level tiles will then be revealed and the hungriest monster will eat the meal and add the total to its Power Level. If a monster eats too fast and exceeds level 20 it becomes too powerful and explodes. If it doesn&rsquo;t eat the right stuff and goes below level 1, it becomes hangry and eats its human. The most powerful monster standing after 15 meals will be the winner!<br/><br/>",

Once terminal cancer patient Wade Wilson, I, the aforementioned Wade Wilson, was transformed into the incredible superpowered hero Deadpool! Thanks to the nerds at the Weapon X program, I was granted an off-the-charts healing factor which allows me to recover from even the most gruesome &ldquo;for the love of all that&rsquo;s holy, look away Timmy!&rdquo; injuries. I&rsquo;m also basically a ninja&ndash;expert marksman, a master in multiple martial arts (including the deadliest of all, Karate), and I speak, like, nine languages. But my greatest superpower of all is my dazzling wit and immeasurable charm. Though teams like the X-Men and Avengers would literally kill to have someone like me on their roster, I, the aforementioned Wade Wilson, a.k.a. Deadpool, remain los lobos&ndash;a lone wolf who hunts the moonlight desert in search of the only meal that will satisfy my endless hunger&ndash;justice! Also, they haven&rsquo;t been returning any of my calls or emails&hellip;<br/><br/>A cowardly young man, Bob was persuaded to join the criminal organization Hydra by his wife, who accused him of not being able to hold down a steady job. The thought of a stable career with a dental plan also appealed to Bob, though he was ultimately disappointed to find out that Hydra does not, in fact, offer full dental like A.I.M. Bob&rsquo;s life was forever changed when he met Deadpool during the Merc with a Mouth&rsquo;s assault on his outpost. Deadpool convinced Bob to assist him with his mission and the two became lifelong partners. These days the H on Bob&rsquo;s chest no longer stands for Hydra but Hero!<br/><br/>",

His niece, Jeanne de Penthi&egrave;vre, the wife of Charles de Blois, and Jean de Montfort, husband of Jeanne de Flanders and half-brother of Jean III, claim the ducal crown of Brittany. In less than an hour, battle to know who will become the next Duke of Brittany!<br/><br/>Breizh 1341 is a card-driven game between two players, one taking the lead of the Franco-Bretons of Charles de Blois and the other controlling the Anglo-Bretons of Jean de Montfort. The game is played in a series of turns, during which each side carries out military and diplomatic actions akin to those which were common in the 14th century. Historical figures also influence the course of the game. Nobles must be rallied to support your claim, troops recruited and subsequently led into battle or sent to besiege castles. After years of confrontation, the player who controls the most territories, castles and supporters will become the new Duke of Brittany!<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 map<br/>76 event cards<br/>40 wooden cubes (20 red and 20 blue)<br/>40 wooden cylinders (20 red and 20 blue)<br/>42 counters (markers)<br/>1 dice<br/><br/>",

Together you will have to help them organise a smooth event while keeping an eye on your own goals.<br/><br/>The players will have to place the different animals at the tables, trying to take advantage of the characteristics of each one of them to complete their objective cards and thus obtain as many points as possible.<br/><br/>On their turn, players take an animal token from a bag and places it on one of the tea tables. This triggers an effect that the player will have to resolve. In addition, players can also resolve scoring cards from their hands on their turns if they have managed to fulfill the requirement for one.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no possible placements left or when the scoring cards deck runs out. The winner is the player with the most victory points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Corvette Command is a strategic level solo narrative generating game giving you the chance to experience the worst that the Atlantic can throw at you while taking on the German U-boats. Your crew starts out raw and with basic skills which they get the opportunity to improve over the course of the campaign. Your mission is to protect the convoy from attack and success is measured by the scale of the losses incurred rather than by how many U-boats are sunk. If vital supplies are lost then this can impact on how quickly new technology becomes available to you such as radar and HF/DF detection.<br/><br/>It is May 1941 and the Battle of the Atlantic is reaching a critical point. The Royal Canadian Navy has extended its convoy cover eastwards and the Royal Navy has pushed their cover west so that convoys are now escorted the whole way across the Atlantic. For the purposes of game play only these two forces have been combined and you command a single Flower Class Corvette all the way across the Atlantic. Although the &ldquo;Escort Gap&rdquo; has been closed the &ldquo;Air Gap&rdquo; remains. The escorts are still waiting for the arrival of ship borne radar and spotting surfaced U-Boats and keeping station on convoys in the dark and poor visibility is still reliant on the lookouts. Ship to ship communications is also via signal lamps and flags and occasionally by loud hailer. The game ends on 31st May 1943.<br/><br/>This is a free print and play game that can be played in a small footprint with optional advanced rules that enable you to play a quick set up one-off game or a two player game and introduce greater level of detail.  If you enjoyed Nicholas Monsarrat&rsquo;s book or film &ldquo;The Cruel Sea&rdquo; then don your sea going gear and head out into the Atlantic.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Those with greater power can make sweeping movements greatly altering the course of the struggle. Lesser Priests, while more limited in might, are able to move more freely.<br/><br/>Movement<br/><br/>A piece can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally exactly the number of spaces as the value currently on the die. After, you move, transfer power with the pieces you jumped (see below).<br/><br/>Landing on Pieces: You may land on a piece (yours or your opponent&rsquo;s) only if your piece has a higher value than the one it is landing on. The piece that you land on is destroyed. The capturing piece gains +1 power.<br/><br/>Power Transfer<br/><br/>As pieces move over one another, they exchange power. You give (1) power from your moving piece to each of your own pieces that you jump. Your piece takes (1) power from each enemy piece it passes over.<br/><br/>Underpowered and Overpowered Pieces: During movement, if a piece falls below (1) power, it is has become underpowered and is removed from the board. Likewise, if a piece gains more than (6) power, it has become overpowered and is removed from the board.<br/><br/>Winning<br/><br/>There are two possible ways to win Metis.<br/><br/>1. Occupy seats in your opponents Temple of Metis. There are two areas in each players temple: The inner chamber (darker) and the outer chamber (lighter). Occupying a seat in the inner chamber is worth 2 occupation points. occupying a seat in the outer chamber is worth 1 occupation point. You must hold 8 occupation points to win the game.<br/><br/>2.

The STOP chip is undetectable when played and only shows itself when the opponent attempts to flip it. The DOUBLE chips always show and it doubles the points scored in that row when it gets flipped.

        "description": "After over a century of border disputes with Ecuador, the Peruvian Army began a massive build up for a final reckoning. With modern tanks from Czechoslovakia and modern artillery and planes from Italy, South America's first unit of paratroopers and a battalion of marines, Peru unleashed its blitzkrieg in July 1941. The war lasted for seven weeks, ending with a crushing Peruvian victory as Ecuador was forced to hand over half of the territory claimed by the Quito government.<br/><br/>War on the Equator is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier system based on the battles waged between Peru and Ecuador in 1941. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front and Road to Berlin. There are six scenarios, each based on an actual battle and featuring tank assaults, parachute landings, amphibious assaults, horsed cavalry and river gunboat operations.<br/><br/>War on the Equator is sold exclusively via PDF download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game's components.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Road to Berlin: Platoon Level Combat in World War II – A Panzer Grenadier Game<br/>    Eastern Front: A Panzer Grenadier Game<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Iris is a two player abstract strategy game that is played on a &quot;hexhex&quot; board (a hexagonal shaped board made with hexagonal cells).  An Iris board has rainbow colored perimeter cells and gray interior cells. Boards of sizes 5-8 cells per side are recommended.  (Size 5 is recommended for beginners.) Player 1 plays with black stones and Player 2 plays with white stones.<br/><br/>On the very first turn, Player 1 plays a SINGLE black stone to any gray cell.  Thereafter, starting with Player 2 on his/her first turn, each player plays TWO stones per turn, subject to the following restrictions:<br/><br/>1) If the first stone of a turn is played on a colored perimeter cell, then the second stone MUST be played on the corresponding same-colored cell on the opposite side of the hexhex board.  (In the case of a corner cell, the corresponding same-colored cell is the opposite corner cell.)<br/><br/>2) If the first stone of a turn is played on a gray interior cell, then the second stone MUST be played on any empty non-adjacent gray cell.  (If all remaining empty gray cells are adjacent to the first stone, then the second stone is forfeited.)<br/><br/>When the board is full or when both players consecutively pass, the game ends and players score their groups of stones.  A group&rsquo;s score is equal to the number of colored cells that it occupies.  The player with the highest scoring group wins. If scores are tied, then players ignore their highest scoring group, and compare the highest scoring of their remaining groups.  If still tied, then players compare their next highest scoring groups, etc., until the tie is broken.  (Despite there being an even number of colored cells, for subtle reasons having to do with board geometry, it turns out that draws are impossible.)<br/><br/>(A note on the game's name: &quot;Iris&quot; was the Greek goddess of the rainbow.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Honors<br/><br/><br/>     Iris was a finalist in the Best Combinatorial 2-Player Game Contest of 2019<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Only your teammates can see your rocket components -  will you risk an accident in the production yard? Then try to launch and steer clear of a Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly!<br/><br/>The game starts with the Build Phase.  Each player is dealt a starting hand of Rocket Cards facing AWAY from them.  Players take turns playing one unseen card from their hand onto the field, trying to match it with the Starship's blueprints.  Alternatively, a player can choose to give a hint to a teammate since players can see their teammate's hands.  Players must used memory tactics to manage their turn's action with overall team strategy.  Successful plays of Rocket Cards reward players with Development Cards which can be used to increase the rocket's chance of a successful launch.<br/><br/>If the players successfully build the Starship in time, they move to the Launch Phase.  The launch consists of different stages that must be successfully passed.  To pass each launch stage players take turns randomly drawing from a special hand of cards that is determined by the Development Cards acquired during the Build Phase.<br/><br/>The game is won if players successfully launch and land their rockets during the Launch Phase.  The game is lost if the rocket explodes during launch, or if too many construction accidents happen during the Build Phase.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The other employees will then pick up their implement cards, and use this to dispatch this soul in the setting revealed.<br/><br/>Get your elevator pitches ready and be prepared to impress against a one minute sand timer in order to become employee of the month in this exciting new deadly game! Can you come up with a murderous plot? Or be forced to think on your feet?<br/><br/>Could you dispose of a chicken farmer on a volcano with a whisk? Or a medium on a cruise ship with a lightbulb? <br/>How can you exterminate a patronising life coach, at that place where he goes to forget his family, with a sweaty sock at your disposal? <br/>The manager picks their favourite pitch and awards a card of recognition.<br/><br/>The game ends when an employee has received 3 cards of recognition, has become employee of the month, and has won the game!<br/><br/>Disappointing the line manager could leave you receiving disciplinary card. That's gonna make life harder to get those recognition cards!<br/><br/>This is an exciting new opportunity and we can't wait to share our death with all of you!<br/><br/>And remember, it's good to be G.R.I.M.!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This new edition takes us from the death of Alexander in 323 BC and the war of his successors &mdash; the Diadochi &mdash; which will last fifty years, to the last battles in Italy and Spain of the Second Punic War in 206 before BC, via the expedition of Pyrrhus, king of Epirus in Italy between 280 and 275 BC.<br/><br/>Two great systems of weapons clash then, the Macedonian phalanx and the elephants against the legions of the Roman Republic, but the battle of Cynoscephalae will not take place until 197 BC and the phalanx is not yet obsolete.<br/><br/>Champs de Bataille is a board game largely inspired by an English rule for miniatures called De Bellis Multitudinis published by the Wargames Research Group in the early 1990s, four booklets of army lists ranging from 3000 BC to 1500 AD accompany this rule.<br/><br/>The general classification of troops allows not only armies to compete in historical battles, but also non-historical adversaries thanks to its budgeting system, providing practically endless what ifs.<br/>The adaptation for board game makes it possible to play many battles of antiquity on a small surface and without figurines with on average between 20 to 30 counters on each side.<br/>Overlays to be cut are also provided to vary the battlefield. No two games of Champs de Bataille will be the same.<br/><br/>Through eight lists that will allow you to experiment with many army combinations and four historical scenarios(*), this module will give you the opportunity to replay many battles with a relatively simple system.<br/><br/>(*)    Paraitacene (317), Gaza (312), Ausculum (279),  Ilipa (206).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (edited)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THEME: By the summer of 1849, the California Gold Rush was in full swing. In this fast-moving game, you and your fellow players own competing General Stores in a boomtown where new gold was just discovered. You must battle it out selling specific supplies to the gold prospectors flooding into town. But first you must either buy the goods from local suppliers or trade with a devious gang of vigilantes when supplies become too scarce. And of course, you must move quickly to make your fortune; because in just 6 months, the gold will run out in this town and the prospectors will move on to another!<br/><br/>GAME PLAY: The game is played over 6 Rounds &ndash; one for each month from July through December. Each Round has 2 Phases: Production Phase and Buy/Sell/Trade Phase.<br/><br/>During the Production Phase, each of the 8 Suppliers produce Goods (or has Goods stolen by the Vigilantes!). Production is random based on the Production Cards that are chosen each round, so some goods may quickly become scarce!<br/><br/>During the Buy/Sell/Trade Phase, players either buy Goods from the Suppliers, sell the Goods needed by a Prospector to make a sale and claim the Prospector Card, or trade Goods with the Vigilantes.<br/><br/>Some claimed Prospector Cards include a Contract Goods bonus which can be used to make future sales &ndash; making this an &ldquo;engine-building&rdquo; game!<br/><br/>Play continues for 6 rounds (representing 6 months) with special rules at the end of September when the Vigilantes flee and drop their stolen goods for players to grab, and during the final month of December when the gold has run out and prospectors are stocking up quickly to move on to the next boomtown.<br/><br/>GOAL OF THE GAME: Win the game by collecting the most Provision Points from completed sales to the Prospectors, as well as Bonus Points from individual Bonus objectives achieved at the end of the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The monks who inhabited said castle lived periods in which a call-to-arms would make knights out of them. In this game, this duality is present in the split value of cards and the twofold way they can be played: either facing up or down.<br/><br/>Each round, players will play character cards. Simultaneously, they will try to guess the sum of the score of all currently played character cards. The goal is to find out whether the friar&rsquo;s value or the knight&rsquo;s value is equal or greater than the history value of the castle card being contested in the current round.<br/><br/>The game is over when the 12 rounds are finished and the players count the points in the Castles cards. The winner is the player with the most victory points.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player has a blue, a yellow, and a red worker. Each time a player places a worker, they will activate that location's action, plus an additional action determined by the worker's colour.<br/><br/>Players can unlock the full potential of biological upgrades, by infusing their workers with biological upgrades that will grant them a decisive edge over their opponents.<br/><br/>Each worker location has been forever transformed by vast bio-enhanced changes. Collect elements from the floating cities and use them in various ways. Trade them for objective cards, establish dominance over particular elements through strategic investments, or harness their energy to upgrade your airship. With each move, you accumulate points, driving you closer to victory at different stages of the game.<br/><br/>The player who has best harnessed the newfound powers of this biopunk universe, and used them to collect the most amount of points after four years (rounds) will win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Our new-model Golden Journal features a &ldquo;real&rdquo; booklet, just like a small magazine, and a small set of die-cut, silky-smooth playing pieces.<br/><br/>In January 1943, the German Army began to re-organize the shattered 78th Infantry Division on a new pattern, one based heavily on the experience of German and Italian units in North Africa. This new-model Storm Division would rely on more automatic weapons and fewer soldiers, with heavier allotments of support weapons and anti-tank guns, too. Infantry organizations &ndash; squads, platoons, companies and battalions &ndash; would be radically re-organized around this concept as well. The new organization would have its first test at Kursk.<br/> Golden Journal No. 49: Storm Division provides you with 24 new pieces adding Storm Platoons and additional support weapons to Kursk: Burning Tigers. You can use them in Burning Tigers (where the Storm Division appears in three scenarios) and in the five new scenarios included in the Journal.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players can play like a merchant by dodging pirate ships and delivering goods to ports that need them. Or players can play more like a pirate and attack nation ships and merchant tokens. Or perhaps players start off playing like a merchant and turn to piracy midgame. Players even have opportunities to be pardon for their crimes of piracy to return to a merchant lifestyle of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Marshals V is a complete game from the series The Marshals. It covers the campaigns of spring and autumn 1800 that took place in Germany from the crossing of the Rhine to the banks of the Inn. General Moreau, whose successes would later be overshadowed by those of Napoleon in Italy and the improbable victory of Marengo, is at the heart of this initiative. In six months, he manages to force back Kray&rsquo;s and then the Archduke John&rsquo;s Austrians from France&rsquo;s doorstep to the confines of Bavaria with the culminating decisive battle at Hohenlinden.<br/>The three first scenarios describe Moreau&rsquo;s entrance into the campaign with the hazardous crossing of the Rhine, the gruelling march through the Black Forest, the concentration of the three army corps from Sainte Suzanne, Saint Cyr and the army reserve coinciding with the flank assault from Lecourbe&rsquo;s corps, the counterattack of the Austrians under Kray, and the undecided battles of Engen, Mol&szlig;kirch and Biberach. The French must demonstrate their resourcefulness as Napoleon grows impatient and demands reinforcements from Moreau to support his offensive in Italy. Time is running out; advance in the direction of Ulm before the order arrives for the troops to depart toward the south.<br/>The three scenarios that follow relate the events in Bavaria that lead up to the clash at Hohenlinden in deplorable weather. The Archduke John, propelled by his ardour, decides to assault the French at Munich while the latter marched toward them. This battle of encounter is decisive, contrary to the battles of the spring. With this victory, Moreau succeeds in bringing to an end this war with Austria.<br/>With this new volume, the series The Marshals continues to evolve. The experience of playing numerous games as well as the requests of fans of the series led to minor adaptations integrated into the general rules as well as the addition of new optional rules. Will you fare as well as General Moreau and succeed in competing with  Napoleon&rsquo;s rising star?<br/><br/>The game includes :<br/>&bull;    A recto-verso 59x41 cm map board<br/>&bull;    216 recto-verso, pre-cut counters and markers<br/>&bull;    A rule book and six scenarios<br/>&bull;    A game help in colour<br/><br/>Units: divisions, 1 SS = 1000 fantassins, 500 cavaliers or 1 artillery battery<br/>10 kilometres between two zones<br/>Turns represent one day<br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/><br/>",
