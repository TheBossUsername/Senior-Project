        "description": "Head Hackers is a party game about reading minds and stealing clues!<br/><br/>Strap on your tinfoil hat and lock eyes with your teammate. In this game, you have to get them to read your mind...while keeping everyone else out.<br/><br/>Pass on the Secret Word by writing down three one-word clues. If your teammate shouts out the correct answer, you both walk off with the points. Just watch out for the other teams as they'll be trying to get inside your head, second-guess your Clue Words, and steal your points. Points mean moves on the board. First around the board and back to their Home Square wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player commands an army of soldiers through movement and combat phases.  The rules cover movement, shooting, charges and combats, morale, and more.  Each player fields an army constructed from free army lists utilizing a points system to arrive at historical and competitive army compositions.  Players collect and paint historical armies based on the free army lists. Combat is resolved by a single dice roll for each figure, creating a fast and streamlined system that simultaneously does not compromise on detail.<br/><br/>War and Conquest features randomized initiative rolls for more dynamic battles and introduces a mechanic called &quot;Strategy Intervention Points&quot; which allow the player to influence morale, initiative, and even terrain placement to turn the tide of battle in their favor.<br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of the French Republican forces lead by Bourbaki trying to raise the siege of Belfort and threatening the Prussian line of supply running from Germany to Paris. The other player is in command of four strong german corps who must prevent this threat and destroy the French Army.<br/><br/>This is an operationnal game, with hidden corps, division, columns or dummies evoluting on the map featuring the eastern part of France, from Dijon to Colmar, one turn for one week.  The map represents all major cities, fortresses, main roads and railroads, based on point to point movements. Infantry, cavalry, artillery and siege artillery units are placed on boards for each nominative combat force on the map. Their status is follow-up on this board ; full or reduced strength, supplied or unsupplied, their tired level &ndash; rested &ndash; tired &ndash; exhausted -. Normal and railroad movements are done through activation shits. Initiative may switch from one side to the other, depending on the number of combat forces moved on the previous turn. There are three combat resolution tables ; pitched battles and skirmish, depending of the sizes involved in the fight, and a specific siege table. Reconnaissance and retreat are possible before fights which are never mandatory. A dozen of random events bring chrome and allow uncertainty.<br/><br/>La campagne de l&rsquo;Arm&eacute;e de l&rsquo;Est (The East Army Campaign) contains three independant scenarios The opening fights in Burgundy (5 turns, 2 hours), The last rides of the vanquished (6 turns, 3 hours) and the Campaign (11 turns, 5 hours). Victory points are earned by controlling objective cities or winning pitched battles.<br/><br/>The game include 108 counters and A3 map. Two 6 sided dices are necessary.<br/><br/>Available with French rules, but English rules can be downloaded from Vae Victis website.<br/><br/>",

Half of the rabid fans here are already booing you.  It's your job to prove them wrong, or else end up on a midseason bus out of town.  Fortunately you've got a team of hustle players anchored by a few real stars... just the tools you need to deliver a playoff run... and maybe a Superbowl.<br/><br/>Call the plays, make the clutch decisions, bluff your opponents with trickery or just run the ball down their throat.  Lead your players to victory.<br/><br/>End Zone is a football action card game designed to capture the strategy, drama, and science of american football, and distill it into quick, intuitive, exciting gameplay.  Quick matches take 20-30 minutes.  Double that for a full game.<br/><br/>First play any set cards to assign your personnel for the play... then secretly plot your play.  Once revealed the cards physically line up against each other and give you the range of outcomes.  No books of charts.  No funky dice.  No colorcoding necessary.

        "description": "Step into a world of epic storytelling. Take on the role of the traveling bard, regaling the tales of diminutive heroes, long forgotten. Embellish the stories, challenge your rivals, share the lore and the liquor!<br/><br/>The stories of heroes are well established in the annals of bardic lore. A select band of bards have traveled the earth acquiring the legends of the most unbelievable legends of Goblins past. The stories of their conquests are unlike traditional legends, crafted from improbable accomplishments, incalculable risk, and a nearly absurd amount of luck. The epic tales of these forgotten heroes belie their diminutive stature. You have the responsibility of keeping their memory alive by telling their stories to weary travelers at taverns across the land. Creatures of darkest myth, artifacts of untold power, diabolical traps, and recovery from catastrophic misfortune fill your mind and flow from your tongue as you compete for the attention of the audience. Your story-weaving talents will be put to the test as other bards tell the tales of their own chosen heroes and heroines. Keep it lively ladies and gens&rsquo; fortune is a fickle mistress!<br/><br/>Each round a player may perform two actions from the following list:<br/><br/>May discard two Lore cards from their hand to draw either one Lore card from the discard pile or one Lore card from the top of the Lore deck, as a free action.<br/><br/>May place a card from their hand to the play mat. (this can be done twice, one for each action)<br/><br/>May draw two cards. (May be done twice, once for each action)<br/><br/>May beg for tips and receive two gold from the bank.<br/><br/>May pay one gold and get one bardic talent card.<br/><br/>At the end of 10 rounds,add the score of all the Lore cards on your Storyboard. Add 5 Lore for each Epic Embellishment card on your Storyboard. Add 1 Lore for every two Coins remaining in your possession (rounded down). Determine if you earned any of your Bardic Talent reward(s) by calculating and comparing necessary rows, columns, or other criteria. Add Bardic Talent reward(s) to your Lore score if earned. The player with the highest Lore score wins the game. Ties are resolved by awarding victory to the player with the most Lore earned from Bardic Talents. Secondary ties are resolved by remaining Coins. If a tie still remains, toast each other&rsquo;s success and share victory.<br/><br/>Legends of Goblins Past conjures the confabulist in us all. Your flair for the dramatic will be put to the test, as will your constitution. Drink and be merry!<br/><br/>",

The map spans the historic battlefield and surrounding terrain, divided into 800-meter hexes. Counters represent the military units that fought in the battle, divisions for the Confederates and corps for the Union. Special markers represent leaders and artillery concentration. Event cards bring to life the notable moments of the battle, upsetting the perfect plans of the player and giving the game exceptional replay value.<br/><br/>At the heart of the game system are fatigue and army morale. Units cannot sustain combat continually and will wear out if pressed too hard. Maintaining a reserve of troops to plug gaps in the line is critical. As units rout and break, or if their line of communications is cut, the morale of their army plummets. If you can drive the opposing army&rsquo;s morale to zero, they quit the field and you win a &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo; victory.<br/><br/>A match takes no more than 90 minutes, making the game suitable for beginners and old hands alike.<br/><br/>Published in July 2023 by MMP as the wargame within Special Ops #11 magazine.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2.5 hours (daytime) &amp; 9 hours (nighttime)<br/>Hex: 800 yards / 732 meters<br/>Units: division to corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (40 3/4&quot; game counters, 72 5/8&quot; game counters plus 14 3/4&quot; &amp; 16 5/8&quot; blank counters)<br/>Sixteen event cards <br/>One 8-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1 - 1.5 hours<br/><br/>",

The Union player must assault and capture the imposing Stockade Redan earthworks that overlook Graveyard Road leading into Vicksburg (unquestionably the most defensible position encompassing the city). The Confederate player must defend the Redan against the two historical assaults that attempted to take it (both failed with heavy casualties to the Union). Capturing the Redan does not automatically assure a Union victory. If and when the first or second Union assault succeeds, the players must then consult the Gettysburg Matrix to determine if the impending collapse of Vicksburg will prevent Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s invasion of the North by compelling Jefferson Davis (who viewed Vicksburg as critical to the South&rsquo;s survival) to refuse Lee&rsquo;s risky plan to invade Pennsylvania, changing the course of the war.

        "description": "Theme &mdash; Avalonia is a fast paced strategic area control game. The story of Avalonia transpires in the lands of Avalon after King Arthur was betrayed and defeated by the four tribes, being left sedated on the Excalibur Tower. A plague was unleashed through the Excalibur, twisted most of the people into Variants. The four tribes &mdash; the Reapers, the Raiders, the Saviours and the Seekers, all thirst for power, endeavoured in hunting down the Untainted, using them to sustain the strength of the tribes. Now, a dreadful tribal war is embarked, never ending until someone crushes down the others and takes over the throne in Avalon.<br/><br/>Gameplay &mdash; Each player will lead a faction, aiming to expand their army, gain resources and conquer lands on the Avalon Map in order to be strong enough to defeat other factions. There are four phases for each round, the Planning Phase, Action Phase, King Arthur Phase and the Clean Up Phase. During the Action Phase, players have to decide their own combinations of actions to be taken from the 6 types of actions available. Over the course of the game, players have to win Artifact Units before the others, gain Pure Blood resources and eliminate troops from other factions. There are two ways of ending the game, either when the Throne Area of King Arthur is full or when one of the players has reached the ultimate score.<br/><br/>Objective &mdash; There are two ways to win the game, either be the first to reach 30 points, or fill up the research bar with blood tubes. In whichever ways that the game ends, the players count their victory points, whoever gets the highest victory points wins the game and becomes the new ruler of Avalon.<br/><br/>",

Many of the games are pure strategy with no randomness, just like Chess itself; many of them have an element of luck; and many of them introduce other game elements into Chess, including bluffing, hand management, resource management, gambling, push-your-luck, trick-taking, auctions, etc. There is something here for everyone--including the serious Chess player.<br/><br/>In every game, a player's possible moves are determined, to varying extents, by the cards available to that player. Sometimes, a king will appear to be threatened, but will actually be safe, if the attacking piece is unable to move. As such, check and checkmate have been removed from these games entirely; a player may willingly enter or stay &quot;in check.&quot; The goal of every game is simply to capture the opposing king.<br/><br/>",

The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.<br/><br/>Sarkhan Vol is successful at preventing Ugin's death, though Ugin is forced to retreat into a hibernative state to recuperate. Satisfied, Sarkhan travels back into the &quot;present day.&quot; But the Tarkir he finds, as chronicled in Dragons of Tarkir, is drastically changed. The eponymous dragons, no longer extinct, have proliferated, and are now on the verge of wiping out all other life; in particular, the five god-dragons worshiped by the clans are now the leaders of those clans, with the human (or humanoid) characters who led them in the original timeline serving in other roles. In this new future, each of the clans focuses on allied pairs, with the enemy colors of the original wedges abandoned entirely; likewise, each clan retains the modified watermark of their dragonlords, first introduced in the previous set. Morph returns as &quot;Megamorph&quot;; the two mechanics are identical except that creatures with Megamorph gain a +1/+1 counter when flipped. Dragons also creates the peculiar structure of Tarkir Block drafts: Fate Reforged is designed to be drafted with either Dragons or Khans, but the two large sets, representing alternate timelines, are not intended to be drafted together. To that end, Dragons retains the two altered clan mechanics from FRF and replaces the three that remained.<br/><br/>The Dromoka Brood (Green, White) is what the Abzan Houses have become. Dragonlord Dromoka leads and they retain the Bolster mechanic from Fate Reforged. Anafenza, no longer their leader, was martyred for apostatic religious beliefs, but lives on as a ghost associated with a spirit tree.<br/>The Ojutai Brood (Blue, White) is what the Jeskai Way have become. Dragonlord Ojutai leads and their mechanic, new to the Tarkir block but returning from Rise of the Eldrazi, is &quot;Rebound,&quot; which lets spells re-occur at the beginning of the player's next turn. Narset, their former leader, has ignited her planeswalker spark, and is one of the two planeswalkers in the set (the other being an alternate version of Sarkhan Vol).<br/>The Silumgar Brood (Blue, Black) is what the Sultai Brood have become. Dragonlord Silumgar leads and their mechanic is &quot;Exploit.&quot; When a creature with Exploit enters the battlefield, the player may sacrifice a pre-existing creature to gain extra benefits from the Exploiting creature. Their former leader, Sidisi, exists as an undead thrall to Silumgar.<br/>The Kolaghan Brood (Red, Black) is what the Mardu Horde have become. Dragonlord Kolaghan leads and they retain the Dash mechanic from Fate Reforged. Their former leader, Zurgo, has been reduced to a mere ceremonial bellringer, and is often bullied by his clan.<br/>The Atarka Brood (Green, Red) is what the Temur Frontier have become. Dragonlord Atarka leads and their mechanic is &quot;Formidable,&quot; which provides bonuses if the controlling player controls with total power 8 or higher. Surrak, their former leader, serves as the brood's Hunt Caller, in charge of feeding Atarka and renowned for punching a dragon.<br/>Sorin Markov, arriving at the altered version of Tarkir, awakens Ugin from his hibernation. Ugin agrees to help fend off the Eldrazi, though he insists that first he and Sorin seek out Nahiri, the Lithomancer, a planeswalker who helped him seal the Eldrazi away the first time. Sarkhan, meanwhile, learns that he is the only person who remembers the version of Tarkir where he himself was born, and consultation with both Ugin and Narset reveals that, in this continuity, no Sarkhan Vol ever was born. Though both he and Narset are capable of planeswalking anywhere else in the multiverse, both decide to remain on Tarkir.<br/><br/>",

In this small board game you are a cat, your owner is away at work and the world is your oyster. Unfortunately, there are other cats trying to horn in on all the fun feline experiences your neighbourhood has to offer, but with careful allocation of your four paws and crafty use of special cards, you can be the one who emerges from this cat fight with the lion&rsquo;s share of the points.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of each, colour-coded activity cards worth 2-4 points are displayed at each house on the block. Players secretly allocate their four paws to houses and/or to their basket, which earns them extra cat cards at the end of the round. Certain cards are worth a bonus point to particular cats, which helps guide choices. Then players lift their screens and move their paws to the houses. Cat fights break out, as competing players use cat cards to try to outnumber or outmanoeuvre each other and win the point cards.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>A crowd-funding campaign for Cat Capers on the PledgeMe website met its target and ended on July 30, 2015. The game was released in November 2015.<br/><br/>",

The frog jumps an orthogonally adjacent token, the firefly pulls a creature in the same orthogonal line adjacent to the firefly, the beetle pushes an orthogonally adjacent token one space, and so on. If a token leaves the board, it's permanently removed from play.

Whenever a players jumps over an opponent's satellite and lands on an unoccupied space, the player captures the satellite. After completing movement of the satellite, the player then adds the same amount of comet pieces (as pips on the die) onto the gameboard following the designated comet path. Players start with 10 satellites, and lose them either to opponents or to the comet if a comet piece is laid on top of it. The game ends when only player has satellites left on the board. Players score their captured satellites and all satellites left on the board, and the player with the most is the winner.

Halley's Revenge has no limit to its wrath, it moves at an incredible rate, gobbling up everything in its path. As Halley's comet occupies more and more spaces, satellite movement becomes more and more difficult. Run if you can, but Halley's comet is out for revenge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Downey Games website:<br/><br/>La Grande Boucle (The Big Loop) is the nickname given to France&rsquo;s biggest sporting event, the Tour de France.<br/>Year in, year out, the route followed by the riders for 3 weeks broadly follows a loop around the country, hence the name of our game.<br/><br/>La Grande Boucle has been a labor of love for designer, Phil Riviere, for many years. Phil had released versions prior to partnering with Downey Games that were &quot;highlight based&quot; games. The Downey Games release of La Grande Boucle is a departure from previous designs. Rather than continuing the &quot;highlight based&quot; game engine, Phil has developed a full-blown simulation of the Tour de France.<br/><br/>Phil recently commented, &quot; Although sharing the same name as previous versions, the latest incarnation is a completely different concept. No highlights here as the game system covers the action on the full length of each stage. Every single aspect of Road Racing is covered. There are also options for tactical choices.&quot;<br/><br/>La Grande Boucle is the ONLY full simulation of the Tour de France. Every stage, time trial, and rider is included in the game.<br/><br/>In game terms, the Tour de France is quite challenging a subject because of, the huge quantity of riders taking part (around 200) and the difference in the character of the 20 + stages which form the race. However, Phil has risen to the challenge. La Grande Boucle not only gives accurate results, but you'll feel as if you are taking part in the actual Tour de France.<br/><br/>We do want to reiterate that this is not simply a relabeling of an old game. La Grande Boucle version 4 is a completely new design.<br/><br/>Phil asked me to close with the following: &quot;The game is meant to be played over several sessions. This is definitely not a fast or quick replay game. The flat stages are fairly quick to replay and will be slotted in one seating. Mountain stages, however, will take much longer to complete.<br/><br/>Not wishing to discourage you, but finishing this replay will be like finishing the Tour: Difficult but Rewarding. Be warned and enjoy the racing.&quot;<br/><br/>The game ships with the ratings for the 2004 Tour de France.<br/><br/>The printed game features individual, die-cut cards for all 189 riders; charts printed in full color, a complete rule book, Team lists in full-color, Replay data in full-color, dice, and a sturdy game box.<br/><br/>Note: The game is also available in a e-book version (print and play) for a lower price.<br/><br/>",

To do this you must deploy different resources (building materials, biological, technological) in several colony buildings, as well as automate them assigning a robot if necessary.<br/><br/>During game you will have to face several random events and build required buildings in time. For this you have different possible actions that you can choose with dice.<br/><br/>If at the last turn, when the convoy arrives, you have built all the required buildings, you get victory points for the other buildings. The victory conditions vary depending of the colony that you are building and game difficulty.<br/><br/>Colony 9 uses a 3x3 tile board game for building, three dice, several color cubes that represents resources (technology, biology, building materials) and several pawns that work as robots.<br/><br/>The player can choose different actions to play from a 3x3 action chart. He throws three dice and use two of them to choose an action, and then use the other die to asign materials to a structure. To build a structure you choose an action and deploy resources in that build. The player must build mandatory structures (radio, vital systems, spaceport, etc.) before a specific turn or he'll lost the game. In addition he can build other structures (factory, control station, missile base) to gain victory points and to defend colony from alien attack or asteroids.<br/><br/>2013 Solitaire Print and Play Contest results:<br/><br/>Best Greyscale Printed Game<br/>1st place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno<br/><br/>Best Medium Sized Game<br/>2nd place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno<br/><br/>Best Deck / Pool Building Mechanic<br/>1st place - Colony 9 by Santiago Eximeno<br/><br/>",

Both of them will try to reduce their opponent's life points to zero (0) to defeat them and win the game!<br/><br/>Both players will firstly choose a Weapon to be their Starting Weapon. There are 3 Weapons available: Wakizashi, a light knife; Katana, a dangerous sword; and Naginata, a heavy halberd. Their choice is crucial to their strategy!<br/><br/>Then, in each turn, both players will receive 3 Action cards. Action cards show 2 different actions in their opposite sides, so players will have to choose the action they want to use while losing the other one during that turn.<br/>Actions include Attack, Parry, Move and Unsheath. Attack allows players to damage their opponent. Parry cancels an opponent's Attack if played in front of it, and also applies a penalty to the opponent in that case. Move allows players to move their Samurai token on the Dojo (board). Unsheath allows players to change their active Weapon.<br/><br/>Both players will prepare their turn strategy simultaneously setting their 3 Action cards in the selected way, and then they will reveal their chosen actions one by one. When all 3 actions have been solved, if no player has their life track on zero (0) or below, the game continues. Players add the numbers in their actions to place the Reiki and Hearth tokens, which have special effects on the Dojo, and just start a brand new turn!<br/><br/>When a Samurai is defeated, having their life on zero (0) or below, the game ends! The Samurai who is still alive is the winner. Several games can be played in a row adding punctuations to enjoy a more complete experience.<br/><br/>",

The Revolution fails if you cannot raise the required SPARK by the end of 6 rounds or if you lose all Reputation (belief in the Revolution).  Players start the game with a certain amount of collective Reputation that they can spend to take stronger Sabotage card effects or can lose in certain encounters with Human NPCs.<br/><br/>",

Major game play mechanics include hand management, press your luck, voting and trading, negotiation, and take that!  The game is played over seven rounds, with each round consisting of an election phase to determine the group's leader, and a filibuster phase to block the policy revealed that round.<br/><br/>The leader is responsible for increasing the filibuster time to meet or exceed the minimum number of hours required to successfully block the policy. They also interact with the Time Deck, which is full of events that affect the players and will typically cause the end of the round. Non-leader players during a round act as supporting Senators that play assists and pass cards to the leader to help effectively block the policy and meet the Filibuster requirements for the round.<br/><br/>If at any time the players fail to block 4 policies, everyone loses! If all 7 rounds are completed and at least 4 policies have been successfully blocked, the Senator who earned the most influence (rewarded based on performance while leading a filibuster, as well as playing assists and passing cards) is the true winner!<br/><br/>So, be sure to work with your colleagues to prevent too many policies from passing through... but always look for ways to help yourself a little more than your fellow Senators so that you come out on top!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "January 19, 1919.  The Great War is over, the Kaiser has abdicated, and Germany is on its knees. After suffering a humiliating loss at the hands of the Allied nations, the former Great Power is now confronted not only with the death of millions of its citizens, but also with a severe economic crisis and a political turmoil that threatens to plunge the entire nation into civil war. The November Revolution of 1918 ushered in a new era of liberal democracy in a country traditionally ruled by noblemen warriors. The first democratic election has now been held, but democracy&rsquo;s enemies are numerous, and the future of the fledgling Republic appears grim. No one can tell whether the democratic Coalition will prevail or whether any of the extremist factions will rise out of the chaos and seize power.<br/> One thing is perfectly clear, however: the coming years will not be remembered for their peace and stability.<br/> The Weimar Republic is a Card Driven Game of political struggle in interwar Germany. Four factions compete for dominance: the democratic Coalition, the Soviet-backed Communist Party, Hitler&rsquo;s National Socialists, and the far-right Radical Conservatives.<br/><br/>The game follows a timeline of 15 years (1919-1933) with two rounds in each year. During a round, players take turns using their faction-specific abilities to increase their influence in Germany&rsquo;s regions and major cities, to maneuver the political landscape of the Republic, and to dominate through a combination of propaganda, parliamentary elections, street violence, economic influence, and ideological zeal. Typical actions include agitation, reforms, recruitment and deployment of fighting men, strikes, uprisings, assassinations, and coups. General and regional elections are held at irregular intervals throughout the game, potentially shifting local power balances in sometimes radical ways. The timeline moves through three distinct eras, each with its own deck of event cards. There are also several special cards like Elections and Parliamentary Control Cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay is fast-paced; initiative flows back and forth, and the direction of the game may change rapidly and unexpectedly. Although competition between the factions is fierce, some of the faction-specific mechanics overlap, and players can often take advantage of each other--including the making and unmaking of alliances.<br/> The Weimar Republic includes scenarios ranging in length from 3 to 8 hours and a special tutorial scenario that can be played by new players in only 90 minutes. Victory is absolute and generally achieved through &ldquo;sudden death&rdquo;; there is no final scoring or adding up of different objectives. Each faction can be replaced by a &quot;bot&quot; player, allowing 1-4 players to play with any combination of factions.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players will simultaneously decide what resources to collect and what building to draw in their hex grid, constrained by the roll of the six shared dice. (If you can't afford a building, you can always draw in a burial mound, for a few bonus resources but no VPs.) Each of the five buildings has three possible scoring rules, randomized before the game for 3^5 = 243 different setups.<br/><br/>The game ends in a maximum of 18 rounds when all spaces are filled; sooner if any one player produces enough of one resource over the course of the game to reach the endgame section of the resource track. Players total points for all the buildings they've built and the builder with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Official description: As one of Egypt&rsquo;s most respected builders, you have been selected by the Pharaoh to expand the land. Each builder is given their own plateau to develop. Producing resources will be critical to your success, but do not be too tempted by your ambition, lest you should unleash a plague upon your growing city.

When the total firepower next to a dragon-body card equals or exceeds the vitality point on that card, whoever played the most recent card wins it.

You could win a prize and have your home featured in their publication.<br/><br/>Players start Ulterior Design by revealing one current trend card face up in a central area, then they place one card from their hand face up in their area. On each turn after that, a player plays one of their three hand cards to add to their own house (redecorate), to influence what is trending (by adding a card to the central area), or to sabotage a rival (by adding their card to an opponent's house). Cards are split down the middle with some combination of interior decorations (houseplants, paintings and lamps) on each half, and they must be played so that they overlap at least one half of an already played card.<br/><br/>To end their turn, they refill their hand, then reveal an event card, which may be a judge, a reshuffle, or crickets. Judges are looking for the right number of plants, portraits, or lamps. The player who most closely matches the total number of items in the current trend receives an award; in a tie, the award goes to whoever played least recently as they were trending before it was cool.<br/><br/>The first player to collect three awards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PatimPatamPatum is a special majorities game whose scenario is the popular and traditional festival of &quot;La Patum&quot; in the Catalan city of Berga, near the Pyrenees, recently declared &quot;Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity&quot; by the UNESCO. The game does not intend to faithfully reproduce the festival, but just be a funny competition among the players grasping some of the feeling of the festival.<br/><br/>Each player represents a group of patumaires (i.e. those participating in the festival) and he or she should lead his or her patumaires through the old city streets, trying to reach the special squares where the festival is held. The final aim of the players is to gather the maximum number of patumaires in these squares at the end of each round. But there is a problem: the squares are pretty small and there is no room for everybody. If the squares are full you'll have to manage as best as you can in order to throw out some competitor, while trying to keep there your own patumaires. To help you in this task you should use wisely the various cards and popular characters of the festival: some ones will help you in reaching the squares, some others will help you in defending yourself from the other players' pushes.<br/><br/>The game has three rounds and each player can use his cards to move the patumaires as well as the character cards, which allows some special (and sort of magical) action. At the end of each round the players obtain points by their mere presence in the squares and, in some cases, even more points by having a majority there. You'll have to maintain always an equilibrium in your cards: will you spend your cards mainly for trying to reach all the places or better keep the highest card for defending against your competitor's pushes? Will you spend that 6-valued card for his movement value or for his character's special action?<br/><br/><br/>    Released October 2007.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Winner of the 6th Game Creation Contest Award at the Fira JocJoc in Tona, Catalonia, Spain (November 2007).<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle for Zendikar is a Magic: The Gathering expansion block consisting of the sets Battle for Zendikar and Oath of the Gatewatch. It sees the return of full-art basic lands, last seen in the Zendikar block. It is also the first block in Magic (since the Shadowmoor block) to use the new Two-Block Paradigm, wherein each block has two sets instead of the three that were previously used (the last block having three sets being the Khans of Tarkir block).<br/><br/>Whilst Kiora leads a one-woman sea assault on Kozilek, Gideon, Jace and Nissa find themselves outflanked by Ob Nixilis. The demon attempts to trap them on Zendikar to be destroyed by the Eldrazi, much as he himself was, but is stopped by the unexpected arrival of Chandra Nalaar, who frees them to continue the fight. Ob Nixilis decides to planeswalk away and leave his revenge for later. However, the battle on Zendikar is going poorly. Kiora, the only planeswalker left to represent the Zendikari, is defeated by Kozilek and almost loses her prized possession, the Bident of Thassa which she obtained on Theros. The Zendikari army has been devastated, and Tazri steps up to reorganize it in Gideon's absence.<br/><br/>The four planeswalkers emerge from Ob Nixilis' erstwhile prison to discover the Sea Gate destroyed and the Zendikari in disarray. They will not be able to trap both Eldrazi using the Hedrons, and none of them are powerful enough to fight alone. Jace suggests simply planeswalking away, but Gideon suggests they swear an oath as they overlook the Sea Gate&mdash;the Oath of the Gatewatch, in which they promise to cooperate to defend the Multiverse against extraplanar threats. And since the Eldrazi are extraplanar threats and cannot be contained, the newly formed Gatewatch have only one option: kill them outright.<br/><br/>Jace lays out their battle plan: the corporeal forms of the Eldrazi, monstrous though they are, are only part of their existence; the rest of them reside in the Blind Eternities, the whirling chaos between planes. This is why Ugin has always counseled against destroying the Eldrazi's corporeal forms. Jace's solution is to draw Ulamog and Kozilek entirely into Zendikar so that they can be fully slain. Whilst Gideon, Kiora, Chandra, Tazri and the Zendikari army distract the Eldrazi with battle, Jace and Nissa are to use the remaining Hedrons to anchor them in corporeal form. The plane of Zendikar itself, which has been trying to consume the titans ever since they were imprisoned there, will do the rest. Or, at least, that's the plan. Zendikar quickly begins to struggle over the mouthful it has bitten off, and Nissa and Kiora, both Zendikari natives, almost come to blows over the fate of their home. It's Chandra who has the answer: Nissa redirects the last of Zendikar's mana to her, and Chandra employs a purifying fire that annihilates both Ulamog and Kozilek.<br/><br/>In the aftermath, Zendikar begins to rebuild. Gideon cedes his role as Commander-General to Tazri. Jace still has his own concerns: of the three Planeswalkers who originally imprisoned the Eldrazi here on Zendikar&mdash;Ugin, Sorin Markov, and Nahiri the Lithomancer&mdash;the latter two have failed to help; and when Ugin himself arrives, he has only criticism for Jace's impetuousness at destroying two lifeforms that are older than worlds, their purposes in the Multiverse unknown. Jace decides to hunt down Sorin Markov, who was last seen on the plane of Innistrad.<br/><br/>",

If one player collected 99 or more points at the end of a round the game ends and the player with the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>Game description from the back of the box:<br/><br/>Dieses Kartenspiel hat es in sich:<br/>Es ist so einfach wie Mau-Mau - und doch so listig wie ein Miezek&auml;tzchen.<br/>Wer verpasst seinen Mitspielern die meisten Strafpunkte, ohne selbst welche zu bekommen?<br/>Und wer wird als Ersters seine Karten los?<br/><br/>",

Are they people? Are they both? Why do some of them wear business suits? This quest has lots of cat puns and satire about consumerist culture!<br/><br/>City of Cheer: The City of Cheer used to be really lively and upbeat but in recent years a wave of DEPRESSION has washed over the city. This quest is sure to cheer you up if you're feeling blue. Plus it has the son of the guy named Chad from the first game.<br/><br/>Leprechaun Party: They're tiny! They're green! They drink like ogres ten times their size! Get out your Pepper Spray Wand to handle the rioting leprechaun hordes!<br/><br/>Minotaur's Maze Tavern: This quest is kind of menacing but honestly they haven't even put up all the dry-wall in the maze yet... moments of TERROR mixed with uncomfortable reminders of how boring your day to day life is. Also with an end boss that has a PERSONAL CONNECTION to one of the main characters.<br/><br/>Component list: 3 &quot;Yeti Blue&quot; dice, pad of character sheets, instructions and 62 unique cards<br/><br/>",

Both players have native allies to control and the French player can also control what's left of the Spanish Empire in North America. The game is regimental-scale (approximately 500-1000 men) with the two maps having a scale of 33km and 66km per hex respectively. The combat system uses a combat results table (CRT) and the monthly game turn has several phases. These include the Start Phase, Naval Phase, Supply Phase, Combat Phase, Movement Phase, and End Phase. The game system focuses on having a common sense and simple approach so that the turn can flow easily.<br/><br/>Nominee for the 2006 Charles S.

Fight filthy Punks, hot-headed Firebugs, and elusive Killgaroos (yup, ninja kangaroos) in order to take down the big boss, Super Mutie.<br/><br/>This is a fast paced and funny game with interesting new boardgame mechanics and lots of reverence for 16-bit, arcade fighting.<br/><br/>The game is for 1-4 players, and plays in under an hour. Players will join together to beat down waves of baddies by rolling lots of dice, risking lots of resources, busting crates, using items and defeating the big boss. After each full round of Hero and Baddie activations, the game board sidescrolls&hellip; everything on the first tile dies as it is removed, and then a new tile pops in and spawns another wave of baddies. Players choose their own difficulty by starting the game with a limited number of quarters. Make it to the Boss, or die trying, as you try to clean up the STREETS OF STEEL!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players begin with 4 cards each, playing 1 card on the table each round. The cards in the deck represent different guests attending the ball, each with their own unique ability. Use these to peek at, trade, or steal cards from other players. The two players holding the &quot;Princess&quot; and &quot;Prince Edward&quot; cards during the final round are declared the winners.<br/><br/>This game can be played by anywhere from 4 to 8 people, but some cards are used only if you have enough players. This means bigger groups will result in new abilities, forcing players to change up their strategy.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>1. Deal 4 cards to each player.<br/>2. The player holding the &quot;Princess&quot; card must flip her over so everyone can see.<br/>3. All players choose 1 card from their hand and place it face down on the table.<br/>4. The player holding the &quot;Princess&quot; flips over their chosen card and carries out its ability.<br/>5. Continue clockwise around the table, each player activating their card's ability.<br/>6. Once all players are finished, the round ends.<br/>7. Repeat steps 3-6 two more times.<br/>8. When all players have 1 card remaining, everyone places their cards face-up on the table. The 2 players holding the &quot;Princess&quot; and &quot;Prince Edward&quot; cards during the final round are declared the winners.<br/><br/>Will you aim for the &quot;Princess&quot; knowing everyone at the table can see exactly where she is? She is sure to draw the attention of other players, moving back and forth just like she would in a dance hall.<br/><br/>Or will you instead try your luck and search for &quot;Prince Edward&quot; instead? Some guests will give players the ability to pinpoint where he is hiding!<br/><br/><br/>Various card effects:<br/>Baron: All players take a random card from the hand of the player to their right.<br/>Wizard: Trade your entire hand with another player.<br/>Foreign Royal: Choose a card from your hand and trade it for the Princess.<br/>Priest: You are exempt from all actions that affect a player's hand until your next turn.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description by Raw Potions Publishing, publisher of the English localization<br/><br/>",

The game is played with a &quot;Bavarian&quot; card deck used also in Schafkopf or Preference.  Alternatively, you could use a standard card deck with just the 7,8,9,10,J,Q,K, and Ace of each suit.<br/><br/>The dealer deals four cards to each player, and turns up one trump card.  The dealer may declare &quot;Raub&quot; before looking at his hand if he wants to take a gamble with the  nice trump card he turned up in attempting to take two tricks.  If it is a 7, the dealer may declare a &quot;shtih&quot; and take a gamble that he will get one trick.  Otherwise, starting with the player on the dealer's right, players declare if they are going to try to play on the trump suit for two or more tricks.  Each player in succession can either play and attempt to get one suit, or drop out completely. Each player discards 1-4 cards and the dealer gives each new cards.<br/><br/>Players all start at 21 points, and go down one point for each trick taken.  Failing to win the two trumps when leading will make the player go up 4 points, and failing to take any tricks when following will make the player go up two points.  Hands that aren't played after dealt lead to a &quot;refa&quot; where the scoring of the next hand is doubled.<br/><br/>Finally, when one player is below 10 points, a dealer may declare a &quot;muss&quot; where all players must play.  This is an attempt to cause a player to go up that is in the lead.  This can lead to a player coming close to winning, then another, then another until someone finally hits zero!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bug Strife is a tabletop game that reminds me of many real time strategy games for the PC.  Two or more players begin with certain bug forces and then, through food acquisition, hive construction and combat, establish their side as dominant on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The book for Bug Strife is 33 pages of typing paper covered with a decently sturdy cardboard cover (monchrome green). Clip art and other cartoons are interspersed in the text and the rules are set out in a logical, well organized manner WITH a working table of contents. The last couple of pages are very useful and welcome play-aids that include a turn sequence summary, bug summary, unit cards and terrain effects table.<br/><br/>In addition to a playing surface you'll need 6-sided dice (d6), tape measures or rulers, pens/pencils, scratch paper, and poker chips or something else to represent food, and any terrain (including nest structures) that you want to put out. Last but not least, you'll need something to represent your bug army--usually the cheap plastic dollar store bug bags.<br/><br/>Bugs are placed in functional groupings based on their shared characteristics for game terms. Players can field colony insects, bees, aphids, beetles, carnivores, flying carnivores, spiders, flying raiders, slugs/snails, worms, caterpillars/grubs. These groupings serve as a common language for players to understand that different models are capable of different things.<br/><br/>Bugs are rated in a number of characteristics. If a statistic is marked &quot;0&quot;, then that bug cannot use that characteristic.<br/><br/>Leadership affects how well a bug can recruit other bugs to join his army (from offboard not the opponent's pieces). Defense and Attack are used during to determine individual combat attacks and represent a bug's ability to defend itself (shells, armor, etc.) and ability to inflict damage on an opponent, respectively. Movement is a straight translation to inches per turn movement allowance. Wounds is the number of hits a bug can endure before being removed from the game and Gathering represents how well a bug collects resources.<br/><br/>There are six phases in a turn.  What a bug does during one or more phases during a turn can limit what it can do in other phases. For example, a bug with raiding skill can do all of the following in a single turn: Raid, Move, Attack and Gather.<br/><br/>Phase 1 is Maintenance/Raiding. This is a logistics phase that requires players to feed their bugs (unfed troops simply leave the battlefield in search of food---never to return).  Bugs capable of raiding can feed themselves, provided there is food available to them.<br/><br/>Phase 2 is Movement. You can move your bugs up to their movement allotment in inches. Some bugs can move faster than others (snails and slugs being the slowest in the game). Terrain affects movement, too so moving across a featureless plain on the gaming board produces faster movement than, say, climbing a hill or moving through leaf litter (jungle).<br/><br/>Phase 3 is Construction. Only bugs with engineering ability may use this skill. Tunnels, caches and hive areas are different constructions that a bug general can have his troops with engineering abilities to construct.<br/><br/>These structures help defend his army and the ever important food supply. Tunnels ease friendly movement and restrict enemy entrance into the nest. Hives grant defenders an advantage during defense of the nest and each hive in a player's control adds a bonus to his ability to recruit new bug enlistees---after all, hives are considered the sign of a successful bug civilization. Caches serve to store food and to aid in defending food from invading bugs. Spiders also have the ability to build traps to catch enemy bugs.<br/><br/>Recruiting is Phase 4, during which bugs with leadership attributes can attempt to add more forces (randomly drawn from the bug collection off table).  Successful dice rolls, with bonuses applied if the recruiter wishes to use food as enticement, allows the player to add additional bugs to his army.<br/><br/>Attack is Phase 5 and usually takes place at close range of 1 inch or less (aphids can squirt acid at up to 6&quot;). Attacking involves an attacker and a defender (duh). Attack bonus equals the defender's Defense score subtracted from the attacker's Attack score (yes, negatives are possible). This bonus is then applied to a 2d6 roll that is compared to a quick table. Results range from no effect, to fleeing, to multiple wounds being dealt out.<br/><br/>Gathering is the last phase of a turn. Bugs capable of gathering simply roll dice equal to this stat.  The result represents the amount of food they have collected for use next turn or storage.<br/><br/>Games may be scenario driven (a sample scenario is provided) or &quot;open&quot; where each player basically does his/her level best to completely wipe out the opponent. Victory objectives such as kill the enemy general or destroy/steal half the enemy food supply are very helpful in focusing the game on more than hack and slash (though those games are fun, too).<br/><br/>Overall, a solid game with a nice logistics phase.  Although the rules are not written for a gameboard per se, Bug Strife would very easily convert to a large hex board or terrain map and in my opinion benefits from playing on this type of pre-measured surface.  It returns the game to a more boardgame like feel and helps minimize measurement fudging and arguments associated with measuring tape errors.<br/><br/>",

Certain units can form column (reduced combat effectiveness) gaining +1 hex on clear terrain, or gain +1 hex on roads. Only units in command (by a general, hero, or wizard) can move.<br/>Combat is resolved with dice rolling, and using a simple Combat Results table with effects ranging from &quot;No Effect&quot; to forcing the unit to recoil, flee, and or losing stands. In case of recoil, and flight the winning unit may, or have to (depending on troop type) follow-up, and pursue.<br/>Troop types: infantry, mounted, mounted irregular, horde, behemoths, chariots, artillery, armored car (mechanical vehicles), flyers, mechanical flyers, and psychological.<br/>Command figures: generals, heroes, and magicians.<br/>Magic is kept to a minimum. (Only elemental summoning.)<br/>Simple siege rules are also included.<br/>And again, the rules are FREE, downloadable in pdf format.<br/>Check out the publisher's site offering modular terrain to be used with the rules, and 10mm miniatures packs.

So far, there are over 6000 ships represented, not counting aircraft. One thing that I didn't include is a set of rules, since I figured that most naval-game buffs already have a rule set in mind, and are using my counters to beat the cost of ship miniatures. But all the rules I've seen are too complex for my taste, which means I can't play a game with my own counters. So, just for the heck of it, here are some simple rules for naval engagements.<br/><br/>Easy Ships assumes you have some of my All the Ships counters, although a set of naval miniatures could work. You'll also need hex maps of open sea, like the &quot;Open Sea&quot; map tile that comes with this game (which is from from my M8 map system). These rules are meant for simplicity and fast play, not for extreme realism. The rules emphasize surface combat. The intended era is the first half of the 20th century. All you provide is some 6-sided dice, and pens and paper for some simple record-keeping if you use carriers or submarines.<br/><br/>",

It can be played by two players, or 4 with players working in teams with the goal of being the first player or team to score 5 points.<br/><br/>The game table is a fairly heavy plastic construct, with large springs mounted beneath each of the rectangular board's 4 corners.  Players depress the springs, moving a steel ball through the obstacles towards a goal.<br/><br/>The real point of interest is that the two scoring areas feature both goals, side-by-side.  So attempting to score can be very dangerous indeed!<br/><br/>Game components: Plastic game table, metal ball, instructions.<br/><br/>",

You control Squads of Japanese and<br/>Americans, machine guns, flamethrowers, and Leaders as you fight battle on Iwo Jima, and other islands.<br/><br/>Each Island War hex represents 25-40 meters of terrain, and the turns depict from a few seconds to several minutes of action. The counters represent single characters (Leaders), Squads of men, Weapon Teams, Support Weapons and various administrative markers.<br/><br/>Squads have three figures on the front of the counter and two on their back/reduced side. Leaders have a face on both the front and the back of the marker, and weapons teams have 2-3 men and the weapon&rsquo;s nomenclature, such as Type 92, on a larger, 3/4&quot; counter. Collectively, Squads, Leaders, and Weapon Teams are called units.  A unit&rsquo;s reduced side is indicated by lighter color. There are also administrative markers, labeled Move, Fire, etc, used to assist in playing, and finally markers that represent Support Weapons, such as the USMC&rsquo;s BAR, (that must be crewed by Squads).<br/><br/>The game on PDF file contains the rules, counters, and two map sheets. It comes with two scenarios, both from the Iwo Jima campaign.<br/><br/>",

The basic concept is that of the &quot;Quality Die&quot; for each figure. The action plays as man-to-man, but the system accommodates a 1:5 scaling while still retaining the proper &quot;feel&quot; of the era.<br/><br/>Sons of the Desert may be used in two separate formats.

You control an army of RGBs - alien creatures with three distinct layers of thought - and they lose one layer (and an ability) if they are attacked. For example, children must remain next to a piece which still has the green sustenance layer, or the child starves. Children can be created if the spare pieces exist, but only by one male and one female, both with the blue 'reproduction' layer. And attacks can only be carried out by pieces with the red destruction layer. RGB bears a few similarities to Chess, but not as many as you might think.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Feud is all about combat.  It is about warfare - the weaponry, the armor, the tactics, the respite, the strengths and weaknesses of participating warriors, and the suspense and mystery of an unknown outcome.  A typical game can last anywhere from ten minutes to two hours.  It is for two players, and, best of all, Feud is played with two standard decks of playing cards!  This makes Feud cheap!  And sometimes free, (the best kind of game), if you already have the cards lying around.<br/><br/>Feud is initially quite complex.  No one can master the concepts of Feud by playing just a few games, let alone the subtleties.  Once you have played it enough though, you will not only find it enjoyable, but rather simplistic and easy.<br/><br/>To ease new players into the game, a set of Basic Rules is outlined first.  Play several games of Feud with the Basic Rules.  Once you have grasped them soundly, the Advanced Rules will bring the true excitement of Feud to light.  Though we have called them &quot;Advanced&quot; rules, they are just an extension of the Basic Rules, and complete the game's symmetry.  If you find yourself having fun with just the Basic Rules, or Basic Feud, no worries!  Many people enjoy Basic Feud more than Advanced Feud, or True Feud.  But we urge you to try out True Feud if you have enjoyed basic Feud, especially if you like games with higher degrees of skill and lesser degrees of chance.<br/><br/>",

While he can join the fray (perhaps to bolster the flagging morale of one of his units), his ability to control the rest of his army will suffer, maybe evening failing to follow his orders.<br/><br/>Written with 15mm figures in mind, Taiko! converts easily to 6mm and 25mm as well.  The rules play to two levels of combat, 1:1 scale, and 50:1 scale. The former is used for small skirmish battles, and has a fast and chaotic feel to it as units of warriors engage, pursue their beaten foe, and then perhaps find themselves being beaten and pursued.  The 50:1 scale is ideal for recreating the larger battles of feudal and/or renaissance Japan, with large formations of infantry and cavalry maneuvering around the battlefield under the control of their lord or one of his generals.<br/><br/>",

Then play one Action Card. At the end of your turn, draw enough cards to fill your hand up to (5).<br/><br/>Infection Cards: are a person, place, or thing that spreads the epidemic. Each Infection Card has two symbols. An Epidemic grows as cards are placed adjacent to the initial Infection card. Cards can only be placed adjacent to another card if the symbol in the corner facing that card matches.<br/><br/>Example: A Rock Star card has the LIPS symbol in both corners. The Big Bear Biker card has LIPS in the lower right corner, so it can be placed on the left-hand side so that the LIPS symbols touch, thereby spreading the infection and growing the epidemic.<br/><br/>Outbreak Cards: are wild cards that allow an additional card to be played. The Outbreak Card DOES NOT count toward the (5) cards needed to complete and Epidemic.<br/><br/>Action Cards: are objects or items that either: (1) stop or slow an Epidemic by blocking or killing an infection. (2) enhance or accelerate an Epidemic by making the infection immune to the effects of a block<br/>or kill card.<br/><br/>Block Cards: block one side of an Epidemic. If both sides are blocked, the Epidemic is contained, then discarded.<br/><br/>Germ War Cards: weaponize a virus making it able to spread on any edge of the Germ War card. The Germ War Card DOES NOT count toward the (5) cards needed to complete and Epidemic.<br/><br/>Special Action Cards: are objects or viruses that can be played on anyone&rsquo;s turn. They include the Frysol and Super Germ card.<br/><br/>Frysol Cards: kill one infection.<br/><br/>Super Germ Cards: nullify the effects of Frysol<br/><br/>Global Containment: ends the game.

        "description": "&quot;Osmosis&quot; was published in A Gamut of Games. A word from Sid Sackson:<br/>&quot;It would be difficult for me to say why, how, or even when I created the following work. Like the game itself, the ideas seemed to flow shapelessly around until, before I realized it, they had taken concrete shape.<br/>&quot;Osmosis is a subtle game. What constitutes a good hand? What constitutes a good play? The contestants must discover this for themselves, more by intuition than by logic&quot;<br/><br/>Osmosis is played with a normal deck of cards, but without some cards according to the number of players. Each player starts with a eight card hand and to win a round he must gather more than 11 cards, when he scores alone or he loses when he reaches 4 cards, then all other players scores. Cards are gathered by trading with the other player is very specific ways.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game. From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Vai_Lung_Thlan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Vai_Lung_Thlan</a>:<br/><br/>&quot;Vai Lung Thlan (lung &quot;stone&quot;; thlan &quot;grave&quot;; vai may mean &quot;foreign&quot; or be short for vai phei, the name of an old Kuki clan) was first described in 1912 by Lt.-Colonel J. Shakespear. This mancala game is played by both sexes of the Mizo (the modern name for the Lushai people) who live in the Indian State of Mizoram located between Myanmar and Bangladesh.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board consists of two rows of six holes.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player lifts up all the stones of one of his holes and distributes them clockwise, one by one, into the consecutive holes, first along his row and then back along that of his opponent.<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped into an empty hole on either side of the board, the player captures it as well as all stones which precede this hole (that is, against the direction of movement or anti-clockwise) by an unbroken chain of single stones. Captured stones are removed and placed aside by the player.<br/><br/>No matter whether it was captured or not, the move is over after one lap.<br/><br/>The players move alternately and passing is prohibited, unless a player has no legal move.<br/><br/>The game is finished when no stones are left on the board. The player who has captured more stones wins. If each player has captured 30 stones, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>Suggestions for good play:<br/><br/>The game starts slow, but accelerates as stones are captured or accumulated in a few holes and the board is cleared. The middle game should be a clever exchange of stones.<br/><br/>A hole containing 12 stones can always capture at least one stone because the last stone is dropped into the emptied hole. On the other hand, it is impossible for holes which contain more than 12 stones to capture. These holes can be used for defence because by distributing their contents all empty holes of the board are filled. At the end of the game players try to deprive their opponent of legal moves while keeping as many stones as possible on their own side in such a way that only single stones are created when they are distributed. Therefore, overloaded holes become &quot;bad shape&quot;.<br/><br/>Quote:<br/><br/>Counting the stones in the hole before removing them is not allowed, and considerable skill is required to judge accurately the number of stones, so as to select a hole containing the number of stones which when distributed will leave the maximum number of holes with single stones in them. <br/>J. Shakespear&quot;<br/><br/>Mancala World also gives an interesting endgame problem.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    igGameCenter (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>",

Because loops come in a wide range of sizes and shapes, and have many degrees of freedom, the game has rich tactics and strategy.<br/><br/>Small loops threats force players to focus on local battles while large loop threats force them to think globally, and to consider how the local battles fit into the global war.

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:  The Three Musketeers (Chess Variant) is a two-player abstract strategy board game that represents renaissance  warfare on an 8x14 board with alternating light and dark colored squares representing land, river, bridge, castle, and cathedral terrain. Each terrain type provides specific benefits or obstacles to the different game pieces. Opposing pieces, printed as blue and red chess pieces (but which may be substituted by actual chess pieces), are initially placed in specific locations designated on the game board. Each type of piece has a unique type of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, by its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece, as in chess. Each side takes turns moving a single one of their pieces trying to gain positional advantage, capture opponents, and achieve their objectives. The Cardinal&rsquo;s pawn type pieces are an important exception to normal movement rules.  If a pawn is selected to be moved, a total of two pawns may move during a single turn.  These are the only pieces that may do so.  The Three Musketeer player&rsquo;s knight type pieces may not move until the d&rsquo;Artagnan rook type piece finishes a turn adjacent to each and activates it.  Until they are activated, they face backwards on the game board and may not move.  The game was inspired by Alexandre Dumas story, The Three Musketeers, and by Chess-like games such as Siege.<br/><br/>",

A game usually take 6-8 rounds and lasts about 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a swarm of bees and each bee is carrying a different amount of nectar.  On a round different areas of the hive are made available to fly bees into.  Using a secret bidding mechanic players deploy their bees in the different locations.  The player who brings most nectar to an area claims ownership of that area of the hive.<br/><br/>Points are then scored each round for making honey. If a player can claim groups of areas they will score more points.<br/><br/>Players can also influence the hive by bidding on cards which give extra points, extra drone bees or more significantly the 'swarming' cards allow players to swap ownership of different areas of the hive.<br/><br/>However at the end of a round the player with least points can remove a honey marker from the board and keep things balanced.<br/><br/>Beehive was designed to be a quick fun game with a 'stop the leader' ethos in its design.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with Beehive<br/><br/>",

Grant has just come directly with his army from his victory at Fort Henry only a few days prior.<br/><br/>The Confederate General John B. Floyd has held a council of war and it was proposed that the Confederate army should attempt to breakout and head for Nashville.  So on the morning of the 15th February 1862 the Confederates prepare for their assault, luck is on their side as General Grant is away from the immediate location of Fort Donelson.<br/><br/>Fort Donelson has a time limit of 12 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their objective.  Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 2 hour period of continuous play.  The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit.  You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion.  The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>Included with the download is the 3D Game Board in four quadrants, the Fort Donelson six page Battle Report, the Gaming Counters, a simple guide on how to build a 3D Game Board, the Brothers At Arms twenty page Rules Booklet with Playsheet, a twenty four hour Timeline Table and finally a set of Tile Dice.  The game rules are fast and easy to learn and will be the same throughout the full series of American Civil War in 3D.<br/><br/>Can you continue this great series of battles with another victory?  Play North or South in this the third of the American Civil War in 3D series of board games.<br/><br/>&gt;Source: wargamesdownload.com<br/><br/>",

The Allied High command watches horrified the panzer columns emerging on its back.

For those not familiar with Q&bull;bitz, here's a rundown of game play:<br/><br/>In Q&bull;bitz players use their special blocks to recreate patterns, claim cards and win the game.<br/><br/>In the first round, someone reveals a Q&bull;bitz card (out of a deck of 100 cards), then players race to assemble their specially colored blocks in the pattern shown on that card; the first player to do so claims the card. In the second round, players must roll their blocks like dice to find the iamges that they need to recreate the pattern on the card. In the third round, all players look at the card for ten seconds to try to memorize the pattern, then they work on recreating that pattern by memory; the round ends when someone calls for it to end, with the player who successfully recreated more of the pattern than anyone else claiming the card.<br/><br/>After three sets of three rounds, the player who claimed the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Expands game: Qâ¢bitz<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Go Hunt card game is packed with tons of fun and laughs and is perfect for most any party.  It will be hard to keep your mind out of the gutter while playing or asking for any one of the 16 different hilarious images on the Go Hunt cards.<br/><br/>Goal: To collect the most matching sets, either sets of 2 or 4. You decide on game play.  Matching sets 2 will make for a quicker game, sets of  4 will extend game play.<br/><br/>There are 16 differant card images to play and match: Bald Beaver, Big Cock, Big Honkers, Cuddly Puss, Cute Ass, Dry Puss, Excited Monkey, Fat Beaver, Little Hooters, Fat Weiner, Little Monkey, Nice Rack, Red Pecker, Stretched Puss, Small Cock, Wet Puss.  The images are all innocent pictures of animals, check them out in our picture gallery! No animals were hurt in the making of the Go Hunt card game.<br/><br/>Game play: With four or less players; seven cards are dealt to each player.  Five cards can be dealt to each player in larger groups.  The remaining cards are placed face down in a draw pile.  The player left of the dealer goes first.  On your turn, ask any player for a specific card.  For example: &quot;Michele do you have little hooters?&quot;  You must already hold one of the requested cards.  If Michele has any little hooter cards she must give them all to you.  If the person you ask does not have the card you requested, they would say &quot;Go Hunt!&quot;  You would then draw a card from the draw pile.  When the draw pile runs out, keep playing until all the cards have been made into matching sets.  When you collect a set of matching cards, immediately show the other players and place the cards face down in front of you.<br/><br/>Is is fair to lump all pair matching games together? Yes it has the same type of play as go fish, but the card images really make the game stand out. Playing basketball, and playing a game of HORSE is differant, for example in the game Go Hunt there is a card with an image of a fat beaver eating an apple, the card is called &quot;FAT BEAVER&quot;, now imagine this card and 15 others in play, would you ask your grandma if she had a &quot;FAT BEAVER&quot;, &quot;WET PUSS&quot; or even a &quot;LARGE COCK&quot;.<br/><br/>In conclusion if you have an inoccent soul and a naughty mind you&quot;ll have a blast playing the Go Hunt card game with your friends!<br/><br/>There are also variants of the Go Hunt game that are drinking games, so if your over 21 give them a try!<br/><br/>",

Weathered card players will enjoy the strategy of play, as vast as the deep blue sea.<br/><br/>The player that is dealt the ship starts the game, and each other player matches the color if they can, trying to take the trick with the highest numbered card of that color. There are cards that you want to capture for more points like treasure maps, chests, and gold coins. There is even one card that you want to avoid capturing, the dreaded Magistrate Burns. Once all the cards have been played and all tricks taken, the player that captured the Duchess Carmen receives the cards that were removed from the game, and perhaps even more points. Players total their points and are paid in gold and silver coins. Once all the coins are given out, the player with the most treasure is the winner.<br/><br/>The game includes high-quality plastic coated playing cards and a sack full of gold and silver coins. Whimsical characters illustrated by Monte Moore in bright colors make the game as attractive as it is fun.<br/><br/>",

The new promotion tokens introduce a new rank for builders: Jester. Vault tile, where a builder promoted to Jester is present becomes a wild tile with one color more. Thus, the Jester can change a single-color tile into a wild one, and wild tile into three-color one.<br/><br/>The new cathedral tiles contain a new order, Altar, which allows a player to place two Altar tokens on two separate tiles of the cathedral. Altars increase the value of Stained Glass tokens and protect vault tiles from the effects of two orders: Disaster and Confuse. (A set of altar tokens is included in the expansion.)<br/><br/>Festum Fatuorum debuted in issue 22 of the Polish boardgame magazine Åwiat Gier Planszowych.<br/><br/>",

The Halflings must snatch as much food as possible and escape before the City Watch closes the venue and catches them red-handed. It&rsquo;s quick and brutal as they dodge the barroom brawl and try to outgrab and outscore their fellow Halflings.<br/><br/>Halflings move throughout the Cockatrice Corral, resolving Brawl cards as they navigate the Brawl in their quest for food. Often Brawl cards result in the Halfling being bumped a square, thrown across the room or picked up and being used as a weapon. Brawl cards are often brutal and stop a Halfling in their tracks. Every time a Halfling is forced to Stop by a Brawl card, they draw a Luck card. Different Luck cards are used to Yoink another Halfling's food, ignore Brawl squares or bribe the City Watch guards loitering by the pub exits.<br/><br/>The game ends when the Brawl deck runs out - inevitably when the fight has died down and it is safe for the City Watch to come in and mop up. Halflings have to escape the pub before the Brawl ends. Any Halfling still on the board at the end of the game automatically loses and does not get to score their meal.<br/><br/>Different types of food are worth different amounts of points. There are also recipes that that give different combinations of food bonus points. Any unused Coin Purses from the Luck deck are also worth additional points. The player with the greatest amount of points at the end of the Heist wins.<br/><br/>",

Open Architecture and clear guidelines for building any kind of war band you want with figures you want to use. Ruleset is friendly to any miniatures, including historicals. Starting bands include centaurs, fae, creeps, and the flying monkeys from the Land of Od.  Does not use an &ldquo;I go, you go&rdquo; turn sequence. Instead, it uses a card driven sequence, full of events and interesting command &amp; control choices for determining what units can move and act.  These cards are assigned to each unit, character and monster in the game.  These activation cards are drawn one at a time and the units are activated in turn.

Once arranged, the screen is removed and play proceeds in alternating turns. Each piece has its own strengths and weaknesses, and multiple units (such as Elephants and Spearmen) may be moved during a single turn.<br/>The game ends upon the capture of an opposing player&rsquo;s King.<br/><br/>Cyvasse combines the simple elegance of chess with elements reminiscent &quot;Stratego&quot; and &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;.<br/><br/>The following material represents an amalgamation of the better fan-published material found online coupled with my own ideas.â¨ It is hoped that the following interpretation provides a balanced, interesting and (above all) fun Cyvasse experience while keeping as close as possible to the descriptions presented in the novels.<br/><br/>",

Field Marshall Erwin Rommel&rsquo;s Army Group B had erected strong fortifications along the coast of Holland, Belgium, and France, including the French Mediterranean coast, creating The Atlantic Wall. The bunkers and minefields were backed up by some of Germany&rsquo;s best troops. Allied forces had been gathering in England and the Mediterranean for more than two years, preparing to assault Hitler&rsquo;s Fortress Europe.<br/><br/>On D-Day, 6 June 1944, they attacked on what Rommel called &ldquo;the longest day.&rdquo; Success of the invasion was far from guaranteed, but the Allied victory on the beaches signaled the beginning of the end for the Germans in Western Europe.<br/><br/>Paul Koenig's Fortress Europe recreates the war in Western Europe from the D-day invasion to VE-Day, what General Eisenhower dubbed &ldquo;the mighty endeavor.&rdquo; As the Allied player, you must choose a landing site and then get ashore with a successful landing. This is followed with a breakout of the beachhead and a drive across France, culminating with a deep penetration into Germany itself. As the German player, you must choose a wise defensive alignment of your forces, including hidden units, and hope that you are strong enough at the point of the actual landing to defeat the Allied invasion. If you fail at the water's edge, you must conduct an orderly withdrawal across France, constantly delaying the Allies, until you are strong enough to launch a winter counter-attack (historically, the Battle of the Bulge).<br/><br/>What's In The Box?:<br/><br/>&bull;  One 40-page Rulebook<br/>&bull;  One 26&quot; x 38&quot; paper game map<br/>&bull;  Three sheets of double-sided, laser-cut game pieces<br/>&bull;  Four Player Aid cards<br/>&bull;  One six-sided 12mm die<br/>&bull;  One white, 9&quot; x 11 7/8&quot; Deluxe cardboard VPG game box<br/>&bull;  One beautiful box cover sleeve<br/>&bull;  One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin<br/>&bull;  One charcoal dessicant packet<br/><br/>",

The self-destruction mechanism has been triggered and players only have 5 minutes to kill the aliens blocking their way to the emergency exit hatch.<br/><br/>Players are dealt six face-down alien cards showing the hit pattern to complete in order to kill the alien. The hit patterns consist in 4 or 5 dice in various colors and values. When the game starts, a timer is triggered, all players flip the first card in their deck, and then simultaneously roll dice as fast as they can, in order to complete the hit patterns lying in front of them. Once a pattern is complete, the player flips the next card and starts rolling dice again to complete the new pattern revealed. Dice can (and in some cases must) be passed between players to complete their patterns.<br/><br/>If all players manage to complete all the patterns they were dealt at the beginning of the game, they reach the escape pod safely and leave the space station unharmed. However, if the timer reaches zero before all patterns are completes, the space station explodes with aliens and humans aboard, and everyone lose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since Colombus arrived in America in 1495, rumors said there was a mythical city called &quot;El Dorado&quot; built using gold and which guarded great treasures. After some centuries, word spread of a lake in the mountains where a sacred rituals took place where gold was thrown into the waters as offering to the gods.<br/><br/>Now, using the technology available in the 19th Century, some expeditionaries (the players) will try and drain Guatavita Lake in search of this glorious treasures.<br/><br/>Guatavita is a worker placement game, where player will try to get machinery, work force and plumbing needed to drain each tile in the lagoon. After draining a tile, the tile will be flipped to reveal treasure, fame points, ponds or disasters. But the gold will be scarce and the expeditions will get poorer with each turn, making it harder to get to the center of the lake.<br/><br/>The game ends if one of two conditions is met: either a player reaches the center tile of the lake, or a player enters bankruptcy. Points are scored for having the most camps, for having machinery still working, for the explored area and for remaining gold.<br/><br/>This is a game of economical scarcity, and where every piece of gold counts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this terrain tile manipulation game, 2 to 4 Druids match wits to transform the terrain to match their own personal goal. Every Druid has a unique ability, and with the use of movement, standard actions, action cards, and well planned strategy, they set out to transform the land to their liking.<br/><br/>It's not worker placement, it's not tile placement, it's tile manipulation! No dice to decide your fate - just your cunning, wits, and planning. Are you ready to transform the land to the way you want it? After all, you are a Druid; you should be able to do that without any problem. But watch out for the other Druids disrupting your terraforming!<br/><br/>You win the game by completing your personal goal - even on someone else's turn! To complete your goal, all terrain tiles specified on your Goal Card must be face-up on the game board in the layout specified. While you are trying to complete your goal, your opponents are also trying to complete their own - which could disrupt your tactics and planning.<br/><br/>The standard game is played on a field of Terrain Tiles laid out in a 5 x 5 configuration. On your turn, you may Pass (take no moves or actions) and draw a Spell Card. Or you may take one Move Action, one Standard Action, and as many Free Actions as you desire (in ANY order). Then at the end of your turn, draw one Spell Card (yes, that means if you Pass, you get two Spell Cards). Download the Rules to learn how all the Actions work.<br/><br/>The Terrain Tiles are double sided and represent many types of terrain like mountains, water, desert, grassland, and frozen tundra, as well as special areas like a village or a tavern. But there are two very special terrain types: there is the Mystical Wild Tile that is a wild Terrain Tile, and then there is the Void Tile that no player can move through or land on.<br/><br/>Included with the game are four variants: one to make the game easier, one to make the game longer and more challenging, one that increases the size of the game area (to 6 x 6 tiles), and then there is the Black Druid variant, who adds a truly chaotic element to the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the Persona of a famous detective who has been invited to a party, only to discover their host has been murdered, and one of them is responsible. It is up to the Partygoers to identify and arrest the Killer, or determine if there are multiple Killers, before they get murdered as well.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, there is the hidden identity ritual of having all Killers open their eyes and identify one another. One Killer must decide to make the first murder and then leave a Cause Of Death card and a Clue card, tied to their Persona, on the host's BODY sheet. Regular play begins and everyone goes to the room in which they want to take their turn. Each player, upon entering, takes a Drink card, that determines the order of questioning, and a Drawer card to see if they can find something useful.<br/><br/>When everyone has finished at the table, each player can ask a question of one other, attempting to tie them to the murder, or to uncover the progress of their investigation. Afterwards, the players will disperse to find new players to question. This process of hunting suspects from room to room continues until there is another murder.<br/><br/>At any time during gameplay, one player can attempt to kill another player by giving them a Weapon card (with a Cause Of Death), and a Clue card. But be careful, if the intended victim has a Weapon, they may try to defend themselves. And be sneaky, if the victim sees the attack coming they are allowed a single scream that could be heard by potential witnesses. The wise Killer will sneak up on the other player, and touch the victim on the back. The victim will not get a chance to scream nor defend themselves.<br/><br/>When a murder is discovered an Accusation Phase begins. All the surviving players gather and each is allowed one question to &quot;examine the body.&quot; The victim may only reply by showing a card, including the Cause of Death and Clue left behind by the Killer. Based on what everyone has learned over their investigations, an Accusation may be made. All the free and living players vote on whether or not to put the player accused of being a Killer under House Arrest.<br/><br/>Play continues until someone makes a Final Accusation, declaring that they know who all the Killers are. The accuser will name the players (alive, dead, and under arrest) they believe to be Killers. Arguments are made, then a vote is taken. Any accused players who are still free and alive are placed under House Arrest, and the game ends. Identities are revealed, and the players discover who won: the Partygoers or the Killers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Russia would fall to a new enemy in the resurrected Rasputin the great and the middle east would struggle under the cults of Moloch. The Pacific would see the rise of the Elder Gods with the return of R'lyeh and the cult of Dagon, in the Bermuda the re-emergence of Atlantis would see a new enemy and cult step onto the stage.<br/><br/>Even with all this, mankind still continue to fight each other. Old enemies and grudges reappear, Mexico invades America, the Prussians invade New Guinea, and China invades Manchuria and Japan.<br/><br/>The game is played with company-level sized units of infantry, horsed cavalry, tanks or machine guns. In their turn each player moves their miniatures, conducts artillery fire, resolves aerial attacks and then undertakes combat (ranged or close assault) against their opponent. Morale is also considered; as unit take casualties they may become ineffective, retire to the rear or even surrender.<br/><br/>Players attempt to win by defeating their opponents and driving them from the field or by completing one-off scenario based objectives.<br/><br/>",

Where you take from on your turn directly affects which cards your opponent can choose from on their turn. Choose wisely to gain the best sets, and avoid the potentially dangerous/unwanted animals!<br/><br/>The game uses a 4*4 grid of cards, with 2 'arrow' cards (one per player) pointing to a row and a column respectively.  On each player's turn, they move their arrow card to a new row/column and take the card in the grid pointed to by both arrow cards.  Most cards have varying types of set-collection scoring opportunities; others have special actions to swap cards or discard cards.<br/><br/>Once all cards in the grid have been taken, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Once a player completes 2 of the 3 goals available, they win!<br/><br/>RULES:<br/>To start the game, shuffle the 5 goal cards and randomly draw 3 of them. Those will be the goals for this game. The other 2 cards can be returned to the box.<br/><br/>Take the 1 Red cube &quot;left&quot; card and the 2 Yellow cubes &quot;right&quot; card from the deck and place them on the table. This is the starting function. Shuffle the rest of the cards and deal three to each player. Then give each player 3 red cubes. The player who was most recently in a math class will go second.<br/><br/>Turns:<br/>Each turn, the current player MUST do the following things<br/>- Play only one card to either side of the equation. <br/>- Perform the equation if they have the cubes on the left side to trade for the cubes on the right side from the supply. If they do not have the necessary cubes, they MUST take 1 red cube from the supply. <br/>- Draw one card from the draw pile.<br/>(Play passes to the next player)<br/><br/>As soon as a player meets the requirements for one of the goals, the MUST trade those cubes into the supply and take that goal card. The first player to complete 2 of the 3 goal cards wins the game.<br/><br/>If the draw pile is exhausted, take the top two equation cards off and leave them on the table. Then you can shuffle the remaining cards to reform the draw pile.<br/><br/>If using the function causes a player to trade for a resource that has been exhausted, they do not get that resource and they do not take a red cube.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The discovery of Pearl Lands, a galaxy with abundant resources, changed the face of the space race forever. Fleets traveled to Pearl Lands to transport new red shiny Pearl resource to our solar system, an adventure that was not possible before the use of Pearl extensively in every part of space technology. And the gift of Pearl Lands was not limited to Pearl! A green rain made of grain, discovered on a Pearl Lands&rsquo; planet, created a new energy source for space technologies, and a curious little yellow flower with beautiful petals provided Mana, a seed to be cultivated with utmost care. So, with these three new resources previously unknown to mankind, space travel to the farthest points of the Pearl Lands galaxy became a reality, and with the establishment of colony after colony Pearl Lands has become a new home for mankind.<br/><br/>Of course, war has never ended. With the use of new technologies, it just became more sophisticated. Fights for planets turned into a fight for resources, whether by using fire power or trade channels. Prosperity was never enough for mankind. There was always more to gain, and more to develop. Now it's your turn to join the race. Trade, fight and build future technologies. Power is a beautiful thing, so make sure you have it all&hellip;<br/><br/>Pearl Lands is a 2-4 player resource management strategy game with a sci-fi theme in which you compete to build three main resource buildings before other players. It&rsquo;s a fast paced game that gets more and more intense with each passing turn.<br/><br/>The game has different strategy elements like attacking opponents to steal their resources, trading resources and using universe cards to change the course of the game (sometimes just slightly and sometimes drastically). Its combat mechanics is similar to Risk, while trade aspect gives it more like a Catan style strategy element. However there is no tile or troop movement factor that complicate things: it&rsquo;s designed to be fun and straightforward.<br/><br/>Pearl Lands is full of surprises: the game can turn even at the last round. However it&rsquo;s not a game of pure luck. The player with long term winning strategy will definitely have the upper hand, and most likely will be the target of other players banding together against her. Alliances are of the utmost importance. Cunning players will find the game to their liking, but utilizing only the art of deception may not be enough to win the game. Sometimes desperate measures like a kamikaze attack to destroy five resource crystals by sacrificing an attack ship can change the balance of power. And buying universe cards can pay off greatly if you get one extra attack or defense die, or get to change the resource setup on the board to sabotage an opponent's game plan.<br/><br/>",

Your previous exploits have garnered the attention of one of the most prestigious Bounty Hunting Guilds, The Severed Skull. But first, you must prove yourself worthy of initiation, and for that you must compete against others who have also been chosen.<br/><br/>The game takes place over a series of rounds. On your turn, you will be tracking down a variety of the universe's most notorious fugitives.<br/><br/>You start with a hand size of 4 cards, each representing the fugitives you are currently tracking. On each turn, all players will secretly select one fugitive to catch. Once all players have chosen a fugitive, the fugitives are revealed and placed in each player's Temporary Holding Cell aboard their ships. Then, in turn order, starting with the 1st player, each player has the opportunity to activate the Special Action that is awarded for the fugitive&rsquo;s capture.<br/><br/>After all actions have been taken, the fugitives are then moved from the players&rsquo; Temporary Holding Cells to their ships&rsquo; Brigs. If at this time any player has 5 different fugitives wanted for 5 different crimes and are wanted by 5 different Bounty Issuing Organizations, then the game promptly ends. If not, all players track new fugitives by drawing back up to 4 cards in hand.<br/><br/>At this time the 1st player marker is passed clockwise, and another round begins.<br/><br/>This cycle continues until someone captures a winning set of fugitives or until there are no more fugitives left to track (i.e., the draw deck runs out). At which time, scores are tallied and a winner is crowned.<br/><br/>",

The game is about the size of a deck of playing cards.<br/><br/>Players attempt to accrue the most points by playing a numbered card on each of their turns. Their hand is finite and cards are drawn rarely. They must use the resources they are given in clever ways to win two out of three rounds of play. Special Arcana cards can drastically effect the game, each offering a unique power.<br/><br/>Daggers feels like it belongs in a rich fantasy world. Both the look and play of the game make it seem like a living and immersive piece of a fantasy setting.<br/><br/>The art and feel of Daggers draws on the iconic images of the tarot. Both in name and depiction the cards have an esoteric flavor that add an air of romanticized mystery to the game.<br/><br/>If you've ever experienced the trope of the seedy fantasy tavern, be it in a movie, a book, or perhaps a role-playing game, then you know the scene is not complete without a few shady characters gambling in the greasy lantern light. The game they are playing is Daggers.<br/><br/><br/>",

(If you play a 2, for example, you must ask either your neighbor or the player next to them, going either clockwise or counter-clockwise depending on the direction of play.)<br/><br/>The topic of your question must be related to the card you just played, with blue cards relating to daily life, green society and community, red love and friendship, and yellow private matters. If the chosen player cannot answer or chooses not to, they must draw two cards, then the next player plays. If they answer the question, then they get to play a card. The game includes special cards, so the player questioned might be able to bounce the question back to the original questioner, pass it on to the next player, or require more people to answer as well.<br/><br/>If you have no matching cards on your turn, you draw a card and your turn ends. Alternatively, you might play a special card that reverses turn order or changes the color of cards that can be played.<br/><br/>Whoever plays all of their cards first wins!<br/><br/>",

To prevail, you will need to explore and colonize new star systems, build space ships, research new technologies, politicize in the galactic council, and keep your population happy.<br/><br/>There are many routes to victory; smart plotting and investing in the right political Agenda could secure your political supremacy, or you might science your way to the top, uniting the galaxy in a holistic singularity event. You might slowly plod to economic predominance. An aggressive colonization strategy with the support of your population could secure your superior power, as would the military domination of one of the other big intergalactic players. Reading which path your opponents follow and outsmarting them is key to victory.<br/><br/>De Bello Galactico is a straightforward and streamlined true 4X space game. The vast interstellar distances covered are baked into the Hyperspace movement system, doing away with the need for a board. Each Faction has different upgradeable ships, as well as a different way to handle their population. Thanks to a staggered action and pass system, downtime is minimal and rounds flow fast.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This is a stand alone game for solitaire and two-players and is fully compatible with the other Panzer Orders games and expansions. This game also includes some new gameplay mechanics and special scenarios to add to the Panzer Orders range.<br/><br/>The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and comes complete with everything you need.<br/><br/>You can combine two copies of the game to make either larger or tank-vs-tank games for both solo or multiplayer games or combine this game with existing Panzer Orders games.<br/><br/>With the game you will receive two decks of cards - one deck for the Soviets and one for the Germans, plus rule summary cards (56 cards in total). You also get a full set of the rules plus a dice - everything you need to play.<br/><br/>Each card has a points value based on the card characteristics and special rules. The players agree a point based battle and then build their decks, spending points on specific cards.<br/><br/>Each player must form two columns of any mixture of tanks and then attack the opponents columns. The first player to defeat both their opponents columns or force the opposing player to draw their last card, wins the game.<br/><br/>During the player turn you can choose to dig and defend with your card, moves cards from one column to another or attack with ling range or close combat. Non of these are without their risks and weighing up the risk vs the strategic gain is part of the decision making elements of the game.<br/><br/>Combat is fast, simple but very brutal with all the dice rolls required on the cards - no charts or looking up in the rules. Damaged cards are suppressed first before being removed from the game and can still make a free saving throw on the dice to keep in the fight.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Later released in the May 2019 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.<br/><br/><br/>Captain Crag navigates starships for the Dynasty. While he's a natural among the stars, he's even better at avoiding his job. Crag knows all the tricks. You'll find him off looking for some made up tool for hours, with a 528-Z Longnose coasting on autopilot. Nobody works as hard as him to not work.<br/><br/>But when the stars align, Crag will take control. He'll save the crew and by the time they go to thank him, he's hiding off somewhere with a co-worker covering for him. It's would be almost comical... if his job wasn't so crucial.<br/><br/>We had a vote at the Button Shy Twin Stars Discord channel, and Crag beat out 4 others to be our fan-made custom character. We chatted about his backstory a bit and then worked on mechanics. Jason and Mike finished him up and wanted to share at PNP Arcade, since Twin Stars doesn't require shuffling. This card can be printed and played along a standard or PNP copy of the game. Enjoy!<br/><br/>",

The West was no longer the West, it was the WILD WEST!<br/><br/>Now, the year is 1885. The Wild family has made a fortune through various &ldquo;marketing&rdquo; strategies, &ldquo;business&rdquo; ventures, and &ldquo;community&rdquo; projects. More importantly, the Wild family has emblazoned their name on both a territory and an era. After decades of pure wildness, the Wilds are tuckered out and ready for retirement. The family has grown tired of being ridiculously, filthy, stinking rich and they&rsquo;ve done everything there is to do in the West.<br/><br/>After a raucous family council, the Wilds have decided to give away half of their fortune and head east to retire as New York City slickers. The family wants someone with basic mathematical skills who is also able to wisely manage money without going into debt. Most importantly, though, the Wilds want someone to carry on their Wild legacy in the West; a person with rambunctious spunkiness and tons of true grit.<br/><br/>The family has designed a simple competition to determine who will win the Wild Family Fortune and the glorious title of WILD ONE. Challengers have come from near and far to participate in this unprecedented event. As a challenger, your task is to manage basic income and expenses and stay as close to &ldquo;1&rdquo; as possible without going broke or into debt. Of course, there are other challengers attempting to do the exact same thing. Besides being known for their immense wealth, the Wild family also has a reputation for being very &ldquo;hands-on.&rdquo; During the contest, they will get down and dirty to help their favorite challenger win. Will you emerge victorious and be named the Wild One?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;My God! What will the Country say?&quot;<br/><br/>-- President A. Lincoln<br/><br/>The Chancellorsville campaign, which took place in and around Virginia&rsquo;s Wilderness in May 1863, is considered by many to be Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s masterpiece, a true triumph &ldquo;against the odds.&rdquo; Opposing Lee was Union commander Joseph &ldquo;Fighting Joe&rdquo; Hooker, who had devised a plan that seemed assured of success. His cavalry would raid deep behind Confederate lines, cutting Lee&rsquo;s supplies, while Hooker and four of his seven infantry corps would march west, then south, and appear behind the Confederate defenses opposite the city of Fredericksburg.<br/><br/>Lee would be compelled to withdraw south, in which case he would be pursued, or he would be compelled to attack with his numerically inferior army to avoid being crushed between the hammer and anvil of Hooker&rsquo;s forces. &ldquo;May God have mercy on General Lee, for I will have none,&rdquo; Hooker declared.<br/><br/>No plan, however, survives first contact with enemy. With the advantage of interior lines and a great deal of audacity Lee would confound his opponent by continually bringing more rifles to the critical place at the critical time. And it didn&rsquo;t&rsquo; hurt that Lee&rsquo;s largest corps was commanded by one &ldquo;Stonewall&rdquo; Jackson. . . .<br/><br/>Lee&rsquo;s Greatest Victory is an area-impulse game but one unlike anything seen before. Since the appearance of the &ldquo;sunset die roll&rdquo; nearly three decades ago players have alternated activating a single area, with variation coming in the form of an uncertain turn length. Play has a chess-like feel, with players able to act and react with a great deal of prior calculation. Short turns could be frustrating for one or both players. In this revolutionary development of the genre players no longer know how many impulses they, or their opponent, will have, creating both opportunities and crises that cannot be anticipated in advance&mdash;just like real combat. The &ldquo;momentum&rdquo; swings back and forth but rarely the same way twice. At the same time, each turn lasts as long as the players wish it to last, ensuring something will happen every turn.<br/><br/>Units of maneuver are Union divisions and Confederate brigades for the most part, with historical leaders present to provide a combat boost though at the risk of being wounded or KIA. Pontoon bridges and entrenchments are part of the basic rules while optional rules incorporate weather and optional units for both sides. Best of all, it's just six turns long and very playable in one sitting.<br/><br/>Content:<br/><br/>    Map - One full color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet<br/>    Counters - 176 full color 5/8&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>    Rules length - 12 pages<br/>    Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>    Complexity - Medium<br/>    Playing time - Up to 3 hours<br/>    How challenging is it solitaire? - Poor<br/><br/><br/>Design - Michael Rinella<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh<br/>Graphics - Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>(from the publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

Unlike previous island invasions, in which the Marines had crushed ill-prepared defenders, Peleliu would become a strategic nightmare for the Americans.<br/><br/>The Japanese had spent months building defensive fortifications and turning the island into a death trap.  Bombarded  by  battleships and hammered by Corsairs dropping tons of napalm, the Japanese held on and withstood the initial invasion. Skillful night attacks and relentless artillery barrages made the Americans pay dearly for every inch taken.  <br/>The terrible 115-degree heat and endless combat sapped American morale and turned a battle projected to be won in 4  days into a vicious 6-week campaign.  With the aid of the  reinforcing 81st Infantry Division the Marines would eventually win at Peleliu, but the cost was devastatingly high.<br/><br/>You, as the  American Player, have a limited amount of time to  destroy all 30 Japanese Counters from the map. You win the game as soon as the last enemy counter is destroyed, but lose at any time the Morale Track reaches the 1 box, or the last Time Chit of Level IV Intensity is drawn with Japanese Counters still in play.<br/><br/>",

Sniping was his second nature, the cutting barb was his forte, and he even took to stealing their diaries to scrawl snarky comments in the margins. He was eventually disowned. But he had learned swordsmanship to at least a competent degree, and a Guild membership was easy enough for someone of his connections. Ironically, he welcomed the invasion, but was cast out when he was found scrawling derisive comments beneath graffiti the orcs would leave on each other&rsquo;s&rsquo; walls.

Quality ingredients. Awesome vibe. What could be missing? You probably got it by now... Yes, You! The famous Guly&aacute;s Masters. As soon as it turned out that you&rsquo;ll be cooking the main course, many Gourmets and Locals flocked around the fire to see what you are up to. Their expectations are high and very much different. You will really have to get it together to impress these guys! And you will have to pay attention whether it is a critical kitty or a seasoned chef you want to blow away. Well, what are you waiting for? Start cooking like the Eskimo dress up! (Quick!)<br/><br/>Guly&aacute;s is a half-cooperative game where you will need to cook a soup under changing circumstances but working together the whole time. That is until one of you thinks that it&rsquo;s ready and yells &lsquo;Guly&aacute;s!&rsquo;. Your guly&aacute;s is considered successful when its value reaches 13 points. During the course of the game, you will have to cook more than one guly&aacute;s. You will get a different amount of victory points for every meal you cook, depending on whether the soup was successfully made, or which Gourmets were impressed. The ultimate winner will be the person who is the best at navigating between the sneaky Locals, the other chefs and the whims of the Gourmets. And most importantly whoever reaches 7 victory points first.<br/><br/>The game is played through several rounds, the players cooking a separate guly&aacute;s in each one of them. The players take actions in clockwise order and can decide between three actions: put an Ingredient in the cauldron, distract a Local or stir the soup. Each player has one Ingredient card in their hands, the active player draws another card - unless they stir the soup - and pick one of the two to take an action. The cards you use always go face down on the game board. Each Ingredient has a separate value so you cannot possibly know the exact value of the guly&aacute;s, plus the Locals can steal ingredients from the cauldron if you don't distract them. So take extra care before yelling 'Guly&aacute;s!'. If you were brave enough and yelled 'Guly&aacute;s!' you will have to check the point value of the soup. If you were right and the cauldron does have 13 points worth of Ingredients in it, you get 2 Victory Points. If you were wrong, all the other players get 1 Victory Point. The players have the option to get additional Victory Points by guessing the Gourmet conditions right. After yelling 'Guly&aacute;s!' but before calculating the value of the soup, the players have to guess if any (or both) of the Gourmet conditions are met. If you guessed right, you get an additional Victory Point for each Gourmet. Good luck chefs!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this scenario, &quot;Who will be the new king?&quot;, players trying to impress the king by building tall towers and being in as many castles as possible.<br/><br/>In the second scenario, &quot;Impress the King's Envoys!&quot;, players seek to be close to the King's Envoys in order to present their buildings. If you build for an envoy, you get double the number of points, but this isn't easy. When building you have to pay attention to the color of the fields as not every tower may be built on every field.<br/><br/>",

(VMLS) is an low-complexity, two-player war game simulating the events that could have unfolded during the year following a major switch in east front strategy by Hitler made just prior to the launch of the Kursk offensive. That is, he cancels that ill-fated attack and instead transfers approximately two armies from the east to the west, there to use them against the Anglo-Allies, while leaving von Manstein in charge in Russia. Von Manstein rationalizes the situation by pulling back to the narrowest front possible, the Riga-Odessa line, and there prepares to make a final stand against the Red Army. A complete game generally takes three to four hours to complete, and it is suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>",

You must answer the call and travel with the champion Sigurd through Heathland both to build defenses to protect the village and to collect runes needed to defeat the beast. Fafnir will fall to either Sigurd's sword or one of the heroes' strikes...or will he? While most heroes quest for glory in The Flames of Fafnir to receive the town's honor, one might seek victory through more nefarious means by joining Fafnir in his destruction of the village!<br/><br/>The fireballs launched from Fafnir's mouth toward the town are represented by marbles that will collide with anything in their path, damaging heroes and destroying defenses. Each round, Fafnir acts by changing his angle of attack, spawning monsters, or building up his fiery breath. Eventually, he will release all his charged fireballs towards the town &mdash; and if all the town's walls are destroyed, everyone loses.<br/><br/>While walking the Heathland, you'll encounter mythological creatures and monsters; slaying them will aid you in your quest as snow trolls, giant spiders, and selkies guard magical sites where ancient runes can be found. Claim these runes and bring them to bear on Fafnir to kill the dragon. You can gather wood, stone, and gold to construct defenses to protect the town. Barricades, watch towers, and trenches will reduce the carnage, and if your structures intercept the fireballs, you'll be rewarded, so plan your defense well. Praying to Gods and raising defenses will reward you with powerful artifacts that allow you to improve your movement, gain more glory, weaken the dreaded Fafnir, and more.<br/><br/>If an opportunistic hero chooses to join Fafnir, they get to ride the dragon, turning on the other heroes thanks to rider cards while trying to destroy the town in an attempt to take victory for their self!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stay Low is the perfect card game for anyone who loves a good challenge. The objective of the game is to avoid accumulating points by discarding cards from your tableau of 4x3 cards (ten of which are face down at the start of the round).<br/><br/>Each card is numbered from -2 to 12, and on your turn you can do one of two things: take the top card from the discard pile, exchanging it face up with a card from your display, OR take the top card from the face down draw pile. If you do the latter, you can either exchange the card face up with one card from your display, or you can discard it and turn over one of your hidden cards.<br/><br/>The round ends when one player has revealed all their cards, at which point all other players turn over their remaining cards. All the numbers on the cards are added up for scoring. If the player who triggered the end of the round does not have the fewest points, then they must double their score. The game ends after one player has 100 or more points. Whoever has the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Casino).<br/><br/>In Cast &amp; Capture, you are a mage specializing in the collection of wondrous creatures for the Arcane Academy.  You must use your knowledge of the elements and arcane powers to capture a variety of mystical and magical creatures before your fellow mages.  It is only by using your wits to blend the right spells and group the right creatures that you can earn the title of Master Capturer.<br/><br/>There are 2 decks in the game: a Creature deck and a Spell Deck. Each creature and Spell have a Power and Element tied to them. To begin, mages are given 4 Spells at random from the Spell deck and 4 creatures are placed on the field.  Each turn a new creature will come onto the field and the mage whose turn it is will use their Spells to attempt to capture any number of creatures on the field that match the Power and Element of the Spell they cast.  If they cannot capture a creature, then their spell is added to the Spell Pool to be used by any mage. Mages refresh their hand of Spells when they run out.<br/><br/>Using the Spell Blending and Creature Grouping mechanics, mages will use light strategy and symbol recognition to blend spells to create new ones and even group creatures together to make bizarre and whimsical combinations.  By mastering Blending/Grouping, it helps the mage to ensure that the right spell is always at hand and maximum number of creatures are captured per spell.<br/><br/>With beautiful, hand-drawn illustrations and a unique split-card, dual-deck design; Cast and Capture updates an old gaming favorite for a new generation of players both young and old.<br/><br/>",

There is no grid - stones may be pushed to anywhere on the board. When touching stones enclose an area the majority of stones on the perimeter of that area decide who controls the area. It is illegal to create an area which has the same number of black and white stones on its perimeter. Stones that are part of the perimeter of an area are immobilized, but the rest may be pushed again instead of introducing a new stone. The winning player is one who connects their edges of the board.<br/><br/>There is no standard shape of board and no standard stone. You can use a tree stump and real stones if you wish.

Players combine more than 12 different elements to interact with each other and win the game! Valence Plus expands on the elements and chemical reactions players can make from the original Valence game.<br/><br/>Players draw Element cards from the deck in order to form Molecules. Each Element has a different Valence number that describes how many electrons it has to give (positive) or how many electrons it needs (negative) to have a full valence shell. If the Valence numbers add up to zero, they form a Molecule!<br/><br/>Each Molecule is worth a certain point value. If your molecules add up to 16 points then you win the game! But beware&hellip; several molecules are vulnerable to attack from your opponents! Acids attack Bases (4 points) and turn them into Salt and Water (1 point each). Deadly Carbonyls (which have the special power of removing oxygen from the board) are vulnerable to attack by Water. Players interact with each other using real chemical reactions!<br/><br/>",

There are grenades (exploding and destroying everything) and land mines (exploding and destroying everything, but itself destroyed by engineer soldiers). Pieces in camps may not be captured.

        "description": "This German Trading Card Game is based on the weekly science fiction series Perry Rhodan. You you can play over the story from about the first 100 novellas issued. The game is broken up in different phases which you can play separately or one after another for a very long game. The phases with different backsides are:<br/><br/>Phase I: Die Dritte Macht (The Third Power, 1996)<br/>Phase II/III: Topsider &amp; Springer (1996)<br/>Phase IV: Vorsto&szlig; nach Arkon (Approach to Arkon, 1997)<br/>Phase V: Atlan &amp; Arkon (2003)<br/><br/>Fanpro canceled the game in 1998. Finally Between The Stars (a company founded by fans of the game) took over and released phase V in 2003.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins this complex game. You get victory points for completing phases and for completing side plots. Only after a phase is completed the players can draw cards from the next phase (you need separate decks for each phase you will play).<br/><br/>The cards show different planets, star systems, mutants with psi-talents, other persons, troops, spaceships, fleets, accessories, event cards and galactic riddles. There is also an action card deck to randomize the fights someway.<br/><br/>Every card can be &quot;Pro&quot;, &quot;Anti&quot;, or both (&quot;Dual&quot;). In a game you have to play two sides at the same time, the pro-side (the good guys) and the anti-side (the bad boys). After you have built up your fleets and armies (you normally hide them below other cards) you fight space fights and invasions on enemy planets: With your anti-side you attack the pro-sides of your opponents, and with your pro-side you damage their anti-sides.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to lead your randomly drawn Rumble Fighters to eliminate all your Opponent's Rumble Fighters. The Rumble Fighters and art style is inspired by 80s Saturday Morning Cartoons and video games that we all love.<br/><br/>Players receives six Rumble Fighters - two powerful leaders and four warriors via draft or random draw. Each Rumble Fighter has a health value, an attack value, a defense value, special abilities, and varied Action Points that indicate which directions they can attack and defend.<br/><br/>Each Player places six Rumble Fighters onto a four-by-four grid and then uses your turns doing movements and attacks. Each turn, you have three movements to move your Rumble Fighters into the best position to attack: Dash, Castle, and Slide. When you Dash, you move a single character to an adjacent space. When you Castle, you can exchange two of your adjacent fighters. When you slide, you can move an entire row or column of fighter in either direction.<br/><br/>Positioning is the main component of the game. How can I position my Rumble Fighters in the best possible way to eliminate all my Opponent's fighter and win the game?<br/><br/>",

If only the villains worked together, they could easily defeat the arrogant superheroes, but they are too concerned with getting all the credit to work together.<br/><br/>The heroes are represented in the form of cards that are played out of a separate Hero Deck. Each hero has an attack value, that also doubles as their point value at the end of the game. The heroes also have their own superpower that trigger when they are defeated. Some of these superpowers will help the attacking villain, others will hurt the attacking villains, and some will hurt every villain!<br/><br/>The game is over when either of the decks run out of cards. Once the game is over, each player's Victory Points are totaled and one villains is declared as &quot;The Greatest Super-Villain of All Time!&quot;<br/><br/>",

There are several bonus points to achieve - most of them when you manage to hit one ball after the other (like in real billiards). To give you enough strategical possibilities, you are free to choose the billiard ball with which you want to start the moves.<br/><br/>Though the number of players is given from 2-6, it works perfectly as solitaire game, where you can think about your next turn as long as you want.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A quantum vortex is rearranging reality... history and fantasy are being jumbled together and somebody needs to untangle the mess! You must find the lost people and creatures then get them to follow you back to their homes. Lead enough followers to safety and you might just be able to destroy the vortex and rescue reality!<br/><br/>Follow is a tile/card matching game based on strategy and luck.<br/>Players create a different board each time by joining together the hex-tiles (111mm max. width) as the game progresses. Each hex shows a different location and in each location there is a 'follower' card (45x63mm).<br/><br/>The locations and characters are well known from history or fantasy but are randomly mixed. The objective is to lead these famous faces to their specific places. For example; you could find a bewildered Dracula in the Wild West and lead him through Ancient Egypt and Camelot to reach his Transylvanian home.<br/><br/>The rules provide a choice of actions each turn, such as exploring new locations and stealing followers from other players as well as the opportunity to have several turns in a row, allowing players to plan strategies.<br/><br/>The followers and locations are colour-coded as yellow, green, blue, purple and red. To win the game a player has to return one follower of each colour to the safety of their specific locations. Upon achieving this feat the player must then succeed a dice roll called the 'Gizmotron roll' in order to reset reality and therefore be declared as the winner.<br/><br/>An eight page (A5) 'Instruction Manual' gives rules for 2 to 6 players aged 8 to adult. A standard game comprises 30 'follower' cards, 30 corresponding location hex-tiles, 6 'vortex' hex-tiles and lasts from 20 to 60 mins, depending on the number of players. The game is made quicker and easier by reducing the number of follower cards involved, along with their location hexes.<br/><br/>",

These cards may be ghost, zombie, scary pumpkin, or haunted house cards. They then roll the three dice in an effort to satisfy the conditions to win that card. If successful, the player takes it and places it face-up in front of them, drawing any &quot;spooky action&quot; cards as instructed.<br/><br/>They may PLAY any spooky action cards they have before relinquishing their turn to the next player. Spooky action cards may place a deck &quot;off limits&quot;, force an opponent to play for a specific card, manipulate dice, split, etc. There are also three &quot;ghost&quot; cards in this deck that count toward your overall ghost total.<br/><br/>Collecting sets of 3 of zombie, pumpkin, or haunted house cards allow special powers that are important later in the game. A special effect of winning a haunted house card is getting to &quot;peek&quot; at the bottom card of the deck it came from, which helps direct a players strategy.<br/><br/>A few of the main deck cards have a &quot;vanish&quot; effect, which can be spent to move a card from the top of a deck to the bottom, thus keeping it away from an opponent. Spending a &quot;vanish&quot; card in this way may break up a valuable set of three, so care must be given before deciding this course of action.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player has acquired seven ghost cards and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Contents: 60 cards(25 main deck and 35 spooky action), 3 six-sided colored dice, and rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pentagame is an abstract strategy game without chance element. It is played on a pentagram star that shows 100 round stops. The 5 corners and the 5 crossings in the pentagram are colored (white, blue, red, green, yellow). It can be played with 2, 3 or 4 players. It looks a bit like a pentagonal ludo, but it is truly different. For example, there is no chance and pieces don't get beaten. Instead, it is all about moving, swapping, about paths and about areas.<br/><br/>Every player plays 5 pieces of one shape, e.g. cats against pawns or whatever. Every player has one white, one blue, one red, one green and one yellow piece. All pieces start the race on the corners of their respective colors. The goal is to bring three of one's pieces from their corners to the crossing of matching color.<br/><br/>There are five black blocks that are neutral pieces. At the beginning they are on the crossings in the center. There are five gray blocks that come into the game as pieces reach their goals.<br/><br/>One can move in any direction on the star or the ring, as far as there is a free path. But one cannot jump. One can either (1) just move to an empty space, (2) beat a black block, taking its place and re-position it on another free stop somewhere, (3) swap two neighboring pieces, one of which must be one's own piece.<br/><br/>As Ko-rule, immediate repetition of the same move is not allowed.<br/><br/>A piece that reaches its destination crossing is removed from the board. A player thus moving a piece out successfully gains a gray block that she can position on any free stop. Such gray blocks are also neutral pieces, but when they get beaten, they are removed again rather than re-positioned.<br/><br/>The game becomes very complex very soon. Nevertheless, a two player game takes often under 20 minutes, a 3-player maybe 45 minutes, a 4-player some 90 minutes. That of course depends on how long players think, or are allowed to think.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

By the end of 1980 Iraq&rsquo;s invasion of Iran had degenerated into bloody stalemate all along the front. Iran was able to mobilize over two hundred thousand newly recruited citizen-soldiers into their Pasdaran, and both sides rushed additional regular army troops and equipment to the front lines. The Iranian military high command wanted to await the end of the winter rains to launch an offensive in the Spring that would drive the Iraqi&rsquo;s out of Islamic Republic. However, the Iranian clergy, that headed the government, did not trust the lay and military leaders, many of whom the clergy suspected of harboring pro-Shah or anti-fundamentalist adherents, and ordered a more limited but immediate offensive in early January. Dubbed Operation Nasr (Victory), the offensive at Hoveyzeh sought to break through and drive back the Iraqi units that threatened the crucial city of Ahwaz.<br/><br/>",

Of course, we are speaking of time relative to each player's home base. The ships themselves will have hardly aged at all relative to their Home Base. The concept presents interesting situations since one never knows for certain the 'age' of his opponent's ships.<br/><br/>",

These slaves and their trainers (often retired gladiators themselves) made up the familia gladiatorius of the ludus. Normally, the ludus was contracted by the editor to provide fighters for the murrus. It was a risky business, and its practitioners were reviled by Roman society.

        "description": "REVOLVIQA<br/><br/>RevolvIQa, the revolving game series debuted in N&uuml;rnberg Toy Fair 2013. It&rsquo;s basis is an innovation: playing piece supported revolving mechanism. The supporter is a playing piece onto which a constituted bottom surface in the middle of the revolving device is laid upon. A playing piece supported revolving device can make 6 playing pieces step at once.<br/>RevolvIQa Red and RevolvIQa Blue are two independent games, packed into independent boxes, however these ones are intending to be an overture of revolving game series.<br/>In a RevolvIQa box there are 3 individual games: 2 pcs. revolving puzzle games in varied difficulty levels (1 player) and 1 pc. revolving board game (2 players). Playing adventure and rules are varied, however a.m. structure is the same in both RevolvIQa boxes.<br/>Play with revolving puzzles first:<br/>the basic idea here is to have different coloured balls as a &bdquo;pixel&rdquo; of a pic on a playing field. The playing field plate is removable and exchangable. It has a hexagonal shape and it is hole-punched at 37 places in bee-cells pattern. It is to be put onto a basic board having 37 spheric recesses in the same pattern area. After pouring the required balls onto field, revolve until all the coloured balls match with the colours of the graphic. Starting with any ball arrangement results solution! A &bdquo;Fox&rdquo; and a &bdquo;Galaxy&rdquo; in RevolvIQa Red, a &bdquo;Parachute&rdquo; and a &bdquo;Birthday&rdquo; in RevolvIQa Blue is available as main theme on graphics of the playing fields.<br/>Play with board games next:<br/>There are equal starting chance arrangements for both players and one after the other order playable games by immediate revolving in both RevolvIQa board games. <br/>Player wins, who revolves 5 in one row of its chosen coloured balls at first: that&rsquo;s the board game about in RevolvIQa Red. Defeat arrives as magic touch in most of the cases. It&rsquo;s name: &bdquo;COLORICA-5&rdquo;.<br/>Player wins in board game of RevolvIQa Blue, whose all chosen 4 ferries are able to cross the sea first, or the one, whose opponent can&rsquo;t revolve rule-wise anymore. It&rsquo;s wintertime and some areas in the sea is frozen (white balls on the board). Revolving rules: revolve on water only (support on dark blue balls only), at least one of revolving player&rsquo;s ferries shall change place during revolving action, the opponent&rsquo;s can be revolved at the same time, but only if opponent&rsquo;s previous revolving action took place elsewhere. Captivating and exciting. It&rsquo;s name: &bdquo;FERRY&rdquo;.<br/><br/><br/>REVOLVIQA Blue<br/>3 games in the box: Parachute, Birthday, Ferry<br/><br/>Revolving puzzle and board games that are developing creativity and logical and strategic skills for 1 or 2 players, children or adults.<br/><br/>Parachute<br/><br/>Revolving puzzle games that are developing creativity and logical skills for 1 player, children or adults.

        "description": "You and your fellow engineers are working cooperatively to launch awesome products and grow the user base. In order to successfully launch products, you must develop the necessary infrastructure while keeping an eye on external events, which might help or hinder your efforts.<br/><br/>Launch &amp; Iterate is a turn based cooperative card game. Tech cards are the primary type of card used in the game. Tech cards enable development of either core infrastructure (e.g. Data Redundancy), or offer one-shot benefits (e.g. Refactor). Tech cards are also used as the primary currency in the game, representing engineering effort required to develop new technology or to contribute to launching new products.<br/><br/>During the game, players focus on launching 1 or (potentially) more products at any given time. Successfully launching products increases the overall user base (in millions of users) and allows players to shift effort onto new products. Players attempt to maximize the total user base by the end of the game by strategically selecting the right products to work on at the right time. Each product has specific infrastructure requirements which must be met, along with a cost (in Tech cards) which must be contributed by players in order to successfully launch the product.<br/><br/>On their turn, players may select a Tech card to play from their hand (making sure that all requirements and costs are met), contribute any number of Tech cards from their hand to help launch an active product, and draw new card(s). At the end of each round, players reveal the next Event card, which can either deliver a benefit or incur a penalty, depending on the card as well as the infrastructure levels players have developed. The game is over after 11 events have been resolved.<br/><br/>A key factor in Launch &amp; Iterate is developing infrastructure across 4 critical technology stacks, (F)eatures, (A)ccessibility, (S)torage, and (T)esting. Each stack is built up over the course of the game, from base level 0 to level 7. Developing infrastructure is critical to successfully launching products, but usually doesn't directly affect the user base. Each stack also offers specific benefits at higher levels, such as reducing or negating negative Event effects, increasing user base, enabling better allocation of resources or increasing development capabilities.<br/><br/>",

Using a modified version of the Shields &amp; Swords medieval battle system, it recreates one of the most famous battles of the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>Near a place called Agincourt, Henry V of England and the exhausted, disease-ridden remnants of his army took on a French force the size of which vastly outnumbered his own, and proceeded to wipe the floor with 'em. The French may have had the numbers, the knights, and the horses, but Hal had a strong defensive position and the all-important English longbow. The French sneered at the bowmen as only Frenchmen can, but like the man said, don't nock it until you've tried it.<br/><br/>Chief among the game's features is a clever, speedy, and diceless alternative to opportunity/reaction fire concepts that reflects the difficulties inherent in moving under missile fire. This results in a very tough game for the French Player. The English Player is favored to recreate the historical result, but it's not a stroll in the park.<br/><br/>Like other titles in the Shields &amp; Swords series, We Happy Few is an ideal introduction to wargaming, but with just enough grit to satisfy the seasoned counter-clipper.<br/><br/>",

You take on the role of Hunters, warriors trained to fight back against a tide of Oni demons and mythical creatures let loose by The Cataclysm.<br/><br/>Each game of Hametsu sees the Hunters seeking out a mythical beast known as a Boss, and attempting to take it down. At the beginning of the game, the Hunters will be in stealth and wandering Oni will not be aware of their presence. Once the alarm has been raised, the Oni will pursue and target the Hunters until the Boss is found. Then it's up to the Hunters to be the last ones standing.<br/><br/>Hametsu uses standard d6&rsquo;s for performing tests and saves. Hunters all have stats that govern how many d6 are rolled to perform certain actions. A roll of 4+ is a success. Score enough of those, and you will cast a spell, deal damage, or shrug off a hit.<br/><br/>Carve Your Own Path<br/><br/>Create a Hunter and choose from nine different classes spread among three different schools, all with unique abilities, spells, and playstyles. As you level up, choose new abilities and stats based on your class specific Path of Legend.<br/><br/>Narrative campaign<br/><br/>Hametsu encourages players to track progress from game to game, growing their Hunters and expanding their narrative story. Designed from the ground up for campaign play, dive in to randomly generated scenarios, or fight through the first narrative campaign, The Wolf and the Devil.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shock Army was the name given to the elite fighting units of the Republican 'Ejercito Popular' (The Popular Army).  The game recreates a number of attacks by these spearhead corps.<br/><br/>Shock Army is designed to be played as a table top game between two players.  No map is included, but there are sufficient terrain features to fight four major scenarios.<br/><br/>The game is built around three fundamental concepts.  The first is the importance in battle of an army's command system, that is the way in which its headquarters is organized.  Orders from HQ's are represented by impulse counters.<br/><br/>The second fundamental concept is that of &quot;fighting power&quot;.  Each unit has a total fighting power factor. In combat opposing forces compare their total fighting power factors - the unit with the higher fighting power factor is the victor.<br/><br/>Thirdly, every combat unit can move an unlimited distance.  However, the further a unit moves in one go, the lower its fighting power will fall.  This represents the breakdown of cohesion in a unit if it is pushed too far, too quickly.<br/><br/>",

This may appear to be a wargame, but there are numerous roads to victory, as the use of trade and economic advancement is just as likely to prevail, in the end, as territorial expansion and conquest.<br/><br/>King of Kings includes 15 scenarios set from 1700 BC to 1200 AD, ranging from 1 to 5 players.   A ruler can try to increase his empire by conquest, increase wealth by trade, or invest in civilisatory improvements that may well be a better path to victory than warfare.  Trade is handled by caravans moving from resource areas back to the heart of your empire.  As the design notes say, &quot;this is not a wargame&quot;.<br/><br/>If players desire, battles can be fought in detail, by using the rules from Good Industries' other game, Ancients.  Calls for Divine Intervention, as well as finding out the personal characteristics of your partner in Royal Marriages add to the colour of the game.    The game end is variable, depending on the death of monarchs, which can be sudden (although it is possible in principle to continue playing as one's heir).<br/><br/>(source : Publisher and user's desciption)<br/><br/><br/>Reimplemented by Imperator, which replaced the hex-based map with area movement.<br/><br/>",

What are those categories, and how is an answer correct? Read on...<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out the yellow, green, and red loops so that they overlap like a Venn diagram and form seven specific regions: yellow-only, yellow-and-green, all three colors, etc. Each player represents one of these colors. Each player chooses a category in secret, with the category being something that can easily divide answers into &quot;belongs&quot; or &quot;does not belong&quot;. Examples might be things with four legs, foods, games by Reiner Knizia, things you can cut, and school subjects. Each player writes something that belongs in their category, then the other two players move those answers to the proper region. (If you're yellow, for example, you must give an answer that belongs in the yellow category, but that answer might also belong in the red or green category as well.)<br/><br/>Following this set-up, on a turn one player places a token in one of the seven regions, e.g., inside the red and green categories but outside the yellow one. Each player now gives an answer that matches the status of their own category, then the other players say whether or not your answer is placed in their categories or not. If your answer fits within the proper region, then you score a point and leave the colored portion of your answer sheet visible; if it's not in the proper region, then you hide the colored portion (to show that you don't score), but leave the answer visible to give information to other players.<br/><br/>The first player to score 1 point in all seven regions or to score 8 points total wins.<br/><br/>",

While the last carriers, with only a few planes between them, drew off the massive US carrier strike force, a flotilla of Japanese battleships and cruisers descended on the American invasion fleet in Leyte Gulf. As the Japanese ships rounded the island of Samar, they ran into two task forces of US escort carriers.<br/><br/>Yamato Unleashed picks up the action at this point. The Japanese player must push through the carrier groups and get heavy ships off the edge of the map, where they will find the American transports. The US player must fight for time, using carrier aircraft and light vessels, destroyers and destroyer escorts, to delay the Japanese until a squadron of US battleships arrive to even the odds. Historically the Japanese turned and ran; it might not work out that well this time.<br/><br/>Each counter represents a single ship, or a fighter, dive bomber, or torpedo squadron, each hex is a nautical mile, and each turn is 12 minutes. Ships are rated for main guns, secondary guns, torpedoes, armor, speed, and maneuverability. Hits can cause general damage, start fires, slow a ship, or cause a catastrophic explosion.

You can use the die numbers separately for basic pipe or sum their values to use one of the special connectors. If doubles were rolled, well, too bad; you get a rock and need to place that somewhere in your grid. If a 7 comes up, you can choose any two basic pipe or one special pipe. Some spots on your player sheet are already filled in, so you can incorporate those pieces or avoid them as you wish. Rocks &mdash; you just want to avoid those.<br/><br/>After a certain number of dice rolls, the game ends, and if you have not completed your waterline, you score no points and lose. If you have, then you score based on how well you used existing pipes, how many rows and columns you filled with objects (including rocks and unused pipe), how many starred spaces you incorporated into your pipeline, the total number of pipes used, and whether you used more corner pieces than everyone else.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you place one of your Snorkel pieces on the board. Snorkels never move once they are placed.<br/><br/>Each Snorkel has four breathing tubes coming out of its body. If all of its tubes get blocked by the walls at the edge of the board or by enemy Snorkels, it passes out from lack of air and gets captured by the enemy. The first player to be captured loses the game.<br/><br/>A common practice among Go educators, especially those who work with kids, is to begin by teaching a somewhat simpler variant of Go known as The Capture Game. Snorkels is an adaptation of The Capture Game by Mark Engelberg, who will donate his share of the proceeds to the American Go Foundation.<br/><br/>The Nestorgames edition includes 3 stones that are placed before the game starts, to add variety to the board.<br/><br/>",

Each Demigod took control of one element -  Air, Earth, Fire and Water.  Not content with what they have, the Demigods plotted against each other. They recruited 3 classes to do their bidding: The Angels, the Undead and the Demons, starting an arms race.<br/><br/>The aim is to be the first to build an army and raid your opponent. The stronger your army the more Spirit coins or Skull Counters you can loot. SNATCH, KIDNAP and AMBUSH your opponents' troops. Use strategy to deter your opponent from forming an army. A game of strategy, skill and an element of luck.<br/><br/>The game is a spin-off from the traditional Mahjong by incorporating new symbols, rules and storyline we hope to allow more people to enjoy this century year old game.<br/><br/>",

You'll find the cover of PL 2.5 depicted at the top of the left column of this web page. Overall, it's a very nice package for Campaign Gaming, as everything you need to conduct the campaign is right in the booklet.<br/><br/>Platoon Leader campaign game rules for Historical SQUADS &amp; LEADERS enthusiasts are now available in version 2.5. As the version number suggests, this is still PL 2 at heart, but with many improvements. More than just a minor upgrade, this is an under-the-hood overhaul that was expressly aimed at making the existing line of modules easier and more fun to play. In fact, our testers report that these rules work great for RB, PB and KGP, too! Head to the bottom of this page for links to the latest version.<br/><br/>The approach was simple: bring in some of the system's harshest critics and some top talent for a down-to-earth review of the strengths and weaknesses of the system. A round table was conducted by our PL team, with many other folks providing comments and insight. The resulting enhancements, fixes and improvements make PL more user-friendly without introducing any major changes to familiar terms and methods.<br/><br/>Platoon Leader provides one set of rules to learn before embarking on your personal 'campaigning' to the different 'fronts' CH has and will continue to bring you. (In recent months, North Africa, PTO, France 40, Normandy, Market Garden and more.) And since it's a rulebook aimed at campaigns only, the emphasis is on enhancing that particular gaming experience.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    The Sunrise Bridge<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "A climbing game played with a standard 52 card deck primarily meant for three players, (though there is a four player variant).  It is similar to &quot;Fight the Landlord&quot; (Dou Di Zhu) but with some noticeable differences - the biggest being that the 3 (not the 2) is the high card, but also in the number of cards in the pot and allowable plays.  Because the runs are relatively limited (4 through K only) and because there are no &quot;bombs&quot; it is a bit more predictable in its gameplay than Dou Di Zhu.<br/><br/>Each round starts with dealing the cards (except for four of them) and an auction for the remaining cards.  The winner of the auction then picks up the cards and plays against the other two opponents who are now in a temporary partnership.<br/><br/>The goal for each round is to shed your cards.  The winning bidder needs to shed all his cards first before one of the opposing players sheds all of their cards.  Allowable plays are singles, pairs, triplets, quads and runs of three+ cards and staircases of three+ sets (note that runs/staircases may only involve 4's through K's).

        "description": "For centuries, Samoan warriors have spun and tossed their weapons in dazzling demonstrations of courage and skill. The traditional wooden war clubs were later replaced with hooked steel machetes. In 1946, a young knife dancer, &ldquo;Freddie&rdquo; Letuli, was performing in San Francisco at an event that also featured a Hindu fire eater and a girl who twirled a baton with light bulbs on the ends. Letuli wrapped some towels around the ends of his knife, dipped them in fuel, set them alight, and invented fireknife dancing.<br/><br/>The fireknife dance (siva afi) is now a major feature of Samoan culture and the pinnacle of any lu&rsquo;au.<br/><br/>In the Fireknife! card game, players take on the role of fireknife dancers, trying to impress the audience with the best routines. The first player to earn enough points (acclaim from the audience) wins.<br/><br/>There are 100 cards in the deck. Most of these represent moves that a dancer might perform, but a few are mistakes to be played on other players. In addition to the cards, players will need pencil and paper to keep score.<br/><br/>Fireknife! is intended as a light or family game. Mechanically, it is related to Mille Bornes or Mystery Rummy: Jack the Ripper. There are also echoes of Ticket to Ride (&ldquo;Should I take more stuff or use what I've accumulated?&rdquo;) and Kill Dr. Lucky (&ldquo;Should I stop the leader from scoring or hope someone else can do it?&rdquo;).<br/><br/>",

Each battalion is divided into units consisting of between 1 and 9 miniatures and led by a commander.<br/><br/>The game is divided into a series of turns (typically up to 6) which can be solved in about 2 hours. On each turn, alternately, players are activating their units that can move, shoot and even assault enemy units to take control of key areas of the battlefield (Objectives) and win the game. To achieve the victory, the armies also have the help of their commanders, who, by skillful tactics (represented by cards), can provide better techniques to attain their goals.<br/><br/>",

A player will be the counter.<br/>A card is placed away. <br/>A player of each team will go to see the card, return to his place an take a block to start building the structure, This must be done before the counter gets to 10.  Then a another player from each team will do the same and so on until a team agree that they correctly built the structure calls out  &ldquo;Mental Blox!&rdquo;<br/>Check the team&rsquo;s structure against the card.  If he team built the structure correctly, they can  keep the card. If they built the structure incorrectly, see if the other team came closer to re-creating the structure; if so, that team keeps the card. Continue playing for three rounds.<br/><br/>Game 2: Listen &amp; Build;;<br/>In this game, you&rsquo;ll have one caller and two builders.  Divide blocks so that each player has an identical  set of 10 blocks.  The caller should take a card and, with his or her back to the builders, describe the  structure to the builders.  After the caller finishes describing the structure and the builders complete their re-creations, compare the card to the structures. Which builder came closest to re-creating the picture with blocks? The most accurate builder can keep the card. Continue playing for three rounds.<br/><br/>Both games have a variant where players should answer the bonus question on the bottom of the card.<br/><br/>",

One-Minute Che Guevara is a solitaire challenge and the entire campaign can be played in a minute or two. However, the game offers a player most of the political and military choices available to Guevara in 1967.<br/>The player represents Guevara and guerilla units represent small groups approximately the size of a platoon. Bolivian army units represent elements of the 2nd Ranger Battalion at the company level. Historical factors like propaganda, supply shortages, and Guevara's limited tactical options are contained in the rules. The political phase is played on a map of Bolivia; the military phase is played on a separate battlefield map. Event Cards are used to guide the narrative but several different outcomes are possible. Victory is determined by the level of Guevara's political and military success ... if he survives.<br/><br/>(Excerpt from the Rules booklet)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SUMMARY<br/>Booz Mooz is a party game with cards, where players let each other take sips or drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) in a sly and playful way.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION - theme<br/>Every year, in some deep dark forest, all mooz of the world gather for the great Mooz Fest. A gathering so secret even we don't really know what happens there. All we know things tend to get quite rough. All mooz (players) are eager to have a nice drink (or two, or three, or more...) but the real boozers get lost in the forest. Their follow-mooz cannot wait to find them and lush up together. Are you curious about what kind of mooz you are going to meet? Before you know it, you are in a world of choices, speed, agility and above all: lots of fun!<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>The goal of the game is simple: The player who has the least blood alcohol content (bac) points when the game ends, wins. The game ends when all cards are face up.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>STEP 1: Gather some friends and take a seat. Clear the table.<br/>STEP 2: Make sure everyone has a glass and fill this glass with a drink of choice.<br/>STEP 3: Spread all cards on the table face down.<br/>The youngest player starts the game by turning a card of choice face up. Turns go clockwise until all cards are face up.<br/><br/>Does the Question Mooz has it in for you? Or are you, as Royal Mooz, calling the shots? Are you a Gentlemooz or do you steal booz from your neighbors? Everything is possible, as long as you finish the game as the mooz with the least points.<br/><br/>Servant Mooz, another round please!<br/><br/>",

Help him catch some fishies for his lunch by matching the number of fish in the stream to earn fish tokens.<br/><br/>Snappy Maths is a quick-fire educational game for children, designed by a 10 year-old. Two players race to compose simple math equations (addition, subtraction and multiplication of numbers 1, 2 and 3) to match a target number determined by a six-sided die. Each of the nine cards can be used in two ways: as a number (1 to 3), or as an operator (+, - or &times;) depending on which way up you place it. The first player to arrange their cards to match the target number wins the round and receives a fish token, and the first player to earn five tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warning: This is a hard game with some prime number math involved. As such, this game is not for everyone, but it is very rewarding when played well.<br/><br/>A little girl named Mina and her best pal, a friendly yeti named Yuki, play hide-and-seek in a magical frozen forest. Not only do the trees grow perfectly aligned in a 10&times;10 grid, but the trees themselves grow straight up. This means that a skinny little girl could easily hide behind one. A yeti, however, is far too big not to be seen. So, that is why Mina always hides, Yuki always seeks, and they always have fun! But seeking takes a lot of energy for someone as big as Yuki, and the trees also happen to be very much to Yuki&rsquo;s tastes. So he cannot resist munching every last splinter of every tree he encounters. In fact, if he runs out of trees to eat, he gets too hungry and gives up.<br/><br/>One player plays Yuki and the other player plays Mina. Yuki and Mina take turns moving from tree to tree. Yuki moves slowly, because with every step, he devours an entire tree (don&rsquo;t worry, no real magical trees will be harmed during the game). On the contrary, Mina moves as far as she wants.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT<br/><br/>- Board with 10&times;10 tree spots<br/>- 70 snow spots (white discs)<br/>- Yuki (an &lsquo;ice&rsquo; meeple)<br/>- Mina (a red meeple)<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN:<br/><br/>One player plays Yuki and the other player plays Mina.<br/><br/>Play twice swapping roles to see who does best. In many cases Yuki eventually catches Mina, but sometimes she manages to leave Yuki with no valid moves.<br/><br/>- If both players win playing Yuki the one that ate fewer trees wins.<br/><br/>- If both players win playing Mina, the one that ate more trees wins.<br/><br/>- If a player wins playing both Yuki and Mina this player is clearly a hide-and-seek master!<br/><br/>The paradox:<br/><br/>The strategy on the second game will depend on the result of the first one:<br/><br/>- If Yuki wins the first game, the player playing Yuki in the second game must eat fewer trees (catch Mina sooner).<br/><br/>- If Mina wins the first game, the player playing Yuki in the second game (who won as Mina), must eat as many trees as the other player did (trying to catch Mina later!) just in case Mina eventually escapes.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

This way they are all snuggly and warm until they can soak up the sunshine.<br/><br/>Roll the die and add new parts to your snake! Bend it, coil it, extend it! At the end of the game, measure the distance between the snake's head and its tail. The player with the shortest distance takes the prize!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The promise of the newfangled railways has brought unusual co-operation to the leaders of the disparate states of this land. Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and Bulgaria, along with the powerful rulers of the Ottoman Empire and the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, see the immense bounty to be realized with railways connecting East and West. Steep mountains must be overcome, and isolated valleys must be reached to attain the goal of a true Orient Express. Merchants see the vast potential wealth to be gained and work to fund this dream and become rich themselves. Hooray for the Orient Express!<br/><br/>In Balkan Railways, players are rich merchants and powerful leaders investing their wealth and status in building railroads in this forbidding land. Loans are taken and serviced, opportunities must be recognized and seized. Savvy fiscal manipulators will come out on top in this no-luck economic knife fight.<br/><br/>Note that while Balkan Railways was originally released as an expansion for Iberian Railways, this edition of the game is a standalone design that includes everything you need to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Void Intentions is a dungeon-crawling, print-and-play, roll-and-write game. It's set in the same world as Void Halls, but the roles are reversed. Now, take on the role of a &quot;hero&quot;, explore, and plunder this dungeon. The dice are rolled, fate is written, and riches await you. But be careful &mdash; death might find you, as these dungeons are full of dangers and traps. It's an unbalanced, solo game, that provides a different experience in every playthrough.<br/><br/>Choose your character. Each character possesses distinctive starting attributes, Life and unique quest. Your inventory is where you keep track of your supplies and treasures gained. There are 30 rounds: 23 hourglass rounds and 7 camp rounds. In each round, move your character onto an adjacent square on the dungeon map. After you move, roll as many dice as the level of the room you're in (indicated next to it) - to determine what encounter you have found on the specific square on the map. Draw the exploration icon on the map square that you have just explored. Each encounter affects you in a certain way. Inventory items can be used while camping. You may spend the treasures and supplies that you have collected to do some actions. The game ends upon reaching the final stairs at the 5th level.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Here comes the new era of the space develop. For the foundation of the greatest empire, You must build establishments connected with combo among a lot of others, and use their functions to produce victory points and to keep the other nations in check.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Players play the game with the cards representing various establishments and political systems. Players take their turns in order. During their turns, they should RESEARCH to draw cards or BUILD to play their cards. The cost for the build is paid by selling cards from their hands, so players should choose which card to build and which card to sell prudently. And players can use the functions of the  cards in their tableau to draw extra cards, to get victory points, to steal cards from the other players, or to keep them in check by getting some advantages triggered by them. In the simple play, making the combos with various cards and maximizing the effects will be a key for the game.<br/><br/>In a simple explanation, Stardust Imperium is a game which is hybrid of &quot;Race for the galaxy&quot; and &quot;Magic the gathering&quot;. I'm a huge fan of them, but I had to make a game which can substitute them because those games are little bit hard for my friends. Consequently, I made a game in which players use abilities of their cards so they directly interact with each other like &quot;Magic the gathering&quot; in a frame in which players build their nations like &quot;Race for the galaxy&quot;. It took the merits of those games, but it was easy, simple and short. I'm satisfied with the basis of this game and while I'm continuing balancing tests, I decided to open this game in 3 languages so that more people enjoy this game and give me feedbacks.

        "description": "Alibi is a murder mystery game inspired by dinner parties with a crime theme, designed for players aged 14 and above. The game begins by choosing one of the following scenarios:<br/><br/><br/>     Murder on the Nile, a vacation on the river that ends in tragedy;<br/>     A Dish to Die For, the last &quot;poisonous&quot; episode of a cooking program;<br/>     Blood on the Tartan, in the villa of a Scottish gentleman inspired by a Sherlock Holmes story.<br/><br/><br/>All five players are suspects, and through clues and discussions, they must reconstruct the events while concealing or revealing the secrets of the story.<br/><br/>In Alibi, it is important to carefully follow the order of card decks. If there are six (or more) players, the Detective (or investigation team) comes into play. With only four players, one innocent suspect deck will be removed from the game.<br/><br/>No one knows who the killer is &mdash; not even the guilty party &mdash; until the final phase of the game, which begins with the Revelation when each player learns their guilt or innocence from their own deck of cards.

        "description": "Billions of years ago, when the earth was just an incandescent globe that began to cool - big masses of rocks and ores, that were before in a liquid state, started to solidify, creating what we call today a terrestrial crust. The magma, still boiling and liquid, started big waves around an unstable soil and this huge rock layers collided and rose from the soil, creating the mountains. In the abstract game YN a player will experience the idea of creating these mountain rages using sequences of dices in a scenario that simulates the Earth at its formation process. The player with less numbers in the dices outside the board wins the game.<br/><br/>Each player have a bunch of dice (that represents mountains) and need to put in the board, but there's a problem: a dice only can touch another dice with a same value like a domino mechanic and after each turn a player can put a small token to create blockades to the opponent. The objective of the game is to be the player with few numbers in the dices out of the board.<br/><br/>",

In doing so, they must not move the other pieces. If no piece fell, that player may take an island card that has shells and a symbol on it. The symbol indicates which island the raft must be balanced to in the second phase. The islands are each four cards with a symbol on them, which are randomly distributed in the game area during the set-up. The raft card must be moved, but the found objects may not be touched. If again nothing has fallen down, this player gets the number of shells credited as points. The game is over as soon as only one island has island cards left.

From turn to turn build your dominance and win combats so that the initiative stays with you. Press your opponent until you reach your goals. Together, create an epic battle in which every warrior plays their part!<br/><br/> <br/>&quot;Never again will you have to depend on a single dice roll - in this game you literally roll a handful. Watch as they shape the fate of your warriors and thanks to simple, easy-to-learn mechanics you will be able to concentrate on your strategy instead of trying to remember an obscure rules technicality.<br/> &quot;Create your own saga, direct your heroes, and influence their future. In many cases the players will decide the fate of their characters; in big tournaments and during fierce battles they may acquire legendary artifacts or gain experience - become a great leader, a fearsome warrior - or they may perish...

        "description": "Von Moltke's Triumph recreates the decisive 1870 campaign of the Franco-Prussian War. Under Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, the German states used superior logistics, advanced artillery, and a strategy of envelopment to terrorize the sluggish and unprepared French.<br/><br/>Historically, it ended with the capitulation and capture of Napoleon III after a mere five weeks. The game slants historically but is intended for competitive play: the French will almost always lose the war, but a good French Player can win the game.<br/><br/>Amabel Holland's designs tend to have unusual combat or activation mechanisms, but in this game she utilizes a mostly traditional, odds-based CRT and Logistics-Move-Combat sequence of play. A liberal strategic movement rule allows for lightning-fast encirclements, while subtle differences in each side's logistic phase, organizational structure, and the rounding of combat factors reflect the doctrinal and technological differences that proved decisive.<br/><br/>",

You then have only 5 turns to try and drive your opponent from the battle field using tactics, scouting, speed, flanking, and combat<br/><br/>Each turn you will place one Creature or Spell faced-down in each open Rank on the battlefield at the same time as your opponent. When both players are finished deploying, you then simultaneously reveal cards in the same Rank and resolve the spells and abilities of creatures. The newest Rank also is called a Scouting Rank where the fastest creature outmaneuvers the slower creature and immediately deals its damage to the opponent. Finally, any creatures that were revealed in earlier turns do battle with each other to try and defeat the opposing creature in that rank. Once opened, the creature here can go right through and do it's damage directly to the player<br/><br/>Forged Realms is a game of planning, surprise, scouting, using abilities/spells and controlling ranks to try and defeat your opponent by lowering their armies moral to 0 in only 5 turns<br/><br/>With 4 factions to choose from in the Core Set, you have up to 10 combinations to make your army with. Each pre-built deck can be changed and built as see fit thus giving players hundreds of deck combinations<br/><br/>",

This version contains no board.<br/><br/>BEZZERWIZZER Kompakt is a new way to play BEZZERWIZZER that makes it easier to play on the go, at the beach or anywhere else for that sake.<br/><br/>The game contains 150 cards with questions in the same 20 categories as the original game, which means that they can be used as new challenges in the original game as well.<br/><br/>To start with the players are divided into two to six teams. Each team can consist of one or more players. Each team then gets a bezzerwizzer token that can be used once per round (see below).<br/><br/>Now the game starts: Each team picks a token at random out of the included bag. There are 20 tokens - one for each category in the game. The token must be kept secret from the other players. The first team to go then choose either to answer a question in the category on their token or to swap with one of the other teams, without knowing what they will get. If they answer the question that they end up with correctly, they will receive 3 points - a wrong answer does nothing. Scoring is kept on the included pad. This continues till all teams have answered a question. The last team will not have the opportunity to swap, as all other teams have used up their categories.<br/><br/>Each turn, each of the teams have one opportunity to bezzerwizze one of the other teams question. This means that if the team does not answer the question correctly, the team that has bezzerwizze'd has a chance to answer it as well. If the first team answers correctly however, the other team will have wasted their chance to bezzerwizze this round. The number of points you get for bezzerwizzing and answering correct depends on when you choose to do it; if you choose to bezzerwizze after the category is revealed, but before the question is read aloud you will get 2 points for a correct answer. If you do it after the question has been read aloud, you will only get 1 point for a correct answer. If the teams that bezzerwizzet can not answer correctly either, the original team will receive the points.<br/><br/>The turn order then switches one place and the process starts again. If there are fewer category tokens in the bag than the number of teams when a new turn is started, all of the tokens are returned to the bag.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the teams has 20 points (continuing the round to completion to allow other teams to reach 20 as well). Alternately, teams can choose to only play until the bag is empty.<br/><br/>",

Grab your Tiki, grab your four....err....three...oh no...TWO closest friends and get as far away as possible!  You've heard rumor of another island, rich in abundance, on the edge of the horizon.  Head to the sea and cross the ocean to find your new home.<br/><br/>Tiki Island is best described as a light strategy game with some...interesting elements thrown in.  The goal is simple; get from one side of the ocean to the other.  The only problem is that everyone else is trying to do the same, and the vast ocean is only so big.<br/><br/>Use your magical Tiki to build an island chain from one side of the map to the other.  Try to avoid the other players, because along with the ability to build new islands, Tikis can hurl powerful runes and utilize devastating combinations to keep you from reaching your goal.  Are you going to try for the tortoise or the hare approach?  A complete path makes a world of difference...but then again, so does a well timed lightning bolt!<br/><br/>Using simple and intuitive strategy, Tiki Island was designed from the ground up to be a family experience.<br/><br/>",

To rule and control the city each arrondissement had its own elected counsel. &lsquo;Government of the people by the people&rsquo; as Marx diagnosed its administration.<br/>But this experiment was about to short lived, in may 1871 the regular French army made an end to the Commune.<br/><br/>In arrondissement the player place their influence in the arrondissements. At the end of each round two arrondissements are valued. The player with the most influence in the valued arrondissement receives points. The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in nine rounds in which all arrondissements shall be valued. A round begins with a voting phase, by majority of votes the players decide of which 2 routes an arrondissement will be valued at the end of that round (in the last round there is no voting phase, because the remaining 4 arrondissements will be valued). After voting all players play an influence card, and they have the choice of playing an action card. The last phase in a round is the valuation of the arrondissements and the order of play for the next round.<br/><br/>Arrondissement is a game in which planning, waiting and knowing when and where to take control, are the keys to victory.<br/><br/>",

Players alternate taking turns. On their turn a player is manipulating his cards in order to gather a set of four cards of the same category one after another. Categories stem from various areas of medieval life (i.e. medicine, science, handicraft, cookery) which are represented on cards by Old &ndash; Polish words coming from medieval manuscripts. The game can be also won by realizing two out of four available task cards (in every game 4 out of 6 available task cards are being used). A player&rsquo;s turn is based on action points. A player can spend them in five possible ways:<br/><br/>     Take another card to their stand<br/>     Exchange cards within their stand<br/>     Exchange cards between stands<br/>     Reject a card from their stand<br/>     Peek at any card in the deck<br/><br/><br/>What is interesting about Staropolski wokabularz is that players put most cards on special stands back to a player and what makes it easier to remember them are&hellip; colourful clips, which can be used to mark cards!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Big Shuffle is a film noir card game where you are trying to make your way in an uncaring city. You play a classic noir character who is trying to set up the perfect scene for their agenda. You have to play smart though, as it is easy for someone else to change the scene for their benefit also. Full of role playing opportunities, The Big Shuffle pairs well with a cigar, whiskey, and smooth jazz.<br/><br/>In essence it is a 2-4 player game where everyone gets a different set of win conditions and you are trying to stop the others from hitting theirs with the scene cards in the middle. You not only have to plan your turn to try and change it to your win condition, but also use your reaction cards to try and stop others from winning on their turn keeping gameplay interactive and interesting even when someone else is trying to swing things in their favor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In August 1914, two Russian armies, Rennenkampf&rsquo;s First and Samsonov&rsquo;s Second, invaded the German province of East Prussia. The lone German army there, Hindenburg&rsquo;s Eighth, had to rely on interior lines and railroads to concentrate against each Russian army in turn. This game focuses on the southern half of the campaign, with the northern half factored into the victory conditions. Those victory conditions vary with the strategic options chosen by each player so neither knows the other&rsquo;s intent.<br/><br/>Tannenberg uses a modification of the Fire &amp; Movement game system. Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of rapidly-concentrated fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves. In 1914, although railroads allowed the rapid shifting of forces on a large scale, no one moved faster than a man on foot on the battlefield, making exploitation ineffective. However, here both players have hidden movement, allowing them to concentrate in unexpected locations to surround and destroy isolated enemy units. The clumsy and inflexible fire support is represented by the artillery brigades available to division and corps commanders. It must be brought to the point of decision, then supplied to give it the firepower to affect the fighting.<br/><br/>The historical outcome at Tannenberg was the destruction of Samsonov&rsquo;s army, but it need not have been so. Both players have options and can achieve decisive success. The player who makes the better choices, and backs his strategy to the hilt, will emerge the victor.<br/><br/>Details:<br/><br/>    Level: Brigade<br/>    Hex: 3 miles (5 km)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "An Undeniable Victory is a simulation of Iran&rsquo;s first large-scale offensive in its war against Iraq. The previous year Iraqi forces had captured large swaths of Iranian territory. With the front line dangerously close to Khorramshahr, the Mullahs in Tehran ordered the Iranian military to launch an offensive at the earliest opportunity to eliminate the threat to this vital Iranian city and production center.<br/><br/>An earlier, smaller Iranian offensive, Operation Hoveyzeh, was easily repulsed by the Iraqis in January. As evidence grew of another Iranian attack, the Iraqis entrenched and awaited their enemy&rsquo;s actions. Any further offensives by the Iraqis were out of the question until the severe losses in men and material from the previous year could be replaced.<br/><br/>The Iranian offensive in March would be supported by three divisions of the newly created Pasdaran, or revolutionary guards. Composed of youthful recruits, many of them not even out of high school, the Pasdaran was created by the mullahs as a &ldquo;revolutionary counterweight&rdquo; to the Iranian military, which the religious leaders suspected of harboring many who were still loyal to the ousted Shah. Much would be at stake at this battle, both at the front and behind the lines.<br/><br/>An Undeniable Victory is a two player game intended to be an easy-to-learn game suitable for new gamers, as well as a challenging and fun contest for veteran Grognards. The game can also be easily played solitaire, however.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each column gets a random scoring tile, and a token to indicate whether the scoring tile will be awarded to the cup with the most or the least tapioca. Each player starts with a straw and bottom for each of their three cups.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they will draw a tile from the stack and then play one tile to one of their cups.  The tiles may be a tapioca card, a branding card (the cup logo), or a bottom.  If a bottom card is placed, that column's demand switches, either from most tapioca to least tapioca, or the reverse.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, cups will be eligible to score if they have a lid, bottom, three tapioca sections, and a brand.  Players each have a total maximum amount of tapioca that may be contained in their three cups.  The player who best satisfies each columns' requirements wins the corresponding sound tile and additional may be earned if all cards of one cup contain the same color of straw.  Multiple rounds of play may be required to determine a winner.<br/><br/>",

Co-operate so that your team makes the fewest mistakes and complete the final round to win together!<br/><br/>On each of the five rounds of Ink It!, a different player &mdash; or several, depending on the player count &mdash; is the Captain. Each other player is dealt a word card with one concept or item to represent. To do so, they can use only the four rubber stamps to draw red circles, blue squares, green triangles, and yellow rectangles, but the number of &quot;stamp strokes&quot; per drawing is limited and gets smaller the longer the game goes on, from five stamps for the first round to&nbsp;only one for the final one!<br/><br/>The players who draw may use the same stamp multiple times, stamp over a part of another shape, and stamp partially or completely out of the frame, but they cannot use the stamp as a pen to stretch a shape, use another color for a shape, or spell letters. When everyone has finished their drawing, all words and drawings are revealed, then the Captain must find out which word card goes with which drawing.<br/><br/>If the cumulated mistakes made by the Captains exceeds the number of players, the game is immediately lost &mdash; but if they can complete five rounds without losing, they win!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Geometry, skill, and space-time travel.<br/><br/>Flatland is based on the Victorian novel centering around various universes occupied by poly-dimensional people. Players put together their hands of geometric character shapes - custom etched into a set of twelve dice. The strength of each piece is determined by the number of sides and the figure's dimensionality. Players select a piece to play against their opponent and roll. The winner of each round takes both pieces, and the first to lose all of his pieces loses. Easy! However, behind this simple set of rules is a complex game of strategy and chance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION<br/><br/>Drunkgeon is a strategic drinking board game where a barbarian, dwarf, mage &amp; elf fight monsters &amp; each other in an ever-changing maze-like dungeon. Each players life is their drink of choice. Players must use their skill in beer mat flipping to be the first to get to the treasure &amp; win the game. However, keep your wits about you as when your drink runs out. you're dead!<br/><br/>STORY<br/><br/>Welcome to the drunkgeon!<br/>You're with a group of heroes roaming the lands searching for adventure and coin. You come across the Labyrinth of the Old Gods rumoured to contain a great treasure at its heart. The local people warn that the domain within is ruled by ancient forgotten gods. Those that go in never come out and only their cries of madness have given any clue to what awaits inside. As seasoned adventurers, you know more than most that often these rumours are tall tails and laughing among yourselves you enter the labyrinth.<br/><br/>As you walk through the door it slams behind you and in the dark, you hear a voice in your head, &quot;Who dares to enter our realm? You must pay a tribute of blood for a chance of reward and release!&quot;. Torches suddenly light and you find yourself alone in an ever-changing maze of torment. You discover blood is indeed power, for if you sacrifice it you&rsquo;re granted the power to perform ancient magic and great physical deeds. However, the more blood spilled the more drunk on the power you become. What horrors are within these walls? Will you be sober enough to recognise friend from foe? Will you reach the treasure and escape the labyrinth? Head down you plunge into the depths of the labyrinth ready to take on all that awaits&hellip;<br/><br/>WINNING AND LOSING THE GAME<br/><br/>'WIN THE GAME' - Collect at least 3 trophies and each key colour to enter the treasure room. Then defeat the dragon to win the game.<br/><br/>'LOSE THE GAME' - If your glass is empty you die. Remove the empty glass from the dungeon and place all your mats on to the space you died. Other players can pick up the mats by landing on that space.<br/><br/>SETTING UP THE GAME<br/><br/>I. The game is played with 2-4 players. Each player gets a 'dungeon key mat' and a 'key token mat' of the same colour. Remove the unused 'dungeon key mats' and a 'key token mats' from the game.<br/><br/>II. Randomly place the 'dungeon mats' into a 6 by 6 grid/dungeon. Note: 'dungeon mats' can BE placed in any ORIENTATION.<br/><br/>III. Place the 'cleared dungeon mats', 'trophy mats' and the rest of the 'key tokens' into piles.<br/><br/>IV. Layout all the 'magic mats' so they can be seen by all players and study them before the game begins.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/><br/>Pick the first player. A player may do the following three things in any order during their turn. When complete the player to the left now takes their turn.<br/><br/>I - Insert 'dungeon mat' - The first player inserts their 'dungeon mat' into the dungeon with any orientation. They keep the 'dungeon mat' expelled from the opposite side. IF it is the first turn this must be done before a glass filled with beverage is placed on their 'dungeon key mat'.<br/><br/>II - Move Their Player - The player may now move by flipping the 'event mat'. They move the number under the majority of their leftmost finger.<br/><br/>- All moves must be used.<br/>- You cannot move diagonally.<br/>- You cannot move through walls.<br/>- A player must move forward in the direction they started moving this turn unless they hit a dead end.<br/>- When the path forks any new direction can be picked.<br/>- If you land on or move over another player, monster(s) or trap you trigger an 'event' (see Events).<br/><br/>III - Buy a 'magic mat' - To buy a 'magic mat' spend the cost listed on it. You buy it by drinking that many fingers of your beverage. However, another player(s) may contest the purchase by drinking more fingers of their beverage. The player who drank the most fingers takes the 'magic mat' and can use it as and when described. There is only one of each 'magic mat' in the game and so only the 'magic mats' still on the table can be purchased. Once a 'magic mat' has been cast it is placed back on the table.<br/><br/>EVENTS<br/><br/>An event is triggered if a player lands on or moves over the following;<br/><br/>I - Dungeon Key- If they don't already have a 'dungeon key token' of the same colour they can take one.<br/><br/>II - Another player - The player whose turn it is fights the other player. Both players flip the 'event mat(s)'. Whoever has the highest number wins the fight. Re-Flip on a draw. If the player whose turn it is;<br/>- Wins - They may pass or land on the other player's mat. The winner may move the losing player one legal move away.<br/>- Loses - They must stop in the position prior to the player.<br/><br/>III - Monster(s) or Trap - The player flips the 'event mat(s)' and must get the number or more displayed on the monster(s)/trap mat. If the player;<br/>- Wins - They win a 'trophy mat' (see Trophies p4). The monster/trap 'dungeon mat' is removed from the dungeon and is replace with the equivalent 'cleared dungeon mat'. Player movement continues.<br/>- Loses - They must drink the number of 'fingers' from their beverage as achieved from their 'event mat(s)' flip. They must also stop in the position prior to the monster(s) or trap.<br/><br/>IV - Treasure room - A player can only enter the room if they have collected a key of each colour. IF so the player flips the 'event mat(s)' and must get the number or more displayed on the 'treasure room' mat. If the player;<br/>- Wins - They slay the dragon, take the treasure and win the game.<br/>- Loses - They must drink the number of 'fingers' from their beverage as achieved from their 'event mat' flip. They must stop in the position prior to the 'treasure room'.<br/><br/>TROPHIES<br/><br/>Players can gain 'trophy mats' by defeating monsters and traps. On the reverse side of a 'trophy mat' is an 'event mat'. this is so trophies can be stacked on top of the 'event mat' to form a stack. Whenever there is an 'event mat' flip for combat or movement the player may choose to flip a stack of 'event mats' with the trophies they have won. Each additional 'event mat' adds one to the result i.e. Flip and catch a 2 with a stack of 3 'event mats' to get a 4.<br/><br/>FINGERS<br/><br/>A forfeit in this game is performed by drinking 'fingers' of your beverage. this is done by holding that many of your own fingers against the glass and drinking that volume of your beverage. if there is a dispute in measuring an event mat can be used with one row equalling one finger.<br/><br/>DIFFICULTY<br/><br/>Beginner - If new players are finding flipping beer mats hard then they can use a 6 sided dice instead. <br/>Note: The game for those players will lose the skill aspect for catching values they need.<br/><br/>Intermediate - 'Event mat(s)' can be flipped until caught. Note: This can slow down the game.<br/><br/>Advanced - If 'event mat(s)' aren&rsquo;t caught you&rsquo;re fined a finger and the result is treated as zero.<br/><br/>SINGLE PLAYER<br/><br/>A single player game is played in exactly the same way as playing the normal rules. However there is some reduced setup, as there is no key collecting required so all key token mats can be removed from the game. As there are no other players all 'magic mats' can also be removed from the game.<br/><br/>The 'magic mat' 'rejuvenate' can optionally remain. If it stays you're committing to potentially more then one drink. IF is removed, as with the 'just the one' variation, the game becomes more about beating the game with a single  glass of beverage.<br/><br/>VARIATION: JUST THE ONE<br/><br/>the 'rejuvenate' spell can also be removed to add extra difficulty to the game. It also puts a one drink cap on how much will be drunk in a game. This is a useful variation to implement when the player group only wish to have the one pint.<br/><br/>VARIATION: HALF PINT DUNGEON<br/><br/>Instead of playing with a 6x6 dungeon try playing with a 5x5 or 4x4 dungeon. Simply build the dungeon and place the remaining &lsquo;dungeon mats' into a stack. After inserting your dungeon key place the expelled 'dungeon mat' to the bottom of the 'dungeon mat' stack Then on future turns draw a mat from the top of the 'dungeon mat' stack and insert it into the dungeon, and again place the expelled 'dungeon mat' to the bottom of the 'dungeon mat' stack. This variation is useful when you have limited table space.<br/><br/>GAME LINKING MULTIPLE DRUNKGEONS<br/><br/>If you have multiple copies of Drunkgeon then they can be joined together to make up to a 6x12 dungeon by combining the 'dungeon mats'. Then use just one set of 'magic mats' and play the normal rules. The game will also now support up to 8 players i.e. two players of each colour.<br/><br/>FAQ<br/><br/>Q: Is Drunkgeon designed to get people drunk?<br/>A: No. The game is designed to be a fun first drink management game. A good player will carefully consider the best way to maximise their beverage, whereas other players may blindly run into fights and use magic to replenish their loses. Either style can work but the more sober player is more likely to win.<br/><br/>Q: How do i shuffle the 'dungeon mats'? Are 'dungeon mats' inserted in a specific orientation?<br/>A: rotate the 'dungeon mats' as you shuffle because they can be inserted into the dungeon in any orientation.<br/><br/>Q: Do you have to drink alcohol? what happens if glasses are different sizes?<br/>A: You may drink any beverage. Ideally everyone should use the same sized pint glass and beverage. However, if different make an agreement among yourselves i.e. a player drinks more glasses or uses smaller or larger 'finger' sizes. If anybody under the legal drinking age is playing the game then all players should drink non-alcoholic drinks.<br/><br/>Q: How do you move the 'dungeon mats' with glasses on them?<br/>A: It is advised to remove the glasses while a row or column of 'dungeon mats' is being moved.<br/><br/>Q: What happens if i am on a 'dungeon mat' that is pushed out the dungeon?<br/>A: The player is moved onto the 'dungeon mat' that was just inserted on the other side of the dungeon.<br/><br/>Q: Players have blocked the 'treasure room' or are holding a 'dungeon mat' or 'magic mat&rsquo;?<br/>A: Don&rsquo;t let a player get all the 'magic mats' as there are spells that help with these situations. Read the magic mats carefully before playing the game.<br/><br/>Q: I have picked up another 'dungeon mat' from a dead player?<br/>A: You may now choose either of your 'dungeon mat' to insert during your turn.<br/><br/>",

However, the late king's favorite nephew, Stephen de Blois (&quot;blue-a&quot;), was quicker to the throne, and with the help of his brother, the Bishop of Winchester, was crowned king.<br/><br/>Those loyal to the empress were enraged by Stephen's coronation and would not accept him as their new ruler. Over the next eighteen years, England saw a breakdown in law and order as civil war spread throughout the country. This conflict came to be known as &quot;The Anarchy&quot;...<br/><br/>In The Anarchy, players take on the role of English nobles loyal to King Stephen. Over five rounds, players must build their domain, defend their castle from attacks by the approaching Anjevin armies, and storm strongholds loyal to Matilda with their own crafted siege weapons. The player who can accumulate the most bravery, loyalty, influence and might &mdash; while avoiding discontent &mdash; will prove to King Stephen they are his most loyal ally, thereby earning his largest earldom.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trinity is a New Zealand designed and published abstract strategy game for 2 players.  The game is played on a 4 by 4 square grid, which is marked a-d on the horizontal axis and 1-4 on the vertical axis for record keeping.<br/><br/>There are three types of pieces, which are identical for black and white.  First are the ORBS, which are circular pieces with red, yellow, green or blue in the center. The second type of pieces are ARCS, which have a stripe of color matching those of the orbs.  The arcs are 120 degrees in extension, so three arcs fit around an orb.  HALOS are the third piece type, and are either white or black.  They are rings which fit outside the orbs and arcs.  There are four orbs, four arcs and six halos of each color, made of plastic.<br/><br/>The orbs are set up on the 1 and 4 rows with the matching color arcs with those orbs.  Play consists of each player moving one orb one square horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  The matching color of arc MUST be then moved.  Arcs can move to any other legal square on the board.<br/><br/>The easiest way to win is to trap an opposing orb with three arcs of any color around it (an Arc-win).  If you can box in your opponents orbs so that he has no valid moves, then you have gained an Orb-win.  Finally, if you can move your four pieces inside four halos of your own color you have completed a halo win.  A draw is an option through player agreement or stalemate from repeated moves.<br/><br/>A halo is &quot;earned&quot; by moving three of your arcs so that they form a complete ring, with no orbs inside it.  The arcs then attack the opposing pieces of the same strip color as the arcs.<br/><br/>The game rules come in a 16-page A6 sized rule book. There is also a CD for Windows PCs to practice strategies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Road Cycling Tour (RCT) is a road cycling simulation focusing on team tactics in multi-stage races. By means of road/track tiles stages can be built to simulate real or imaginary cycling events. Movement is modified roll-and-move with some additional rules for breakaways and closing gaps (as a simulation of slipstreaming). The characteristics or qualities of the cyclists/riders are represented with 'speed counters' that can be used to replace or in addition to the dice. Teams should generally have a balanced mix of riders with different specializations represented by different sets of speed counters.<br/><br/>A 'beginners' game' and rules for time trials, team time trials, and some advanced and optional rules are included with the game, but given the flexible nature of the game, players can easily make further adaptations to simulate their favorite cycling event. To further explain the most complex rules, a series of picture tutorials can be found in the 'rules forum' here.<br/><br/>RCT is not a short game. It is recommended to play at least 5 stages in a single game, and with 2 experienced players, that would take between 2 and 3 hours. More players and more (and/or longer) stages make the game longer, smaller teams make it shorter but have a negative effect on possible team tactics. However, RCT is played stage by stage, and it would be easy to play different stages on different occasions.<br/><br/>The game is a free download. All necessary files are available in the files section here.<br/><br/>",

Only a few compartments are available at any time decided by dice rolling. As a part of game setup the building blocks are put in the box and the box is shaken upside down and then right side up to randomly divide the blocks in the compartments.<br/><br/>From a deck of &quot;building orders&quot; a row of four available orders are drawn and two rows above it forms a future market.<br/><br/>Each player gets a set of six action cards numbered 1,2,2,3,3,4, four special cards and a base plate in his color to build the tower on.<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds. Each round starts with that each player secretly chooses one of his six action cards. Everyone reveals which card they chose and each player gets as many actions as the number on the card. The cards are discarded after each round and cannot be used again.<br/><br/>The players take turns performing one action at a time and does one of the following:<br/><br/>- Take blocks from one allowed department. <br/>- Choose a building order card and build (but you have to have the blocks first). When a card is chosen the cards above are moved down and the lower is made available. Add a card from the deck to the empty space on the top row. <br/>- Discard all available build order cards, move down the cards from the upper rows and refill the top row.<br/>- Reroll the dice that decides which compartments are avaialble. <br/>- Pass (do nothing).<br/><br/>At the end of each round the dice are rerolled to descide which compartments are available next round. Discard all available build order cards, move down the cards from the upper rows and refill the top row.<br/><br/>Some of the build orders are special and are not built until the end of the game where they allow you to add blocks to your tower depending on how your current tower looks like (color patterns).<br/><br/>Some build orders uses blocks from your opponents supply, or even tower. Some changes the order of blocks in the tower or adds blocks in the middle of a tower. Some cards are used to manipulate actions and order of actions.<br/><br/>Highest tower wins!<br/><br/>",

On the first turn, the starting player draws three block tiles, which show the shape of the blocks available for this turn; the blocks are Tetris-style quadrominoes that have squares in four colors. The player chooses one of these pieces and places it on his board within one minute, scoring points for the like-colored squares touching this block. Thus, if a red 5 on his grid is adjacent to a red square on the block he just placed, he scores five points.<br/><br/>The next player then reveals a new block tile, reveals the new block, then places one of the three blocks in his grid. From a player's third turn on, he can choose to place a block in an opponent's grid, costing him points.<br/><br/>The game ends when either only two blocks remain unplaced, no blocks can be placed in either grid, or one player has more than 180 points or less than -50 points. At this time, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most wins at the end of 5 rounds is the victor.<br/><br/>The biggest feature of this game: the fact that you cannot tell for sure what card (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) you are playing until it&rsquo;s too late. There are a total of 16 numbered cards and while Card #1 and Card #16 are clearly defined as Rock and Paper respectively, it&rsquo;s impossible to say what range is defined as Scissors until the end of the game.<br/><br/>After five rounds of placing out your cards, you use the two remaining cards left in your hand to figure out what range of cards actually count as &ldquo;Scissors&rdquo; for each individual player &mdash; and therefore how many of the five rounds you actually won.<br/><br/>A playful game of psychological warfare that combines funnily illustrated cards with serious strategy as you guess what cards your opponent could possibly have left in his or her hand and play your own hand accordingly.<br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>ã°ã¼ããã¼ãªã©ã®æãæãããã«ã¼ããåæã«ä¼ãã¦åºããããããããããï¼äººç¨ã²ã¼ã ã§ãããããããåè² ãï¼åè¡ããåã£ãåæ°ãå¤ãæ¹ã®ãã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ãåèã¨ãªãã¾ãã<br/><br/>ãã®ã²ã¼ã ã®å¤§ããªç¹å¾´ã¯ãï¼åã®åè² ã«ä½¿ãã«ã¼ãããã¹ã¦åºãã¾ã§åã«ã¼ãã®ã°ã¼ã»ãã§ã­ã»ãã¼ãç¢ºå®ããªããã¨ã§ããæçµçã«ãããããåè² ã«ä½¿ããªãã£ãã«ã¼ãã«ãã£ã¦åã«ã¼ãã®ã°ã¼ã»ãã§ã­ã»ãã¼ãæ±ºã¾ãã¾ãã<br/>äººããããã£ã¦ãããã®ãããªå¤ãã£ãã«ã¼ãã®å³æã¨ãç¸æãã©ããªã«ã¼ããæ®ãã¦ããã®ããæ¨çããªããææ­ãåºãã¦ããå¿çæ¦ãç¹å¾´çãªã²ã¼ã ã§ãã<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Upon arrival on the scene you realize there is an impostor among you.<br/>Your goal is to gather as much information as possible while making sure all witnesses remain alive for further questioning.<br/><br/>Move through the Story by drawing Event cards and playing them during your turn in accordance with your agenda, the mandatory play means you will be faced with several bad choices - in this game most choices are bad. As the story advances more and more clues are found about the traitor, however reaching the end of any story Act with the traitor alive means that the agents lose the game. The traitor(s) must be stopped before reaching the completion of his mission. A unique story progress board is used to mark the progress of the team as a whole while individual Mind sheets follow players' descent into inevitable madness.<br/>The game ends either when the Agents win by discovering and eliminating the Traitor or when the Traitor wins by either eliminating all Agents or reaching the end of the story and completing his goal.<br/>The special 2 player game mode keeps the suspense, social deduction elements and paranoia with only minor rule changes.<br/>Included is one Investigation focus die made of wood, as imperfect as the world you are playing in and unique,, again.. as this world.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Creature Features is a Monopoly-style game in which the players attempt to make a fortune through producing classic monster movies, using actual films and stars from the twenties through the early seventies.  The relationship to Monopoly is so blatant that at the start of the rules (and in the rules' largest font) is this quote: &quot;This game plays similarly to the famous Monopoly game.&quot;<br/><br/>The board features a rectangular track with spaces for each movie featured in the game (akin to Monopoly properties).  There are also Tombstone Award and Dead or Alive spaces (causing card draws, as with Chance and Community Chest in Monopoly).  Finally, there are Ghoul Agency spaces that allow you to draw and purchase actor cards.<br/><br/>As you travel around the board, you buy movies and acquire stars.  There are two actors associated with each movie and upon landing on a Ghoul Agency space you draw three actors for possible purchase.  You can attempt to buy any actors who are in a movie that you already own or, if none match, you may still choose to purchase one of the three cards drawn.  The price of an actor card is determined by a roll of the dice, multiplied by a base dollar amount.<br/><br/>Completing a production (acquiring the movie card and both associated actor cards) requires other plays to pay you a fee if they land on the movie's space on the board (making the actors somewhat like adding houses to a property in Monopoly).  Also, having a completed production allows you to draw a card when you land on an award space.  If you win a major award, you place it on the movie and anyone landing there has to pay you a premium (similar to having a hotel on a property in Monopoly).<br/><br/>",

If the players collectively complete the required pattern, everyone wins - if not, the group loses. Winners gain loot, the losers gain nothing - with the amount of loot determined by the number of cards matched. After 8 rounds, the winner is the player with the most loot.<br/><br/>There's always a chance though that one player was the Snitch - trying to make the group fail in order to win by themselves! The Snitch causes others to miss out on the loot, and steals some of their existing loot. Being the snitch at the right time is key to winning the game!<br/><br/>Players have a limited number of Snitch cards - when will you Snitch on your friends? When will they Snitch on you?!

It was fought between July and November 1938, with fighting mainly concentrated in two areas on the lower course of the Ebro River, the Terra Alta comarca of Catalonia, and the Auts area close to Fay&oacute;n in the lower Matarranya, Eastern Lower Aragon. The results of the battle were disastrous for the Republican forces, with tens of thousands of dead and wounded and little effect on the advance of the Nationalists.<br/><br/>Game uses brigade-battalion scale. One of the most important aspects of the game is to keep as many bridges on ebro as possible, since it's the only way for tanks, artiller and supply to cross the river. Nationalists may use their air forces to destroy the bridges, slowing the Republican advance down.<br/><br/>",

Boost your team, freeze your opponents, teleport balls back to your side, and watch out for fireballs!<br/><br/>In the game, players are dealt a team of five wizards each, and the turn order is determined by the order of the deal. Players then select spell cards based on how many spells their team can have. Each wizard has two action points that can be spent on moving, throwing balls, casting spells, or carrying out some combination of actions. Picking up or putting down balls is a free action.<br/><br/>Each wizard has a physical and magical range, and physical and magical attack and dodge bonuses. The outcome of throwing/casting and dodging is handled by high roll on d6s, with ties going to the defender.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MAMAEV KURGAN, STALINGRAD, RUSSIA, 27 September 1942: Acknowledging the damage done to his army in assaulting the southern and central sections of the city, General von Paulus had systematically reconfigured his forces for a fresh assault. Two shock groups were formed, with one consisting primarily of the 100th J&auml;ger Division, whose task was to clear and control Mamaev Kurgan, followed by an advance into the Tennis Racket and the Bannyi Ravine and finally to occupy the Krasnyi Oktiabr workers' settlements. Paulus' counterpart, General Chuikov was well aware of these preparations and had planned appropriate spoiling attacks, though he was unaware of the fresh German reinforcements. His attack was disrupted before it could even begin, with waves of Stukas strafing his advancing forces. His strongpoint on the crest of the burial mound was destroyed. Bombs and artillery cut down the attackers, decimating their ranks and allowing the following German advance to gain ground. The j&auml;gers advanced two regiments abreast and captured the western slopes, but initially failed to take the southern slopes. The 227th J&auml;ger Regiment's vigorous assaults, supported by intense artillery, destroyed the Russian ability to hold on. The Germans would secure the summit that evening (though some bypassed remnants would harass the Germans on the southern and western slopes for the next few days). By day's end, the 95th Division retained a foothold on the northern and eastern slopes of the burial mound, but was down to only 400 effective fighting men.<br/><br/>The Battle of Stalingrad has received no shortage of treatment in the wargame realm since Red BarricadesTM first focused the attention of ASLers on the factory complexes of the doomed city. No tactical-level game has ever treated the titanic and unique battle for Stalingrad's Mamayev Hill, aka Mamayev Kurgan ... until NOW. From the first thrusts of Hitler's Wehrmacht on 13 September to the last days of 1942 the hill changed hands time and again. By 27 September the Germans had again captured half of Mamayev Kurgan. The Soviets held their own positions on the slopes of the hill, as the 284th Rifle Division desperately defended key strongholds. The defenders held out until 26 January 1943, when the Soviet winter offensive known as Operation Uranus, relieved them, in the process trapping and destroying the German VI Armee in the tomb of Stalingrad.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The story of Odysseus' journey home from Troy starts with his fleet leaving Troy after the end of the Trojan war.  As the captain of one of his ships, you must get your crew home to Ithaca, but complete a series of missions on the way home, whilst the Gods will Bless and Curse your ship.<br/><br/>Will you make it home wealthy, will you make it home at all?<br/><br/><br/>Voyage home is an adventure game where you must sail your ship home after completing a series of quests!  The other players are also trying to do the same thing, but each player will also play the part of the GODS.  Some of the Gods are out to destroy enemy ships whilst other GODS are out to help your ship! Some Blessings, Curses and other effect spells are working in great combination with each other to help you complete the game before everyone else!<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay Detail - The game is divided into two ACTS.  ACT I is the main part of the game, ACT II is the end game, which may not involve all of the players.ACT I has X amount of turns, which is dictated by 10 &quot;oversized&quot; cards that are on display at all times on the table, they are randomly sorted before the game starts so that only one is visible at a time.   Once all the &quot;oversized&quot; cards have been exhausted then the game goes to ACT II which is a sudden death ending to the game.<br/><br/>Phase 1 is made up of a card draw phase where players can choose to draw cards from the GODS deck (which makes up their hand during the game which allows the players to also play the part of the Gods themselves, they can play blessings and curses as well as effect cards that effect either other players ships, their own ships, other players, areas on the map or the general gameplay state (called Global effects).  Phase one usually takes around 20 seconds.<br/><br/>Phase 2 is the Card playing phase where each player will choose which cards they want to play and then play them.  There is a special order that cards are played in and a player order so players must all choose which cards they're playing first for that turn before all the cards are revealed.  During this phase any and all cards that are played will also be resolved if possible.  It's good to make up combos of cards in your hand, and then play them all at once, so that you can propel your ship more quickly through the quests. This is the most lengthy phase of the game.  Some players may have larger hand sizes and will take some time to work out what they're going to play, and once cards have been played they need to be actioned.  This could take 3 or 4 minutes per player to work through, depending on how experienced players are at the game and how many players there actually are.<br/><br/>Phase 3 is the movement phase where you will each roll your dice and move your ship across the map.  You need to complete all 6 quests before you can head back to Ithaca.  It doesn't necesarrily have to be ACT II for you to be travelling home to Ithaca if you have been so successful to have completed everything before then.  However, it's quite unlikely that you'd be heading back so soon, considering the temperament of the Gods after all.  Movement is important as other players can't land on the same spot as you, and ports can only be visited by two ships at once.  Player order plays a reasonable role on how effective your movement phase is going to be, as does your dice roll.  You can skip your movement phase to instead draw off a SHIP deck (another deck of cards) which enables you to upgrade your ship to enhance your ability in some aspect or another. Although movement itself is done in player order, it shouldn't take more than a minutes for each player to work out where to move their ship to once they've rolled their movement dice.<br/><br/>Phase 4 is cleanup.  You will remove one of the &quot;oversized&quot; cards if required (which reduces the length of the game, you will also perform any other cleanup actions (some cards require you to perform actions during this phase.  Then the player 1 ICON is rotated clockwise, so each players number order changes for the next turn.  This phase isn't very complex and is usually over in a minute or so.  It usually just involved an oversize card being removed and all the cards that got played this turn being discarded to the discard pile.<br/><br/>Quests and finishing the game:  Each ship must complete all 6 quests before being able to return to Ithaca.  Each ship must closely monitor it's supplies (which keep the crew well fed!) and crew number as well as its riches (GOLD!) as this may become very important as you endeavor to finish the game before time runs out!<br/><br/>To win you must be one of the players who made it back for starters!  If players have not completed all 6 quests when ACT I ends, then they're lost at sea and take no further part in the game.  There is some sudden death rules that effect the remaining players but as long as you make it back you have a chance to win! The amount of crew is the first factor in deciding a winner, whilst Gold is the secondary factor, but usually a winner is obvious!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Libra symbolizes balance and harmony.<br/><br/>LIBRA was invented by N&eacute;stor Romeral Andr&eacute;s on January 2013.<br/><br/>LIBRA is a 2-player board game of asymmetrical goals played on a hexagonal grid of any shape and size. Two players (MORE and LESS) share a common pool of stones in two colours. MORE will try to create as many groups of connected stones of the same colour as possible, while LESS will try to avoid that many groups from being created.<br/><br/>LIBRA combines these well known mechanics into a new interesting game:<br/><br/>- MORE vs LESS (asymmetrical goal)<br/>- Group counting<br/>- Placement of any colour<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>- A hexagonal grid of any size and shape. For beginners, a hexagon of 5 cells per side is recommended.<br/>- A supply of stones in 2 colours.<br/><br/>The nestorgames edition will include around 200 stones in two colours and a hexagonal board (with 5, 6 or 7 hexes per side depending on skill level).<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>There are 2 types of gameplay:<br/><br/>Duel: The game takes place over two rounds. In the first round, one player plays as &lsquo;MORE&rsquo;, the other as &lsquo;LESS&rsquo;. In the second round, the roles reverse. Whoever creates more groups playing the &lsquo;MORE&rsquo; role wins the game.<br/><br/>Bid: Before the game starts players take turns announcing how many groups they think they can create, raising the number each time. The player that passes first plays as &lsquo;LESS&rsquo;, and the other player plays as &lsquo;MORE&rsquo; and must create at least as many groups as she bid to win.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>Starting with &lsquo;LESS&rsquo;, players alternate turns placing a stone of any colour on an empty cell of the board. The game ends when all the cells have been occupied (or by mutual consent).<br/><br/>Count the number of groups of connected stones for both colours. This is the &lsquo;MORE&rsquo; score. Isolated stones are also considered groups.<br/><br/>",

KATATU is a 100% strategy abstract game that uses magnetic bees and grasshoppers as game pieces.  The object of the game is to eliminate your opponents 'bugs' by forming 'three in  a rows' or mills.  By forming a three in a row you can then select an opponents game piece and remove it from the game board.

It is a unique game about the early years of railroad building in the 19th century U.S., with six railroads along the Atlantic Coast poised to build their lines to the Midwest heartland. Its main feature is a more realistic stock market model than any other game. The stock market in No Caboose! includes the effects of supply and demand due to stock trading, it embodies the effects of the nation's changing economic climate. Watch stock prices soar during economic booms! Watch those stock prices plunge during economic Panics. Players can buy stock to pump the stock price, or sell stock to depress the price. Players may choose a strategy of holding a diversified portfolio with stock in many railroads, or put all their money into one or two railroads.<br/><br/>Another difference in No Caboose! is that players are not railroad presidents and are not bogged down in the detail running a particular railroad. Instead, players are financiers who arrange the routes railroads build and arrange the merger of small local lines into the bigger railroads. That is, players are in the role of banker J.P. Morgan, not the role of president Jim Hill. Players can help any railroad build a new line, which earns the player stock and money for arranging the new route.<br/><br/>A player's goal is simple. Being a financier, the only goal of a player is to be the richer than any rival financier at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are important decisions for players to make every turn, and players must watch what their rivals are doing. There are subtle strategies in selecting routes to build, stocks to buy or sell, and opportunities can be seized or missed.

        "description": "Murder! Mystery! Mastermind! (M3) is a modern brain-twisting take on crime solving and the deduction boardgame genre. The game is divided into two phases: the Investigative Phase and the Trial Phase.<br/><br/>In the Investigative Phase, players scour the city as the Detective, Police, CSI or the Widow to find the evidence, motive and witness of the crime. Once these are pieced together, the clues will point to the location(s), where the crime was actually committed. In this phase, you will feel the drama and suspense of a crime-solving novel or TV drama series, where each clue that the players reveal will lead to more clues and a deeper understanding of the murder. Players can also learn clues from each other privately while using their unique occupational powers to the fullest.<br/><br/>To make matters even more intriguing, you suspect that one of the players is actually the Mastermind behind the murder. It's a mad rush to the murder trial, and the Mastermind is doing his or her best to confound the investigations, with an ability to lie.<br/><br/>The fifth player will play the reporter &ndash; and true to form of the unrelenting paparazzi &ndash; will ambush players at locations to query them or shadow players and learn what they learn. Their objective? Get the expos&eacute; before the trial even commences.<br/><br/>At the trial, players will start presenting their accusations in court on what the murder evidence, motive, and witness are and where the crime was committed as well as the mastermind behind the murder. The trial will gradually build up to a scintillating climax where the player who has placed the most correct accusation tokens wins. However, if not enough of the case has been built up, the Mastermind will walk free. Will justice ultimately prevail? It's all in your hands &ndash; or brain.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the game you get victory points from Prestige icons that your civilization has collected, and also from the longest Wall your civilization has built.<br/><br/>There are four starting civilizations to choose from: Rome, Greece, Babylon and Egypt. Each turn you may add a card to your tableau, using a unique mechanism of partial overlap. However you must make sure that your civilization produces enough resources of military, science and gold to cover its own growing needs. You may also collect prestige icons which have no effect during the game but convert into victory points at the end of the game. Each card also has a piece of wall on one of its 4 sides. By placing the cards in a certain way, you might be able to build a long wall and score a lot of points. But keep an eye on your opponent's military strength, lest she attack your developing micro civilization.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Khans of Tarkir is a Magic: The Gathering block consisting of Khans of Tarkir (September 26, 2014), Fate Reforged (January 23, 2015), and Dragons of Tarkir (March 27, 2015). The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia. It is the last block to have three expansion sets.<br/><br/>Tarkir is the birthplace of the dragon-worshipping planeswalker Sarkhan Vol, first introduced in Shards of Alara. At the beginning of the Khans set, Sarkhan returns to Tarkir and learns that the extinction of Tarkir's dragons was linked to one specific event. Some thousand years ago, there was an epic battle between two dragon planeswalkers: Nicol Bolas, one of the greatest manipulators in the multiverse, and Ugin the Spirit Dragon, who helped trap the Eldrazi on Zendikar. Now that the Eldrazi have arisen again, both Sarkhan and Sorin Markov have arrived on Tarkir, the last known location of Ugin, in search of his help. Discovering that Ugin is dead, Sarkhan resolves to travel back in time and save him. His travels in the Tarkir of 1,280 years ago are chronicled in the set Fate Reforged. He finds a world where the five human clans do not fight each other, instead fending off constant attacks from Tarkir's many dragons; the clans still model themselves on a particular quality, which is epitomized by a Legendary Dragon creature whom each clan reveres and strives to emulate. The set focuses more on the color at the center of each wedge and its ally, with the enemy color given very little presence. The dragons who serve as the inspiration for each clan have their own watermarks, which are modified versions of the clan sigil. Additionally, Morph is missing; instead, a mechanic which is described as being Morph's precursor, &quot;Manifest,&quot; allows players to put any card face-down as a 2/2 creature, and flip them again only if their obverse was a creature to begin with.<br/><br/>The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) are led by Daghatar the Adamant, an aloof and analytical leader. They revere Dromoka, the Eternal. In the past, their mechanic is &quot;Bolster,&quot; which lets players strengthen the weakest of their creatures.<br/>The Jeskai Way (Blue, White, Red) are led by Shu Yun, the Silent Tempest, who seeks to preserve knowledge. They revere Ojutai, Soul of Winter. They retain the Prowess mechanic.<br/>The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) are led by Tasigur, the Golden Fang, an indolent and spoiled prince. They revere Silumgar, the Drifting Death. They retain the Delve mechanic.<br/>The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) are led by Alesha, Who Smiles At Death, a transgender warrior who managed to negotiate a position as equals for her clan. They revere Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury. In the past, their mechanic is &quot;Dash,&quot; which allows players to cast creatures at reduced mana cost, but with the added corollary that the creature must return to hand at the end of the turn.<br/>The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) are led by Yasova Dragonclaw (all Temur khans take the title &quot;Dragonclaw&quot;), Sarkhan Vol's first friend in the past, who dreams of a world where the humans of Tarkir are no longer prey to dragons. They revere Atarka, World Render. They retain the Ferocious mechanic.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the nineteenth century, settlers expanded rapidly across North America, from the eastern seaboard all the way to the west coast.  Players' pieces represent the wagons of a bold family just arrived from the Old World and working to reach the west coast.  Performance is based not on how well any one wagon does, but on how well players manage all of their wagons.<br/><br/>The game is played as a trick-taking game.  The goal of the game is to advance wagons as quickly as possible.  Every trick scores movement points.  These points propel wagons across the board.<br/><br/>Every hand also features a hand evaluation step.  Bidding a hand correctly scores extra movement points.  Missing a bid scores nothing.<br/><br/>Blocking is also an important element of the game.  By placing wagons on the game board&rsquo;s prime paths, players can force each other to either go around or give up some of their precious points to push opponents forward and out of the way.<br/><br/>This game has been self published (at prototype quality) in an edition not to exceed 200 copies.<br/><br/>",

Each piece has a small dent on top so the ball can be placed on it. <br/>In a turn, the active player can pass the ball as many times as s/he wishes, in a straight unblocked line (diagonal, too), and move one piece. Regular pieces move any distance diagonally, while the libero can move orthogonally as well (same as the goalie, who is restricted to the box, though). A piece that reaches a field adjacent to an opponent piece with the ball can grab the ball. Goals can be scored if a piece that is not offside can play the ball into the goal in a straight line.<br/><br/>One half time is played until a player has scored three goals. After two half times, the player with most goals is the winner (in case of a tie, an extension is played).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World War II in the West a division-corps scale wargame depicting the Second World War in Europe and North and East Africa.<br/><br/>World War II in the West gives you control of all of the major participating nations that fought World War II, and allows you to play a simple yet accurate portrayal of the war. World War II in the West was originally designed for play with Axis and Allies figures and rule, but is now a stand-alone game which includes over 1,600 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces if they wish.<br/><br/>In fact, World War II in the West can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.<br/><br/>With World War II in the West, you fight for the convoy routes, have air battles over London, conduct landing operations on the northern French coast, outflank and surround forces on the Eastern Front, and manage the industrial output of your nation.<br/><br/>World War II in the West includes over 1,600 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Canadian, Australian, New Zealander, South African, Czech, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known Spanish Blue Division that fought on the Eastern Front with the German Army.<br/><br/>The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 50 by 40 inches. Also included is a smaller East African map to be used in play. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 150km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.<br/><br/>The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from September 1939 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Two scenarios are included with the game allowing you to play the war in Africa or Operation Overlord in a shorter time than the campaign game. Also, new scenarios will be posted on the website.<br/> World War II in the West&rsquo;s complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history  more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional  counter wargames as its complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>World War II in the West can be combined with World War II in the East to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!<br/><br/>",

Historical units are maneuvered on a map until they contact the enemy. Units are then removed to a tactical map and battles are resolved. Units still on the strategic map may attempt to reinforce the battle, or await a further day's action.<br/><br/>The 11&quot; x 17&quot; map represents the Niagara peninsula using a point to point movement system. The 280 counters represent the company-sized combat forces involved in the struggle.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The heart of this game is the plastic template that comes with it. Other components include paper with asteroids printed on it, pads of space ship and fighter records, and a 12-sided die. Players need to supply their own colored pens, a different color for each player.<br/><br/>The template makes this a nearly unique and very satisfying game. You can play on an empty sheet of paper or on the asteroid fields provided. It's a simple game of space ship combat between either two players or two teams.<br/><br/>You first design your spaceships, assigning shields, armor, weapons, fighter hangars, etc., to spaces in a circle with different levels. The core of the circle represents both the bridge and the power plant of the spaceship - you don't want it hit! The circles are divided into twelve sections, like a clock.<br/><br/>Once you all have ships, you draw a triangle for each base and take turns plotting movement. Movement is handled by the template: line the center of the template over your current position, with your previous position directly to the rear. The template is divided into arcs of distance. If you move eight arc lengths last turn, you will continue to move eight in a straight line - make a slight mark on the paper to note that. If you want to change course, you can either accelerate or decelerate, and/or turn left or right. Find the spot on the map you wish to move to - it has to be within the range shown on the template. For each arc of distance you vary, plus a sideways distance, you must burn fuel - check it off on your ship record.<br/><br/>Combat is also handled by the template, which shows ranges of the various weapons. Missiles are the most fun, as you can only use your hand to measure roughly, and must launch them at an angle and speed fairly close to what you want, but probably not exactly. A missile will travel two turns without change of direction or speed, then explode. It's possible to be hurt by your own missile blast ...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World War II in the East is a division-corps scale wargame depicting the Second World War in Asia and the Pacific.<br/><br/>World War II in the East gives you control of all of the major participating nations that fought World War II, and allows you to play a simple yet accurate portrayal of the war. World War II in the East can be played with Axis and Allies figures and rules, but is meant to be played as a stand-alone game with over 900 counters. However, the rules and the hex sizes still allow Axis and Allies fans to get the most accurate World War II wargame they can find while still using the popular rules and pieces, if they wish.<br/><br/>In fact, World War II in the East can be used effectively to bring Axis and Allies fans into the wargaming hobby as the game combines some of the features of Axis and Allies and conventional counter wargames to produce a new style of game that is simple yet complex, fun yet challenging.<br/><br/>With World War II in the East, you fight major carrier engagements, have air battles over Guadalcanal, conduct landing operations on the many island chains of the Pacific, outflank and surround forces in Burma, as Japan transport resources from Southeast Asia and the East Indies, and manage the industrial output of your nation.<br/><br/>World War II in the East includes over 900 counters depicting the armed forces of the major belligerents as well as informational counters needed to play the game. Along with the major nations, you can find in the counter mix Australian, New Zealander, Indian, and East African units, as well as the well-known American fighter squadron that fought with China against the Japanese.<br/><br/>The beautifully hand-drawn map is made up of 12-pieces, totalling a size of 47 by 36 inches. The map has all of the charts and boxes needed for game play and has a scale of approximately 300km per hex. The hexes are large enough to hold Axis and Allies pieces, but it is ideally played with the counters that are sized to decrease mess and accidents during play.<br/><br/>The game is best played with the grand campaign which runs from December 1941 until the end of 1945, in monthly and bi-weekly turns. Scenarios allowing you to play shorter scenarios will be posted on the publisher's website as they become available.<br/><br/>World War II in the East&rsquo;s complexity is what sets it apart. It sets it apart from the other Axis and Allies games as the complexity is far greater and the history more accurate. It also sets it apart from the conventional counter wargames as it&rsquo;s complexity is slightly more simple, yet still depicts the war accurately while being fun and challenging. This is not a simple game, but its complexity allows both experienced and beginner wargamers to understand the rules and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>World War II in the East can be combined with World War II in the West to play the entire global war, both games combining to use over 2,500 counters and 25 square feet of maps!<br/><br/>",

Place (n-1) batons (where n=number of players) in the center of the table, within reach of all the players, The complete deck is dealt out to the players. It doesn't matter if the cards don't distribute evenly. Each player chooses a card from their hand and passes it, face down, to the player on their left. Players then pick up the card that was passed to them and choose that card or another card in their hand to pass again to the left. Play is simultaneous and continues in this manner, players passing cards as fast as possible, until someone has a set of 4 cards of the same kind. That player places their cards quietly on the table and takes a baton from the table. All other players must then immediately grab a baton.

However, they never know what they are supposed to advertise. <br/>At the beginning of the game, each player draws three different images onto small sheets of paper. Then s/he puts them into three pouches, hands in the pouches, and all pouches are shuffled. A moderator for the round draws a task now, i.e. something that has to be advertised. S/he randomly picks three pouches then, reveals the pictures and everyone discusses which picture is most suitable for the task. After a time of such discussion, each player secretly votes 2 - 1 - 0 points on the three designs. Votes are simultaneously revealed. Players get bonus points for agreeing on something. Also, a player may make a guess as to who drew a certain picture. If noone is able to guess, the artist gets extra points, if there are correct guesses, these are rewarded.<br/><br/>When all images have been awarded points, a second round starts, in which the same pictures are used again, but for different tasks and in different combinations. At the end of that second round, the final scoring happens: One after one, the players reveal what images were theirs and receive points. The highest overall score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is light motorcycle racing game based on the characters of Paul Sample's 'Ogri' comics. It is basically a roll and move game, with a number of cards that can be played at various times to enhance one's own progress or inhibit that of the another player. The game consists of three individual races   and a total of six laps around the course, played with different dice to represent the speed / intensity of each race. At the end of each race, players acquire sponsors based on their performance, and have the opportunity to spend money to purchase upgrades to their bikes for future heats. The overall winner is the first player to cross the finish line in the third race. The game is very aesthetically appealing, with board, card, and box art by Paul Sample and pewter miniatures for player pawns.<br/><br/>From the back of the box: &quot;Hell for Leather is a fast, freaky race around the world famous Isle of Man T.T. course, featuring a host of the best loved characters from Paul Sample's cult comic strip Ogri, which has appeared in Bike Magazine since 1972. A game for 2-6 players, Hell for Leather is all about high speeds, hard cash, 'Derring Do', and dirty tricks. Relying on guile, cunning, and hopefully a little luck, set your sights firmly on the chequered flag... and go for it! Pressure builds as you progress through the races with sponsorship funding, heaps of trouble, and laughs aplenty. When fair play and skilful riding are not enough, deft use of your nasty 'nerg nail', 'orrible oil slick' and other 'cheats' picked up along the way may assist you in the 'no holds barred' charge for glory.&quot;<br/><br/>",

A brave little wolf is on the search for booty.

But the Devil is in the details: Two of the beautifully-illustrated cards, although they may appear identical at first glance, are actually different upon closer inspection. Guessing wrong impacts Wolfi's treasure hunt: the goods have to be returned. The winner at the end of the adventure is the person who has managed to accumulate the most treasure. An extra dose of excitement is afforded by the little pirates that challenge each other to guessing contests.<br/><br/>",

With force sizes varying from one unit to several platoons, each trooper matters, and the correct combination of mobility, firepower, command and control is crucial to your success.<br/><br/>The U.S.S. Army Customizer is a comprehensive and statistically based force construction tool that literally allows you to design any weapon, any trooper and any army that you can imagine, all the while being assured that your creation will be balanced for play against any other U.S.S. force list. A lot of work and testing went into the Customizer, and we feel that you will not find a more versatile or more balanced universal force construction tool on the market today.<br/><br/>The 128-page rulebook contains the necessary rules and army lists to allow players to take part in the battles for the Milky Way. Control the ground forces of one of 5 different empires, all jockeying for supremacy in the new power vacuum that the Starslayers have created:<br/><br/><br/>     The Vobian Empire, vast and ancient, which utilizes high-tech weaponry and cybernetic beasts to even the odds against its former subjects.<br/>     The Tamerlane Khanate, progeny of the last great Mongol Empire, which still clings to a tribal past, despite the urgings of its human neighbors.<br/>     The Ka-yi Sultanate, Perseus heir to the Ottoman Empire, which struggles against religious and political tradition to form a united Human Confederacy.<br/>     The Nordic Alliance, descendants of the army of Gustavus Adolphus, who have used ingenuity and military know-how to overcome their limitations and become galactic players.<br/>     The Meraxillan Empire, ever evolving, which cares only for its own expansion at the expense of all others.<br/><br/><br/>This book contains rules which cover almost every tactical situation, including troop quality, command and control, army discipline, indirect and suppression fire, vehicles from mecha to armored personnel carriers, and more. Also included is the Starslayer Troop Builder, a complete and statistically-balanced troop construction tool that allows you to convert virtually any figure to the Starslayer rules system.<br/><br/>",

Left-liberal groups, led by the American Federation of Labor - Congress of Industrial Organizations and the People for Fair Trade - Network Opposed to the World Trade Organization, planned to rally and march, and to petition the governments for reforms, on November 30th. More radical groups, coalescing around the Direct Action Network and the Seattle Anarchist Response, planned to shut down the opening ceremonies, also on November 30th.<br/><br/>N30 portrays the morning blockades and the afternoon confrontations of November 30th. Two players represent the opposing sides; one represents the protesters; the other represents the police, with their incident commanders, Asst. Chief Ed Joiner and Captain Jim Pugel. Each turn represents one hour. Each bloc represents either about 50 police or 50 to 100 direct action protesters, prepared for confrontations. Each crowd represents 500 to 1000 other protesters, unprepared for confrontations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/>Princes of the East is a political/military game of the period immediately after the first crusade. Each nation strives for supremacy. Only the strongest, most cunning, will leave a legacy of stability and survival for his people.<br/><br/>This game can be played face-to-face or by mail/e-mail. Included are the rules, counters, sheets which allow control of a state, individual named leaders for use as councilors or as generals, tables, expenditure charts and a map of Southern Asia Minor and Northern Syria.<br/><br/>The game begins in the winter of 1100-1101. Each turn represent a season or part of a season. Players write their turns activities, first expenditures and skulduggery, then for<br/>movement and combat. Each winter, taxes are collected and trade deals are made. Any alliances must be thought out carefully, as once trade deals are organized, they can be broken at any time, but not renegotiated until winter.<br/><br/>A state can only run efficiently with an efficient civil service. A player must choose councilors, promoting or dismissing them as the situation requires. Religious leaders, First Citizens, Leading Nobles, and Chief Advisors are real enough, however, and have their own allies and enemies. Attempt to throw out a popular one or keep an<br/>unpopular one, and you risk a revolt which could see you killed by the mob.<br/><br/>Troops of all types are available. Native troops are inexpensive, but few. Mercenaries are plentiful, but expensive. They are listed by the names they are called by contemporaries;<br/>Light Horse are called Skyths by the Byzantines, Turcomen by Muslims, Turcopoles by Christians. Alan Light Horse are also available to Byzantines. There is no qualitative difference. The same goes for Cavalry; you have Ghulams and Cataphracts. Always note the image rather than the name. You'll get used to it.<br/><br/>This is a web-published game that is free to download and play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This trick-taking game is played with a standard deck of playing cards.  Each game, a pair of dice is rolled.  The first die determines how many cards are held in each player's hand (1-6); the other die is special and determines the trump suit.  The second die may come up &quot;no trump&quot; (there is no trump suit) or &quot;no suit&quot; (suit doesn't matter, only face value).  Chips are used to keep score.  Players must ante up before each hand, and the pot is won by the first player to reach eleven points (or to have the highest score after four hands).  Scoring centers around the fact that at start of each game, players use bidding wheels to predict how many hands they can win.  Penalties are applied for guessing incorrectly, while guessing correctly and winning all tricks in a hand can lead to an instant win.<br/><br/>",

A technology deck describes the various technological advances players can get.  Older races begin with more tech, younger races can acquire more.<br/><br/>The beginning of the game is primarily exploration and colonization using the star-fleet, dealing with random anomalies in space such as black holes, or space-pirates.  Once players make 1st contact, then military force and star fleets, and the political deck, come into play.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most colonies on the board when the last planet in the galaxy is colonized.  Planets are also drawn from a random deck, each with different difficulty ratings, mineral wealth and population maxima.<br/><br/>Splittin Infinitives is suitable for an afternoon's or evening's gaming.  The various decks give variety, and keep it light-hearted, while the base allows for strategic serious play.  The rules are simple enough to fit on one page, and it can be played right out of the box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CHECKCHESS RoundBoard contains standard sets of chessmen and checkers, but as the name implies the real star is the game board.  The circular board consists of eight rings of eight spaces each.  Each ring corresponds to one of the eight ranks on a standard chessboard, and each radially-aligned group of spaces corresponds to a file.  (They're even labeled 1-8 from outside to inside and a-h counterclockwise, and the rulebook calls them &quot;squares&quot; despite their curved shape.)<br/><br/>The pieces are set up with one player on the outside of the circle facing in and the other in the center facing out (but otherwise exactly as in ordinary chess or checkers) and the rules of those games are unchanged except that file &quot;a&quot; and file &quot;h&quot; are considered adjacent for the purposes of movement.  This is equivalent to the variant in which pieces are allowed to move off the right side of a square chess board onto the left and vice versa, but on the round board all legally-adjacent spaces are also physically adjacent.<br/><br/>From the designer's notes included with the game:<br/><br/>&quot;An engineer by profession, I have always had a fascination with the game of chess.  As a member of my high school chess team, I played hooky from school to strengthen my game.<br/><br/>&quot;In the 1960's the concept of a round board interested me as a novelty.  However, some 25 years later I made a serious study of that novelty and concluded that the round board is a major evolutionary advancement in the games of chess and checkers.  I hope you share my belief and enjoy your games on CHECKCHESS RoundBoard(TM).&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This a little dice game that we play in our town (Oruro, Bolivia), the popular name is Capi Futbol because it's based on another dice game called Capi Manda (or The Captain give orders) that is kind of like poker dice...<br/><br/>In order to play you just need 5 dice, a cup, and you have to draw a sketch of a football pitch (divided in 5 areas: goal area - field - midfield (the mid line does is not a divisor line) - field - goal area) and a counter that represent the ball (we almost always use a bottle cap).<br/><br/>The game starts with the &quot;ball&quot; at midfield. After a &quot;toss&quot; the one who has the kick off shakes the dice in the cup and the other player does the same (always after the one who is the Captain at time), then the non-captain player can re-roll from 1 to 5 dice, after he does the captain can do the same, they both can no use the re roll (see SIT DOWN below).<br/><br/>This way they play &quot;poker hands&quot; with rankings like this: 5 same (Grande), 1 different (Poker), 2 same 3 same (Full House), 1,2,3,4,5 or 2,3,4,5,6 or 3,4,5,6,1 (Escaleras, in ties the higher straight wins, 3 of the same (Tricas, 111 the higher, 222 the lowest), pairs, if neither of you has anything then both players put all the 5 dice in their cup and play simultaneously with no re-rolls with highest winning.<br/><br/>Every time a player wins a hand, he moves the ball one space towards the opponents goal area.<br/><br/>When you are playing in the goal area if the Attacking player wins it's a goal, you can play to a certain amount of goals,or with a time limit.<br/><br/>suggested optional rules.<br/> DESPEJE (Shot from the goal keeper) after winning a hand in his own goal area a player may choose to made a Despeje.<br/><br/>If he does he rolls one die and moves the number of pips in spaces towards the Goal area of the opponent, but when it reaches the goal area then the ball goes back towards the field (some people choose to not let the ball go back to the goal area or field of the shooter).<br/><br/>After this shot the opponent keeps possession and is now the Captain).<br/><br/>SIT DOWN (Mid distance shot at the goal) there is no re roll if you are in the &quot;Field&quot; area next to your opponent's Goal area, if the attacker wins its a goal (some people prefer to Announce the shot before a SIT DOWN happens), if the defender wins it's a DESPEJE but this time the defender keeps control after the play.<br/><br/><br/>3 LINEUP CHANGES to represent the 3 substitutions of players allowed in a football match, the player can Voltear (turn a dice over to its opposite side) 3 times in a match (i.e. a 3 can become a 4 if using a change, a 2 can become a 5, a 6 can become a 1 etc.) Some people let the attacking player do 1 Volteo each hand if he desires except when he is at the opponent's Goal area.<br/><br/>Well this game is fun and you can play it anywhere  (because it is a modified game of Generala it's like our national game) and of course it's about luck but not pure luck.<br/><br/>",

Recommended for 1/144 or 1/300 scale aircraft.<br/><br/>&quot;Like Scramble, these rules operate in three dimensions while only physically using two. Different types of machine gun are taken into account, and the skill of your aircrew is paramount. The system also caters for game balance to ensure that no game is a walkover. There are simple rules for ammunition expenditure and players can handle about 4 planes each. An added feature appropriate to the period is the availability of Luck, (assuming you are lucky enough to get any).&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rules are quite short, but are supplemented by data with over 150 aircraft and variants from World War One. The aircraft factors illustrate the differences caused by new designs. The rules incorporate a number of options to make life even more exciting for the unwary.

Prisoner's Dilemma is a well-known example of such a &quot;game&quot;. Or, consider the following example, paraphrased from the text.<br/><br/>Aldie and Derk decide to play a game for daiquiris. Each throws one or two fingers. If both throw one finger, Aldie buys Derk a daiquiri. If both throw two fingers, Derk buys Aldie two daiquiris. If they don't match, Aldie pays Derk a dime. (At the time this book was written, daiquiris were 55 cents.) How much per game should Derk demand of Aldie in order to make this game worthwhile?<br/><br/>This text can help you solve this problem, or others like it.

        "description": "Described in the book Calculate!, Invasion is a game where players try to capture regions forming a path to the opponent's capital.<br/><br/>Each region has a number on it, increasing in value the closer to the capital.  Play alternates between attacking and defending.  The attacker selects a region in the opponent's country that borders either the common border or one of the previously captured regions.  The attacker and the defender each secretly select a set of contiguous numbers from their grid of numbers.  The attacker selects from three to six and the defender selects one to three numbers.  The product of the attackers numbers is divided by the product of the defenders numbers.  If the resulting value is larger than the region number, the attacker colors the  region in.  If the  value is lower,  the defender colors the region in.  Once a region is colored in, it may not change hands again.  Numbers used in attack or defense may not be used again either.<br/><br/>A player wins when the other capital is captured or when he seals off all paths to his own capital.  If a player does not have three contiguous numbers on his grid, he may no longer attack.  If neither player may attack, then the winner is determined by comparing the sum of the regions that each would need to take including capturing the capital - the lower sum wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From back of box:<br/><br/>Three centuries ago, a man named John Bunyan wrote an adventure narrative called Pilgrims Progress that has captured the imagination Western Christendom like no other book since the Bible.<br/><br/>Rock Harbor Creations has now brought the dramatic highlights of that perennial bestseller vividly to life in an exciting new board game called Bold Adventure.  Like the book's hero, Christian, you leave the City of Destruction behind on your way to the Cross, and ultimately to the Celestial City.  Like him, you'll go slowly at first, using the lower numbers on the inner circle of the spinner (there are no dice).  But once you reach the Cross and leave your burden there, again like him, you'll find your pace increases, as you shift to the higher numbers on the outer circle of the spinner.<br/><br/>Along the way, you'll meet Mr. Evangelist who'll warn you to avoid such perils as the Slough of Despond and Beelzebub's Castle, and beware the enticements of Vanity Fair.  Once you've made your way past Doubting Castle, and Giant Despair, you get a glimpse of your destination from the peak Delectable Mountain.<br/><br/>Designed to appeal especially to youngsters, bold adventure is a fast playing game for two to six players, taking no more than 30 to 45 minutes per game, on the average.  It is also easy to play; all you have to do is the old enough to read instructions and follow the directions on the board.  And, it is fun to play: the game is designed so that the lead will change frequently, and no one will be left too far behind.  There are also some interesting lessons to be learned in route.  For instance, if someone else lands on your space, instead of him having to go back to the beginning (disease or sending you there), you, being a good pilgrim say, &quot;Please go ahead of me,&quot; and he moves one space in front of you.  Similarly, lest you get discouraged at how far ahead the others are, there are three squares along the way marked &quot;The last shall be first&quot; -- land on one of these, and you immediately move one space in front of the leader.<br/><br/>Nor are you necessarily the winner if you arrive at the last square first, for there is still the River of Death to cross.  There are two ways to attempt that, as indicated on the River of Death cards in two random piles.  Draw a card and see if you: ford the river and enter the Celestial City, or except the invitation of Captain Vain-hope, to avoid getting your feet wet, and let him ferry you across.  Alas, if you choose the latter, his boat capsizes and you are swept down the river and over the falls into Perilous Pool.  When you climb out, you'll find that you have a fair ways to go before you again attempt across the river.<br/><br/>The first player to ford the river wins, but all pilgrims may enter the Celestial City if they embark on the bold adventure set before them.<br/><br/>",

(No real teams or players) Each turn the offensive player chooses a run or pass play from a set of cards while the defensive player chooses from 4 run defenses and 4 pass defenses by placing pegs into a hidden matrix. The offensive play is then inserted into the defensive matrix and 5 possible results are revealed. A die is then rolled and the color of the die face indicates which play result to use. Regular football rules are used, such as 4 downs to gain 10 yards, and scoring is the same as in the real game. As in real football, the object of the game is to outscore the opponent.<br/><br/>",

There are different sizes of each species, and each different point/weight class card includes different information about that species.<br/><br/>The five point cards are new world records for that species, and include thorough information about the current world record for that species.<br/><br/>There are multiple options for play.  In tournament play, anglers can pursue victory by accumulation of points of by total weight, much like in actual tournament fishing.<br/><br/>Additionally, specific species can be the target, i.e. largemouth bass, and all other fish would be returned to the lake when caught.<br/><br/>In point play, there are bonuses given for catching fish of three different species or all species in the lake, excluding the carp--which warrant penalties.<br/><br/>If one angler acquires all eight cards of one point value a bonus is earned, but if that bonus is due to acquiring all of the world record fish (5 points), then they  are deemed the &quot;Greatest Fisherman (or person) of All Time&quot; and they automatically win the game.<br/><br/>The game was commissioned by, and features a spectrum of lures which are manufactured by Sheldons' Inc., of the Mepps line of spinners and spoons.

Each player attempts to make his side victorious, orcs or knights.<br/><br/>Mage towers scattered on the battlefield are strategic objectives, and it soon appears that who controls the most towers will reap the seeds of victory. &quot;<br/><br/>Orcs and Knight fight on the battlefield in a chaotic melee.<br/>Each player tries to secure small areas of the battlefield, hoping to regroup and turn the battle to his advantage.<br/><br/>Once an area of the battlefield is completely surrounded by orcs and knights, a tally is made on each flank to determine who controls that area.<br/><br/>Fight for control of 7 towers using tiles that have both Orcs and Humans in the corners.  Use your Power Tokens like Drummers, Leaders, Banners, and Shamans to increase your chances of victory on the field of battle.  The first player to control 3 towers wins the day.<br/><br/>Batt'l K'haos has well-written rules and is easy to pick up and learn.

Snakes are built in various colors, and body sections can be added that match. Players can catch snakes that have a head and at least two body parts, but longer snakes are worth more points. So the idea is to wait long enough to get good points, but not so long that someone else catches the snake you've been building up. The first player to catch a snake gets the &quot;snake bracelet&quot;, and they wear this until a snake of a longer length is caught. The person wearing the bracelet at the game's end gets bonus points in addition to their snake points.<br/><br/>",

Diplomats and Chancellors from different parts of the land have come to the King's court to solve the conflicts between the different opposing factions. However, among the Diplomats there is a Traitor - with chaos in his mind. If he can turn the other Diplomats at each other, or eliminate enough Chancellors, total chaos will erupt in the Kingdom, and the Traitor will be greatly rewarded...<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game players are secretly assigned the roles of one Traitor the rest being Senators. Each player receives three advisers (that act like life points) and a counter is placed in the middle of a 20 or 30 (depending on # of players) diplomatic point track. The Senators win by taking the point count to 30 or eliminating the Traitor's all three advisers. The Traitor wind respectively by taking the point count to 0 or when all the advisers of a senator have been eliminated.<br/><br/>The heart of the game lies in negotiation and bluffing. The game is played using action cards that manipulate the diplomatic point track, number of advisers in the game and the ever useful resource of gold. Much like in Werewolf, the task of the Traitor is to turn the Senators against one other while getting away with actions with which he tries to end the game in his favour.<br/><br/>",

Most simply, it's an auction game where the characters you buy provide the options you'll have for actions on your turn.  Instead of using the usual approach with character based card games--when cards refer to broad classes of characters such as &quot;thief&quot; or &quot;wizard&quot;--the cards in Bedlam refer to specific characters and they give the game an excellent sense of narrative.  Prepare for some surprises, some backstabbing and plenty of tough decisions.<br/><br/>I know that, as the game's creator, my own opinion doesn't count for much.  I have to say this is my favorite game of all that I have created.  I'm glad to be able offer it for the first time in this form.  I trust expansions and other editions will follow as more people discover the simple system and explore the possibilities it offers.<br/><br/>The game is for three to five players and it can be completed in 45- 60 minutes.  You'll need to print and cut out about 50 cards, a player sheet for each player and some counters (if you don't want to use poker chips or other tokens).<br/><br/>",

The commanders may, based on the course of events, change the order of the remaining cards to the played, or declare emergency maneuvers, however they cannot consult any other member of the staff unless using the Send Signals Card.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;To simulate the pace of combat operations, admirals and their staffs have only three minutes to select and order all their cards. If any ship's commander is not ready at the end of the three minutes, play begins with the ready commanders.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The game can be played with either paper or model ships of various sizes on a large table top or floor. Scale can be set to whatever units are convenient for play; all movement and hit probability charts are based on generic 'unit distances.' One unit can equal 1 inch, 1 foot, 1 yard or any other unit of length which suits the dimensions of the playing area. For table top play, 6 inches per unit is recommended. For floor play, 1 foot per unit can be used.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based in medieval Japan the two players try to capture their opponent's capital. To reach this goal you have to hire troops. The interesting part is that there is no central &quot;bank&quot; - every province has its own bank. So you pay money for the troops into the bank where you are hiring them and you get money for taxes from the bank where you tax your people (only in provinces you control). The results are richer and poorer provinces - with usually the richer provinces closer to the front lines (since that's where you want to hire troops).<br/><br/>Troops come in different types, with different movement ranges and fighting strengths.<br/><br/>Two German grade-school designers invented this game, which was chosen by the Deutsche Kinderhilfswerk to receive a grant, and G&uuml;nter Cornett at Bambus Spieleverlag has been helping the two develop the game over the past 2+ years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Arthurian Ghost Knights is a game of conflict for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  The players represent deceased Arthurian knights, fighting evil spirits for glory at Stonehenge.  Each turn, you draw a card, then play a card from your hand.  If it's your color, you simply place one of your guards at any trilithon.  If it's an opponent's color, you place one of her guards at a trilithon, and gain glory for &quot;helping&quot; her, and get to place a sword (bar) on the altar stone.  If it's black, it's Morgan Le Fay's, and you may do either, but getting no reward for &quot;helping&quot; an opponent.<br/><br/>Four times during the game - two random times in the first half, two random times in the second half - there will be a struggle round followed by a scoring round.  During the struggle round, you use the swords you have on the altar stone, each coupled with a card, to forcibly alter the situation at the trilithons, jockeying for positions that will gain you the most glory:  If you play a card of your color, you add one of your guards to any trilithon.  Playing a card of an opponent's color lets you remove one of her guards from any trilithon.  Playing a black card (Morgan Le Fay) lets you do either.<br/><br/>When the struggle is done, the scoring occurs.  At each trilithon, the player with a plurality of guards gets one glory for each guard she has there - double if you're alone there.  In a tie, everyone gets their respective glory there.  If you have a guard at each of the five trilithons, you get 5 glory.<br/><br/>After the fourth scoring round (or someone gets lapped!), the game is over.  The player with the most glory wins!  (There are a couple of tie-breakers.)<br/><br/>Arthurian Ghost Knights is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.<br/><br/>",

Many more of the movements, particularly those that concern tactical reactions to enemy moves and movements of less-reliable troops, have been randomized. A new combat mode has been added to represent the protracted firefight between bodies of formed infantry. We have also included new tests of commander and troop resolve at the maneuver element level.

I made a set of the original game Burroughs used as a plot device for the book and quickly discovered the design was flawed - 99% of all games ended in a draw. Not much fun.

They then proceed to the second phase, building the ice palace. During the ice palace phase, the winning player takes all the pieces from the yard and adds them onto the ice palace structure, subject to three restrictions:<br/><br/>     A pyramid can only be placed on top of a larger pyramid<br/>     Orthogonally adjacent new stacks can only be formed provided the topmost pyramids of both are the same color<br/>     All pieces from the yard must be added to the ice palace<br/><br/><br/>Players then draw back up to 6 pieces in their hand and the yard-building phase begins anew. Play continues in this manner until a player draws the last piece from the bag, at which point the game ends and is scored.<br/><br/>Players get points for every pyramid in a stack (in the ice palace) which has a piece of their color as the topmost pyramid.<br/><br/>Ice Palace was designed by Geoff Hanna. The rules are available online.<br/><br/>Ice Palace tied for 2nd with Undercut in the Autumn 2004 Icehouse Game Design Competition.<br/><br/>",

Although the title implies that this is a children&rsquo;s version, the box says it is still for ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>The game is here reduced to its core mechanism of forming clay sculptures that are not too difficult nor too easy for other players to guess.  The dice rolling and special spaces are no longer present;  each player instead has the opportunity to ask 3 yes/no questions about one sculpture, and then make a guess.  Instead of arrows, the sculptures are moved up a staircase each time a player asks questions about it.  The middle steps award the most points to the sculptor if their riddle is solved there, while the first steps (too easy) award fewer points, and the top step (too difficult) penalizes the sculptor points.<br/><br/>The players are also dealt cards at the beginning of the game, and must choose their sculptures from these cards.  Player mats provide suggested questions to ask during the game.<br/><br/>",

These cards are typically sin cards which players will play from their hand to their playing area which represents the player choosing not to succumb to the temptations of the 7 deadly sins.  Playing sin cards can help you invoke special abilities called divine favors.  During a round players will be trying to empty their hand because any cards left in your hand will likely cause you to receive negative karma points.

The two players with the same number of jokers are partners, the third player is the soloist. But players do not know this until enough jokers are played.<br/><br/>The object of the soloist is either to win the middling number of tricks (for example, four if one partner wins five or more and the other three or fewer), or to force the partners to win the same number of tricks each. This means he can win with 14 tricks if they both win none, or with none if they both win seven.<br/><br/>Tricks are played and the trick is normally taken by the second-highest card of the suit led, or by the leader if nobody follows suit.<br/><br/>If a Joker is played, its player may decide who wins the trick. If both are played at the same trick, the soloist decide who takes the trick. Jokers cannot be led unless there are no other cards in hand.<br/><br/>The score is always 10 points plus the number of tricks won by the soloist (making anything from 10 to 24 points). This amount is credited to the soloist if successful, otherwise to each partner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "description provided by designer<br/><br/>Essentially, an asymmetric square 'Hex'.<br/><br/>The board is an nxn square grid (19&times;19 is probably a good start)  Two opposite edges are designated white goals, and the other two are black goals. Corners count as part of both edges. Each player's objective is to connect their two goal edges with an unbroken chain of their stones. White (O) stones may use both orthogonal and diagonal connections to complete their chain, while black (+) stones may only use orthogonal connections. However, black places three stones on each of their turns, while white places only two.  White moves first, then turns alternate. If there are not enough spaces remaining to place all of a player's stones for their turn, place as many as possible. Play ends when the victorious player completes a valid connection.  Draws should not occur.<br/><br/>Any serious two-player abstract requires a great many playtests before being deemed 'unbreakable', so I consider this to be a beta version.  Though its name (and possibly some minor points of the rules) are still subject to change, please feel free to implement it for online/AI play (given proper attribution).<br/><br/>",

It is also, incidentally, our first foray into the realms of North American sports, so it is with some trepidation that we launch this latest project, with phrases like 'bearding the lion in his own den'carrying coals to Newcastle' and, perhaps more appropriately, 'trying to sell ice to the Eskimos' springing to mind. But anyhow, despite what our great leaders tell us to the contrary (starting wars in other people's countries obviously excepted) life has to have some element of risk, so here goes.<br/><br/>This is a case of the title saying it all. 'Blue Zone Hockey' concerns itself only with the action in and around the net, strictly blue zone only. We wanted a quick-playing simulation - you already have some great detailed hockey sims out there in the lions' den - but we also wanted to capture at least a little of the excitement of top-grade ice hockey so we have adapted the 5/6 System to produce a game that takes only 6-8 minutes to play an entire match but one which also provides some blue zone commentary, covers such aspects as sin-binning, Power Play, Short-Handed play, injuries, Overtime and Empty Net situations as well as suggesting ways to identify goal-scorers and assists and even goal times if you want that detail.<br/><br/>What we don't provide are team and player details, you will need to do that for yourself. We have no intention of getting involved with the US/Canadian laws relating o the use of such information which, in this country thankfully, would be regarded as being 'in the Public Domain' and therefore not subject to the payment of Royalties. And long may it remain that way. We do explain, however, how you might go about all that.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>",

The game strategy fully depends on player's skills.&quot;<br/><br/>My brief description of how the game is played and the goal:<br/><br/>During the game, players attempt to race their 14 pieces around the Backgammon board, counter-clockwise, blocking their opponent's pieces along the way by occupying a point (a single piece on a point cannot be captured in this variant, in fact, there is no capturing at all) or by building a &quot;wall&quot; (two stacked pieces on a point make a wall) that no piece, friendly or otherwise, can pass over.  Movement, in this game, is only from quadrant to quadrant, each quadrant consisting of 6 points (1 thru 6, 7 thru 12, 13 thru 18, 19 thru 24).  The second piece on the wall has special ability of jumping over any wall that might be in the way to land in the next quadrant (hense the name &quot;Grasshopper&quot;).  Walls can only be built by moving a piece from the previous quadrant that is exactly 6 points away to a point that has one piece on it.  Once the players get their pieces to the 4th quadrant, they must build walls on the quadrant.  These walls (two piece stacks) can be borne off the board as a unit for the players turn.  The winner is the first player to bear off two walls consecutively, but not necessarily in two consecutive turns.<br/><br/>",

Board presents a clock with main activities of the monastery (like prayers, work in the scriptorium or in the garden) and players can can choose in which of the shortly starting activities they want to participate (represented by them moving pawn on board). Next the player can use the ability of the field he moved to (drawing card, exchanging card with a common poll, completing tasks etc.). Each completed task gives a player certain amount of points and allows him or her to draw another task card. Game follows this pattern until one of the players collect enough points.<br/><br/>Game presents Christian spirituality and sentences of st.

Players take the role of psionic test subjects, pitted against one another in an &quot;experiment&quot; only one of them can survive. It is visceral and fast; playable in under 15 minutes.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a game, each player prepares a grid consisting of six cards face down. This grid represents the player&rsquo;s psionic defenses. The card backs display a number from one to three, letting the opponent know the strength of the defense, but not the type.<br/><br/>Each player has an offense and defense deck to draw from. During a round, players burn cards off the top of a deck in order to play cards from their hand, either to replenish their defenses or attack.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to destroy your opponent&rsquo;s defenses, and reduce them to zero life by attacking unoccupied spaces on their grid.<br/><br/>72 cards (2 decks of 36, one for each player) and a simple rule sheet come in the box. No add-ons required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Tactical Assault: Fantasy Cards&trade; is an elegant card-driven rule set for bringing exciting clashes of sword &amp; sorcery - including command &amp; control and the fog of war - to the tabletop battlefield in a very playable fashion. The rules are even able to incorporate the some of the more obscure aspects of pre-gunpowder warfare such as war machines, artillery, obstacles, sappers and so forth into the same fast-play, narrative based system.<br/><br/>Despite being deceptively simple in appearance, the Fantasy Cards provide a very challenging game full of hard choices and long range planning. The fact that every card can offer multiple options, that there is no way of knowing exactly when certain cards will appear in a player's hand, and that not every unit will be available at all times (e.g. due to combat effects, confusion, etc.) forces players to carefully weigh the benefits and risks of almost every tactical decision within the framework of their overall strategic plan.<br/><br/>In addition, with the incorporation of expansion decks, even more challenge and detail can be easily added to the base game. This allows players to customize the rules to the level of complexity they most enjoy.<br/><br/>And if folks prefer their battles more in the form of a traditional board game, the Fantasy Cards can be combined with the new Tactical Assault: Legendary Battles&trade; print-n-play packs. These sets give Fantasy Card players everything they need to play exciting battles in a hex and counter style format - including unique scenarios, beautiful full color maps and more than enough counters to allow players to develop their own scenarios. The only thing the players need to provide is their own Fantasy Card decks!<br/><br/>All of this is offered in an easy to download print-n-play format available at the Tactical Assault Games website - along with articles on tactics, tips &amp; tricks, designer's notes and more!<br/><br/>",

Players mix the cards then place them on the table with the &quot;5 geometric forms&quot; side facing upwards. All the players play at the same time. Once the signal is given, each player looks at the cards and tries to find identical pairs. As soon as a player thinks he has created a pair, he takes two cards, places them in front of him and continues to search for other pairs. But watch out for mistakes as the cards are very similar!In fact, all the cards contain the 5 same geometric shapes; only their location differs from one card to the other. You are not allowed to touch the cards except to finally take them!<br/><br/>Game ends when there are no more cards in the centre of the table, or it does not seem possible to create another pair (if the players have taken incorrect pairs), each player checks the pairs that he has created. Winner is the player with the most correct pairs.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     48 luminous cards<br/><br/><br/>",

The goal of the game remains the same &ndash; checkmate your opponent. However, your arsenal is no longer limited by the 16 pieces on the board!<br/><br/>During the course of the game, you can use special cards: mutations, intrigues and maneuvers. Each card introduces a temporary or permanent change into the normal rules of chess. The game strategy becomes much more diversified as it becomes impossible to foretell your opponent&rsquo;s tactic. An element of chance is added to the game (something completely absent from the classic game of chess). The tables can turn at any time, imposing drastic changes on either side. This is why players in extremely dire situations still have a legitimate chance to win.<br/><br/>In addition to this game set, you will need a chess board with the standard pieces for both sides. You will also at least need to be able to play chess at the most rudimentary level.<br/><br/>&quot;Chess of chaos&quot; is a card addition to classic chess, the idea was created on the base of the game &quot;Temp&ecirc;te sur l'&eacute;chiquier&quot;. &quot;Chess of chaos&quot; is produced in Russia with the permission of the original authors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;I remember back before the great war, we didn't have any fancy machinery guns to add to our two-winged air-scrapers.  So, when two hot-shot fly-boys needed to settle their differences, they grabbed a buddy and had them duke it out mano-a-mano on the wings of aeroplanes. Those crowds would sure hoot and holler as we flew nearly 50 mph to heights of almost 30 feet.  You kids wouldn't remember those days.  So, I made this paper and card game-set box to show you nancies how we used to do it.  Back when flying and racing was pure.<br/><br/>Did I say racing?  Why I can't really remember why we were racin' too.  But, hell, that's exactly how I remember it, so that's how you're gonna play it.  The old-fashioned way.  We called it &quot;Punchin' Planes&quot; and that's how it was.&quot;  ~Grandpappy<br/><br/>In &quot;Good 'Ol Punchin' Planes&quot; players relive the days of early Pre-WW1 aviation.  The days when the only way to fight was to have a buddy stand on your wing and engage in fisticuffs (machine-guns were too heavy, or course).  Through the use of dual-purpose action cards, players have to navigate obstacles on the modular race-track while their fighters spar on the wings of their planes.  Will you win over the crowd and cross the finish line or go down in a ball of flames?<br/><br/>Play is fast and actions are revealed simultaneously.  While the game uses a rock-paper-scissors mechanic for fighting (punch, kick, grapple), there is always the option for the losing player to &quot;trade blows,&quot; essentially turning the tables.  But, since cards are not always drawn each turn, losing a battle may sometimes be more beneficial than winning.  With obstacles that bring players one step closer to explosion, hand management, and plane positioning complicating each situation, &quot;Punchin' Planes&quot; is a short game for 2 players with a surprising strategic depth.<br/><br/>",

The smallest set of each color will be squished and not score, and larger sets score more points. Whenever a new column is formed, a special effect is triggered (usually good). Between games, twelve different special powers are randomly allocated between the six type of gnomes, making for very different games and necessitating different tactics.<br/><br/>This game's core mechanisms are based on Knizia's card game Vampire. Invasion of the Garden Gnomes introduces special powers for each color and more vicious competition within each color of meld. The game includes &quot;junior rules&quot; that allow you to play a simpler game, more similar to Vampire, and the &quot;full rules&quot; are notably different from the the game's predecessor and involve deeper strategy.<br/><br/>",

The black meatball marbles are neutral and are used by either player as needed. Any small object, such as a napkin or black marble, is used as a tie-breaker token to indicate which player last played a black marble to the board.<br/><br/>To start, White plays a black meatball marble anywhere on an empty Shibumi board and takes the tie-breaker token.<br/><br/>Players then alternate placing one of their own marbles adjacent to the last placed marble.  Here, adjacent means orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to and on the same level as the last placed marble or onto a 2x2 platform just completed by the last placed marble.<br/><br/>If a player is unable to place a marble in this way, she or he places a black meatball marble on any empty space or platform and takes the tie-breaker token.<br/><br/>The game ends when the only space left is the peak of the Shibumi pyramid.  A black meatball marble is then placed on the top of the pyramid. This is a neutral move and the tie breaker token stays with its current owner.<br/><br/>The player who created the longest strand of touching spaghetti or sauce marbles (when the board is viewed from above) wins the game. If there is a tie, the player who last played a meatball marble loses.<br/><br/>A strand is a connected set of like-colored marbles such that each marble in the strand is connected to one or two other marbles in the strand as in a chain of links. There is no looping back where a single marble is passed through more than once and there is no branching.<br/><br/>So now the meal is served.

Separate sections on the cards reflect a player on a powerplay or playing shorthanded.<br/><br/>Delayed penalties and shooting off the rebound were also factored in by special rules reflecting these aspects.<br/><br/>One additional detail regarding TWGHG should be noted. In this game, the players for each team in a given season are those who were set to appear on opening day for the current year. This differs from hockey game systems such as Strat-O-Matic or Statis Pro, where card sets were published only after a season was completed. TWGHG was intended for players who wanted to use the opening day rosters and play out a season as it was progressing.<br/><br/>",

The challenge was to make Him more of a valuable member to the team, without making Him too powerful and becoming God like. In this adventure the Wizard asks His friends to join Him on a quest to recover ancient spells that have become lost. Once found, these spells will help the Heroes battle against Zargon and His evil plans. Two new elements, Wood and Spirit, are added to the game. Giving the Heroes 18 new spells to use. All of these spells are used in future games. This is what is so amazing about the adventure series. The game keeps growing, making it more fun to play. We hope that you and your fiends will enjoy your adventure.<br/>This game's pdf files are available for downloading. They are made in a way that will allow you to make the books and cards.

        "description": "Inkognito is a simple yet elegant abstract game from Germany. The board contains a 5 x 5 squared grid, with the squares in two of the opposite corners being of a different colour to the rest, and designated as Castles. Each player has a set of five plastic pieces. These are cup-shaped and placed &lsquo;upside down&rsquo; on the board. Inside one cup of each set is a marker which identifies the piece as a Spy.<br/><br/>The objectives of the game are to manoeuvre one's Spy into the enemy Castle and to discover the whereabouts of the opposing Spy. The achievement of either of these will cause that player to win the game.<br/><br/>At the start, the players set out their pieces on the five squares immediately in front of their own Castle, remembering which piece is the Spy. During his turn a player may move any one of his pieces in any direction as many squares as he wishes. A piece is not allowed to jump over nor occupy the same square as another piece. Instead of moving, a player may choose to interrogate an enemy piece. This is done by moving one of his pieces to rest orthogonally adjacent to the piece to be questioned, and on the next turn asking if it is the Spy. The other player must identify the piece so questioned. If it is the Spy, then the questioner has won the game; however if it is not, then the asking player loses his piece, and if the asking piece was the Spy, then he also loses the game. The rules do not state that it is illegal to occupy one&rsquo;s own Castle, but one must assume that it is, in order to avoid stalemate. Also the rules do not make it clear as to what happens when a player has all his pieces blocked and cannot move on his turn.<br/><br/>Bluffing is an important part of the game. It is not mandatory to interrogate a piece, even having moved into position to do so, neither is it obligatory to remain in position to be questioned. One can thus chase an opposing piece around the board only to discover eventually that it was a decoy, and in the meantime the enemy Spy is well positioned to enter one&rsquo;s own stronghold.<br/><br/>As it is only permissible to enter a Castle orthogonally, it is possible to set up an impregnable defence, by placing a piece on the squares either side of it. This ploy however, will limit the number of pieces that one can move, and unless one employs the Spy as a defender, increases the chances of one&rsquo;s Spy being exposed.<br/><br/>",

Choose your which side you are on: Will you fight with the earthbound Troll tribes, who are determined to hold their wooded, mountainous homelands in the north against their foes? Will you establish dominion over the skies at the side of the ethereal Spirits? Do you share the fanatical rage of the Goblins keen on expanding their territories or will you help the solemn and elusive Merfolk protect their watery domains?<br/>While war wages, mighty Spellcasters emerge from the depths of space and time, summoning mighty Creatures and casting powerful Spells to battle each other...<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.<br/><br/>The third expansion of Elemental Clash is all about Creatures (it features more Creature and less Spell cards than previous sets), in particular the four major tribes, each being associated with one of the four elements: Trolls (Earth), Spirits (Air), Goblins (Fire) and Merfolk (Water). Furthermore, Elemental Clash:<br/><br/>In a &quot;Mini-Expansion&quot; included in the game, Tribes offers an exciting new variant of play, with Spellcaster cards being introduced. Players can choose one out of the ten different Spellcasters included and build a deck around him or her. Each Spellcaster has a pre-set deck size, hand size and number of cards which you draw each turn as well as a permanent &quot;Static Ability&quot; and a &quot;Flip Ability&quot; which gives you a certain benefit once, but shuts down the &quot;Static Ability&quot;.<br/><br/>Featuring artwork of Enggar Adirasa and Andreas Propst.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Racial Wars is the first Polish fantasy card game, designed by Åukasz Kozak. Currently, the game is designed for 2-4 players. However, in the second edition the rules and game sets for 1 player will be presented.<br/><br/>The War of Races takes place in Ithilion world and 12 different races and 1 neutral race take part in it. The goal is to conquer the opponent&rsquo;s residence or to eliminate his leader from the battlefield. The game also becomes more strategic as you play on two fronts.<br/><br/>Racial Wars in not a collectible card game but thanks to random additions, the player can make his own, exclusive card deck. Each card has its own unique abilities and unrepeatable pictures.<br/><br/>Players start with only leader in front of them and build plateau of cards in front of them - some cards generate resources - different for different races - which are then used to put more powerful creatures into the table. Then, each turn the battle takes place - player who is currently attacking chooses units to attack and defending blocks their attacks with his own to protect his leader. The purpose of the game is to kill enemy leader.<br/><br/>The game is based on a fantasy world of Ithilion, which arose in author&rsquo;s and his coworkers&rsquo; minds. If you want to know the new world and characters living in it, or make a new era in Ithilion world and fight at one of the races&rsquo; side, join the Racial Wars community and create with us new days of Ithilion world.<br/><br/>Leader&rsquo;s set &quot;Or'grakrun&quot; is a set which includes the deck of Dragons based on the black leader of dragons Or'grakrun.<br/><br/>Dragons are a race of wild beasts inhabiting high mountains of the Ithilion world. As Elerter-the Angel Creator kept his seed long in his wings, dragons have become almost immortal. Nobody really knows how long these great beasts live because their bodies show no signs of old age or fatigue. Their skin is hard like a stone, eyes will see even the remotest areas and the fire that comes out of their mouths is difficult to extinguish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The biggest challange to making these games has always been, How to keep it fresh and new. After making the 8th game in the adventure series, My Heroes wanted very much to keep the mercanaries. The quests got to big for the original board. So we created a bigger board. My first Son wanted more fighting, my second Son wanted more treasure, and I wanted more furniture. Add to this all the monsters, cards, tiles and rules from all the expansions and we created the Masters' Series. This is a very exciting adventure that we're sure your going to love. It will require a bit of work on your part to create the board and tiles. You will need to buy quite a few extra monsters and furniture for the game. But all of this is provided for you in the making a Masters' Series game booklet. <br/>The pages for this adventure are available to download at &quot;Dragonkingdoms.co.uk&quot; and yahoo's group site &quot;HeroQuest- hero quest&quot; for free. You do need to join the group to access the file's section where they are stored. The photo section of this site will allow you to read the story and look at the maps to see if this game is something you would like to play. Your adventure awaits!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Third Person Shooter (or TPS for the acronym-hungry) is basically a tactical First Person Shooter transmogrified into a tabletop game. The intent was to have as few rules as possible, to avoid them getting in the way of the fragfest. TPS can be taught in under 5 minutes, and a game round usually takes less than 25 minutes. TPS scales well, and runs with little or no lag with 8 to 10 players!<br/><br/>TPS uses simultaneous movement and combat with a minimum of fuss and constraints, such as hexes or movement allowances. As such TPS has been accused of thinking far outside the conventional box for tabletop games.<br/><br/>TPS pits the Terrorists against the counterterrorists in the classic struggle for most frags and points to buy cool upgrades and fancy equipment. Supported game modes in v.1.0 are Hostage-rescue and Bomb placement/disarmament.<br/><br/>More features will come with future patches and major versions.<br/><br/>The future of TPS is currently uncertain - But in a good way - We are looking into doing a redesign and getting it published :)<br/><br/>",

Amongst them are the Elves and the Dwarves, who have fought against Sauron and his armies for centuries. Though their experience in war is legendary, these races are now few in number, their time in Middle-earth close to an end. As such, their armies are often small, but comprised of powerful elite warriors, all of them ready to fight for the fate of Middle-earth.<br/><br/>This 64-page Sourcebook for The Lord of the Rings contains all the rules you'll need to field an army from The Free Peoples (including army lists for Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, Ents, The Fellowship and the White Council), as well as detailed background information and scenarios.<br/><br/>You must possess a copy of The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game in order to use the contents of this book.<br/><br/>",

Legends and tales say that the cave could fulfill a person's ambitions, but there would always be a price. Our group of friends however doesn't know the exact nature of this place and they start being overwhelmed by hallucinations and weird experiences. When they will finally fathom what this situation is all about -themselves- it will be too late. Some of them have already started to lose their sanity...<br/><br/>The Deep', is a game in which players try gain experience cards through bidding and try to surpass challenges and events of a deck of cards called The Road. Some challenges might make the game co-operative for just a second, but don't be fooled! In a place like The Deep it's every man for himself.<br/><br/>A second deck with Events and Conditions called The Book, makes the game more interesting, as players may draw cards from The Book by paying sanity. The Book cards may help you win the game, but a couple of experiences must also be earned, or else The Book might not be as useful as hoped.<br/><br/>Each game turn is divided in 4 phases:<br/><br/>    The Road: Road cards are revealed.<br/>    The Experience: Experience cards are revealed and auctioned.<br/>    The Silence: Players play experience cards.<br/>    The Book: Players may pay sanity to draw Book cards.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends if a player has fulfilled 3 experiences, or if a player has no sanity left. The ambitions of each player are then revealed and the player with the most points is the winner. In case of a tie, the player among the tied that has the most sanity left is the winner.<br/><br/>After all, a madman cannot always win...<br/><br/>",

The answer, apparently, is &quot;very scary.&quot; With a very long range and the ability to ignore Line of Sight, the Austringer has quickly become a premier Guild Minion.<br/><br/>The Austringer has an average 4&quot; Walk, cannot Charge and beyond Quick Retreat (see below), has no other way of enhancing his own mobility. Fortunately, after the Austringer finds a nice piece of terrain to hide in, his long reach means he'll rarely needs to move anyway.<br/><br/>The Austringer is armed with a Raptor - a Range 12 weapon that ignores cover modifiers and Line of Sight. This means you can sit behind a huge piece of blocking terrain and still attack up to 12&quot; away, ignoring any negative flips from cover that your opponent is trying to use to avoid getting hit.<br/><br/>The Austringer has little direct synergy with any one Master. The closest is Lucius (a Henchman), but in any case, he still makes for a good choice in your average Guild crew, regardless of who's leading.<br/><br/>",

The race to collect Ingredients is the goal of the game! To increase the strategy and <br/>interactivity between the players, there are Spell cards that let you bid extra cards or different cards. There are also Spell cards that let you change the rules of the bidding. So you need to maneuver to get the right Spells at the right time and to be in the right Area of the board to take advantage of the Spells you control.<br/><br/>The Dark Summoner expansion is really an interesting assortment of extra Spell cards.  The Force of Nature card might be the most powerful one in the game&mdash; it certainly adds greatly to your ability to collect Element Cards faster than your opponents.  The two Red Spell cards are 2 of only 3 that are available for this game. Soul Drain and Plunderer are meant to increase the interactivity between players!<br/><br/>",

Wells' Little Orc Wars is a miniatures game based on the rules and concepts published by the genius science fiction author nearly a century ago.  It is, in fact, one of the most flexible, innovative, and fast-paced miniatures rule systems for use with fantasy miniatures and models ever created.  Indeed, a primary feature of this game is that it can be played with virtually any miniatures, setting it apart from the vast majority of fantasy miniatures games, which demand that only their branded products be used to play.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Other highlights of the complete book include advanced melee rules that expand upon the basic ones created by Wells that are presented here: guidlines on building props and models; examples of play depicting some of the best wargaming models currently available, including those by the Miniature Building Authority, Armocast, Fantascene, Dwarven Forge, and Flying Tricycle and action-oriented images of miniatures in play.&quot;<br/><br/>Little Orc Wars and its predecessor, Little Wars from H.G. Wells, provide a simple set of rules for wargaming using miniatures (or anything else you can find to represent troops).  Little Orc Wars focuses on fantasy and the basic rules for moving troops, melee, ranged combat, terrain effects, etc.--although modern rules are more complex, these rules capture the feel of combat with very little effort or time.<br/><br/>",

It's up to you and the teenage trouble making Task Force to save humanity. The Night of the Saucers is upon us, and Earth's only hope just got out of detention.<br/><br/>Night of the Saucers is a collaborative game for 1 to 4 players, ages 8 and up. The average game lasts about an hour, but its not uncommon for a game to stretch towards the two hour mark. It all depends on how many missions you choose to complete and how many cards you decide to include in the alien deck.<br/><br/>Each player controls 3 high school students that are stuck in detention when aliens attacked and take over the city. Now it's up to the students to take the city back. You must move about the board searching buildings for supplies to fight the aliens with. At the end of every turn, each player draws an alien card that deploys new aliens onto the board and directs the movements of the alien army. Sometimes devastating Saucer Strikes will be drawn that blow up the buildings tiles and everything on them. This makes the board treacherous to navigate and supplies harder to come by. The way you win is by completing Task Force missions or by surviving the alien deck.<br/><br/>Night of the Saucers is a fun and easy game with cool miniatures set in an 80s action-movie inspired environment. We like to say it's like Red Dawn meets Independence Day with the Breakfast Club. Are you listening Hollywood?<br/><br/>",

If any of YOUR manatees are face up, you may move one of them toward their home location. If you have face up manatee cards that are adjacent to each other, any adjacent manatee can follow the card that moved by moving into the space it just left, and an adjacent manatee can follow that card, and so on.

        "description": "Jazz (sometimes spelled Jass) is a game played with a traditional deck of cards, not to be confused with the Swiss game by the same name played with a special 36-card jass deck. The ideal number of players is four, but it can be adapted for three or five by removing one or two of the number 2 cards for a total of 51=3*17 or 50=5*10 cards.<br/><br/>The game is a fixed collection of several short games and the winner is the player with the lowest total score. There are slight variants of the exact composition of included games and the scoring, however all but one are always trick-taking games while the last one is a variant of the game Fan Tan. All games start by dealing the entire deck so that each player receives the same number of cards. Common for all the trick-taking games is the requirement to follow suit if possible. The player of the highest card (ace being the highest) in that suit takes the trick and starts the next one. If a player lacks cards in the suit on the table he plays any one card of his own choice.<br/><br/>Most Jazz variants consist of a selection of four to six of the following trick-taking games plus the final game of Fan Tan. The provided suggested penalty points provide for a balanced four-person game.<br/><br/>1. &quot;Spades&quot; or &quot;Clubs&quot; <br/>A trick-taking game where the aim is to avoid taking cards of the specified suit. (2p each)<br/><br/>2a. &quot;Tricks&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot;, or &quot;Minus&quot; <br/>Take as few tricks as possible. (2p each)<br/>2b. &quot;Plus&quot; <br/>Take as many tricks as possible. (-2p each) This seems to be a rare variant to include.<br/><br/>3. &quot;Honors&quot; <br/>Avoid taking honor cards, i.e. 10, J, Q, and K. (2p each)<br/><br/>4a. &quot;Jacks&quot;<br/>4b. &quot;Queens&quot; <br/>Depending on the variant, one should avoid taking either jacks or queens. (5p each) Some variants play both the Jacks and the Queens games one after the other, others play only one of them.<br/><br/>5. &quot;King of Hearts and the Final Trick&quot;<br/>Avoid taking the very last trick as well as the king of hearts card. Some variants also give penalty points for the fifth trick. (10p each, sometimes with an extra penalty for taking the king of hearts as part of the final trick.)<br/><br/>6. &quot;Solitaire&quot;, &quot;Seven&quot;, &quot;Fan Tan&quot;<br/>The final game is Fan Tan or a version thereof. One common rule specifies that the player having the 7 of diamonds always goes first by playing this card while another variant is started by normal clock-wise order and with any number seven card. The starting player is often allowed/required to play an additional card if possible. In each suit the 7 is played first followed by the 8 on one side and as the third card the 6 on the other side of the 7. As soon as these three cards have been played the ascending (9-K) and descending (5-A) runs of the suit are played independently of one another on top of the 8 and 6 cards. A player has to play one and only one card on his turn if possible. The game ends when a player runs out of cards. The other players score 3p for each remaining card of their own.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Super Turbo bitCrawl FX: Alpha Xtreme is a co-op game designed for 1-8 players in which our heroes venture through a dungeon in search of treasure, adventure and eventually the BOSS FIGHT!!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players are given a choice of eight classes within the standard four fantasy archetypes: Mage, Priest, Rogue, and Warrior. Each class has a specific number of starting dice for basic attack and agility rolls and class specific skill that is unique for each of the eight classes. After players have chosen their class they are tasked with selecting the skills that their character will possess for the duration of the game. There are eight double-sided ability inserts available to each archetype allowing for a total of 24 unique versions of each of the available eight classes. Players then select their portrait and sprite representation for this game.<br/><br/>Once players have selected their class, abilities, and portrait, the players select the boss they will face at the end of the game. There are two bosses in the base game, along with eight abilities for the bosses to possess. This allows for a total of 48 unique bosses that the players can encounter at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Once set-up has completed, our heroes embark on their adventure through the dungeon. <br/>  <br/>A turn is divided into two phases. The first phase is the exploration phase during this phase each hero has 3 exploration actions that they can take. These include things such as moving into a new tile,  scrounging rooms for treasure, equipping items and resting to name a few. After each hero has taken their three exploration actions it is now time for the encounter phase. Random targeting determines where the encounter(s) will be taking place, the hero(es) that have been assigned an encounter will roll the encounter die to determine what they will have to contend with, be it monsters, events or nothing at all. During the encounter phase each hero is allowed one action and the encounter phase does not end until all monsters have been defeated. After the monsters have been dealt with the heroes gain experience and divvy up the treasure.  The &quot;Player One&quot; marker is moved all heroes move their special ability dice closer to the ready and the new player one starts the turn with their three exploration actions.<br/><br/>The dungeon and all things in it, including the boss, are designed to scale based on the number of heroes playing and the highest level hero in the dungeon. As heroes level up they gain additional attack or agility dice and their special abilities require less of a cool down between uses.<br/><br/>The base game includes 26 hex tiles, which the heroes reveal as they explore the dungeon. The boss fight is triggered by the random pull of one of these tiles that is labeled &quot;BOSS FIGHT!!!&quot; when this tile is entered all heroes teleport to the tile to do battle with the boss. STbCFX:AX is a co-op game at its core but does allow for a competitive element tied to the value of the treasure that the heroes collect while exploring the dungeon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Intrigo the players are pirates on a pirate ship. Half of the ship's crew is loyal to the captain, but the other half is plotting to kill the captain and take control of the ship. Who will come out of this struggle victoriously?<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player will receive a card. On this card is a unique role and a team indication (either red or blue). Many of the roles have some sort of special power. Players do not show their role card to others. Only one player will reveal his role immediately: this is the player which has the captain role (and who is on the blue team).<br/> The blue team wins if they succeed in killing all of the players in the red team. The red team wins if they succeed in killing the captain. However, as long as the blue player with the bodyguard role is alive, the captain cannot be killed by red players.<br/><br/>The game plays in night and day phases, just like in Werewolf. In the first night, the captain and bodyguard will get to know each other. Also, the players on the red team will get to know each other, but only partially: one player on the red team is the team leader. This player will open his eyes (&quot;wake up&quot;) and will make eye contact with other red players one-by-one. This means that the red team leader knows who all of the red players are, but all the other red players will only know the red team leader but none of the other team mates.<br/><br/>In the game, players are eliminated at night by roles that become active then (usually red players). Players are also eliminated by day, as at the end of each day usually one player will be nominated to &quot;walk the plank&quot; (and will thus be eliminated). The captain can never be nominated to walk the plank. There are various player roles which can perform special night and day actions. These actions include finding out more about other players, kill them, or protect them.<br/><br/>What sets this game apart from Werewolf is that most of the night actions require the player performing them to actually touch the player to which it is directed. This not only makes it harder to kill players further away from you, it also increases chances that some kind of noise or movement will be felt by the other players (which have their eyes closed during the nights). This in turn gives players during the day 'evidence' to accuse other players of being on the red team, and thus a good candidate to 'walk the plank'!<br/><br/>Intrigo shares game mechanisms with Werewolf (e.g., two teams that battle for victory, day/night phases, hidden roles with special powers) and BANG! (hidden roles and only one role is known to all players).<br/><br/>The game is language-dependent: the texts on the cards are in the Dutch language, and currently there is only a Dutch rule set available.<br/><br/>",

The last star warrior standing rules the Parax System.<br/><br/>The Amega Weapon is played on a game board that is created by placing 4 different boards together in any way, shape, or fashion that you choose with over 30,000 possible game board variations.  The boards are the beautiful artwork of Greg Winters, illustrator of Star Wars featuring 12 planets, 6 star bases, novae, and asteroids.  Greg also created our fantastic box cover.<br/><br/>The Amega Weapon showcases 7 custom designed pewter playing pieces that we spin cast ourselves. Additional components include: top notch quality Mission Profile cards, Deep Space cards, Asteroid cards, and 6 denominations of money along with two 6-sided dice, a 10-sided die, and a 20-sided die.<br/><br/>Players can elect to play one-on-one, team play, or a regular game.  The game is player tested for ages 12 and up with a special kid's game for ages 6 and up that does not interfere with the normal game.<br/>The questions you have to ask yourself are: Can you obtain The Amega Weapon?  Can you obliterate your opponents?  Will you survive the Black Star?  Do you even think you stand a chance?  Got control???  Think again, lol!!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reclaim Oz is a nontraditional deck building strategy game that takes places in a Dystopian Oz overruled by Four Witches. Reclaim Oz is unlike other deckbuilding games because of the combination of PvP elements and a limitation to the size of each players deck. It is a unique tabletop experience that has the play differently than any other games in the same genre.<br/> If you didn&rsquo;t know already, the game takes place in the Wonderful Land of Oz, but at a time when it wasn&rsquo;t so wonderful. All the great Legends of Oz have disappeared, and four Witches from the Silver Islands. While L. Frank Baum may have written a much happier world, this is still the same place, with all the characters and places you know in love&mdash;but in a time of great terror. The game consists of animals, beasts, and mythos&mdash;it is your task to get the World back to the way it once was, with the characters you know and love. If you are able to compile the best deck filling each of the four categories (HEART, COURAGE, BRAIN, HOME), you win!<br/><br/>The one thing that makes this card game different than a traditional deck building game is the lack of currency and ability to purchase cards. The cards are given to you each turn, Cards are marked with symbols letting you know how they are used in the game, the symbols include: Heart, Courage, Brain, Home, and Wicked. All of these cards are used in different ways. *All Card Designs Are Subject to Change&quot;. Throughout the Game you must build your Deck via placing it on the Game Board, once an item is placed--it&rsquo;s there until the game ends.<br/><br/>The game ends when all four witches have been played, Witches can not be discarded but played into their discard pile that will affect one or all players in the game. To play a Witch Card place the character face up on the table and explain the action that must take place, some witches have you attack single players while others affect everyone in the game. The Witch Cards play a pivotal role in the gameplay and can only be diverted if a Defense Card in Hand is playable and not vaulted. All Witch Cards caused whichever players/cards affected to be Trashed and will no longer be used in gameplay.<br/><br/>Once the game ends and the cards on the Game Board are tallied, the winner has the most Road Points in their Vaulted Deck is the winner. In the result of a tie the player with the highest Road Point Legend is the Winner.<br/><br/>",
