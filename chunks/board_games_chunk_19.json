This might be easy to do, except that the ships are composed of two separate parts: the motor and the rest of the ship, with the latter part tending to turn in every direction except the way you want to go, but since you must move the ship by pushing on the motor with only one finger, sometimes you can't help traveling in directions unintended.<br/><br/>Players take turns via a chronometer/egg timer, and the first player to reach the end of the track wins!<br/><br/>",

The stones measure 2 x 3 x 4 squares and can be placed in any of the three alignments (i.e. covering 2 x 3, 3 x 4 or 2 x 4 squares). After the first stone is placed, subsequent stones must touch at least one previously placed stone - but cannot touch a stone with the same alignment (unless the player is able to score with the new stone). When the board is so full that no further stone can be placed, the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>The rules offer a variant scoring system for three or four players, in which not only the active player scores, but also the player preceeding him/her.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the Decision Games' website:)<br/><br/>By February 1943, much of the inexperienced US II Corps had been deployed along the trails leading through a small canyon known as Kasserine Pass. The US commander, Gen. Lloyd Fredendall, had overextended his lead units, dividing them into individual, unsupported packets while disregarded his flanks. Rommel was quick to recognize the opportunity to inflict a defeat on the untested Americans, and he soon mounted an offensive with two panzer divisions.<br/><br/>Kasserine utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From artillery to dive bombers, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by mortars &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry regiment defending a ridge. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself advancing through a minefield. More support will be necessary to take the ridge, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Kasserine, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of the battles in North Africa. Units are typically two-sided formations that can suffer casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting at Kasserine Pass. Winning is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Intro to the 7th edition rules<br/>The first edition of our original ancient rules appeared in 1969, and their adopted for the British National Wargames Championships of that year. Despite competition from many would be rival sets, succeeding editions have been used in every important convention worldwide since then, and are used by an overwhelming majority of ancient wargamers. Their mechanisms have become a wargames standard used for every conceivable historical period, including some for which WE consider then unsuitable!<br/><br/>The seventh edition went to the printers in late 1985, and in the seven years since has almost completely taken over from previous editions. Feedback from play by several thousand customers has made it possible to provide free update sheets available in return for a stamped addressed envelope or international reply coupon. A few of the amendments blocked minor loopholes, most clarify meanings and some incorporate goal ideas for improvements suggested and justified by players. All such changes to date are incorporated into the text of this printing of the rule book as Version 7.5.<br/><br/>Seventh was a revolutionary, rather than evolutionary, change from previous editions. It places much more emphasis on realism, the problems of command, terrain and natural conditions, and seeks to distract players from excessive pre&mdash;occupation with weapon and amour differences important only if &ldquo;all things are equal&rdquo;. It is the function of the general to ensure that things are NEVER equal! We also take the view that a putative difference in weapon characteristics that cannot be shown to have influenced tactics in, or the result of, at least one historical battle is likely to be spurious. The tendency sung rule writers to show off their knowledge rather than produce the simplest realistic simulation is natural but unhelpful.<br/><br/>The unanimous conclusion of the users is that seventh is far more realistic than other sets and greatly widens the gap between good and poor tacticians. They applaud the end of the &quot;fire work display&rdquo; with units whizzing off in all directions without getting in each other&rsquo;s way the increased mobility out of and the reduced maneuverability in proximity to the enemy the need to take conditions, terrain and the chance of a surprise into account when planning, the way the fatigue rules force a proper use of reserves, the way rebased troops no longer fall over in the box, and not least, the discomfiture of rule lawyers.<br/><br/>Since its introduction, seventh has been used in the great majority of tournaments around the world, and even passed the fearsome test of the Milton Keynes 36 hour sleepless marathon event. Tournaments normally use the full rules with terrain choice, weather, unusual deployments and unreliable generals without these causing any difficulty or complaint of unfairness. A public demonstration game at Northern Militaire with one player per side each using 3,600 points of 25mm figures on a 6 foot x 4 foot table with plenty of terrain finished with a decisive win in something over two hours. This implies that increased realism has not been achieved at the cost of &ldquo;playability&rdquo;. Gums now play &lsquo;inch quicker.<br/><br/>The major difficulty faced by players transferring from the previous editions is one of imagination. It DOES help to plan as if you wore commanding a real army rather than trying to analyze the rules to deduce goal tactics. Cannon mistakes are to leave cavalry at the rear of a marching column instead of scouting in front, keeping the general safe instead of in a position to see, letting an unreliable general continue disobedience instead of correcting him, ignoring terrain difficulties when deploying, with consequent traffic jams when moving out, accepting waver tests instead of avoiding then like the plague, deploying front and rear lines too close so that they became entangled, and leaving front line units to become exhausted or be overwhelmed instead of reinforcing or withdrawing then in goal tine. Victory with seventh edition goes to the player who has best learned the skills of real historical generals, not he with most grasp of the minutiae of the rules.<br/><br/>Finally, although 7th is simpler than its predecessor and much simpler than its rivals, it is necessarily complex and needs large numbers of figures, a full sized table, and two or mare hours to play. For those occasions for which it will not suit, we recommend our other rule set for the period, the very successful &ldquo;De Bellis Antiquitatis&rdquo;. DBA allows much quicker games with far fewer figures on a 24&rdquo; square terrain, incorporates a campaign systen and army lists, and is especially suitable for beginners, the young, jaded elders, large multi-player gases and odd moments<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Award-winning cooperative boardgame that was published more than a decade before Knizia's The Lord of the Rings, Sauerbaum is a dice-based movement game. The board depicts a tree filled with a square grid of movement spaces, which are gradually filled from the top with tokens representing acid rain. The players' pawns try to move through the remaining open spaces on the tree, ending their movements on a raindrop, &quot;flicking&quot; it off. Thus, it's a race between the accumulating raindrops and the players' collective ability to flick them off with clever movement plays.<br/><br/>The rules encourage the players to discuss the options openly for each player's turn, and in fact they'll have their hands full defeating the acid rain together. Doing it alone is practically doomed to failure, and will cripple the other players, too. The level of difficulty is easily adjusted by varying the number of acid raindrops that fall onto the tree.<br/><br/>",

Spectators have gathered for the spectacle. Both sides are in for a shock as this will be the first major battle in a war that will last another four years and consume 600,000 lives.<br/><br/>Now for the 150th anniversary of the battle, Worthington Games brings you, First Bull Run: 150th Anniversary Edition. Players will take control of either the Confederate and Union armies, blue and gray wooden blocks with labels, on a mounted 22&quot; x 17&quot; map of the Manassas area, cards, and rules. The game will come with a certificate stating that it is a copy of 525 limited edition.<br/><br/>First Bull Run: 150th Anniversary Edition lasts nine turns, with each player receiving 8-14 cards per turn from an individual deck of 20 cards. Each turn is divided into a number of rounds, with players alternating rounds until both pass or both run out of cards; during a round, a player can play 0-5 cards, using each card for its movement point value or its action. After playing one or more cards in a round, the active player can attack a defender's units with adjacent, facing units. Each unit may move/attack or be attacked only once per round.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players score victory points for the opposing units they've eliminated as well as the victory point locations they occupy. Whoever scores more points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players can freely converse and make any claims at any time during the game.<br/><br/>On your turn, you need to take different actions using the cards or characters in your hand to find potential allies or defeat potential enemies during the game.<br/><br/>The goal of each round of the game is to have only one faction remaining in control of the battlefield. Please note that factions are not static or fixed. With the Dual Faction card system, players may change their own or another Faction. This is absolutely a chaotic yet compelling faction game.<br/><br/>Challenge your social skills and strategic thinking (or maybe your luck), and become a legend in the Kingdom of Catrolia!<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>1. Players take turns performing Appearance &rarr;Plan &rarr;Declare &rarr;Rest on their turn via cards.<br/><br/>2. A Faction being revealed does not directly cause a player to lose the game or suffer apparent losses. A player's faction has the opportunity to change during the game, and the player needs to adjust strategies according to the current situation and their own interests to find the most advantageous faction. Yesterday's enemy may become today's ally.<br/><br/>3. Attacking other players can cause direct damage and narrow the base number of players for <br/>Faction Fudgment, but Faction Cards can produce more effective results.<br/><br/>4. Players only need to answer truthfully when showing faction markers and determining if the game continues. Players can engage in negotiations or bluffs with other players during the process.<br/><br/>5. The game has a considerable strategy, and players should carefully consider the consequences of each decision.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Back Cover Blurb<br/><br/>The decline of the Koranelan Empire led to numerous confrontations between neighboring star systems for the domination of their sectors. Lead your fleets in battle to conquer the universe.<br/><br/>Space Empires is an intriguing multiplayer game of interstellar conflict. The special weapons and abilities of the contending races give this game a unique flavor.<br/><br/>Rulebook Excerpts<br/><br/>The conflict begins as players build armadas of Starships to conquer worlds. The player's purpose in Space Empires is the imposition of his form of government on other alien races and to gather new allies in the conquest of the known universe...<br/><br/>A player wins the game by controlling seven or more races for two consecutive victory phases . . . Alternatively, the players may agree on a time limit, the player at the end of the game with the most races wins, with ties being resolved in favor of the player with the highest production point total . . . Any other result is a draw.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>A relatively simple hex-and-counter game of space conquest in a galactic zone populated by twelve alien races. Players seek to expand their control over the star systems scattered across the map. This increases the player's production capabilities which allows more starships to be built.<br/><br/>The interesting twist, sort of a Cosmic Encounters &quot;lite,&quot; is that each alien race has a special ability. When a player conquers the home world of an alien race, the player can then start building starships for that race. The special powers of the alien starships include the paralyzing ray of the Amoebas, the Gort repulsion field generator, Parasite energy absorption, and the cloaking device of the Slinkers.<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s so much to say. And so much we know will be left unsaid.<br/><br/>I Guess This Is It is a two-player game about saying goodbye. Players take the role of two people once strongly connected standing before each other in the final minutes before their last goodbye. They will work together to try and say as much as they can before leaving, but being careful not to hurt each other's feelings.<br/><br/>The mechanics aim to emulate the emotions of the moment, in which there's so much you want to say before they go, but you also don't want to make the other person feel guilty or neglected. You know time won't be enough and there will be things left unsaid. How do you make the most of this last instant together?<br/><br/>When no story cards remain, it's time to say goodbye. There's no more time for stories. The person leaving says the words on the Goodbye card, then gets up and leaves. After a short break, get back together. Reveal the cards left on your hands. Those are the things left unsaid. Look at them together one by one, and silently reflect on their meaning, on how you wish you had just a little more time together. If you both had the same amount of cards in your hands, you at least feel you were on the same page, and your final conversation was in sync, like the good old days.<br/><br/>",

His lands are declining and people cannot have dreams anymore. You will try to fix it and take the creation of dreams upon yourselves. Using the Dream Pendulums you are going to take an exciting adventure to reverse the situation. Be ready to wind up your brain and show your courage, because it is not a simple task to create a Real Dream!<br/><br/>In Somnicum, with a help of Dream Pendulums and Magical Sand, you will concatenate smaller dream pieces into one Real Dream. The players will connect Dream cards of 3 different Themes with multiple Dream Particles (images) on them. The deeper in your Dream you place your Dream cards, the more victory points you will get for them. But be careful placing Nightmares into your Dream! These tricky cards may look appealing, while they have so many different Dream Particles on them, but at the same time they will inevitably make you lose your Victory Points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game comprises 3 rounds with an undefined amount of turns. Each turn you will move one of 2 Dream Pendulums around the circle of Dream cards of 3 different Themes picking up (gaining or spending Magical Sand tokens) and adding them to your Dream. You will need to combine them wisely to prevent your Dream from Breaking. Some of Dream cards will allow you to get special Discovery cards, which in their turn will bring you help of magic creatures and mighty artifacts. The game ends after the 3rd round with a final scoring. The player with the most stars (Victory Points) on their cards wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is the original version of the game of Tripoley.<br/><br/>All cards are dealt out, except one which determines the &quot;pay suit&quot;. Each hand has three stages. In the first players collect the pot from some compartments for the appropriate cards or card combinations. The second stage is similar to Poker with a smaller variety of valuable combinations: players bet on who has the best set of cards of the same rank. The third stage is played like the game of Stops (known under a variety of names like Newmarket and Michigan), where the cards have to be played in suit and sequence, the winner being the first player to run out of cards.

        "description": "Filled with magic and mystery, Germany&rsquo;s Black Forest is a place of legend serving as the backdrop for the classic tales we&rsquo;ve all come to adore. Darkness and danger lurk around every corner, but those who dare to enter the forest and face challenging encounters with creativity and cunning will come out on the other side enriched for having taken the journey...into the Black Forest!<br/><br/>The game takes places over 2-3 rounds (depending on the number of players) with each round consisting of three &quot;encounters&quot; or hands. In the game, each player uses their own deck of cards numbered 1-12 that depicts four creatures that will help them journey through the forest: frogs (#1-3), squirrels (#4-6), lynx (#7-9), and owls (#10-12). In addition to the creatures on the cards, each deck has a unique distribution of four suits of magical items: wands, potions, spell books, and swords.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, players draw six cards from their personal deck and reveal three cards from the central encounter deck. The encounter cards direct the play of each hand and provide a glimpse of what challenges lie ahead for future encounters. Players take turns playing a card to an open slot around the outside of the encounter cards with each side scoring in a different way once the encounter card is surrounded. At the bottom, the low card beats the high card, taking the value of the high card for points. To the left side, the card played scores its value only if its suit matches one of the cards played above. On the top, the high card beats the low card, taking the value of the low card for points. And on the right side of the card, players may each play one card face down, hoping to meet the unique win condition for the card or to bluff or sluff to throw off the other adventurer and buy themselves extra time. After playing three hands, new encounters are revealed, then players choose from their remaining cards and newly drawn cards to prepare for the next round.<br/><br/>Into the Black Forest is a new classic card game that provides a challenging puzzle of hand management, planning, and tactical decisions. Fans of trick-taking, area control, and light bluffing will love taking a journey into the Black Forest!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The conjectured departure from the historic timeline that resulted in this alternative history wargame is assumed to have taken place in mid-September 1939. At that time, as his forces are completing the conquest of Poland, Hitler receives a flash of intuition. That is, he can&rsquo;t help but notice the strategic paralysis of the Anglo-French, who do nothing to try to prevent the downfall of their fast-disappearing eastern ally Poland. From that he concludes it would be a waste of time to redeploy the Wehrmacht to the western front in 1940. He tells his generals: &ldquo;The time will never be better to destroy the Bolshevik power than in the coming year. We will continue to have nothing to fear in the west. The British and French simply do not want war; they are afraid of it. Once we&rsquo;ve taken Moscow, we&rsquo;ll take Paris and London by telephone.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Accordingly, he also tells his foreign minister to drop all negotiations aimed at revising the original territorial split set out in the accords with the USSR the previous month. Most importantly, Lithuania, originally in the German &ldquo;sphere of interest,&rdquo; is not traded for a further slice of Polish territory.<br/><br/>All of which has resulted in this low-complexity, strategic-level, alternative history wargame. In it, two to four players can investigate the possibilities inherent in a changed German strategy for 1940. The West Front map is scaled at 16 miles per hexagon. The Eastern Front map is scaled at 25 miles per hex. All Soviet units are armies; all other forces in the game are corps. Each game turn on both maps equals half a month.<br/><br/>This game can be played by two, three or four. If two play, one commands the Germans, while the other commands both the Anglo-French and Soviets. If played by three, one player commands the Germans, one player commands the Anglo-French, and the third commands the Soviets. If four play, one player commands the Germans on the west map; the second commands the Germans on the east map; the third commands the Soviets, and the fourth commands the Anglo-French. The rules contain some 17,000 words, which means experienced players can finish it in about four hours.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: neutrals, fog of war, airpower, 7th Flieger Corps, Soviet 1st Shock Army, fortifications, and more. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/><br/>     German Player Turn<br/>          A. German Airpower &amp; Strategic Transfer Phase<br/>          B.

        "description": "Have you ever looked up in the sky at all the stars, at the marvel of the Universe and felt a curious nerve inside wanting to travel to these stars, see the planets, and maybe find life? Expedition Zetta includes 3D-models of spaceships, gorgeous art, and a modular game system. In this game for 1-5 players, you and your fellow travelers each represent a country in a maiden voyage of the first starship to ever use a newly developed warp drive. The goal is to brave the unknown and collect discoveries in four different star systems. Though you may have to cooperate, one player will bring special fame and fortune to their home country. Will it be you?<br/><br/>In Expedition Zetta, you start the game by recruiting 1-4 crew members, then you will:<br/><br/><br/>    Discover strange planetary systems, randomly generated each game based on the latest scientific data<br/>    Find exotic new substances never before seen<br/>    Develop exo-products that can advance human technology<br/>    Gain new knowledge<br/>    Encounter new forms of life or ruins and settlements of vanished, ancient alien civilizations with their promise of both danger and discovery<br/>    Perhaps encounter another star-faring civilization whose members might even become part of your crew, making it not only international but interstellar<br/>    See crew interactions that can lead to romance or intrigue, which can either help or hinder you<br/><br/><br/>Every game plays differently! Each game includes four planetary systems. After warping together to a distant star, you travel with your crew individually between planets, searching for life and substances or trying to construct exo-products. If the life you find is intelligent, you may even interact with it. The discoveries are your main source of Fame.<br/><br/>The revolutionary Zetta Planetary System Generator, used in the advanced game, can generate as many different star systems in the game as there are in the known universe, each with its own unique characteristics and its own name. Thus, no two voyages to the stars will ever be the same! During the warp stage in the advanced game, you interact with the other players' crew members to gain advantages. Romance or intrigue may occur, with varying effects.<br/><br/>Apart from the gameplay experience, a journey with Expedition Zetta will give you knowledge about stars and planets, along with memories of when you for instance managed to extract gems from a gaseous giant in a triple star system, from when you found life in a lenticular galaxy or when you managed to produce time crystals near a super-hot supergiant O-star.<br/><br/>Expedition Zetta has a basic version that is great for the whole family.<br/><br/>    Want a quick game? Use the Quick rules!<br/>    Want to add special adventures and encounters to your mission? Play adding one or several of the specialized rule modules!<br/>    Want to play solo? There are two different solitaire variants.<br/>    Playing for the first time? Use the play-and-learn tutorial.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pond is a combinatorial abstract game similar to Tak and Go. Players place, move, and transform pieces on a square grid to create connected lines of matching symbols. Pieces are removed from the board and scored when matches are made.<br/><br/>Each piece is three-sided, and when transformed, pieces always advance through the three faces in the same order: Egg to Tadpole to Frog to Egg. Each face has unique movement rules. Because pieces can't transform in the backwards direction, players are never able to simply reverse their opponent's previous transformation.<br/><br/>One player uses light pieces, and the other dark. When matching pieces are removed from the board, each player scores their own pieces from the set, regardless of which player created the set. The ability to score for yourself and your opponent creates asymmetrical incentives in otherwise symmetrical board states.<br/><br/>Pond takes 2 minutes to learn and about 10 minutes to play. It can be played in the 4x4 &quot;small&quot; (小) pond for a shorter game with tight quarters, or in the 5x5 &quot;big&quot; (大) pond for a longer, more open game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Damned Die Hard, the second game in The Glory Series, is a detailed, operational-level game depicting the conflict between Japanese and Allied forces in and around the Philippine Islands from December 1941 to May 1942.<br/>The game is designed for two players (but can easily accommodate additional players - a side might have separate air, naval, and ground commanders and/or multiple ground commanders, for example). The Allied player controls the US Army Forces Far East command and the US Asiatic Fleet. The Japanese player controls the IJA's 14th and 16th Armies and the IJN's 3rd Fleet. The Allied player must disrupt the Japanese advance, inflicting unacceptable losses on his opponent and denying him use of the Philippine ports and airbases for as long as possible. The Japanese player must quickly overrun the Philippines, allowing his forces to be redeployed for the campaigns to come in the Netherlands East Indies and The Solomons/New Guinea. Both players maneuver their ground, air, and naval forces and conduct combat in an attempt to achieve these goals.<br/>There are five scenarios in the game. These are:<br/><br/>    Luzon is an introductory scenario designed to familiarize players with the core ground and air rules. No naval units or naval rules are used and the scenario is only 4 turns long. Play begins with the main Japanese invasion force already ashore on Luzon Island.<br/>    Invasion of the Philippines recreates the historical campaign for the Philippines.<br/>    The Philippines Reinforced explores how a somewhat reinforced Philippines garrison - based on accelerating scheduled US arms deliveries by about 1-2 months - would stand up to the Japanese assault.<br/>    The Philippines Fully Prepared posits acceleration of scheduled US arms deliveries by about 6 months, allowing for a nearly full-strength Philippine Commonwealth army to meet the Japanese attack.<br/><br/><br/>Bataan models the campaign for the Bataan peninsula and Corregidor Island using a special map at a scale of 1.6 miles to the hex and with play focused at the battalion rather than regimental level.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    One rule booklet<br/>    Two orders of battle booklets - the Japanese Order of Battle and the Allied Order of Battle.<br/>    Nine The Glory Series mapsheets (G7:NE, G7:NW, G7:SE, G7:SW, G8:NE, G8:NW, G8:SE, G8:SW, and G9).<br/>    Three counter sheets (G-9, G-10, and Europa universal marker sheet).<br/>    A set of ten charts for the play of the game<br/>    two dice<br/><br/><br/>",

Players control 3 ships and are racing to pick up cargoes from asteroids and return them to earth. Each ship has a speed from 0 to 5 must change speed by one unit each turn. The moon orbits the earth, and is a constant hazard. Attacks are permitted and send the loser out of control. Landing is a fine art of judging speed.<br/><br/>Deadly Planet. 2-4 players. Each player has a team of astronauts stranded on a hostile planet and they have to reach specific pick-up point. Dangerous beasts roam the planet, some of which can be ridden; others exist only to attack astronauts.<br/><br/>Invasion Earth. 2 players. The Ganoids are invading Earth's seas. The earth player using orbital missile satellites, submarine and surface fleets must track down and destroy the Ganoids spawning craft. It is a game of careful placement as the Ganoid player tries to over-extend the Earth player's resources.<br/><br/>Galactic War. 2 players. The Krul vs the Stellar Federation. Players expand across the map capturing planets to increase their technology rating and dodging the randomly moving anti-matter cloud. Combat and conquest depends on the number of ships in the fleet. As only one ship can occupy each space, long snaking fleets stretch across the board. Some of the ships are annihilators - suicide bombers that destroy all neighboring ships. Ship types are kept secret from your opponent.<br/><br/>",

In the game you have a 3x3 grid of number cards and around it you have face cards. The face cards are called royals and the goal of the game is to assassinate all 12 of them. If you manage to do this you win the game. Number cards may only be played on matching or lower numbers. In order to kill a royal, you place a card opposite him/her - which means you have lit the charge on a cannon - and you use the two cards between the trigger and the royal, the &quot;payload&quot;, to do that much damage. Payloads can include any suits when attacking jacks, but must match the color of any queens attacked and the suit of attacked kings. Aces and jokers provide you with special actions.<br/><br/>",

(In the original version of the game, these objects were cards; in newer versions, they're castle towers that stick together magnetically.)<br/><br/>Each player receives one color and one number, keeping these values secret since they form that player's combination. Play starts with one player asking the player to the left if they have a certain color and number. If they have either of those values, they say &quot;yes&quot; and they become the next player; otherwise they say &quot;no&quot; and the question passes to the next player to the left to answer.<br/><br/>When a player thinks they know an opponent's combination, on their turn they can name that player's color and number. If the guess is correct, that opponent is out of the game and the player gets another turn &mdash; but if they're wrong, they are out of the game instead and the wrongly accused opponent now has the next turn.<br/><br/>As far as the rules go, that's it! How much do you talk to your opponents? Do you keep quiet or suggest questions for them to ask? Do you remind them who answered what, and if you do, did you remember correctly?! Are you spinning disinformation?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First Blood: Second Marne, 15 July 1918, is a two-player wargame of low-to-intermediate complexity that simulates the final day on World War I's western front during which it was the Germans who held the strategic initiative. After that day, the German high command, though they didn't yet understand they were soon to be fully and finally defeated, knew an offensive solution to the war was no longer available to them. The German player is generally on the offensive, trying to cross the Marne River and exit units southward off the map through the Surmelin valley.<br/><br/>The first game turn of FB represents roughly the first two hours of operations after the Germans began crossing the Marne. Those operations were conducted in the slowing conditions of early morning darkness. Every game turn after the first represents from 15 to about 45 minutes, depending on the intensity of tactical action that takes place within each turn as the daylight battle unfolds.<br/><br/>On the US side the units of maneuver are infantry platoons, along with static heavy weapons emplacements. The latter represent one or two dug-in and pre-sited heavy machineguns and/or 37 mm guns (&quot;one pounders&quot;).<br/><br/>The German units are organized so as to be reflective of the chaos created among them by the intense US aerial and heavy artillery bombardment that was conducted against their north bank marshalling areas and bridges. That is, German units represent ad hoc, mixed, tactical formations (primarily storm trooper infantry), ranging in size from sections and squads up to almost full companies, which the Germans self-organized as they left the complete chaos of the riverbank and moved into the semi-chaos of the actual battlefield. Each hexagon on the map represents 100 yards from side to opposite side.<br/><br/>The reverse sides of all the units in the game show carnage. That is, they present a depiction of the human wreckage remaining when units of these small sizes are eliminated in combat. Whenever a unit suffers that fate, players simply turn it over in place, so its carnage side thereafter shows upward within the hex of its elimination. When flipped to their carnage sides, units permanently cease to be &quot;units&quot; for all game purposes, thereafter serving only as reminders of the recent horror that took place in that location.<br/><br/>Carnage markers have no combat effects or stacking values, nor does their presence in a hex generate any extra movement cost for living units as they enter and/or pass through the killing field. Alternatively, if your tastes don't run to an appreciation of carnage, you may choose to ignore the reverse sides of the units and simply remove each unit to a traditional, off-map, &quot;dead pile&quot; as they suffer elimination.<br/><br/>",

One after the other, players turn over a tile, taking care that the letter revealed can be seen by all players at the same time. With no waiting as others ponder their moves, as soon as you spot a word that can be made from some or all of the up-turned letters, you may call out that word, pick up the tiles required to spell the word, and arrange the tiles to display the word in front of yourself.<br/><br/>If you or any player can make an anagram of an entire word belonging to any other player (including yourself), or can make a new word by adding extra letters (from the central pile) to an existing word, you shout out this new word (at any stage in the game) and claim the necessary letters to spell the word. Regardless of how many words you manage to make or steal during the game, you will only score points for those that remain in your possession at the end of play.<br/><br/>Devised and published by Oxford Games in 1991, and loosely based on the Victorian game of Word Making, Word Taking, Anagram is, without doubt, the word game enthusiast&rsquo;s favourite game.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Anagram is a game for quick and steady thinkers&hellip; This is a cracking little game.&rsquo;  The Play Cabinet<br/><br/>&lsquo;We have a set of Anagram that has travelled the world with us and everyone who tries it loves it&hellip; Highly recommended.&rsquo; Rivendell<br/><br/>Product Contents<br/>90x Letter tiles<br/>1x Rules leaflet<br/><br/>",

To win you must get in your hand treasures of the same kind (being 3, 4 or 5), but your hand is limited to a maximum of 5 cards and the more treasure you get the less actions you can take, as treasure cannot be played. <br/>During your turn you can either play cards, trying to get the right treasure, or hide cards on the table, where you can retrieve them later. But no place is safe, as another player can steal cards from your hand or take cards from the table. Throughout the game more treasures come into play increasing the probability of completing a set.<br/><br/>",

Your hand consists of nightmarish aspects and you goal is to trade these with your friends. If someone can get a collection of similar aspects then they can master that part of the nightmare and contribute to your eventual escape - however each card that you receive in trade can force you to undertake certain actions, restrict who you trade with or limit how you can communicate. To make matters worse something is chasing you through the nightmare and you have to trade its card every ten seconds or be devoured. It's coming. Run.<br/><br/>During set-up players choose a collection of nightmare types based on the number of players. This choice allows a group to include or exclude certain mechanics - so whether your nightmare will be an all singing all dancing nightmare is down to the exuberance of the players rather than luck of the draw.<br/><br/>Escape the Nightmare is a challenging experience, with the average group losing a fair few games before their first victory. However the play time is quick and resetting for another go takes seconds. There are six difficulty levels to make the game accessible for groups of any level of skill and selecting different types of nightmare allows players to set the tone of their game to suit their preferences.<br/><br/>",

It was fun!<br/>Can you imagine playing complex strategy games with simple wooden blocks? Blocks is proof. A set of 40 beautiful wooden blocks in two colors is all you need. And the blocks have it all: their special size is the building block for two exiting games. A haptic and tactical pleasure!<br/><br/>Kwinty - The Wall<br/><br/>The players are building together a wall between them. It is all about the visible sides of the blocks. Each block side corresponds to two equal-sized squares and exactly that is what counts! The aim of the game is to arrange the blocks in a series of five &quot;squares&quot; of the same color (horizontally, vertically or diagonally), while at the same time to block your opponent from doing the same. Sounds easy, but it is not - as always when two players want the same thing.<br/><br/>Turris - The Tower<br/><br/>Brick by brick the tower grows in height between the players creating on its four sides a patchwork of light and dark blocks. <br/>The players try to create concatenations of the sides of their blocks to the largest possible contiguous areas and at the same time to cut the opponent's surfaces. But be careful: each side of the tower is considered separately and individually evaluated at the end. The better the blocks are set, the more points you will earn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1st Alamein is my (Lou Coatney's) 1997-designed free, print-and-play 2-player game about the opening battle for Alamein, in July 1942, which was Rommel's best chance to break through and take naval base Alexandria, Cairo, and the Suez.  It is the first part of my Battles for Alamein game set, and it is an ideal introductory game for the hex-and-counter game format.<br/><br/>It uses archaic (but surprisingly realistic) combat mechanics with &quot;active Zones of Control&quot; requiring combat - except of Allied units already in brigade boxes/fortifications - which can be taken and eliminated.<br/><br/>The icons/figures on the pieces are by my older son Robert, who was also the playtester to the point of helping me design the game.  (We have played it hundreds of times together, even in video telephone conversations.)  Graphics guru Patrick Tremoureux has used those to produce professional quality map and units.<br/><br/>The scale of the game is: 1 day of real time per (10) game-turn(s), approximately 6 miles/10 kilometers per hexagonal space width, and brigade-to-division (8,000-15,000 men) unit scale, which amounts to 12 ground units on each side.  It takes a little over an hour to play.<br/><br/>",

Following the army build rules, each side can customize their force to suit their own strategy. They also control how the forces are deployed at the start of the game. The balancing factor is a victory point time limit and a growing defensive force. The attackers must move fast!<br/><br/>The 20&quot; X 30&quot; map depicts the United States and surrounding areas as it was around World War 2. Areas are broken up into Land Territories, City Zones, Nuclear Research Sites, and Naval Landing Zones. The Allies must defend their 20 major Cities from Axis occupation in order to continue fielding their defensive forces. However, they must also keep the enemy from capturing the 2 research facilities across the U.S. so atomic research can be harnessed and Victory Points earned. Axis forces are tasked with simultaneously cutting off Allied supplies and capturing nuclear technology for themselves to crush the last remaining opposition to Axis world domination. By attacking America from both sides at once, coordination and decisive action is a must!<br/><br/>AMERIKA also introduces veteran wargame players to a variety of new units like jet fighters and self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, while keeping each unit type&rsquo;s rules easy enough for beginners to master. With just 8 unit types in the game, purchasing and combat move fast and are resolved simply using a battle board. All 8 unit-types are unique to this game and cannot be found elsewhere.<br/><br/>",

Just be careful that you don't sink into a tarpit, get stomped by a Mammoth &mdash; or run right off the cliff yourself in the process. This &quot;Guts-style&quot; game has you trying to outthink your opponents and maneuver them into harm's way...until &quot;WHAMM!&quot;, one tribe emerges victorious.<br/><br/>Wooly Whammoth features identical eight-card hands, each card showing a number of spaces that must be moved &mdash; but it is the total number, adding all the cards played that hand, which determines just how far ALL the cave people will run. Some have modifiers to slow down or speed up your cave person alone - and quickly getting out of sync with the others is how you will survive and send them over the edge. Getting two spaces from the edge is how you will earn Mammoth Meat as the wooly beasts plunge to the valley below &mdash; and it take six Meat tokens to win. BUT to refill your hand, you must eat a Meat, in a lovely balancing act.<br/><br/>Your two-piece modular board becomes elongated after every successful hunt, changing the conditions and lengths individual players have to go to score a Mammoth.<br/><br/>Of course, the other way to win is to eliminate all four of your opponents' tribespeople by forcing them into tar pits, crushing them under CHARGING mammoths, or sending them flying over the cliff.

The game includes 280 die-cut counters, with the each warship chit representing two ships per counter; there are three primary ships types: Galleys, Galliots and Galleasses, each with different capabilities. The colorful map features the Ionian Sea, printed with the historical set up of both sides just as the two opposing fleets were arrayed to begin battle, as well as various charts and tables for easy reference during play. The land area featured represents the peninsular areas of the Grecian mainland.<br/><br/>The rules entail a variety of mechanics pertaining to 16th century naval combat, such as Wind Direction, Ramming, Boarding, Small-Arms Fire, Gunnery Ranges, Exhaustion, Galliot Shoreline Movement, Christian Small-Arms Advantages, Ottoman Maneuver Advantages, as well as the designations of the historical admirals in the battle, such as Don Juan, Ali Pasha, etc.<br/><br/>The easy and quick game sequence is as follows:<br/><br/>Movement<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>Reorientation<br/><br/>Movement is regulated in terms of the front and back side of each warship chit. As each ship completes its movement, it is flipped from its A (Alpha) side over to its O (Omega) side (or vice versa, if they began the turn on their Omega sides). When all desired moves have been completed, the player&rsquo;s remaining ships are also flipped to their O (Omega) side (or vice versa, if they began the turn on their Omega sides) to indicate the end of the entire Movement Phase. In this way, players may easily keep track of which ships have moved, and which have not, during each game turn.<br/><br/>Victory in the game is determined by the accumulation of VPs for eliminated and damaged ships that have been inflicted by each side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marathon and Granicus uses the tried and tested Battles of the Ancient World system which now has clocked up an impressive 17 different battle scenarios spread over 3 boxed sets and 2 magazine game issues.<br/><br/>The map is up to the usual high standard of S&amp;T and ancient battles standard. The bay, rises, 2 streams as well as the Persian camp are clearly shown, although the Persian camp hexes sit pretty on the map but appear to have no effect on the game at all - no vps for the Greeks passing through or occupying the hexes at all.<br/><br/>The functional counters show Persian footmen, cav and bowmen along with the Greek hoplites.<br/><br/>Standard rules are used with specific scenario rules being the Greek charge in turn one which triples their movement, thus all hoplite units are able to crash into the Persian ranks on turn one, if the Greek player feels the urge - and it is advisable, as another rule states, that the disorganized Persian cavalry cannot move and would defend at half strength up until turn 4.  Thus the Greek is encouraged to batter through some of the Persian foot and close with the cav before turn 4 if possible.<br/><br/>All in all, a fine simulation given the scope of the system rules. The Persians' only good chance is to resist the Greek hoplites with foot until turn 4 and then try and turn any Greek flank possible, by moving their cavalry away and around the Greeks and charging them in clear terrain - if the Greeks allow themselves to be exploited this way, of course.<br/><br/>",

The units in the game represent battalions (and sometimes regiments) (228 counters), and operate according to a chit-pull divisional-command activation system. Movement and combat are randomized by each division&rsquo;s potential activation, such that the general course of play goes a long way toward simulating the fog of war in a simple yet realistic manner and without the need for special rules.<br/> As a new addition to this system (not present in Sedan), to simulate the more pronounced effect of long-range anti-tank guns in desert terrain, units with AT capability are identified, and they&rsquo;re given the capability to engage enemy armor as it approach, just as the infamous 88s did at Hellfire Pass.<br/> Each hex represents four miles, and the map area portrays the Western Desert from around Tobruk to near the Libyan/Egyptian border.<br/><br/>",

Unknown to other racers, each player has a secret agenda as to where their racer is to finish (e.g. 1st in Stage 1, 3rd in Stage 2, 2nd in Stage 3).  If you accomplish your goals, you score points.<br/><br/>The board is made up of five straight lanes, each a sequence of rectangular areas, and each rectangular subdivision has four dots of the racer's path (ie, ten consecutive rectangles will require dice-rolls totaling 40 to advance through).  Players also have a hand of four cards which conveniently overlay these rectangles and which have differing numbers of dots (from 0 to 8).  On a player's turn, he or she may play one of these overlaying cards on the board so as to make any player's path longer or shorter.  Then the player rolls the dice and moves his racer.<br/><br/>In the &quot;advanced&quot; game, each player also has a hand of four action cards, some of which can be played on others and some of which can only be played on oneself.  These actions alter player's options (e.g. &quot;play no cards,&quot; &quot;move 10 spaces rather than rolling&quot;, etc).<br/><br/>",

Players take turns gathering groceries from the market and preparing recipes to satisfy the growing list of picky dinner guests. Each guest has specific food preferences. Based on this information, players will try to appease their guests as strategically as possible.<br/><br/>There are 5 rounds and each round consists of 5 steps: Reveal 1 new guest, deal 5 food cards to each player, fill the open market (2 cards x the number of players), take actions until all players have passed, then pass the first player marker to the next player clockwise.<br/><br/>During the action phase, players have 5 actions to choose from: Get 1 food card from the open market, prepare a recipe (which requires the player to have the recipe card and its corresponding ingredients in hand), play an item card, discard 2 cards in hand to draw 1 card from the face-down food deck, or pass.<br/><br/>At the end of the 5th round, whoever makes the most satisfying feast wins! Points are given for each recipe prepared and then modified based on the guests' preferences. The player with the most points wins. In the case of a tie, whoever started the game as a later player wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The Assassin is trying get enough Might (A card suit) to kill the King, while the King is looking to Accumulate Power(A Card Suit) to maintain control of his Kingdom. Everyone has their own unique win condition and some roles even have a role specific special operation.<br/><br/>During the game you'll be accumulating resources to achieve your win condition while  trying to keep your role secret. You will sabotage others, steal their cards, make trades, and ally with players. It's a simple game at it's core that is has an incredible level of layers that you uncover the more you play the game.<br/><br/>The design of this game was inspired by other great secret identity games like Secret Hitler and Coup. We wanted to create a game we could play regularly that inspired table talk, had many layers of game-play, and left you with those memorable win moments. It is fast paced in nature and because of rotating roles, no game is ever the same.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each driven by their own motives, they will have to navigate the streets of industrial revolution London, explore mysterious tombs and underground canals, and finally - make their way through the nine circles of Hell itself! During their journey they will face many foes, collect amazing loot, befriend powerful companions, and, of course - fight each other.<br/><br/>The hero that brings Queen Victoria to the Buckingam Palace will be the ultimate winner.

Well, whoever it may be - the winner can be only one!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fantasy skirmish wargame ruleset based on Song of Blades &amp; Heroes in which heroes, monsters, demigods, gods and units of mortals clash for dominance of the battlefield. Each player has 16 to 40 figures including a balance between gods, heroes and mortals. A point system makes games scalable, as large or small as time and available models allow.<br/><br/>Each player&rsquo;s force comprises a few units of mortals, a single god, and legends - an in-between tier of powerful, unique creatures like the monsters and heroes of lore. Legends are much stronger than mortals but not as powerful as the gods themselves. Gods are true immortals - if they are defeated they do not die. They come back as soon as enough mortals pray for them to reappear on the battlefield. The three tiers are interdependent. Gods lose power and actually cannot exist without the support of mortals. The strength of prayers, faith and oaths taken in the gods&rsquo; names is what keeps the gods going.<br/><br/>Gods are the real powerhouses and keep the mortals fighting - without them, mortals lose heart. Mortals fuel the gods&rsquo; powers through chanting and prayer. Legends lead and inspire mortals or terrorize them and turn them into mincemeat.<br/><br/>",

In round one players race to recreate the pattern shown on the card using your set of cubes, rotating the cubes in any way. In round two players roll all of the cubes on the table like dice and use as many cubes as possible to recreate the pattern shown on the card. Race to re-roll all remaining cubes to complete the pattern. In Round three players study the card, then race to see who can recreate the pattern from memory.

The invasion began January 22, 1944, under the code name Operation Shingle. It had the Alban Hills and the isolation of the German army as its objective. Failing in this, Allied troops would have to hold until relieved. Here Hitler recognized Germany's great chance to destroy an Allied invasion. Had his troops succeeded in destroying the beachhead, the war in Europe could well have been lengthened.<br/><br/>Anzio Beachhead is a two-player game in which one player controls the German forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 24 Hours<br/>Hex: .9 mile / 1.34 km<br/>Unit: Company/Battalion/Regiment/Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 17&quot; x 22&quot; Map<br/>One counter sheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8 page rule booklet<br/><br/>This first appeared in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #20 in December 1969, along with Bastogne. SPI later released it in white box and black formats during the 1970s. In 1990 it reappeared, with minor revision, in S&amp;T #134 (May/June 1990).<br/><br/>Per Jim Dunnigan:<br/><br/>&quot;AB was seen as another situation like the Bulge, where the attacker had a rapidly declining edge. The original American commander was not bold, and lost. So the idea with AB was to explore the what if's. At that time, I had been working on designing games for about eight years (since I first discovered the AH games.) Before that, I was always interested in the details of history, and how they were connected. AH wargames were the first time I saw someone else thinking the same way, and doing it in a novel way.  I was always building on that.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;I had been designing a similar game, called Italy, which incorporated the rest of the Italian theater, with a smaller scale map of the Anzio area (ie, two interrelated games, one strategic and the other operational). But when Dave's game came in I thought it did a better job of the Anzio section. We had come up with some of the same solutions, and his game  was more compact and suitable for the magazine.&quot;<br/><br/>(e-mails with Neopeius, 9/5-6/11)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Andy Hopwood's third game, this time round it's a push-your-luck racing game with a twist. The twist being, that instead of doing multiple laps, players race their cars to the end of the track and then turn around and race back to the starting line. So if you're the first to turn around, you can be sure that you'll have to weave around the cars still going in the other direction!<br/>And in ZOOM ZOOM KA-BOOM it's allowed to run into your opponents, thus making it harder for them to stay on track once it's their turn...<br/>So try and get ahead. And then try and stay ahead!<br/><br/>",

Each player is the captain of their own warship with the goal of eliminating all other players (or teams during Allegiance Play). Game play consists of a player issuing one Captain&rsquo;s Order each turn, generally allowing them to either gather additional Compass Points (the game currency) or spend Compass Points to attack their opponents.<br/><br/>Players support their Captain&rsquo;s Orders by declaring Crew. As a player&rsquo;s Crew Cards are kept hidden from others and bluffing is allowed, knowing when to bluff and when to call a bluff (by calling out Scalawag!) is an important element to successful play.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to create a line of four pieces in your own color or to prevent the other player from being able to move. The winner scores one point for each empty space for making a line or one point for stalemating the opponent. Individual rounds are brief, and several rounds are usually played in a series with the overall winner being the first to reach a pre-determined number of points (such as 100).<br/><br/>Neo-Delta is similar, except it is played on the 6x6 board, and either / both players may use the third color piece (placed by the first player on the first or second move) to form their line of four. Draws are possible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bourre (pronounced &quot;boo-ray&quot;) is a trick-taking card game similar to Spades. It is widely played in Louisiana, particularly within the Cajun culture and on the off-shore oil platforms near the Louisiana Gulf Coast.<br/><br/>Bourre uses a standard 52-card deck. Players ante up and are dealt a five card hand. They may then &quot;fold&quot; or continue, swapping out up to all five cards (in some variants they will re-ante to play a hand). The rules are fairly straightforward:<br/> (from Wikipedia entry):<br/>   1. You must play to win. This goes beyond simply &quot;playing a higher card&quot;; if you know that no one else has any trumps, and it is your turn to lead, you must play trumps if you have them.<br/>   2. You must play on-suit if possible, even if your highest on-suit card will not beat the highest card in play. Even if a trump has been played on a non-trump lead, if you have a card of the suit led, you must play on that suit.<br/>   3. You must play a trump if you have no on-suit cards. You still must play to win; if the only trump played is a 3, you hold the 2 and the Ace of trumps but no cards of the lead suit, you must play the Ace of trumps.<br/>   4. If you have neither any cards of the lead suit nor any trumps, you may play any card. This is an off card, and is effectively lower than the 2 of the lead suit.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the person with the most tricks, takes the pot. If there is a tie, the pot stays in for the next round. If one of the players who played a hand did not take any tricks at all, he is said to have &quot;bourreed&quot; and must match the pot as his ante for the next round. Needless to say, the pot can get quite large, especially with larger groups playing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fortune &amp; Famine is a strategy card game, set in medieval times of magic. You play as the ruler of a growing kingdom, attempting to store more grain in 12 rounds than opposing rulers. To do that, you will spend silver to bid against other rulers on worker cards which produce unique goods or services for your kingdom. You will need to balance your silver and grain economies, and take some risks. The primary risk-reward comes in the form of FAMINE cards, which show up with increasing regularity as the game progresses. You can store as much of your grain as you wish to safety for a single silver coin. This makes it economically beneficial to leave your grain growing as long as possible. But beware! When FAMINE strikes, you will lose half of it!<br/><br/>Variable player powers are built in with six rulers. Each ruler gives a unique power to their kingdom. Rulers can be distributed randomly at the start or chosen by each player for the cost of less starting silver.<br/><br/>If all else fails and you think an opposing ruler is running away with the game, you may be able to slow them with judiciously played evil wizard cards, although each wizard will cost a precious spot in your kingdom!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

While Farmer Wiggins was away on vacation, the rabbits got into the house where they kept the sports equipment, the art supplies, the cosplay costumes and the box of classic movies. The farmer arrived home to find the place overrun with all kinds of rabbits. He&rsquo;s calling upon you, the luckiest person he knows, for help to get these rabbits back into their rabbit hole where they belong. It&rsquo;s a big job. There are a LOT of rabbits to round up. Maybe even one too many---but if you hop to it, you can save the day.<br/><br/>One Two Many Rabbits is a fun, fast-paced, family friendly card and dice game that is easy to learn and takes about 10 to 20 minutes to play. The main rules are for 2-4 players, but also included are rules for a one player game so that people can try their hand at some solo play.<br/><br/>Each player starts off with a LOT of rabbits and will choose to roll one, two or three dice in order to create the numbers that will help them decide which rabbits will willingly go back into the rabbit hole. But, watch out, these rabbits are tricky and will use the turns of the people playing against you to find ways to hop back into your hands. As play continues and the number of rabbits in your hand start to dwindle, the more difficult it will be to roll the numbers that you need to get rid of all of your rabbits.<br/><br/>There are also special cards in the deck to help you along. Wild cards can be used as any number. Plus Minus cards can be used to add or subtract two of your number cards together. Piggyback cards allow you to use the roll of your opponent to get rid of some rabbits. And Place Your Rab-Bets cards allow you to take a wild guess on which number will be rolled next and try to get rid of some rabbits that way.<br/><br/>",

These items represent the ancestral geisha arts: find similar tiles to discover their secrets!When you reveal a pair of tiles with the same items, it means that you learned one of the nine arts of the geishas! Possessing tiles of your maiko&rsquo;s color increases  your points. Conversely, possessing tiles of other colors decreases your points. Indeed Maiko is a game of memory but also elegance!During your training, you can also get kamon tokens, marks of prestige, that let you call upon four tutors  to  help  you  on  your  quest.  Each  tutor  possesses  a  unique  talent  that  will  lead  the  brightest  maiko to the victory. The maiko with the most points wins and begins her geisha career.<br/><br/>",

In bidding to do research at the five particle accelerators, each scientist gets to take part in the thrill of discovery. Each player must balance pushing their own research forward whilst sabotaging opponents to make sure they do not make an astounding discovery. Fast and furious auctions ensure that the player who wants something the most actually gets it, though they may have to pay a dear price. Such is the nature of research!<br/><br/>Quirky Quarks is peppered with interesting facts about subatomic particles. (Who knew that bananas emitted positrons?!) So while you&rsquo;re waiting for your opponents to make a decision, you&rsquo;ll be entertained as you learn about the wonderful world of particle physics. Lighthearted, memorable illustrations make particles instantly recognizable and convey their nature. The game also features tremendous replayability - no two games will ever be identical, and players must determine which strategy best suits the cards that they&rsquo;re dealt as they vie for the Nobel prize!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Lots of dealers go to jail. In fact, there are 500 &quot;busted gringos&quot; sitting in Mexican jails right now.<br/><br/>Yes, dealing is a high risk / high gain situation.

When you record a new instrument by placing a card in your orchestra, you draw a beat pattern that you have to memorize, and then perform it correctly when used in one piece. If you perform all of the beat patterns in the correct order, you have successfully performed the piece and can collect the points. The player who reaches a specific number of points first wins.<br/><br/>As an addition there are special cards to do good things to you or bad things to your opponents. Moreover, you get the attendance of other famous conductors who have very special preferences about the next music piece you have to conduct. By fulfilling their needs you get additional points.<br/><br/>The game contains 48 cards with music pieces, 20 conductor cards, 72 instrument cards, 24 special cards, 48 wooden counters with 6 different beat patterns, 1 scoreboard, 4 player pieces, 1 conductor's baton and rules in English and German.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

This sun-baked fishing community has a rich history of independence, commerce, and competition.<br/> Every September, in order to determine the fishing rights for the following fishing season, the gozzi (typical Ligurian fishing boats) of the four districts of Burgu, Ciassa, M&agrave;ina and Portellu run a regatta along a path of 1,600 meters, on fractions of 400 meters between the bouys.<br/><br/>Not satisfied with this single form of competition, the merchant families of each district compete with each other to build tall red-brick towers as a display of their wealth.<br/><br/>Their edifices to success give the town of Noli its distinctive look, though no merchant tower can hope to match the proud castle atop Monte Ursino, whose constant vigilance and defensive walls protect Noli from the raids of the Saracens and the assaults of envious neighbouring towns!<br/><br/>Each game follows a series of rounds, in which players will secretly bid on four actions using coins. The player who bids highest in each action gains a bonus or gets one step closer to victory by building a floor of their tower.<br/><br/>Between each bidding session players frantically roll dice in real time to simulate the famous Regata-dei-Reoni. The winner of the race gets to fish at the best spots, drawing from the best deck of fish cards, whereas other players must draw from worse decks with less fish. These cards can also have events such as &quot;saracens attack!&quot; and &quot;Storm!&quot; which shake up the game and set players back.<br/><br/>If a player manages to build 6 tower floors, or have the most tower floors at the end of the game, they win!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Wizard King has selected you and your rivals to be his Heirs. He plans to teach you everything he knows and select the best of you to be the next king. Your training had just begun when a Black Wizard murdered the Wizard King to fuel an evil ritual. Unguided, you must complete your training to be able to stop the Black Wizard. You must stop the ritual, and do it quickly, because not only could the ritual destroy this way of life, someone less worthy might rise and take the throne before you.<br/><br/>In Heirs of the Wizard King, each color of Wizard uses a unique type of spell that you can choose to command or absorb. Commanding a wizard allows the player to use their spell one time. If absorbed, you can then permanently use a reduced version of that spell. This absorbed power starts small, but you can continue to invest in, and eventually master, that spell.<br/><br/>To defeat the Black Wizard, players forge Chains of Wizards by matching any combination of color/number. This task appears simple, but with each completed Chain, the difficulty increases as each Chain requires one additional card. The first player to reach the top of the score track defeats the Black Wizard and becomes the next Wizard King.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Ritual of the Black Wizard is not an idle threat. On every player's turn, the Black Wizard's Chain is dealt one card from the deck. If that weren't bad enough, whenever the Deck runs out of cards, the Black Wizard advances one spot on his score track. Unchecked, the Black Wizard would quickly overwhelm and destroy the players. Players must work together to stop the Black Wizard, but in the end only one can be crowned the next Wizard King.<br/><br/>What type of King will you be?<br/><br/>",

The old Alpha has died; guided by the law of Tooth and Claw, it's&nbsp;every wolf for themselves as you compete to&nbsp;be crowned the&nbsp;new&nbsp;Alpha of the Badlands. To gain the allegiance of the pack, players will lead and join dangerous hunts for scrap cards that will be&nbsp;used in battles for each other's&nbsp;loyalty tokens. The first wolf to capture enough loyalties for the allegiance&nbsp;of the pack will win the game.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>To lead a HUNT on your turn, you must risk a loyalty token you hold (other wolves may join in the hunt by doing the same). Once the hunting group is determined, the lead hunter draws a hunt card and resolves the outcome of the hunt by deciding how to allocate the SCRAPS among the hunting party. But beware! These hunts are dangerous depending on the animal you encounter and can end with stolen loyalties, lost scraps, and more!<br/><br/>SCRAPS are action cards that are collected and shared as the spoils of successful hunts. Instead of leading a hunt on your turn, you can attack another wolf with your scrap cards in order to capture one of their loyalty tokens; however, they can also defend themselves using their own scrap hand.<br/><br/>Capturing three of a player&rsquo;s five loyalty tokens will make them ALLEGIANT to you and unlock in-game benefits. The first player to hold the allegiance of two other wolves will win the game and be crowned Alpha of the Badland pack!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It was first printed as a magazine game in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #26.<br/><br/>SPI said: &quot;This game is unique in many ways. It uses a combat system in which the defensive value of a unit depends on the terrain the defender is in ... The game provides for true hidden movement for one player (the guerillas.) A wide selection of scenarios and Orders of Battle are provided.&quot;<br/><br/>In 1975 SPI released John Young's design Search &amp; Destroy, a heavily revised version of the Grunt game system. Search &amp; Destroy successfully fleshed out the concepts introduced in Grunt, and benefitted from the increases in design and graphics that SPI saw from the early to mid seventies.<br/><br/>",

While simple to learn and quick to complete, games are fun and competitive for all ages.<br/><br/>Players split into two teams and each player chooses a character.  Each character has a clear plastic playing card for a weapon.  Players use these weapons to attack simultaneously by throwing the cards at opposing characters.  Hitting a character with your weapon causes a hit, and damage is scored (1 for limbs, 2 for body or 3 damage for head shots).  If a player accumulates 7 or more damage, he/she is eliminated.  After attacking, each player moves one card length in any direction. <br/>Play repeats until only one team remains.  Last team standing, wins.<br/><br/>Each character in Rise of the Exiled has at least one ability to enhance their usefulness on the field of battle.  For example, one character can &quot;Blot our the Sky&quot; twice per game to make all opponents attack with their eyes closed on their next attack.<br/><br/>",

A hero appears in seven different suits, each a color of the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet. Each hero and suit combination appears once in a set.<br/><br/>The first player of each round may play any card from her hand. The second player in the round is called The Trickster, who may also pay any card from her hand. Any subsequent player that round must play a card that follows the pattern set by the Trickster.

If everyone was able to play one card, then the Trickster collects the cards.<br/><br/>The goal of Trickster is to have the fewest cards by the time any player has emptied her hand. Whoever has the fewest cards is the winner... with one exception! If you have more cards of a suit than any other player, you may ignore those cards when scoring.<br/><br/>",

During the draft phase, players strategically choose which cards they want to be part of their hand while their opponents do the same. During the play phase, players use cards from their hand to organize the perfect dates for their couples and sabotage their opponents!<br/><br/>Play alternates between the two phases, with the draft phase occurring first. Once each phase has been played twice, the game ends. The player who has the most victory points from creating the best dates wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of a board, showing 30 different types of contraband goods, Gold, Cigarettes etc, each marked by a small picture and it's name. Each picture has a matching tile, which is placed face down over it. Players each receive a number of chips and then take two or three (depending on the number of players), of the tiles for themselves, announcing which they have taken and then laying them face down in front of them. Now play begins.<br/><br/>The players take turns to roll the die and then move around the board. At first they generally land on a space where the picture is covered by a tile. They take this tile for themselves, and lay it face down in front of them announcing as they do so which it was. As the tiles start to disappear though, players land on spaces where the tile is already missing. They then have to say who they think has that tile. If correct, they receive the tile. If the named player however thinks that he hasn't got the tile, then he may in turn name another player, and so on until either a named player accepts that he has the tile, or a player who has already been named is named again. Then it is sorted out who really did have the tile, working backwards through the chain of accusations until it is found. The owner, when unmasked, passes it to the first player correctly to have named him, and all players who have falsely accused someone must pay chips into the Bank, one chip for each false accusation made in that turn.<br/><br/>Obviously, the passing on of tiles complicates matters terribly. It is simple enough to remember who took the tile in the first place, but by the time you have unraveled a chain of four or five false accusations, trying to remember who now has the tile is not so simple. The game goes on until either someone has collected a specified number of tiles, dependent on the number of players, or someone has no chips left. A player's tiles count two points each and every remaining chip one point, so it is quite possible to win without collecting many tiles, you merely have to avoid guessing falsely.<br/>(Jon Webley from GameCabinet)<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game, players will take two different cards of their &quot;team&quot; (in favor, against, or to be neutral in the &quot;magnicide&quot;) and they must discard one of these cards before the second round of votes take place in order to choose their final team.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The other player controls Mojo Jojo, trying to take out the Powerpuff Girls.  Each character has an individual deck of action cards.  Players try to reduce opposing characters' hit points to KABLOOEY!<br/><br/>The Powerpuff Girls player selects a girl to activate and draws from the appropriate deck.  The player will then follow the card instructions (usually movement). If the girl moves adjacent to Mojo Jojo, then she can fight him along with any other girls that are with her. Fighting Mojo Jojo consists of rolling one die for each girl in the fight.  Each die has 3 sides with no stars, 2 with one star and 1 side with two stars. For each star rolled, Mojo Jojo loses one hit point.<br/><br/>The Mojo Jojo player draws a card from the Mojo Jojo deck and follows the instructions.  Mojo Jojo may attack if adjacent to a Powerpuff Girl, rolling a black die that is the counterpart to the girls' dice, except with splats instead of stars.  Then Mojo Jojo gets a second attack. The player throws a red die through the laser sight on the 3D Laser Tower to physically knock down one or more of the Powerpuff Girl figures. Each girl knocked down loses a hit point.<br/><br/>A Powerpuff Girl whose hit points are reduced to KABLOOEY! is out of the game and her figure and deck are removed.

MasterSweets uses unique game mechanic based on the set collection mechanic. In the game, a set of ingredient cards are ordered on the table- they form the cookbook. Each row or column of the cookbook represents one recipe. The players will try to collect the full set of ingredient cards that a recipe contains in order to complete it. But each player may also exchange a card from his hand with a card from the cookbook. This way the player changes the set of cards in the collections that all players are trying to collect.<br/><br/>Clash of Sweets - player elimination game<br/>In &ldquo;Clash of Sweets&rdquo; each player will create his own unique cookbook and will try to steal his opponents&lsquo; recipes. This way, he reveals other players&lsquo; culinary secrets and their unique cookbooks decrease. After the last recipe from a player&rsquo;s cookbook is stolen, the player must leave the game. The last surviving player with recipes that have not been revealed is the winner.<br/><br/>Sweets Workshop - cooperative game <br/>In &quot;Sweets Workshop&quot; a royalty has noticed our masters of the sweets. She wants them to make incredible sweets for her birthday. Now the players must combine their efforts and team up in order to precisely fulfil all the royalty&rsquo;s requirements. But they have not worked together before and the players have communication problems. In &ldquo;Sweets workshop&rdquo; each player holds the cards in his hand facing the rest of the players. The other players should give him clues about his cards.<br/><br/>Lonely in The Kitchen - solo game <br/>To be a true master of the sweets, you need a lot of workouts. The best workout is when you are confronted with your own best achievements. The solo game mode &quot;Lonely in The Kitchen&quot; has the same gameplay as the core game &ldquo;MasterSweets&rdquo; for two players. The goal in the &ldquo;Lonely in the kitchen&rdquo; game is to collect more victory points at the end of the game than your fictional opponent George &ldquo;The cake&rdquo; (a dummy player).<br/><br/>Endless Cookbook &ndash; competitive game <br/>&quot;Endless cookbook&quot; game mode keeps all rules from the main game mode &quot;MasterSweets&quot; except the following. Regardless of the number of players create the initial cookbook with a specific form. When a recipe is completed fill the just emptied positions in the cookbook with new cards from the drawing deck. This way the cookbook keeps its initial form during the whole game. The first player that has at least 35 points in his completed sweets is the winner.<br/><br/>Team Sweets &ndash; team competitive game <br/>&quot;Team sweets&quot; game mode allows you to play the game modes &quot;MasterSweets&quot;, &quot;Clash of sweets&quot; and &quot;Endless cookbook&quot; in team competitive game - 2 players vs 2 players. Before the end of the active player turn, he may pass (only if he want) one card from his hand facedown to his teammate's hand. Before the active player choice of a cart to be transferred is made, his teammate may tell to all players exactly which kind of card he wants to receive. Or may use a code name for example &quot;Please give me a tree&quot; as &quot;tree&quot; is a code name for chocolate.<br/><br/>The Best Clue - competitive game <br/>In &ldquo;The Best Clue&rdquo; each player holds the cards in his hand facing the rest of the players. The player&rsquo;s goal is to guess 5 cards from his hand. On his turn, the active player may give a clue to one of his opponents in order to receive a special card. He may use this special card to request a clue (from a type that he wants) for his cards from the other players. (The clue types in &ldquo;The Best Clue&rdquo; are the same as in game mode &ldquo;Sweets Workshop&rdquo;). In this way, the player that gives the most useless clues to his opponents and requests the most useful clues about his cards will be the winner.<br/><br/>Sweets Puzzle - competitive game <br/>In game mode &ldquo;Sweets Puzzle&rdquo; each payer tries to build his own cookbook that is an exact copy of a part of the main cookbook. A player receives victory points from inseparable cards in his cookbook that represent an exact copy of a part of the MAIN cookbook. If in a player&rsquo;s cookbook there are two or more separate groups of cards representing a copy of the MAIN cookbook then the player takes the victory points only from the group that gives the most points. The game ends when any player collects at least 25 points. This player is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragon Chess first appeared in Dragon Magazine issue 100, and was also featured in the short story &quot;At Moonset Blackcat Comes&quot; in the same issue. It is a 3D Chess game that is played on three 8x12 boards stacked above each other. The top board represents the air and features pieces like the Griffon and the Dragon. The middle board represents the land and has pieces like the Oliphant, the Thief, and (of course) the King. The bottom board represents the underworld and contains pieces like the Dwarf and the Elemental.<br/><br/>Like regular chess, the object is to checkmate your opponent's King. Many pieces move like their chess counterparts, but many others have unconventional moves taken from other chess variants that are further complicated by the game's three dimensional nature.<br/><br/>For example, on the upper board, a Sylph piece moves like a Berolina pawn. It may make a non-capturing move one space diagonally forward, or it may capture by moving directly forward one space. It may also capture by moving straight down to the middle board. While on the middle board, the Sylph cannot move at all except to make a non-capturing move back to the top board. It may move to the square directly above it OR any empty one of the six home squares that any friendly Sylph occupied at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Roughly translated as 'Robbers', this abstract battle game was known to be played by the Romans, and versions of the same game may well have been played before by the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians, and afterwards by the Persians. Games archaeologists and historians disagree hotly about just about every aspect of this game: board size, number and distribution of playing pieces, use of a king piece, age, priority, etc, etc; the list goes on. However, there is evidence that the game existed, both in literature and in archaeological finds. All this disagreement suggests that, as the game traveled out to the far flung regions of empire, it was altered and developed by gamers and gamblers.<br/><br/>The basic Latrunculi consists of 1, 2, or 3 ranks of opposing pieces (the number differs), on a board divided into squares of a single color; the board itself could be 8x8, 10x10, 12x8, or variations thereof.  The move of the pieces is a matter for discussion: the rook's move, queen's move, king's move from chess, or one square orthogonally have all been suggested.  Capture is made when a piece has opposing pieces on either side of it. The winner is the player who captures all his opponent's pieces, although variations have been suggested, such as getting two pieces to the opponent's back rail.<br/><br/>As noted above, many variations exist, including a version recently discovered in Colchester (the Roman capital of England, Camulodonum), which includes a 'king' or 'standard' piece. Games of the Hnefatafl family are probably further developments of Latrunculorum. BGG members will no doubt have disagreements, opinions, and variations to add to this 'base-line' summary.<br/><br/>Moshe Callen is credited as a designer on this game for his work in researching, developing, and formalizing the rules of the game based on historical data for the nestorgames version of this game.<br/><br/>",

During the game, players will draw cards to their hand and place them adjacent to previously placed cards, collectively building a grid that fills the play area.<br/><br/>Challenge your pattern recognition skills by playing cards that have minimum two attributes (e.g. shape and number) in common with neighboring cards on the board. Carefully choose where to play in order to score points for yourself and/or block your opponents from doing so. Cluster your cards together in rows and a rectangle, each card scores 1 point for each cluster it is part of (max 3). Simply score more points than the other players to win. It&rsquo;s anyone&rsquo;s game until the last card is played!<br/><br/>The 1st and 2nd editions also functions as expansions for each other, with 4 separate colours in each edition and identical card sizes, so they can be combined for a total of 8 players.<br/><br/>",

The Empire of Japan, eager to emerge as a global power and seeing an opportunity to expand at the expense of Germany's Asian and Pacific colonies, entered the Great War alongside their British allies.<br/><br/>John Gorkowski's Empire at Sunrise: The Great War in Asia, 1914 depicts the struggle for control of Pacific sea lanes during the opening months of World War I. Its focus is largely on naval operations - on the cat-and-mouse dance of destroyers and battleships. The game presents its action at three different telescoping scales using nested playing surfaces, representing the area around Tsingtao at six miles per hex, the fight over the Asian Pacific at 240 miles per hex, and the entire Pacific Ocean at 1440 miles per zone. From the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Chile to the Siege of Tsingtao in China, this game elegantly captures the sweep of a forgotten chapter in the history of World War I.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Galactic Scoundrels is a game of space-western mayhem for 3-5 players that features gambling, lying, cheating, and lowdown dirty dealing. Plus it's in space.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. In each round, the players gamble to win a job, one player takes that job, then the other players play cards to stop them from finishing it. Along the way, they also try to bleed as much money from them as possible. After all, what are friends for?<br/><br/>Jobs consist of a series of events, described on cards, which the player on the job must resolve with their ship, its contents, the cards in their hand, and whatever is in their stash. Along the way, all the players tell the tale of the adventure, describing how each card advances the scoundrel's story. Galactic Scoundrels is, more than anything, a storytelling game.<br/><br/>",

The most powerful cards cost your action and other cards are free. The biggest decision point each turn is usually which card in your hand to use your action on and how and when to use that card.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a score of 30 Mojo. Player's use champion, object, and event cards to try and reduce their opponent(s)'s Mojo to zero.<br/><br/>The game comes in 15 card packs. Each pack is specially sorted and balanced so that you can shuffle any 2 packs together and have a playable 30 card deck.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a shovel card, and you place scoring cubes (worth 1-4 points) on a score card, with one cube next to each of the six types of treasure in a two-player game and two cubes each in a game with three or four players.<br/><br/>On a turn, either you reveal the top card from the deck and place it face up on the table or you pass on revealing a card. If you reveal a card that has a rat on it while another rat is already visible, you must take one of these rat cards and add it to your collection. If you pass on revealing a card, you must choose a type of treasure and collect all cards that have this treasure on it; you may also name a treasure type after revealing a card if the rats didn't catch you.<br/><br/>After taking one or more cards, place your shovel card on a face-up treasure card, then sit out until all players have placed their shovels, with the last player taking as many turns as desired as long as the rats stay away. You then each reclaim your shovel, while removing the covered cards from play. Continue taking turns until the deck is exhausted; if not all players have placed their shovels at this point, shuffle the removed cards and continue play until all shovels have been placed.<br/><br/>For each treasure type (rings, coins, etc.), players count how many of these items they have on their cards, with the player who has the most (and secondmost in a game with more than two players) claiming a scoring cube for this treasure type. Once all the cubes have been claimed, sum the value of your cubes to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

At the start of a round, one team flips its sand timer, then rolls five colored, twelve-sided letter dice; each color corresponds to a row on a paper tablet, with the red die indicating what the first letter in a word must be, the yellow die indicating the second letter in a separate word must be, and so on. The team members think up words that fit these constraints as quickly as possible, stopping the sand timer once they've finished.<br/><br/>Following this, a member of the other team looks at the word list, starts the same sand timer in reverse &mdash; thereby giving him as much time as the team took to write down its words &mdash; then tries to get her teammates to guess these five words. Clue-giving is done Taboo-style, and that team scores one point for each word guessed in the time allowed.<br/><br/>",

However, in doing so, he often overlooks what is lying in front of him in the meadow.<br/>In the game of Fladderadatsch, the players move the magnetic game figure of Florian Fl&uuml;gel over the gameboard, trying to have him avoid stepping into the hidden (also magnetic) pieces of horse- and cow-dung.<br/>The object is to collect the most photo cards by using the game figure. The themes of these cards are also depicted on the tiles of the gameboard under which unpleasant surprises might be hidden. Fortunately, the naturalist has a wooden footstool on which you can put him in the nick of time in order to save him from a misstep. Who can succeed in taking the most photos of all flying animals and objects before Florians&rsquo; shoes are ruined?<br/>As you play the thrilling and hilarious &ldquo;heap leap&rdquo; of Fladderadatsch, you'll have the best chance of winning if you have a good ability to memorize &mdash; and, in particular, if you keep your balance in spite of the other players' malicious joy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sabacc is a gambling card game based on a game referenced within the Star Wars universe.<br/><br/>Note that this game is different than the card game available at Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge - the new area of Disneyland. That game can be found here.<br/><br/>The game is played with a unique 76-card deck, comprised of four suits of 15 cards (Coins, Flasks, Sabres, and Staves) as well as a number of unsuited face cards. Gameplay loosely resembles poker, while hand scoring resembles blackjack. Players are dealt an initial hand, then can draw more cards to their hand, while wagering over the value of hands. Wagers are paid into two pots, a Hand Pot and a Sabacc Pot. Once the hand has been called, players reveal their hand to win the Hand Pot: the winner is the player with the highest hand value that is doesn't exceed 23. A player with a hand that totals exactly 23 or -23 has Pure Sabacc and wins the Sabacc Pot. Since unwon pots roll over into the next hand's Sabacc Pot, the Sabacc Pot can grow to be quite large.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to guide the agents in such a way that all countries get the same amount of information. Only this guarantees the global balance of power. However, agents tend to live a double life; aside from their official identity, they also work for another country &ndash; undercover.<br/><br/>In Undercover, the countries are represented by the six colors of the color circle: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple. During the game, players place and replace the agents adjacently to others with matching colors &mdash; the same or one of the two neighbored colors on the color circle. Tiles can be flipped before being replaced, and later flipped again and again. Since the tiles show different colors on the sides - again two colors neighbored on the color wheel - there is a strong deduction element in the game (while younger kids rather will play it using their memory).<br/><br/>For the highest score you need to score for all colors more or less equally. The player who coordinated the meetings of agents of all countries in the most clever way wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game ends when a player reaches 500 points, lowest score wins.<br/>    The Totally Insane Card Game has numbered cards 0-10 and 27 action cards such as the Change Hands.   If you do not like the cards in your hand, you think another player MAY have a better hand, play the Change Hands to the discard pile and change hands with him.  Other examples of action cards are the Moving Cards, these cards when played, will move the entire hand of all players ether two players left or one player right. The Totally Insane Card Game includes Draw 2, Draw 4, and Take 2, cards that make the next player ether Draw 2 or Draw 4 cards from the draw pile, or Take 2 cards from any player. Of course the draw cards add together so you might have to draw 6 or 8 cards. In Totally Insane, players could take cards from your hand, helping you get rid of your cards, while adding cards to their hand.  The Totally Insane Card Game has a Totally Useless Card this card is exactly what it says totally useless.  At no time can the Totally Useless Card be played to the discard pile.  So what do you do with a card you can&rsquo;t play to the discard pile?   Simple, you give it to anther player so he can&rsquo;t play it either. (If you can&rsquo;t play it, you can&rsquo;t go out.) You can give it away with cards like the Change Hands, Moving Card, or a Forced Kindness.  When you play a Forced Kindness to the discard pile, you give two cards from your hand to any player.  You never know who will be picked on next.  The Totally Insane Card Game boasts one Dead Card, any time this card is played to the discard pile, the hand is over immediately all players add the points of there cards, then deal the next hand.  This is just a sample of the action cards and how they play.  <br/>    The Totally Insane Card Game is designed to play in turn and out of turn, (matching) so you must be alert, or you may miss an opportunity to play a card.  <br/>    The Totally Insane Card Game is fast moving and outrageous fun, for 4 to 12 players Ages 8 and up. <br/>Find us at totallyinsanecardgame.com<br/><br/>",

The game board shows a top-down view of the temple, showing a path through the temple off which are many niches holding the treasures. The pathway has stepping stones marked with a variety of symbols, one in front of each. To open the niche you must have the right symbol. To move around, you must spend footprint tiles. To obtain these, the player must reveal 2 supply tiles, keeps one and auctions the other. Players bid with anything they have, tiles, coins, cards.<br/><br/>Sounds confusing? It is. You must win auctions to get the stuff you need to win more auctions and move and open niches and collect treasures to score points to win the game.  It might take a player a while to figure the true value of all of the items and how it all fits together, but once a player has the idea, the game really works.<br/><br/>",

After the Battle of Culloden in 1746, the victorious Englishmen suppressed Scottish idiosyncrasies such as clan colors, kilts, bagpipes, tartan, and the Scottish language. Particularly loathsome was the tax placed on Scotch whisky, and the traditional race along the River Spey therefore became an ideal opportunity to smuggle such liquor in the participants' backpacks!<br/><br/>In Scottish Highland Whisky Race, players aim to reach the finishing line, while selling whisky to the pubs along the way and all the time attempting to avoid the patrolling Englishman.<br/><br/>",

Each games takes only an hour or so to play.<br/><br/><br/>The US fielded a small military force at the time. This results in them having fewer Units at the start of the game. However, as seen a few decades earlier during the Civil War, the US is able to rapidly ramp up their production capabilities and quickly expand the size of their army. As the game unfolds, the US receives production bonuses to reflect this. The geographical area represented by the US map is larger than in the other games, as such, each Martian Wave is made up of 5 Tripods, and they tend to move a little less often. To match this, the US must pay 3 PP to move Units during the Production step. The US game gives a more lumbering feel with large forces bashing against each other.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;The profound influence of sea commerce upon the wealth and strength of countries was clearly seen long before the true principles which governed its growth and prosperity were detected. To secure to one's own people a disproportionate share of such benefits, every effort was made to exclude others, either by the peaceful legislative methods of monopoly or prohibitory regulations, or, when these failed, by direct violence. The clash of interests, the angry feelings roused by conflicting attempts thus to appropriate the larger share, if not the whole, of the advantages of commerce, and of distant unsettled commercial regions, led to wars.&rdquo;<br/> - Alfred Thayer Mahan, The Influence Of Sea Power Upon History, 1660 - 1783<br/><br/>Although advertised as purely commercial ventures, China&rsquo;s &ldquo;String of Pearls&rdquo; (a series of key ports) across the Indian Ocean Region (IOR) gives her the option to assert sea control of that theater, and for good reason.  About 80% of the PRC&rsquo;s oil transits the IOR before bottlenecking at the Strait of Malacca and then going on to terminate at ports in the PRC.  Even a Gwadar-Kashgar oil pipeline, designed to bypass the full-length IOR route, would still require some initial sea transport, followed by a vulnerable off load, and couldn&rsquo;t carry the full load anyway.<br/><br/>Therefore, in a modern interpretation of Mahan&rsquo;s observations, China has used &ldquo;legislative methods&hellip;monopoly&hellip;(and) prohibitory regulations&rdquo; all via diplomacy to secure its oil-toting sea lanes throughout the IOR.  Patient cultivation of relations with Pakistan over decades has delivered access to the updated, modern port at Gwadar, Pakistan.  Buoyed by Chinese land leases and development projects, Maldivian President Yameen has drifted closer to China while his opposition looks to India.  In Sri Lanka, China may have used &ldquo;debt trap diplomacy&rdquo; by forgiving debt to obtain certain rights to the port at Hambantota for 99-years.  How ironic, after regaining Hong Kong, China is now using tactics reminiscent of Imperial British mercantilists to gain Ceylon!  The confidential nature of certain aspects of these deals along with the close association of many Chinese firms to their military and government opens up the possibility of &ldquo;dual use&rdquo; facilities that might quickly transition from commercial to military applications.<br/><br/>Thus, as China secures its sea lanes other powers perceive corresponding threats to their own.  India can&rsquo;t help but feel surrounded.  The United States has strategic incentive to preserve India as a counterbalance to Chinese expansion.  And, any nation drawing oil from the Persian Gulf or Africa must wonder about the possible negative consequences of unrestrained Chinese power.  The increasing presence of Chinese naval vessels in the region only strengthens these concerns.  So, the IOR is not only a point of potential geopolitical friction, but also a critical theater in any larger global power conflict that erupts over friction elsewhere.<br/><br/>The game Indian Ocean Region enables participants to play out possible future conflicts, circa 2025, from their political beginnings to military endings with the same game mechanics as used in the South China Sea game.  Players assume the roles of nations or groups of nations and deal cards in multiple rounds of play each representing three to seven weeks to advance their separate agendas.  Each card play might trigger armed conflict.  If violence comes to pass, the time scale compresses to three to seven hours per turn and players deploy their military units to resolve matters by force.  Those forces include: individual capital ships, pairs or triples of smaller vessels, squadrons of aircraft, and battalions of ground troops all waging war at the far end of logistical shoestrings.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>    &bull; Complexity: 7 out of 10<br/>    &bull; Solitaire Suitability: 6 out of 10<br/>    &bull; Time Scale: 1 turn = between 3 and 7 hours<br/>    &bull; Map Scale: 1 hex = 45 nautical miles<br/>    &bull; Unit Scale: aircraft squadrons, pairs of ships/subs, land battalions<br/>    &bull; Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 3 players, or solitaire<br/>    &bull; Playing Time: 2-4 hours depending on scenario<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>    &bull; Three 22x 34&rdquo; map sheets<br/>    &bull; Three Countersheets totaling 390 3/4&quot; counters<br/>    &bull; Deck of 39 political cards<br/>    &bull; Two player aid cards<br/>    &bull; Rule/scenario book<br/>    &bull; Two Dice<br/>    &bull; Box and Lid<br/><br/>Game Credits:<br/>    &bull; Designer: John Gorkowski<br/>    &bull; Artist: Christopher Moeller<br/><br/>",

You roll 6 dice, and remove any dice you want to use for points. You can stop, keeping the points, or re-roll the remaining dice.  Points can be scored by specific numbers (e.g. 5 or 1) or sets of the same number. If you can use all six dice for points, pick them all up and keep going.<br/><br/>'Bank' your points and end your turn at any time but beware, some scoring dice must be removed after every roll - if no scoring dice are rolled your turn ends and you score zero points.<br/><br/>The highest score over 10,000 wins the game.<br/><br/>In 1996, Charlie and Mary Potter, known as &quot;Mr and Mrs Farkel&quot;, created a copyrighted scoring system and lodged various trade marks. The scoring system is proprietary to Legendary Games, Inc. Charlie started by selling product made on his kitchen table. Over the course of 10 years, it became a commercial hit. In 2007 Patch launched a version of the game spelled as &quot;Farkle&quot; with almost the same logo design, which soon after they changed.<br/><br/>",

The stone the dragon had been standing on goes to the top of your rack, to be used again when it rolls down eventually to the bottom.<br/><br/>You make three moves per turn and try to put the other dragons into tough situations while making progress with your own.  So you generally want to play a North stone to move somebody else and the S, SO, and SW stones for your own dragon -- but there are blocks and corners, so this won't always be possible.<br/><br/>The main strategic tip is to try to move the dragons that have been left standing on stones with southward movement so as to get the S stones onto your own rack.  You also have two Storm cards (to allow 5 moves instead of 3 on a turn) and two Lightning cards (to prevent another player trying to move your dragon) to deploy during the course of the game.<br/><br/>Although the structural underpinnings and the slight benefit of memory might make you think you're going to have a serious, thinking game, Goldener Drache actually plays out as very light and take-thatty for a fun 15 minutes and &quot;Let's do it again!&quot;<br/><br/>",

You bring equipment to each crime scene and use your equipment to generate effort, with which you clean evidence tiles from the crime scene. The more evidence you are able to clean, the less chance you give the police to catch you.<br/><br/>The Cleaner is a game of playing cards to generate Effort cubes. You may then place Effort cubes on Evidence spaces, or combine lower-value Effort cubes to create higher-value Effort cubes. Once all spaces on an Evidence Tile have been assigned an appropriate Effort cube, you may remove that Evidence Tile from the play area. Each action you perform takes some time off the clock. You must play your Equipment cards as efficiently as you can, to cover as many Evidence spaces as possible.<br/><br/>At the end of each stage, the police will conduct an investigation of the crime scene. For each unoccupied Evidence space, the police will have a greater chance of finding any Evidence you left behind. Successfully clean all the crime scenes to win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t================The Cleaner won the following awards in the 2018 Solitaire Print and Play Contest:<br/><br/>1st place, Best Regular Print and Play Build<br/>2nd place, Best Rule Book<br/>3rd place, Most Thematic Game<br/>4th place, Best Resource Management Category<br/>7th place, Best Overall Game<br/>9th place, Best Graphic Design<br/><br/>Janine Viglietti<br/>1st place, Best Artist<br/><br/>Martin Gonzalvez<br/>3rd place, Best New Designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thousands of Years Ago<br/>Conflict and strife between the six races resulted in years of war and suffering. One day, a strange cursed fog began to roll in from the north. The races fled south, and settled in what is today known as the Five Realms. Their ancient traditions and cities were lost to the miasma, and slowly forgotten by history.<br/><br/>Modern Day<br/>A dwarven merchant ship sailing to Merchants Cove noticed that the poisonous miasma surrounding the land had been lifted. Word quickly made its way to Queen Tabitha who organized excursions to this new land. What they found shocked them; this was their ancestral homeland, and the six races used to live in peace. Peace and harmony had returned to the Five Realms, and thus the ancient curse had been lifted.<br/><br/>In The Sixth Realm, players assume the role of explorers who&rsquo;ve sailed to this new (old) continent. With the backing of the crown and help from the guilds, players will compete to make a name for themselves in this strange new land.<br/><br/>A game of The Sixth Realm takes place over three rounds.  Each round, the Stone Council will meet seven times, determining in which order each of the six guilds are going to activate. Players will then have the ability to take actions based on the selected guild. By exhausting their supplies of precious resources they will be able to take stronger actions, or even petition to take a different guild's actions.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, You will have opportunities to win the favor of the Stone Council and gain more permanent support from the guilds, allowing you to take powerful actions.<br/><br/>As word of your deeds spread, your popularity will rise and you will attract new Envoys to aid you in your endeavors&mdash;enabling taking free actions that can lead to lots of exciting multi-stage combos.<br/><br/>The Merchants Guild is all about resources. Gain new resources and refresh exhausted ones to keep your engine running smooth.<br/><br/>The Builders Guild are trying to construct a permanent settlement, and need your help laying foundations and building homes.<br/><br/>The Adventurers Guild are busy exploring ancient ruins, diving deeper into the dungeon for greater rewards, and precious artifacts from their ancestors.<br/><br/>The Navigators Guild want to explore the entire continent, establishing outposts in forgotten cities, rebuilding bridges, and unearthing forgotten relics.<br/><br/>The Scribes Guild are in charge of recording and scrubbing information on scrolls, which can be done with ink resources to take powerful free actions.<br/><br/>The Historians Guild are in charge of translating scrolls and texts from an unearthed library containing a treasure trove of ancient traditions.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will earn the Queen&rsquo;s Favor, and use it to influence her royal challenges. These challenges will ask players to accomplish certain feats in this new land, and bestow royal favor upon those who rise to the challenge.<br/><br/>The Sixth Realm is a heavy euro game stuffed to the brim with combos, bonuses, engine building, and interaction. The player-driven scoring and action-selection mechanisms mean that no two games play out the same. You must carefully balance long-term strategic planning, short-term  tactical adjustments, and the desires of your opponents to make a name for yourself as you return to the homeland of your ancient ancestors.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each week a team of three contestants tries to complete a Level by running along narrow pathways that hover high in the sky. The better they perform, the more credits they win.<br/>At random intervals gaps appear in these tracks, over which players must jump, or otherwise fall onto the pathway below. <br/>And large mutant creatures, known as Blockers, are also waiting to try to stop their progress.<br/><br/>The aim of this solitaire micro game is to win as many credits as you can!<br/>Each Level consists of 3 tracks (high, mid and low), divided into 7 Zones (cards). The game has 3 Levels, each getting progressively more difficult.<br/>Runners who successfully reach a Level&rsquo;s End Zone are awarded points (credits), depending on the height of track and the Level. A runner who completes one Level can then tackle the next one (hopefully with their other team mates if they also finished it).<br/>You control a team of 3 Runners. You&rsquo;ll be rolling dice and deciding how best to assign them so that each Runner has the best chance of progressing. Runners also have special abilities that can modify their dice score.<br/><br/>Zone Runners was voted Best Solitaire Game in the 2017 9-card Nanogame PnP Design Contest.<br/>It was also voted 2nd Best Overall Game.<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/><br/>EXPANDED EDITION<br/>This edition adds 2 expansions, 4 character ability reference cards, an updated turn tracker card and card backs. <br/>Available from both PNP Arcade <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.pnparcade.com/products/zone-runners\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.pnparcade.com/products/zone-runners</a> and Randomskill Games <a target='_blank' href=\"https://randomskill.games/product/zone-runners/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://randomskill.games/product/zone-runners/</a><br/><br/>",

Only logic and flair can help you. Ambiguous clues, vague hints, encrypted messages, random phrases, and sometimes blatant lies - all this will come across you during your investigation and will give you the key to exposing the villains.<br/><br/>You have to plunge into the world of robberies and murders, get to the bottom of the truth in four main and one secret mission, each of which has its own plot (partly related to other missions), a unique set of characters and evidence. More than 50 unique locations are waiting for you, where you will visit during the game. For example, the Great Leader barbershop, the University of Chicago, the Chattanooga Arms weapons store and even Madame Zhu-Zhu's cheerful salon<br/><br/><br/><br/>Вы окажетесь в роли журналиста Джона Фицпатрика, в круговороте событий, происходящих в Чикаго 1929 года, когда &laquo;сухой закон&raquo; еще не отменен, а Великая депрессия еще не началась.В городе, где гангстеры и бутлегеры часто влиятельнее, чем политики, где процветают коррупция и контрабанда, молодой журналист Фицпатрик делает себе имя на расследованиях подоплеки тех преступлений, которые на первый взгляд кажутся непримечательными. Вам могут помочь только логика и чутье. Неоднозначные подсказки, туманные намеки, зашифрованные послания, случайные фразы, а иногда и наглая ложь &ndash; все это встретится вам во время расследования и даст ключ к разоблачению злодеев.<br/> Вам предстоит, погрузившись в мир ограблений и убийств, докопаться до истины в четырех основных и одной секретной миссии, каждая из которых обладает своим сюжетом (отчасти связанным с другими миссиями), уникальным набором фигурантов и улик. Вас ждут более 50 уникальных локаций, где вам предстоит побывать в ходе игры. Например, барбершоп &laquo;Великий вождь&raquo;, Чикагский университет, оружейный магазин &laquo;Читтануга Армс&raquo; и даже веселый салон мадам Жу-жу.<br/><br/>",

The ZoxSo board consists of an 8 x 8 grid of &quot;Pearls&quot; and a 7 x 7 grid of &quot;Stones&quot; wherein the pieces flip back-and-forth and behave differently in each realm. Each coin-like piece has, on its opposite sides, dual personalities: One personality that may exist only on the Pearls, and one personality that may exist only on the Stones.<br/><br/>In the first part of the game, the &quot;Placement Phase,&quot; players take turns placing their pieces on the board onto empty Pearls outside &quot;The Wall.&quot;  During this phase the players each strive to aggressively carve out their own position and strategic/tactical plans, while at the same time trying to cut across their opponent's position and plans.<br/><br/>As soon as all 20 pieces are on the board, the second phase of the game begins: &quot;The Race to the Throne.&quot;  In this phase, the players alternately either: 1) move a piece; or 2) flip a piece; or 3) flip-and-move a piece. Using competing captures, tactics, and strategies, players each strive to be the first player to win by either: 1) moving or flipping his/her Xing (Emperor) onto the Golden Throne in the center of the board; or, 2) capturing the opponent's Xing (Emperor).<br/><br/>Note that good initial placement is highly important for success in ZoxSo; while sharp and accurate play during the &quot;Race to the Throne&quot; phase to follow-up the initial placement is, well, pretty much just as important.<br/><br/>Players are sometimes surprised at how strategically and tactically &quot;brutal&quot; ZoxSo can be, but that's simply the nature of the beast. And while it's easy to learn the rules of ZoxSo, it really will take a lifetime to master the game.<br/><br/>",

Naturally you wouldn't want to blow your cover by breaking environmental laws, so all of you will be scrounging for components in the junkyard.<br/><br/>To set up the game, shuffle the 45 cards and lay them out in a 9x5 grid; each player takes a character card. The first player takes a card from the perimeter of the grid, then lays her character card in its place. Each other player in turn order does the same, then play order reverses for the remainder of the collection phase, with players moving their character cards to adjacent spaces (which includes diagonals) to claim cards. Land on an empty space, and you get nothing &ndash; but are still active in the round. Once all the cards have been claimed, the round ends.<br/><br/>Players then have the ability to steal cards from opponents (or secure cards they need) based on the number of weapons they've collected. Each player can first secure four cards, though, so not everything is up for grabs. Players then assemble a robot with a head, body and legs, along with one weapon and any number of bonus cards. Each robot is worth the sum of its parts, along with any applicable bonuses; each additional robot a player can construct is worth ten points, no matter the value of its parts. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

All players start the game on Saffron Island and may sail in any direction from there. Progress through the game is denoted by three progress stages.

        "description": "Gathering Storm does for GMT's A World at War what Days of Decision did for ADG's World in Flames. It allows players to simulate the diplomatic, economic, and political maneuverings that preceded the Second World War, either as a stand alone game or as an expansion for A World at War.  (Unlike Days of Decision, Gathering Storm covers only the European events leading to war.)<br/><br/>&lt;From the publisher's website:&gt;<br/><br/>Gathering Storm, both a game in its own right and a prequel to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War, covers the period from 1935 to the outbreak of World War II, whenever that might be. Like A World at War, Gathering Storm simulates the military, economic, political, diplomatic, research and production preparations for the Second World War, allowing the players to explore what might have happened if:<br/><br/>- Admiral Doenitz had convinced his superiors of the importance of submarine warfare in the impending war with Britain.<br/>- Germany had pursued the Z Plan earlier and more consistently.<br/>- The development of the &ldquo;Ural bomber&rdquo; had been pursued.<br/>- Poland had become a German satellite, rather than resisting German aggression.<br/>- War had broken out over the Sudetenland, or even the remilitarization of the Rhineland.<br/>- Mussolini had given a lower priority to naval armaments, to the benefit of the Italian armor and air forces.<br/>- France had extended the Maginot Line.<br/>- de Gaulle&rsquo;s arguments to expand and strengthen France&rsquo;s armor units had been accepted.<br/>- Britain had rearmed sooner.<br/>- Russia had deferred the Great Purges. Or accelerated them.<br/>- The Spanish civil war had been won by the Loyalists.<br/>- A civil war had broken out in Yugoslavia. Or Greece.<br/>- Atomic fission had been discovered earlier.<br/>- The Second World War had begun with a Franco-Italian conflict. Or a French pre-emptive attack on Germany. Or a Russo-German war, with Italy and the Western Allies neutral.<br/>- War comes early. Or later, in 1940 or even 1941. <br/>- YOU had been in command.<br/><br/>Gathering Storm can be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, but A World at War players will want to press on and see how the war they have created plays out. While using different mechanics, Gathering Storm's structure is consistent with A World at War and allows for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into.  Some 30 years in development, with three years of design and playtesting, Gathering Storm, includes the following:<br/><br/>- Six random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value.<br/>- Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork.<br/>- Flexible mobilization rules, allowing players to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other.<br/>- Unit construction which allows players to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options.<br/>- Variable research, which can focus on air, naval, military or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains.<br/>- A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not.<br/>- Shipbuilding that allows varied fleets, including the possibility of 5-factor super battleships.<br/>- Ahistorical A World at War counters, including armor units of different strengths and additional ships. <br/>- A dynamic crisis system, in which the Allies can appease or oppose the Axis, with neither side necessarily being certain whether war might break out.<br/>- No dice.<br/><br/>Gathering Storm is a must-buy for any committed A World at War player, an excellent &ndash; and possibly dangerously time consuming &ndash; introduction to the A World at War universe for those unfamiliar with that game, and a enjoyable and instructive fast-paced game all on its own.<br/><br/>",

Games last 6 turns. The time scale, though not stated, is probably two days per turn. (The historical battle ran 12 days.) Units are German divisions (light gray) and ahistorical Soviet &quot;corps&quot; (brown), plus a handful of smaller formations. They have combat and movement factors (e. g., 6-8 for the best German panzer divisions, 2-4 for a Soviet infantry &quot;corps&quot;). The Germans have several non-divisional panzer units that must be stacked with a German division in order to use their combat factor.  The Soviets have artillery and anti-tank brigades that can only use their combat factor in attack or defense, respectively.<br/><br/>Four bands of fortified lines dominate the map, one German line and three Soviet lines. The Soviet fortified lines are indicated as they existed in May, June and July 1943.  All four lines are used during the historical scenario but not all of the Soviet lines apply to some of the hypothetical scenarios.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns, each having a movement phase, combat phase and second movement phase for mechanized units. Zones of control are &quot;semi-active&quot; (requiring extra movement points to enter or leave). The stacking limit is three divisions or &quot;corps&quot;, plus one smaller formation, per hex. The Combat Results Table has the classic Eliminate, Exchange, Retreat outcomes. Supply lines must be traced over no more than 10 hexes to a rail line leading off a friendly map edge, with lack of supply halving movement and combat factors.<br/><br/>Air power is represented semi-abstractly by air units that can fly close support, interdiction, combat air patrol, air superiority or interception missions. There are no command rules, but a couple of optional rules try to suggest organizational differences between the two armies. These options are quite advantageous to the Germans, who, as in reality, need all the help they can get. One of these optional rules is the ability of the German mechanized divisions to not be completely removed from play on an Eliminate result, but be replaced by low-strength Kampfgrupen (this became a standard rule in later games).<br/><br/>The wargame includes six scenarios: historical and free setup scenarios for the historical July start date, hypothetical May and June German attacks, and two hypothetical August Soviet counteroffensives (one with a fixed and the other with a free setup). 255 counters<br/><br/>For its day, Kursk: Operation Zitadelle was a &quot;monster game&quot; and more attentive to history than many of its rivals. SPI used the same basic system, generally with elaborations, in later World War II games, such as Breakout &amp; Pursuit, The Moscow Campaign and Destruction of Army Group Center.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>In September 1944, Operation Market Garden was intended to open a direct path for the Allied armies to circumvent the West Wall and threaten Germany's industrial Ruhr heartland. British, American and Polish airborne forces were ordered to assault and capture key bridges along the main highway leading through Holland, the Arnhem bridge being the most distant of them all. Unfortunately, the Allies had gravely underestimated the strength of German forces in the area; so, when the airborne forces landed, they found themselves scattered amid an SS panzer division. The various bridges thus became the fulcrum of the entire operation for both sides.<br/><br/>Arnhem utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From mortars to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by tanks &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy paratrooper battalion defending a landing zone. As that attack gets underway, however, the recon battalion may find itself strafed by enemy fighter-bombers. More support will be necessary to take the landing zone, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Arnhem, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting for Arnhem. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    A Bridge Too Far: Arnhem (alternate)<br/><br/><br/>",

To set up a round, each player takes 4-5 coins and someone shuffles the mask deck, then lays out the four actors around the deck. The deck consists of ten different types of masks, with five cards of each type.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player reveals the top card of the deck, then places it on top of one actors of her choice. If any opponent thinks that this type of mask is already present in this stack, he can yell &quot;Stop!&quot; If the accusation is true, the accuser takes as many coins from the active player as the number of masks of this type buried under the top card; if the accusation isn't true, then the accuser loses one coin, placing it out of the game.<br/><br/>The round ends when one player has no coins remaining or the deck of cards has run out. Players tally their score for the round.

        "description": "One of the original set of Avalon Hill &quot;Adult Games&quot; that includes U-Boat, Tactics II, Verdict, and Dispatcher.<br/><br/>This is one of the earliest &quot;typical&quot; wargames, with movement/strength counters, order of appearance chart, CRT, etc.<br/><br/>Board has square grid with squares 1&quot; = 1/4 mile. One hour turns.<br/><br/>27 Confederate counters<br/>41 Union counters<br/><br/>Units include infantry, artillery, cavalry, HQs (but had no use), and outposts (pickets, not in '64 Ed.).<br/><br/>Roberts redesigned this game in 1961 with hexagons.  Although it sold out, Roberts wasn't happy with it.  He then re-released it in 1964 with squares again, like the 1958 version.  However, the rules were significantly changed.<br/><br/>The 1958 version was basically a miniatures game on a map.  You used range cards (shown in the illustration) both to move your units and then to check their firing range.  Units could rotate on their centers before checking with a range card, which was placed along the front side of the rectangular pieces.  You got better odds hitting from a flank.  Artillery had double range the of infantry or cavalry (this was only optional as far as I know). There were at least 3 slightly different rule books for the '58, '59, &amp; '60 Ed., all were basically the '58 one.<br/><br/>The game also had optional rules for hidden movement.  You left the room while your opponent put his pieces on the board and moved them, recorded their new positions and removed them again!  If they came within sight of a unit (including an outpost unit), he had to tell you where they were seen, or leave them on the board if still in sight.  Line of sight rules for all this.<br/><br/>The 1964 version required you to keep your units aligned with the square grid rather than the free form miniatures style movement of the 1958 version. This really didn't work well. Units facing diagonally had to be adjacent to form a solid wall of ZOC sqs. to their front and could not therefore protect their flanks if they spread out any at all. This made doubled and tripled attacks easily possible.<br/><br/>Every version would benefit from a road movement bonus rule, x3 at a minimum (but x4 would be better, units that move this fast should not be able to attack that turn, though).<br/><br/>",

Two of your landscapes point left, the other two right. Each team has 40 hit points, and to win you need to bring the opponents down to zero. Gameplay is identical to the 1v1 version of Adventure Time Card Wars, but now you need to guard against attack from two opponents while trying to help out your partner when needed.<br/><br/>One special addition to this set is Teamwork cards, which don't occupy a lane. Each player can control one, and these cards give you and your partner a benefit turn after turn...if you play your cards right.<br/><br/>",

Do you have what it takes to be a famous football player? Find out today with  Famous First Downs - the World's Smallest Gridiron Football Game!<br/><br/><br/>Famous First Downs is a fun, fast-playing simulation of the sport of American football. The game focuses on offensive and defensive play-calling and on the need to build and manage your team&rsquo;s momentum over multiple scoring drives. Each down, the offense declares a play to which the defense secretly responds. The offense then chooses a play option, resulting in the success or failure of the play and determining any subsequent yardage. Blocked plays earn momentum for the defense while first downs earn momentum for the offense. That momentum can then be spent on special plays like interceptions, extra yards, and repeated downs. The various coins are used to track downs, momentum, and yardage. Famous First Downs is the fourth game in the Famous Games Company's line of World’s Smallest Sports Games and a personal favourite of the company's founder.<br/><br/>",

Taking on the role of a faction from the District 9 world, players vie for control of the district and its technological resources by interacting with the local population, iconic characters, and each other.<br/><br/>The game unfolds over the 3 days in which the film&rsquo;s events take place. Players begin by setting up various district tiles to create a dynamic game board. A variety of different-shaped district tiles allow for the board to be unique each play through. Players then set up their starting tile at the edge of the district, simulating where they have strategically chosen to enter. Using orders to move their units around the board, and cards to augment their abilities, players lead their faction in a bid to salvage the biggest stockpile of alien technology.<br/><br/>As the competition heats up, the unrest in District 9 escalates. Wikus&rsquo; actions during the prawn evictions, and the ensuing man-hunt, drive the stakes higher and higher until the climactic finale: when Wikus dons the prawn mech suit for his heroic last stand. The player who can weather the chaos of battle, and salvage the most alien technology, is declared the winner.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MARK is a game about collecting, processing, and reselling recycled components for a profit. Each turn, a player rolls a pair of color dice and chooses one of the showing die colors to perform an action with. Each color is tied to one type of recyclable material. A player can choose to receive a single new recyclable good to his delivery yard, or he can choose to move a single recyclable good from his delivery yard to his treatment area, or he can choose to sell one good from his treatment area to the market grid in the center of the board.<br/><br/>The market grid has 5 rows, and each row can hold only one variety of recyclable materials. When selling to the market, if it is the first time that good has been sold, the player may choose which row to sell into (left-most position in the row only), otherwise he must sell into the next empty space in the row that variety already occupies. He receives the amount of money shown on the space where he places his recyclable good. When the row is full, all goods of that type are removed from the game. The game ends when four of the market rows are completely filled.<br/><br/>If the player rolls both dice of the same color, he has no choice in which recyclable material to choose, but may perform two actions (delivery, treatment, or sale) with that type of good. In addition, there are two special symbols on the dice (one on each). One is a star symbol, which acts as a wild. The player can choose whatever color he desires. The other is a gavel, which triggers an immediate auction for the type of good shown on the other die, after which the player takes another turn. The auction is a closed-fist auction.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the player's turn, he must pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his delivery yard. He must also pay 5 dollars in storage fees if he has more than 2 recyclable materials in his treatment area. This provides tension between waiting for bigger pay-outs and selling recyclable materials early.<br/><br/>The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from a session report:<br/><br/>In essence it&rsquo;s a round-and-round trick game, combining Frank&rsquo;s Zoo with Hattrick. 4 suits valued 1-10. High beats low. Net (or joker) beats 10. A 1 (or joker) beats Net. And then we&rsquo;re back into the numbers and round we go again. The trick is won when everyone passes.<br/><br/>7&rsquo;s, 8&rsquo;s and 9&rsquo;s each have a sex. When one is played, if a player can play the same rank but of an opposite sex, a second trick is formed a la Hattrick. It&rsquo;s a powerful play, because the round then ends the moment either trick gets back to whoever played a currently winning card, improving the odds of you winning a trick. And causing all sorts of calculations as to what the best play is.<br/><br/>Winning a trick with a net, or someone playing their last card induces a new deal. If you have a crappy hand, let a net win, concede and get a new hand. Otherwise, kick-start it again with a 1.<br/><br/>In the round that someone wins their tenth trick (you start with 1, so it&rsquo;s actually the ninth trick), the last player to win their tenth trick in that same round wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player will register on his Elemental Counter the amount of each of the four natural elements (water, fire, earth and air) that are present on the table. Then the players scores according to how near their guess was. But, its not as simple as it looks! Some tokens combine the elements in random ways and also if your guess is too high you score 0!<br/><br/><br/>Desde el inicio de los tiempos los cuatro elementos realizan una danza constante, de lejos pareciera ser una lucha.

        "description": "The Royal Banquet, September 1256: Despite the sumptuous dishes, tension fills the air of the great hall. Numerous guests had accepted the invitation to the funeral service for the late queen, and now await the mourning king&rsquo;s eulogy. After all, he is now without an heir to the throne &ndash; and many of those present sense an opportunity for themselves. When the king finally rises, there is a hushed silence. He raises his goblet and lets his keen gaze wander from face to face. &ldquo;Few of you are here to mourn my beloved wife with me,&rdquo; the king begins, and takes a sip from the goblet. Suddenly he begins to cough and puts his hand to his throat. He collapses, knocking food from the table. A murmur goes through the crowd as orders are shouted frantically for aid. The king is carried out of the hall in a hurry, and minutes of dismay pass. Then the personal doctor emerges and announces to all, &quot;The king is dead!&quot;<br/><br/>In UNDO: Long Live the King, players learn the rules and encounter the starting situation of the case on the first few cards, which also guide them through the setup. Once the setup is complete, players carry out nine time jumps. Every jump takes them to one independent moment from the past and allows them to change that moment in one of three ways, which may change the starting situation for better or for worse. The players need to discuss what they know and try to come up with theories about the story, using the clues they gather from the different time jumps. Only by continuously adapting their theories and making the right choices will they successfully change fate and save the life of the king.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The diversity of doctrines, weapons, training methods and leadership in medieval armies was a function of the geographic and cultural diversity in which those armies originated. Consequently, many military systems developed along divergent lines until the time of the widespread use of gunpowder, which dominated Renaissance warfare. Black Prince: Crecy &amp; Navarette (BP) reflects that diversity by simulating two battles, both of which represented a clash of distinct weapons and tactics.<br/><br/>Navarette is a simulation of the conflict between English and Castilian forces and their French allies near the Spanish village of Najera on 3 April 1367, during the Hundred Years War. The battle marked the culmination of the Black Prince&rsquo;s campaign to overthrow the usurper Henry the Bastard and regain the throne of Castille for the rightful king, Pedro the Cruel. The scales are 50 yards per hex, 500 men per standard counter, 1,500 per double-length counter, and 20 minutes per game turn.<br/><br/>At Crecy, in 1346, the French knights in Philip&rsquo;s army were the elite of the country, and felt themselves to be the epitome of chivalry. That led them to treat the foot soldiers of both sides with contempt. Thus, when charging, only English knights were worthy of their attention. Also, when their own archers faltered before the hail of English arrows, they saw them as cowards and traitors not worthy of being on the field. The scales here are 80 yards per hex, 400 to 500 men per standard counter, 1,200 per double-length counter, and 40 minutes per game turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: rout, plat armor, English longbows, crossbows, leadership and much more.

        "description": "In Sudoku: Duell der Meister, the board is the standard 9x9 grid split into 3x3 blocks. Each player gets 12 scoring markers and 36 number tiles in his colour. These are mixed up face-down. Nine golden numbers are placed onto the board so that there's a single number in each 3x3 block. Players take turns revealing one of their numbers and adding it to the board (following the rules of Sudoku). As soon as a player has a majority in a row, column, or block, he places one of his scoring markers onto the matching scoring spot along the edge of the board. In the event of a tie, the player with the highest number sum gets to place the marker. The goal of the game is to be the first one to claim 12 majorities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the first of a series of games. Four battles are represented in a single box: Marston Moor, Naseby, Justice Mills and Kilsyth.<br/><br/>Royalists and Roundheads contains four of the most important battles of the English Civil War. Taking place at the dawn of modern warfare, the war led to the creation of the New Model army, the basis of the British army until the start of the twentieth century. As the pike and tercio failed, the gun rose to become the most important tool of the infantry. The English Civil War was the testing ground for these new weapons of destruction.<br/><br/>The game features an innovative, easy to use command system, that recreates the problems of command in an elegant and simple way. Leaders are rated for command, initiative and combat. Weapons range from pikes, muskets and artillery to bows and lances. Each of the four games is complete in itself, and can be played in 1-1/2 to 3 hours, with the ever-present possibility of one side or the other triggering an automatic victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Capek Golems is a card game for two players who take on the roles of competing engineer-alchemists trying to create Capek Golems, creatures who are an amalgam of steampunk technology and biological raw materials. Players will be using cards to buy scientific inquiry and field research resources racing to activate their golems before the tide of public outrage turns against them. A Public Outrage Track is used for this. If this track reaches (25) both players will lose, so they must work cooperatively to keep the public at ease about their experiments while still competing against each other.<br/><br/>Requirements:<br/>For this game you&rsquo;ll need the deck of 54 cards consisting of:<br/><br/>&bull; 12 Capek Golem body part cards, 6 per player<br/>&bull; 39 game cards showing areas of scientific inquiry, gold coins and field research journal entries<br/>&bull; 3 cards which make up the Auction House and Public Outrage Track<br/>&bull; 40 markers for the Capek Golem cards (eurocubes work well) [Alternately you can use 6d6 per player, placing one die on each Golem card and rotating the die up each time a resource is gained towards the specified total.] and one additional marker for the Public Outrage Track<br/><br/>To win a player must activate all six parts of their Capek Golem. Activating a single card includes having all Field Research resources as well as playing one set of Scientific Inquiry cards matching the number total on one of the two colored circular icons. If the Public Outrage Track ever reaches (25) both players lose the game.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>A player may do any of the following actions but may do each action only once during that turn:<br/>1. Buy cards from the Auction Area and play them immediately or place it in your hand.<br/>Purchase a single card at its Auction value by discarding cards with an equal or greater number of gold coins. Then discard it immediately and take Field Research resources as indicated, and move the token up or down the Public Outrage Track, or place the card in your hand and use it later on for its gold value or to complete a Scientific Inquiry set. Repeat buying a card as desired.<br/><br/>2. Discard a set of Scientific Inquiry cards and mark gained resources on your Capek Golem Cards.<br/>Discarding a completed set, matching both a color and number as indicated on a Capek Golem card, allows you to place a marker in that resource area, helping to activate that card. You can choose either of the two color types to collect for a set, but you cannot make a set with a mix of both colors. There are 3 special wild cards in the game which may be used in any set and can take the place of one or two cards (as marked). If you use one of these cards in a Scientific Inquiry set, you must move the token on the Public Outrage Track as indicated.<br/><br/>3. Discard one card to draw two new cards from the Draw Pile.<br/>A player may discard any one card from his hand to draw two new cards from the Draw Pile.<br/><br/>Additional Rules of Play:<br/>If at the start of a player&rsquo;s turn the player has fewer than two cards in hand, they should draw two cards from the Draw Pile before completing any of the three actions.<br/><br/>If the Draw Pile is ever exhausted, shuffle the Discard Pile and create a new Draw Pile.<br/><br/>If at any time the marker is moved to the (25) space on the Public Outrage Track the game ends immediately and both players lose.<br/><br/>Winner of the BGG Quick Print and Play Design Challenge<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Escoba is a traditional spanish card game which means &quot;broom&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is played with a 40-card Spanish deck with cards worthing 1 to 10 in each of the four suits. It can be played from 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>The game is played through several rounds in which the dealer deals 3 cards to each player. After dealing the first time, the dealer puts 4 cards on the table.<br/><br/>The players take turns playing a card from their hand and trying to sum exactly 15 adding the card played to any combination of cards in the table, if the player is able to do so he &quot;wins&quot; the cards adding up 15. If there are several combinations available, the player chooses which cards &quot;wins&quot;. If the player takes all the cards in the table he scores a &quot;Escoba&quot; which is worth 1 point at the end of the game. If the player can't add up to 15 he leaves his card over the table and then the next player play a card.<br/><br/>After all cards are played, the dealer deals another 3 cards to each player and another round is played. Rounds are played until there are no cards left in the deck. At that time, the player &quot;won&quot; cards last, &quot;win&quot; the remaining cards on the table and scores are calculated.<br/><br/>Bonus points are awarded:<br/><br/><br/>     1 ponit for each &quot;Escoba&quot;  <br/>     1 point for the player who &quot;won&quot; most cards<br/>     1 point for the player with most &quot;Oros&quot; (the golden coin suit)<br/>     1 point for the player with most sevens<br/>     1 point for the player with with the seven of &quot;Oros&quot;<br/><br/><br/>In case of tie nobody scores the bonus point.<br/><br/>Special event: if when the dealer places the initial 4 cards on the table, they add up 15, the dealer &quot;wins&quot; all of them and scores a &quot;Escoba&quot;.<br/><br/>The player with most points win. The game can be played through several hands adding the points from each hand to a determined total.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

To start the round, a card is revealed that has a yes/no question in red and a different yes/no question in yellow. All players answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to the question corresponding to their secret color by placing a token on the &quot;Yup&quot; or &quot;Nope&quot; end of the card. Two other cards are then revealed, with players answering them in the same way.<br/><br/>Using these clues, you want to identify someone &mdash; anyone! &mdash; who's on your squad. Everyone raises a finger, and on the count of three, you point at someone who seems like a good fit. (In a three-player game, you might be alone, and if you think you are, you point at yourself.) Everyone then reveals their squad affiliation, and if you guessed correctly, you score points; you also score if someone correctly identified you as being part of their squad.<br/><br/>You then reshuffle the squad cards and play another round. Whoever has the most points after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>This is an English-language update of the German game #no secrets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BABEL is a balancing game in which players make a tower of paper by building walls of different heights. This game has three modes of play: hidden identity mode (saboteurs may exist), limited communication co-operative mode (players use strange languages - frog, robot, dog, cat, no words), and random co-operative mode (players may not choose walls).<br/><br/>In hidden identity mode, players are secretly assigned a role: Builder or Saboteur (Fanatic is the 2nd Edition). A Builder's goal is to build an eight-tier tower, and a Saboteur's goal is to make one of the builders collapse the tower.<br/><br/>The 2nd edition, published in 2017, kept the gameplay the same, but made significant changes to the components of the 1st edition (2016). The original edition had the player's Height cards also acting as the actual floors of the tower. The Height card had a sort of Pac-man shape. By combining two pieces, you made the hexagonal floor you would build. The player building the level was meant to arrange the floor parts to match the wall parts. That is, if the heights combined are a 3 and a 5, the 3-wall goes over the 3-floor, and the 5-wall goes over the 5-floor.<br/><br/>The 2017 edition did away with this physical mechanism; instead, players had normal playing cards numbered 1 to 5, and wholly separate floor tiles to actually build with. This edition also introduced a new card 'Break Down The Wall', which means that only one wall piece is used in the level being built. Also, in the new edition, the tower starts with a floor, and on your turn you place two walls and then the floor. The new edition also has a sturdier box and is slightly larger.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each player has three cards in their hand. In your turn, you place a floor card, which is numbered 1-5, face-up, and other players place a floor card face-down, saying a hint (saboteurs might be misleading you). Then you choose and reveal one of these face-down cards (the unused go unseen to a discard pile), take a floor tile (in the 2016 edition - combine the chosen card with yours to make a hexagonal floor), and take two walls that correspond to the floor numbers. You must place the floor and the walls on top of tower without making it collapse. Height of walls gradually vary over floor numbers, so you should pick the same number if you want to build an upright tower.<br/><br/>If you are a saboteur, it's up to you whether you secretly or explicitly betray the builders. You may try to mislead builders to take unbalanced walls, or boldly build up a skewed tower in your turn. But beware. Your side loses the game if you make the tower collapse yourself. You may also reveal your identity during your turn, in which case builders need to complete one more floor to win the game.<br/><br/>In the co-operative mode, players may loosely discuss which card ought to be selected (you cannot say obvious info, such as 'my card is a 3!'). But discussions are done in foreign languages - dog, cat, frog, robot, and no words. You are dealt a card and can only use your given language to communicate.<br/><br/>The game can be played as a solitaire but only in random mode. You randomly take two floor cards and use the corresponding walls to build one tier. Repeat the process until you build 12-tier tower without it falling.<br/><br/>There is an instructional manga by 七色洋品店 (Nanairo Youhinten) in the first edition. The second edition has a manga by Ayame Gonta (あやめ ゴン太). These are online on the Game Market webpage for the game (see links below).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>BABEL is a dexterity game where you build a tower using walls of<br/>unoriented heights.<br/>You may play the game in 3 variations:<br/><br/>     Hidden identity mode - the traitor secretly tries to collapse the tower<br/>     Co-op mode - as postfin of the myth, build with limited communications<br/>     Solitaire mode - build the tower as high as you can with random draw of walls<br/><br/><br/>Difference between the first edition and the 2017 new version:<br/>The following improvements were made from the version sold at TGM2016.<br/>1: Introduced the &quot;Height Card&quot;. No need to combine the floor cards anymore.<br/>2: Introduced the &quot;Break down the wall&quot; card. When played, the active<br/>player must build the tower with only 1 wall card this turn.<br/>3: Construction order for each turn altered, from floor=&gt;wall to wall=&gt;floor.<br/>4: More sturdier box.<br/><br/>BABELは不ぞろいのカードを積み上げて、塔を完成させるバランスゲームです。<br/>裏切り者が暗躍する正体隠匿モード、神話の後日談が楽しめる完全協力モード、ランダムにカードを積む神の戯れモード1パッケージで3つのモードが楽しめます。<br/><br/>初版と2017年新版との違い：<br/>2016年にゲームイベント『ゲームマーケット』にて頒布した初版から、下記の点が改良されています。<br/>１．高さ番号カードが導入され、半分ずつの床を組み合わせる必要がなくなりました。<br/>２．壁柱1枚で支えなければならない〈破壊カード〉が追加されました。<br/>３．手番での建設行程が、床&rarr;壁から壁&rarr;床に変わりました。<br/>４．箱が頑丈になりました。<br/><br/>BABELは不揃いの高さの壁カードを積み上げ塔を完成させるバランスゲームです。裏切り者が暗躍する正体隠匿モード、神話の後日談を楽しむ母語が使えなくなる完全協力モード、ランダムに壁カードを積む髪の戯れモード、1パッケージで3つのモードが楽しめます。　●正体隠匿モード●　人数＋１枚の人格カードを配り、建設者(建てたい人)狂信者(壊したい人)を決定します。床カード5種を各3枚配り、手番プレイヤーはその中から1枚を表にして出します。他のプレイヤーは一言そえて裏向きにカードを出します。手番プレイヤーはその中から1枚選び床カードを組み合わせ1枚にし、対応する、高さの違う壁カード(5種類あります)をそれぞれの床の上にのせます。8段積めたら建設者の勝ち、塔を崩したらその陣営の負けになります。また、狂信者は自分の手番に正体を明かすことで、完成段数を1段上げることができます。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Fletcher Pratt's Naval War Game&quot; is a set of Naval miniature wargame rules for World War I and World War II ship battles, extremely popular during the 1940's.<br/><br/>From the Introduction:  [A] game that can be played by almost anyone, not too heavily upholstered to bend over and maneuver a model ship across the floor.  It is also, fortunately, a game whose practical details can be learned in 15 minutes or less, in spite of the apparent complexity of the rules.  Having been told how to maneuver his ship by the speed-scale and how to lay the firing arrows, the rest is up to the individual's keenness of eye and his ability to keep cool amid excitements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>&quot;Sueca is a 4 players game, that plays with two teams, partners sitting opposite from each other. It is played with 40 cards (remove the 8s, 9s, 10s from a standard 52 card deck). The rank of the cards in each suit, from highest rank to lowest one, is: Ace, 7, King, Jack, Queen, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. As well as the high position of the seven, notice that the jack beats the queen..<br/><br/>The game is played clockwise. The first dealer is chosen at random and the turn to deal passes to the left after each hand.The player to the dealer's right shuffles the cards and the player at the dealer's left cuts. The dealer then gives 10 cards to each player, in a single batch, beginning with the player to dealer's left, going around clockwise and ending with the dealer. The bottom card of the deck, which belongs to the dealer, is turned face up, and its suit becomes trumps.Alternatively, the dealer can choose to deal the first ten cards to himself, the next ten to the player to his right, and so on counter-clockwise. In this case the dealer's first card (the original top card of the deck) is turned up and determines the trump suit.<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer (the one who cut the cards) leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can. A player who has no card of the suit led may play any card. If any cards of the trump suit are played to a trick, the highest trump wins. Otherwise, the trick is won by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of each trick leads to the next.<br/><br/>Being considered a &quot;deaf-dumb persons game&quot; in Portugal, there can be no talking between the players and no exchange of signals between partners (considered cheating in tournament play). In casual play, though, this rule is frequently overridden, with signs actually being negotiated between partners prior to playing, which adds a different level of fun to the game - as each team tries to discover the others cheating signs so they can get the upper hand in play.<br/><br/>In Sueca, the aim is to win tricks containing valuable cards. The card values are:<br/>Ace ..... 11 points<br/>7 ..... 10 points<br/>King ..... 4 points<br/>Jack ..... 3 points<br/>Queen ..... 2 points<br/>The rest of the cards = no points.<br/><br/>There are 120 points in the deck altogether.<br/><br/>The object of the play is to win tricks containing more than half of the card points. The team which takes more than 60 card points scores one game. The first team to score four games win the rubber.<br/><br/>If a team takes 91 or more card points in tricks on one deal, they score two games instead of one.<br/><br/>If they take all the tricks they score four games and thus win the rubber immediately. Taking 120 points but losing a trick (with no counting cards in it) is not sufficient to win the rubber. In this case the winning team would just score 2 games for having more than 90.<br/><br/>In case of tie it's considered a null game... no team gets any point.&quot;<br/><br/>There is a variant called Sueca Italiana which is for 5 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this twist on the classic word game, Scrabble, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. The twist is that now, proper names such as cities or celebrity names will now be allowed.  Other twists include &quot;playing words backwards or playing words unconnected to others on the board,&quot; Mattel said.  The game is a limited edition and will not replace the original Scrabble.<br/><br/>Just like regular Scrabble, each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>Not all precise details are known yet as Scrabble Trickster is due out in July in the U.K. only.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "REICH portrays events in Germany between the Reformation and the unification engineered by Bismarck. Players are not bound to a pre-determined sequence of events; rather, major social forces are used to compose game elements. These include Marxist agitation, religious riots, peasant uprisings, revolts, Papal recognition, key ministers (like the Iron Chancellor himself), foreign intervention and aid, mobilizations and wars, etc., making up a game system both exciting and flavorful.<br/><br/>Each player becomes a Prince attempting to unify a fragmented Germany by means of adroit diplomacy, cunning bargains, and sudden mobilizations and armed strikes. Each turn allows for card play and interaction, then demands that the phasing player choose one of four exclusive policies in the ensuing Action Phase. Player intelligence, elan, and flexibility determine a game's outcome, with little reference to luck. Opportunities for conclusive action are many, but must be seized decisively and courageously. Winning or losing, REICH is a memorable and enjoyable experience for every player.<br/><br/>",

A player knows who their assassin is in real life, but not who they are playing in the game. They move around by secretly playing movement cards that are all shuffled together before being read and played.<br/><br/>The goal is to catch your target while evading your assassin. Points are scored for successfully assassinating a player, identifying your would-be killer, or scaring players into making mistakes as a ghost from beyond the grave, so even dead players are still in on the action!<br/><br/>Can you safely navigate the treacherous crowds of the most dangerous AssassinCon yet?<br/><br/>",

Each round, the players bid on flowers in the flower clock using their fireflies. They can also plant a flower from their hand into one of their gardens, secretly bid a royal firefly, and also discard one of the cards in their had to the compost heap so they can bid a second firefly on the flower clock. Each of the six types of beautifully colored flowers has a special ability which players can utilize to form combos and add benefits to their play. Additionally, orchid/weed cards can be bid on, and these allow players to add bonuses to their gardens or attack an opponent's garden.<br/><br/>A round ends once all players have taken their turns and drawn back up to three flowers in their hand and the sundial has turned one card clockwise to see which flowers are coming off the flower clock that round. Once all the flowers have been exhausted from the potting shed (i.e., the draw deck), the game ends and points are totaled for flower beds created to see who wins and becomes the next royal gardener.<br/><br/>",

To set up for a round, reveal a mission card, then assemble the unique Amis pieces into the blocks indicated by the mission parameters, e.g, create three blocks each of three pieces, two blocks of four pieces, and two blocks of five pieces. You then assemble these blocks into a 3x3x3 cube, adjusting them as needed (while staying within mission parameters) to ensure that you can create a cube. Once you do this, you disassemble the cube into the blocks that you've created.<br/><br/>Players then reveal a draft card to indicate which size block they should pass; each player individually chooses one of their blocks, then they pass them simultaneously in the direction indicated, after which they each race to build a 3x3x3 cube first, now with one of the opponent's blocks in place of their own. Players score points depending on their order of finish each round, and if you have the best score after four rounds, you win!<br/><br/>",

They decide to prepare for winter early this time.<br/><br/>Over the course of 3 seasons 2 squirrels play cards to fill their nest. The one with the most food when winter starts wins the game.<br/><br/>This dexterity game for kids from age 4 and up combines tactile, strategic and dexterity elements into an engaging, fun experience. During a round (spring, summer or fall) each player takes 4 cards from the deck. Alternating turns the players play the cards and perform actions like:<br/><br/>     get 3 food from the bag and put them in their nest (a round wooden ring) <br/>     drop an owl ball on their opponent's nest<br/>     steal a food from your opponent with the magpie card<br/><br/><br/>All food that falls out of the nest lands in the clutter. The clutter can be deducted from the total amount of collected food, depending on the version you are playing.

This allows a player to choose the most beneficial result, but in turn means that opponents' riders will also move.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as all 3 messengers on a team reach the goal or eight total messengers have reached the goal. The team that has the most messengers at the goal wins. In the case of a tie, the player whose messenger crossed last wins.

        "description": "This is low-to intermediate-complexity, two-player, examination of the historic alternative to Montgomery's ill-fated Operation Market Garden. Instead of his left-jab through lowland Holland to the Rhine, we have Patton's proposed right-hook, starting at Metz and swinging north and east toward the Ruhr for a war-winning knockout blow. Or, as an alternative within an alternative, the Allied player may try for a more conservative push straight east to the Rhine, there to create a bridgehead over that German river, thereby likely advancing the advent of V-E Day by at least three or four months.<br/><br/>As soon as you begin to game Patton's alternative to Montgomery's all or nothing plan, it becomes clear what a huge opportunity Eisenhower missed by backing the wrong subordinate. That is, for the British field marshal's plan to have succeeded, it really did have to go all the way, or at least get across the Rhine in some significant way. Failing short of both the Rhine and the Ruhr, as happened historically, meant a month had been wasted and a lot of lives lost only to create a salient to nowhere. Had Patton's idea been tried, only to fail as badly, a salient of that same size &ndash; but  jutting north into the Rhineland from a base at Metz &ndash; would've done much more for the Allied cause.<br/><br/>We've broadened the appeal of this design beyond those who enjoy alternative history by including a second, historical, scenario. At first we were only going to cover the actual Market-Garden portion of Montgomery's operations in September 1944. It quickly became apparent, however, portrayed at these time, space and unit scales, such a game would be a dud, with a map only nine hexes long and three wide. So we broadened the thing's shoulders by expanding the coverage to take in all Montgomery's possibilities that fateful month. So now you can choose a straight-up historic approach, or you can have alternative history within your actual history.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map equals seven miles from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents three days. Playing pieces represent divisions, brigades, combat commands, Kampfgruppen and regiments of various kinds of infantry and armor formations, each containing from about 3,000 to 14,000 men and 50 to 400 or so armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>",

Knights of Justice is a grand tactical level simulation of the Islamic attempt to crush the Knights Hospitallers during the year 1565.<br/><br/>In May 1565, an Ottoman expedition between 26,000 and 39,000 men strong landed on Malta. Grand Master Jean Parisot de la Valette (GM 1557-1568) had a force of 592 knights, to which several thousand arms-bearing men drawn from the Maltese population were also added. The Ottomans quickly defeated the Maltese militia, became master of the countryside and laid siege to the fortress, which was stubbornly defended by the Knights Hospitallers. After four months of siege, the knights, in a desperate fight over St. Elmo Fort and its natural harbor, inflicted heavy casualties (according to reports, 7,000 dead) on the Ottoman forces. Following the landing of 6,000 - 8,000 reinforcements from Sicily, the Knights again defeated the Ottomans, which embarked and left.<br/><br/>",

Each turn is divided into three phases. Draw, Main and Combat phase.<br/><br/>In the draw phase each player takes turn drawing two station cards and two investor cards. When all have done the draw phase the Main phase begins.<br/><br/>In the main phase each player takes turn playing station cards from the hand to the player's station. They can either be played as a standalone module or extend existing once into more advanced modules. Cards can have production, requirements, attack, defense and victory points. The player will try to build a station that meets the demands of the two investor cards draw in previous phase. Investor are worth different amount of victory points, some are easy to claim while others require a big station. Some cards even has special abilities that apply when part of a station. When all have done the main phase the combat phase begins. Unclaimed investor cards are discarded (new once are draw in the draw phase).<br/><br/>In the combat phase a player may choose to attack another player's station using modules with attack values or discard cards from the hand that gives additional attacks.<br/><br/>When the last card in the draw pile has been drawn a last turn is played.

        "description": "Impact City Roller Derby ( ICRD ) is a fast paced board game for 2 or 4 players based on flat track roller derby.<br/><br/>Game play is done by moving your team of 5 roller derby girls around the board trying to get your Jammer to pass more opposing derby girls than your opponents Jammer.<br/><br/>Games should take between 90 minutes to 2 hours if you play all the possible Jams.  The game uses strategic movement of your players to pass or block opposing players.  A variety of dice (D6, D8, D10 and D12) are used to determine the success of key moves but dice rolling is kept to a minimum during a turn (normally moving all 5 players should only require 0 to 3 dice rolls).<br/><br/>In addition, each lap of the track the coach (ie you) will have a hand of 3 special move cards which will give you options for special offensive or defensive plays straight from normal flat track derby play (like a Leg Whip or Hip Check). There are also Foul cards which allow you to risk breaking the rules to give your team a key advantage, however the referee might catch you and send you to the penalty box.<br/><br/>Game play was kept true to the rules for the sport of flat track roller derby, while also trying to make the game fast paced and fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Glyph is a dice-building combat strategy game for 2-6 players. Players are tasked with forming a team of three champions and defeat their opponent. These Champions are broken up into three distinct classes--Strikers, Guardians, and Adherents--with each Champion having his or her own strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities which you will use by harnessing the power of mystical glyphs. As the game progresses, your Champions will have the opportunity to acquire new items which will enhance their capabilities as well as perhaps give them even more skills to use to defeat your enemy.<br/><br/>Glyph utilizes an intriguing dice-building and card-drafting mechanic, which rewards tactical thought as well as provides exciting gameplay. The dice in the game represent ancient powers, which each color of dice having a unique face structure tailored to specific Glyphs. Each Glyph serves a specific purpose and, through rolling and manipulating the dice, your Champions will be able to perform actions ranging from devastating attacks, to fortified defensive stances, to supportive aid. Each Champion also has various item slots available and you will be able to acquire unique weapons and armor to aid you in combat. Some items are rather simple and provide minor boosts to your champion's dice pool, while others have their own unique abilities that only the wearer of the item can perform.<br/><br/>These items come at a cost, however: you may be required to spend [read: trash] dice from your own champion's pool in order to acquire these powerful items. This makes item acquisition much more than merely taking an available card--you will need to weigh the costs and benefits of these items and determine if sacrificing the requisite dice is worth it.<br/><br/>The decisions you make each round will have a lasting influence on the tide of battle. Do you take advantage of a weakened Champion and attack or try to accumulate wealth to purchase a suit of armor to protect you in subsequent rounds? Battle will rage until there is but one side left standing. Will you bring honor or disgrace to your tribe?<br/><br/>",

A man (Шашка) moves forwards only, but it can capture forwards and backwards. Men are promoted to kings (Дамка, actually meaning lady) upon reaching the back row. If this happens within a capture, the piece is promoted, too, and must, if possible, carry on capturing as a king. Kings fly in movement and capture. A move may not end when there is still a capture possible, but there is no need to choose the path with the maximum number of captures. The game ends when a player cannot move, either because his pieces are blocked or because he lost them all.<br/><br/>Shashki was the dominant game in Russia before the rise of Chess. It is still very popular and played in tournaments. There is a plethora of variants, some of which, notably Bashni (column Shashki) and Shashki Poddavki (give-away Shashki), are played in tournaments as well.<br/><br/>",

Its combat style involved 1:285 scale micro armour miniatures. When it was first created it used the 1/87 scale miniatures that were common but this later changed.<br/><br/>The game came as a boxed set containing three booklets illustrated by Don Lowry.<br/><br/>Tractics was innovative when it was published due to the fact that it was the first game that was published using a 20-sided die.<br/><br/>In 1968 Reese and Tucker, two members of the LGTSA, began play-testing rules for tank combat that would eventually form the core of Tractics. Gygax contributed some rules on infantry, covered in the second booklet, and the third booklet would cover additional topics such as airstrikes and the MODERN period (which at the time included rumors of the XM-1 tank).<br/><br/>The players must first acquire the miniatures and build the terrain. Reese and Tucker were interested in an accurate simulation, and as a result the game provides data describing the rate of movement, thickness of armor, and rate of fire for the makes of tank in service from 1940 to 1970. The tanks in Tractics have a 30% chance to hit a target which in essence means rolling at least a 15 on the 20 sided die. The modifiers of battle apply depending upon several factors such as concealment. The game is consequently slower to conduct than a board wargame such as Tactics II. For miniature wargamers who felt that the amount of detail was excessive, Reese and Tucker recommended their earlier Fast Rules (1970) although that set covered WWII only.<br/><br/>Tractics requires the use of a judge. Since players are unaware of their enemies locations, the pieces are placed on the map only when they are detected or they march to an open view.<br/><br/>",

In The Cat, players try to change the moods of their cats quickly via simultaneous card play. Each player receives three or four stacks of four cards, depending on the number of players. On the cards, you can see cats in thirteen different moods: sometimes winking, sometimes friendly, sometimes grinning widely. Your goal is to have only cards of a single mood in each stack.<br/><br/>Once a round begins, all players simultaneously exchange exactly one card from one of their stacks with a card from the center of the table; exchanging cards from one stack to another is forbidden. As soon as a player has collected four identical cards in each of their stacks, they shout, &quot;Stop!&quot; to end the current round. Everyone then reveals their stacks, and for each stack with four identical cards, the owner of that stack scores 1 point. The player who ended the round scores 1 bonus point as long as they didn't make a mistake; if they did, they score 0 points for the round. The game ends as soon as a player has reached 20 points, and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

The Germans hoped to take Russia out of the war, but they never dreamed how much the world would change.<br/><br/>Now, Against the Odds lets you explore the tangled facets of the Russian Civil War, with the historical situation exemplified by a game that handles two to four players&hellip;with up to three of them commanding the &ldquo;White&rdquo; Russian factions! (In multi-player games, if the Reds are defeated, the game isn&rsquo;t over yet!) For Bloody Honor: Civil War Russkaya captures the interactions of political influence, railways, foreign intervention, and the discord among the White factions that gave the Bolsheviks their best chance to win in a battle against &mdash; as it seemed to them &mdash; their internal enemies and the whole Western Alliance. (Yes, there were British, French, Canadian, Australian, Indian, Japanese, and even U.S. troops fighting in Russia as late as 1920&hellip;and even later for the Japanese).<br/><br/>For Bloody Honor includes 10 game turns, each representing 4 months of real time from the end of 1918 to the end of 1921, and driven by chit pull which will guarantee no two turns are alike. Units represent organized troops of various sizes, with each counter (except tanks) of relatively equal strength. Yes, depending on the situations, this can become a &ldquo;buckets of dice&rdquo; game&hellip;or the fate of a region (and the political points that go with it) may hinge on a single unit. Defeat can be costly, not only in lost units but in the potential for defecting as your units may decide the other side has more to offer them!<br/><br/>Can you, as the Reds, repeat history and form a Union of Soviet Socialists Republics?

Now, Firefight Games offers it as a wargame. The game is unique for the rules cover everything in simplicity yet, making the correct decision makes it tough to master! Political influence and recruiting plays a vital and realistic role, for these decisions will impact military units and their use! Technology (tanks, aircraft) is important but it alone cannot win the game. The beautiful area map conveys at a glance the massive expanses of the war, for each area plays a critical political role. The game is deceptively simple to learn, yet, like Chess, hard to master. A grand strategic game on the Russian Civil War from 1918 to 1922, with each turn being four months, units represent 5 - 15,000 men, while tanks, aircraft, armor cars and armor trains are abstracted amounts. One player plays the Red , the other plays the White Factions (Polish, Kolchak, Denikin etc). The map is divided into zones. The game, designed by Mark Woloshen, designed a game that is used frequently by his students to learn about the complexities of the RCW. Thus, it is focused on how the political influence and control impacted the military events. One cannot win by military means alone. The game relies on activations and recruiting new men to man the armies is of major importance subject the game's political realities! Unlike other strategic RCW games, this plays in a few hours' time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's a race to the finish when some super-smart, yet somehow clueless, engineering students invent rocket-powered skis and decide to test them out at Yeti Mountain!<br/><br/>In Avalanche at Yeti Mountain, players play multipurpose cards &mdash; the same cards used to make up the ski slopes of Yeti Mountain &mdash; to determine their speed in a race down the mountain. If the skiers collectively exceed the speed limit, which is determined by the number of players, the fastest skiers crash, only moving one space forward down the mountain.<br/><br/>Players may also activate rocket jumps to overshoot the competition, but at the expense of causing an avalanche to begin chasing them down the mountain. If that's not enough tension, rocket jumps are possible only if the Yeti, awoken from his slumber by all of the rocket-powered racket, doesn't attack and deactivate players' rocket-powered skis! The last skier standing, or the skier who makes it to the bottom of Yeti Mountain, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

With the world's nations in decline, powerful corporations now stand as humanity's last hope. Take the reins of one such corporation, as CEO, and venture out into space. With your mission in hand; build ships, collect resources, research technologies, survive the dangers of space exploration, and, while ticket sales hold steady, preserve the human race. Remember to stay a step ahead of competing corporations, which can use slick marketing campaigns and 10 cent tchotchkes to buy the loyalty of the people you just saved from certain doom!<br/><br/>In Disaster Looms!, players are rewarded points for sticking to the mission and building colonies, and saving colonists. As you are a CEO you are also rewarded points for filling the Corporate treasury, and building the company's value proposition by retaining rights to the best technologies. Gameplay is fast, and exciting. Events, and the vast variety of hazards that space has to offer will keep you on your toes, and your underlings busy on the paperwork for decades to come!<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases:  Research, Fleet, Management, Revenue, and finally First Player Turn Auction. All players will complete each phase, in turn order, before proceeding to the next phase. This helps to keep the game moving, and keeps players engaged. In Research phase players can pay to research, or choose to license another players tech. In the Fleet phase players get one action with each ship they own. The Management phase is when players build new ships, special tech items, and sell technology to the public domain. The Revenue phase is when players collect their hard earned resources, including a small stipend from their home office on Earth. And finally, the turn auction phase is a bidding war for who goes first. Not that important at the start of the game, but monumental for the end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Day of the Dead is a highly strategic card game that turns you and a friend into necromancers! Summon the best team of undead fighters and in six turns you&rsquo;ll be named Super Grand Master, a highly coveted and extremely descriptive title.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each necromancer is given a hand containing nine cards. They represent an eccentric collection of skeletons, zombies, vampires, ghouls, and other spooks. Each turn, you select one of these weird characters and send it to the field. Once your opponent has done the same, the fun begins! All the fighters pair off and fight to the death. Normally, this sort of thing would be dangerous, but undead are durable and really get into the spirit of the thing.<br/><br/>Winners score points while losers are flipped face down. Undead are resilient, so losing fighters will reassemble themselves in time for next turn&rsquo;s battle. But if you don&rsquo;t think your losing fighter will do better next turn, you can pull him out of line and turn him into a spirit. Spirits are the ultimate fans, boosting the power of all of your fighters. Some spirits even let you replace weaker fighters!<br/><br/>Strategy in Day of the Dead centers around positioning; when played in the right place, any fighter can be a champion. On the other hand, even your favorite fighter can be a total failure if you are too stubborn to pull him out of a losing matchup. Stay flexible and you will bury your competition.<br/><br/>Turn Order<br/><br/>     Summoning &mdash; When you bring new cards to the field.<br/>         A New Slot Opens &mdash; Each turn a new slot opens up on the field for both players. On the first turn, each player takes a card from their hand and places it as a fallen fighter in this new slot. On each turn after that, they will take their current spirit card and place it there.<br/>         Play a New Card &mdash; Fighters start their undeath as spirits, face down and slightly below the field. Spirits are also rotated 90 degrees to show that they are special. When considering what card to play, remember that you can only have 2 cards of each back in play. On turn 6, the final turn, you are allowed to break this rule and choose whatever card back you want.<br/>         The Field Becomes Active &mdash; Flip all cards on the field face up (except for your spirit, it&rsquo;s not on the field though it&rsquo;s watching with considerable interest). If any player chose an Unearth card to be their spirit, they resolve this effect now. Then you&rsquo;re ready to fight!<br/>    <br/>     Fighting &mdash; When your fighters get to work.  Fights resolve one by one, starting with the newest slot and going to the oldest. Fights are 1 on 1 affairs and follow rigid rules. Be aware of what spirits each player has, as they will affect the outcome of each fight.<br/>         Use Effects &mdash; Starting with the player who has the Priority counter, both fighters use their effects. Fighters must use their effects if able.If a player has a Double card as their spirit, they use their fighter&rsquo;s effect, then immediately use it again.<br/>         Add Up the Power &mdash; Add on the printed power of each fighter to any bonuses they may have accumulated via effects or spirits (Remember, if a player has a Power Up card as their spirit, they will get +2 power this fight).<br/>         Compare Power &mdash; The higher-powered fighter is declared winner (in the event of a tie, both fighters are considered winners) and stays active. The lower-powered fighter is declared the loser and flips face down, becoming fallen.<br/>         The Loser May Become a Spirit  &mdash; If your fighter lost its fight this turn and you want to try something new, you can pull it from line and turn it into a spirit.<br/>         Move on to the Next Fight <br/>    <br/>     Rewards &mdash; When you gain victory points.<br/>         Score Victory Points &mdash; Each player scores victory points equal to the printed power values on their active fighters. Fallen cards score no points. Use the score board to keep track of it all.<br/>         Pass Priority &mdash; The player who currently has the priority counter passes it to the other player. Next turn, that player will be able to use their effects first. This turn is now over!<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Winning<br/><br/>     At the end of 6 turns, a winner is declared. Whoever has the most victory points is that amazing person/<br/><br/><br/>",

Throughout the game, pennies move about on the playing cards, tracking statistics and men on base.

Army Group South, accompanied by various Axis-Allied Armies, attempted to seize the valuable communications junction at Rostov and establish bridgeheads across the Donets and lower Don rivers. In the fighting around Rostov, the Germans suffered their first strategic setback in their campaign against Russia, as the Soviet Army drove the German mechanized spearhead from this vital area.

With four of a kind, it's three spaces upwards.

From a hand of five, a player lays one or more cards of one color, declares the total value, and draws one card. Following players must lay cards to beat that total in that color to stay in the round. If you can't or choose not to play, you're out and draw a final card. The round continues with players adding more cards to their total or dropping out until one player remains and that player takes a token in that color. There are joker cards (shields) of 7 or 10. First to win 4 out of the 5 colored tokens, wins the game.<br/><br/>Ridiculously simple and really great fun.

The game you thought you knew has been reimagined as a game of combat, crafting killer hands, decisive moments, and non-stop fun with every turn of the cards!<br/><br/>In Poker Assault, take control of the mysterious and maniacal Invaders, the ferocious and unrelenting Wolf Pack, the elegant and vicious Vampire Court, or the heroic aeronautical aces of the Rocket Patrol. Each team has its own custom suit theme and artwork. Play any deck versus any other deck, or even three- and four-player variants. While each deck is a legal 52-card poker deck, it's also so much more! Several cards in each deck have bonus abilities that can aid you while assaulting your opponent or defending against an assault. Additionally, if you can craft a Straight, Flush, Full House, or Four-of-a-Kind, you will earn an aptly named Power Card. These unique cards give you new strategies to pursue.<br/><br/>Chances are with your initial hand of five cards, you aren't going to have much of a poker hand. But by playing only one card at a time, and drawing a new card from your deck after each play, you can slowly build up to something great. How great is up to how risky you want to get. Craft a hand of at least a pair, and your assault is underway! Now your opponent must block your cards using the cards in their hand. The defending player likewise plays only one card at a time and draws a card from their deck after each play. To block an assaulting card, match the value (2 to Ace) or play a card of the same suit (Heart, Diamond, Club, Spade), but with a higher value. Each assaulting card that gets through knocks your opponent's hit points down by one. Bring your opponent's health to zero and you win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legacy's Allure is a customizable, card-based wargame with no randomness. Imagine chess but with customization, deeper mechanics, and a high-fantasy theme. Legacy's Allure has been called a &quot;streamlined wargame&quot; due to its elegance and accessibility.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game by drafting an army of an agreed upon size from their deck, also known as a &quot;kingdom&quot;. Then players alternate taking turns in which they may perform a single action with one of their units: moving, attacking, or using an ability. After a unit acts, it is exhausted until the end of the round and cannot act again. Once all units on the board are exhausted, they are refreshed and a new round begins. The game ends at the end of the seventh round. At that time, the attacking player wins if they occupy the central hex with one of their units. Otherwise, the defending player wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If the active player still can't flip a tile face down, then they must flip one of their already face-down tiles face up.<br/><br/>When a player creates a row of face-down tiles, whether orthogonally or diagonally, they take a star token and place it at the end of this row.

Each class has different weapons, spells, and abilities, represented by color-coded dice that simplify to-hit, armor class, damage, and criticals into one roll, easily understood at any age.<br/><br/>The game is moderated by an adult Quest Master, who guides the adventure party through a campaign of 10 maps. This adventure gradually introduces standard RPG concepts such as spells, doors, locks, potions, stun, invisibility, traps, levers, and more. As characters progress through the dungeon levels, they grow in power and have more choices to make in how they play.<br/><br/>Heroes &amp; Treasure is played on a modular board made up of large tiles, and each character and enemy is represented by stand-up pieces.<br/><br/>",

Or will you unite a group of holy guards to avert the approaching danger of the undead?<br/>It's in your hands! Manage your resources, play powerful action cards, and gather the most diverse troops under your banner!<br/>Welcome to the world of Adellos!<br/><br/>Description:<br/><br/>Adellos is a turn based fast paced tactical strategy board game for 2-4 players. Each player controls a medieval fantasy noble, who hires various units and tries to overcome the other players. Everyone plays a different faction (Royal Army, Clergy, Rebels &amp; Undead) and the players have different units with unique skills to choose and control. They also have to manage their gold income and the flow of action cards that can be used on their and enemies turns for effects that influence the game. Everything takes place on a symmetric battle map and every noble has a specific skill that influences the game from the start. The game can be won through K.O. or &bdquo;King of the Hill&ldquo;.<br/><br/>Turns are played in two phases. During the first phase, players gain resources their units provide. In the second phase, players hire units, move, attack, or play action cards. Every action costs a specific number of action points. The players start with three action points and a fix amount of gold. Players can increase their action points throughout the game to build up huge turns.<br/><br/>",

All their movements are under the control of the tower of destiny, which sometimes arranges for a companion to reach their destination a bit too late. When the last egg is collected, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>For this edition of Dragonland, some new features have been added, specifically a unicorn mechanism and token and a witch mechanism and token.

At the beginning of each segment, 1 route card per player is turned face up. During each round players may either take one route card or place two cubes. Turn order is reset for each round, with the player with fewest VPs going first. Players accumulate VPs according to the size of their railroad network(s) and by playing their route cards.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of a segment where one of the players has accumulated at least 100 VPs.<br/><br/>Robber Barons has some luck, with timing of route card plays being the most important factor, followed closely by strategic railroad building. The game includes two maps and route card decks, allowing the game to be played on US or a German setting.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, roll the dice, then move a distance equal to either die face or the sum of the die faces. When you land on a space in the castle, your figure pushes down a lever and whatever is depicted underneath that lever is then visible in the mirror. Sometimes you get to collect equipment, sometimes you must swap planks, and sometimes you do other things.<br/><br/>When you have the right equipment and can access the staircase to the top of the pillar, you can confront the Big Bad. Draw the topmost token of its stack, then look at the back of it in secret. If you can discard the item depicted, you collect that token; otherwise, you're ejected from the castle and must start moving in again. The first player to collect three tokens wins.<br/><br/>Patatrap Quest includes five Big Bads, each with its own stack of tokens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Capture: A Medieval Wargame is a game in which players use armies made up of Knights and Soldiers in an attempt to locate and capture one or more of the enemy crowns in enemy territory and safely return the crown to their home.<br/><br/>Originally designed by first-timer Andrew Hunzicker way back in the 1980s, Capture was pitched to several big name companies but never saw the shelves. Only now is it seeing the light of day, having been given a beautiful makeover to help it grab the attention of gamers in 2015. Gameplay is in the style of &quot;Capture The Flag&quot; as you roll your dice to send your soldiers into the enemy's territory while also claiming cards from a deck that will hopefully give you the edge. Should you manage to steal an enemy crown, you'll race to return it to your own side of the board while also protecting your own, but watch out for the opposition forces that will swarm around you...<br/><br/>Capture also comes with a unique element, adding a need for dexterity as well as strategy. Each game comes with a pair of catapults that allow you to fling boulders at the opposition forces, should you get the cards or dice rolls that allow you to do so. Knocking out a soldier will eliminate them, but it's not just the enemy that's under threat - should you hit your own forces, they will be eliminated as well!<br/><br/>Capture is a game that works with a wide range of gamer types, from children who delight in hurling boulders across the board to take out their parents' pieces, to experienced gamers who want to take the strategy element to the next level, only occasionally throwing in the chaos of the catapult!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Bold Stroke: The Soviet Liberation of Kiev, 1943, is a wargame simulation of the battles between the Soviet Union and the German forces for the control of Kiev and the right bank of the Dnepr River in November and December of 1943. Early November Soviets attacks blew holes in the thin German defenses, resulting in the liberation of Kiev and the pursuit to Korosten and Zhitomir.  A massive German riposte led by the XLVIII Panzerkorps stuck the Soviet flank and rolled back some of the initial Soviet Gains.  In December, additional German efforts pushed in the Soviet forces around Korosten.  Heavy Soviet reinforcements (undetected by the Germans) enabled the Soviet to return to the offensive on Christmas Eve and drive the Germans back from Kiev once and for all.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 46-page A Bold Stroke rules booklet<br/>Two single-sided Set-up Charts<br/>Two Player Aid cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/><br/>Players: 2<br/>Playing Time: 2-20 hours<br/>Complexity: Medium-High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Moderate<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's tourist season, and you have to choose which destinations to invest in, and which to market. Cleverly pass cards to manipulate your neighbours into marketing the ones you've invested in, and avoid marketing theirs.<br/><br/>Forks 2nd Edition has the simple rules and quick gameplay of Forks, but with some significant changes. The most obvious change is the theme and artwork, basing the look and style of art-deco tourism posters. The main gameplay change is to now have simultaneous play as standard, removing the swap rule and only including merge as a variant. This speeds up the game significantly, meaning it now plays well with up to 6 players. To enable this each suit now has an additional 3 cards, in place of the bonus cards from the first edition.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It's that simple!&quot;<br/><br/>Habe fertig (&quot;I'm Done&quot;) includes cards from 1 to 11 in six colors; each card also shows 0-4 stars. Each player receives twelve cards, then places two cards aside. Two cards from the draw pile are revealed to form two discard piles. A player can play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on one of the discard piles. Alternatively, he can play a card with a value that's between the numbers of the topmost cards &ndash; that is, in the gap &ndash; in a color that's not visible. If he does this, he takes another turn and can play another card. If a player can't play, he must draw a card from the draw pile.<br/><br/>If the two discard piles have no gap at the start of a player's turn, he reveals a card from the draw pile and places it on one of the discard piles, possibly creating a large gap by doing so...<br/><br/>Whoever empties his hand first scores positive points equal to the number of stars on the cards he set aside; everyone else scores negative points for the number of stars on their remaining cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Conquer the world with history's greatest warlords under your command.<br/><br/>The game plays in 4 turns where each player plays a ruler from history and conquers territories using a simple dice mechanic.<br/>The deck of world conquerors cards generates effects and goals to modify and drive the action.  If nobody has conquered the world by the end of the 4th turn to win immediately, the player whose empire got the largest at any given point wins.<br/><br/>Each card can be played in one of 3 ways: Generals allow you to place a pawn in that card's territory to be used for rerolls in combats in or adjacent to the territory.  Playing cards as agents gives you one time effects that reflect that historical figure's abilities (Stalin assassinates, Victoria adds an extra die on a naval attack).  Playing cards as rulers gives you their ability for the duration of your turn and sets a goal that reaching it will net you a power bonus at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you're issued a number of tokens.  This number escalates by one during each player turn to ramp up the epic nature of the game.  You also get the bonus when somebody plays a ruler (including you) in one of your territories, and you'll get it at the end of your turn if you reach your ruler's goals. Tokens convert into armies controlling territories in successful attacks and are spent to pay for failed attacks and sea attacks as a Supply Cost.  Each time you pay the Supply Cost, it escalates.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplay DetailsOn your turn, you campaign by throwing one die for each territory you control adjacent to a target territory. The defender throws one die for their defending army plus another for each adjacent territory they control. The highest die wins. Losses and Naval attacks have an escalating Supply Cost. When you are unwilling or unable to pay the Supply cost, your turn ends. Make it count, though, because you only get four turns.<br/><br/>Strategic depth is layered onto this simple system by the deck of conqueror cards. Each historical figure has special powers based on their history, such as Erik the Red making unsupplied naval attacks, or Stalin using assassination to eliminate enemies. The cards may be played as your empire's ruler (which makes their power last your whole turn), a local agent (which gives you the power just once), or a general (which ignores their power but gives you combat rerolls). Ruler cards also have a strategic goal, such as Elizabeth's &ldquo;No one else controls a continent&rdquo; or Caesar's &ldquo;Win 5 attacks.&rdquo; Fulfilling these goals gets you a power bonus at the end of your turn.<br/><br/>In the grand tradition of global conquest games, World Conquerors is epic in scope, but it addresses the genre's traditional shortcomings.<br/><br/><br/>     Short Play Time - just four turns per player each game. It plays in about an hour. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     No Player Elimination - each turn you get a new ruler, regardless of the last one's fate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Quick combat resolution - one army per territory makes battles quick and easy, focusing strategy on card play instead of mass dicefests. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Reduced Kingmaking and Spoiling - ruler goals drive the action leaving little room for spite. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     No Hopeless Positions - supply is based on both time and territory, so it's possible to rebuild a shattered empire from no territories at all. Everybody is in it until their last turn, unless somebody conquers the whole world and wins instantly.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the future<br/><br/>The year is 2033. The world is in ruins. All the major cities have been wiped away by a nuclear war. Flooded with radiation, the planet surface is largely unfit for life. Handfuls of survivors have found refuge in antinuclear bunkers, the largest of which is the Moscow Metro. The Metro has become humanity&rsquo;s last haven after Judgment Day.<br/><br/>Metro 2033 is based on the popular Metro 2033 universe created by Russian writer and journalist Dmitry Glukhovsky. After the nuclear strike, thousands of survivors have found refuge in the Moscow underground (a.k.a., the Metro) &mdash; the biggest shelter in the world. In the stations and tunnels deep below the surface a new civilization emerges.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Each player is a leader of one of the many factions of post-nuclear underground. In order to win, a faction has to achieve ten victory points (VPs). Each station under the faction's control gives it 1 VP; different quests also bring VPs when completed. The other way to win is to capture all four stations of Polis &mdash; the cultural and political heart of Metro. Each faction has a hero at its disposal. Heroes can travel the underground, gain quests and equipment that increases their abilities, fight opponents' heroes, attack stations, and so on. The army of a faction can also attack stations, and usually with better chances to win, but it can target only adjacent stations. Stations under factions' control produce resources &mdash; pigs, ammo and mushrooms &mdash; that are used to capture new stations, strenghten the army, buy equipment and obtain quests. The production of resources and other game events are determined by a special sequence. This sequence tells what will happen each round: production of certain recources, a vote for a new law, or a sudden attack from the dark that must be repelled.<br/><br/>Players can attack stations with their armies or their heroes. Both have strength that may be increased by hiring new troops or buying useful equipment. When attacking a neutral station, the army/hero fights a random threat from the special deck and has to beat its strength. When attacking an opponent, the attacker confronts his army or hero. In battles between players a special set of combat cards is used; these cards give various bonuses to strength depending on the card chosen by the opponent, so the goal is to deduce which combat card will be used by the other side.<br/><br/>",

You are tasked to evacuate crew members from an exploding spaceship, taking them via pods to secure refuges on a nearby moon.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to rescue as many crew members as you can, taking them from the spaceship to the four shelters in some nearby moons. However, be careful: The combination of crew members in each shelter could make the escape not completely successful!<br/><br/>Players will alternate their turns following the round in clockwise order. On their turn, a player becomes the active player. On each turn the active player can take up to two actions. To take an action, the active player must:<br/><br/>     Place one of their available action tokens on one of the activation spaces on their action cards, marking the action the player wants to take. If the chosen action does not have any free activation spaces (without a token), the player cannot take that action.<br/>     Resolve the effect of the chosen action. This effect must be resolved in its entirety before taking a second action.<br/><br/><br/>After taking the two actions, the active player will take all their action tokens from the activation spaces for basic actions. In addition, if all three spaces for advanced actions (Board, Program, Pilot) have an action token on them, the active player also takes those action tokens.<br/><br/>Players continue playing using the normal rules, until one of these conditions is met:<br/><br/>     There are no spaces left in the refuges, or<br/>     There are no crew member on the pods beyond the barrier.<br/><br/><br/>As soon as one of those conditions is met, the game ends and players proceed to scoring.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(Four to Me!) is an award-winning children's memory game in which the goal is for players to find sets of four animals that match those shown on their search cards.  Once a card has been matched, it scores a point for the player, and the one with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>The game includes a set of 24 unique plastic animals, 24 green tubes (film cannisters), and 24 search cards.  One animal is hidden in each tube, and these tubes are then distributed evenly among the players.  Each player is also given two &quot;search cards&quot;; each of these cards depicts a set of four of the animals.  Players try to locate all of the animals on one or both of their cards by asking other players for the ones they need.  If the acting player asks someone for an animal they are holding, that tube is passed to the acting player; as a reward, they can continue asking for more animals.  However, if the player they asked DOES NOT have the animal, the player's turn ends.  Once a player has all the animals needed to complete one or both of his search cards, he can reveal the card(s) and the animals to score 1 or 2 points.  Completed cards are set aside and replacement cards are drawn until no more remain.  The game ends once all 24 cards have been matched.<br/><br/>Vier zu mir! was originally published by Altenburger und Stralsunder Spielkarten-Fabriken (ASS) in 1996, and won the Kinderspiel des Jahres in that same year.

        "description": "Nanolith is a cyberpunk-dungeon crawler with heavy rpg elements. The game is played in two books (the encounter- and the storybook) which present the players with the fatalistic story of the four main characters and their quest to retrieve their lost memories. In the encounter book artworks, scenario maps, and comics tell the progressing story of a human civilisation on the brink of extinction. Scenario outcomes, items the players get during the encounters and player decisions reference text sections in the storybook which advance the surprising and creative novel situated in the world of nanolith. Depending on player decisions and the outcome of scenarios the narrative paths of the story diverge greatly.<br/><br/>The mechanics used to bring the unique skill sets of each character to live provide a deep tactical, cooperative experience. Through the use of five six-sided activation dice movement, item activation and special skills can be activated by the players. But fear not the bad luck of rolling a hand full of dice! The clever mitigation mechanics using aggro to manipulate the value of your rolled dice guarantees, that if you really need to power up your mightiest abilities you will be able to do so. But every power comes with a price. The more you push your luck the harder your character may fall. Overusing the nanomachines your body produces you will at some point overcharge and set free the power of the nanolith inscribed in your DNA. You will get nanoshocked and be able to use a mighty character specific nanoshock ability once for free. But the more often you do this the closer you bring your precious character to the threshold between live and death. So choose you weapons wisely.<br/><br/>Most importantly Nanolith is a game of adventure and storytelling. The world in which this game plays out is different from any generic science fiction world you ever visited before. Player decisions do have a heavy impact on the story and the prose written for this game is much more than decorative attachment. It's a cyberpunk novel in which your characters are the main protagonists. Your decisions seal the destiny of Neo Eden. So don't hesitate any longer. The Nanolith awaits you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the deck of sack cards, which contains four types of sacks with 1-5 sacks on each card, then distribute the cards evenly among all players.<br/><br/>On a turn, flip the top card of your stack, then place it in the proper row of cards leading away from Zacki, with each type of sack getting its own row. If placing this card would make the sum of sacks in the row equal six, the first player to grab Zacki takes these cards; if the card would make the row go over six, then it's placed in a different row; if the player grabs the sack by mistake, they must place one card that they previously collected under their deck.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been played and claimed by players, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!<br/><br/>",

His first order of business was to create panic in the city above and to make his presence known. He sent out his best thieves in the cover of night to steal the king&rsquo;s crown. In the morning the king saw the crown was stolen and in its place a piece of paper with a crudely rendered eye scratched onto it.<br/><br/>Word spread quickly and the city was both scared and on high alert.<br/><br/>Your task is to sneak into Zogar&rsquo;s lair and reclaim the crown, and escape alive, in order to restore peace and calm to the city!<br/><br/>You are attempting to steal back the crown from the evil wizard Zogar.<br/><br/>First you must turn off the four lanterns in each corner to reveal the hidden crown in the center. During this time you move one space and then flip the tile you left behind. This is to simulate there being light and you being able to see where you are heading.<br/><br/>Once all four lanterns are turned off you must flip the tile you plan to move to before moving and you leave the tile behind you alone. This is to simulate darkness and it makes things a bit harder. You must draw a little bit on your memory as well.<br/><br/>You then make your way to the crown. Now you must do everything in reverse to escape. Once all eyes are turned back on the stairs are revealed again in the center, and you begin to move and then flip the tile behind you again.<br/><br/>All the while you are drawing the attention of the Zogar. If you gain 14 Spot Tokens during the course of the game you are captured and you lose. You will also have to deal with monsters and traps that will steal your health away. Loose all your health and your journey ends.<br/><br/>To deal with combat, you have four personal player tiles and another separate character marker. You move the marker to an adjacent tile and flip the one you left. You take the result of the tile you land on. If you fail to defeat the enemy, you loose one health token, and must move to another tile until you defeat them. This requires strategy and is a tense little puzzle in itself.<br/><br/>There are some treasures that help you out that you can find like daggers, health potions, and holy symbols, but your wit and cunning as a player is what will garner you the victory!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Once everyone has completed their zoos, players score 1 point for each visitor next to an enclosure tile, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>You can increase the difficulty level of WonderZoo by having players start with certain squares blocked, and you can add advanced scoring rules as well, with the yellow visitor granting 2 points when next to a yellow enclosure.<br/><br/>",

When the dice stops, a fish is caught if the dice roll (along with any bonuses) is equal or higher to the catch rate of the closest fish. Players can also use caught fish as bait, and items from the Bait &amp; Tackle shop to increase their chances of catching fish. The game is fast to learn, but offers strategic options as players become more familiar with the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Robot Royale is a tile-based strategic combat game for 2-4 players. Players aim to claim victory through moving and positioning their robots and rotating tiles to trap and destroy their opponents, scoring points each time they do.<br/><br/>Robot Royale has core mechanics that are easy to learn and quick to play, but is also robust enough to have tactical depth and encourage competitive play. The game has a very high replay value due to the interchangeable tile layouts and the choices made during play.<br/><br/>In Robot Royale, each player controls a robot who is seeking to hunt down opposing robots and destroy them, claiming victory. This is achieved simply by drawing line of sight to an opposing robot during their turn. The arena however is designed to make this difficult, 16 square tiles each comprised of four spaces with walls and falling floors restricting the robots' movement.<br/><br/>Players move their robot in straight lines and rotate tiles to change the layout of the arena to their advantage, creating routes to allow them to destroy another robot or limiting an opponent&rsquo;s possible moves and trapping them. Another feature of the arena is that once a robot leaves a space it falls away leaving a space that cannot be occupied. As the game progresses these spaces reduce the robots&rsquo; possible moves, forcing them together into a final showdown.<br/><br/>A game of Robot Royale is won when a player reaches their goal, three points in an average game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, you'll choose which faction to play as and then set up the appropriate location to attack. Whether you're playing as Peter and his allies or Hook and his crew, you'll then assault your foes' base of operations, drawing cards to search every nook and cranny for lost boys, fairies, and pirate treasure, while positioning yourselves around the board to bypass or fight off your enemies. Combat and actions are resolved through a dice system that determines what you can accomplish each turn. As the Peter and his allies, the game is won when you rescue all of the lost boys aboard Hook's ship. As Captain Hook and his crew, the game is won when you capture all of the lost boys hiding in their camp. In either case, the game is lost when your foes defeat enough of your characters!<br/><br/>",

Strike cards are revealed and added to the value of the feint card.<br/><br/>Normally the highest total wins the combat and deals one damage. However, each card has one of three disciplines marked (Physical, Intellect and Cunning), and if both strikes are of the same discipline, it is the player with the lowest total who wins that combat! Players receive an advantage if both their Feint and Strike are from the same Discipline. In this way, Showdown contains a heavy bluffing element. The player who can read their opponent the best has the advantage!<br/><br/>The game ends once one player has taken enough damage to have flipped over all of their own Aces.<br/><br/>Showdown: Icons features rough and hardened characters from the world of the Icons, including: King of Clubs, Queen of Hearts, Jack of Diamonds, The Jokers, and Ace of Spades.

The sheet shows an island of hexes, with various spaces displaying shovels, footprints, treasures, and five colors of temples. Each player starts the game in a different harbor space on the island's perimeter.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls a die, then each player moves that many spaces in a contiguous line, marking each space as you go. You can't re-enter spaces you've visited previously. If you pass through or land on shovels or footprints, you circle those icons on your player sheet. By crossing off a footprint, you can ignore the die and move 1-6 spaces.<br/><br/>If you end your movement on a treasure, roll the die, and if the die result equals or exceeds the treasure value (4-6), you collect these points in one of your six scoring spaces. For each shovel you cross off, you can add 1 to the result of the die.<br/><br/>If you end your movement on a temple, roll the die; if you have at least as many shovels as the number rolled, you score 9 points, and if you don't, you lose 1 point. If you succeed in exploring a temple, all other players mark it out since you've looted that location.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has filled their six scoring spaces or no one can score any more points, the game ends, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The loot has to be sold to fences or, if the loot is money, the money has to be washed &quot;clean&quot; by a money launderer. The first player to possess 100,000 &quot;clean&quot; dollars wins the game.<br/><br/>There is no fixed order in which the players take their turn. Through his actions, the current player always chooses the next player. When it is your turn, you should always try to choose a player who will probably then choose you again because the more often a player comes to turn, the better the chances for him to win the game. Wise foresight into the plans of the other players will help to make you the winner.<br/><br/>As a two-player game, Downtown works differently.<br/><br/>BEST WITH 4 PLAYERS!!!<br/><br/>",

Well dream on.<br/><br/>Succession ends when the aging King chooses a successor to the throne.  Of all the worthy citizens of the land, the King has narrowed his choice to five candidates.  You are not one of them.<br/><br/>As a courtier, master of palace politics, you will manipulate the King's opinion of the candidates through intrigues -- bits of gossip, good and bad reports, etc.  Just as important, by claiming credit for things you may not have done and avoiding blame for things you probably did you'll manipulate the opinions of the candidates.  That way when the King makes his selection you're set to be the power behind the throne rather than the next court jester.<br/><br/>To do this, you'll have to out-bluff and out-maneuver the other players, manage your resources carefully and decide when to fight and when to sit on the sidelines and watch your opponents beat each other up.<br/><br/>Succession is a game of politics and deal-making lasting from one to three hours (1-2 hours is typical).  You can offer other players gold, cards, or promises of future behavior in exchange for what you want.  Be creative!<br/><br/>Succession was launched at GenCon Indi 2004.<br/><br/>",

During your round you can equip your Hero with the items you have in our hand and you can attack your opponent(s) either through Physical Attacks or Magic Attacks. You can also sell back some equipment, gaining back some HP...but will this be enough to save you from being defeated?<br/><br/>Create your Hero choosing one of the Class cards and one of the Race cards available and construct your deck picking any other card.

        "description": "When the Civil War was taking place in America, an uprising broke out in Poland. The winter of 1863. Poland was captive, partitioned by three powers of that era &ndash; Austria, Prussia and Russia. Under the occupation of this last country, the embers of yet another revolt appeared and tore these lands for the next two years. Once again, the rebellious hearts of Poles were itching for a fight. This time there was no regular army. Armed with scythes and hunting weapons, Poles joined armed groups called parties to stand up to an unequal battle with the large Russian army. You yourself could stand at the head of one of these parties.<br/><br/>1863 is an unusually dynamic card game designed for 2-4 players, in which our task is to put you in the role of an insurgent party. The party, which may include Scythemen, Shooters or elite troops of the Zouaves of Death, will engage the Muscovites in the historic battles of the January Uprising. We must take care that we have the right amount of ammunition, and make sure that none of our fellow players gain too many glory points. They decide which player wins the whole game.<br/><br/>One begins the game having five Command Cards and Ammunition Chips. Each round starts by drawing commanders and issuing a battlefield with the Muscovite&rsquo;s card hidden beneath it. In each turn, players replenish their number of chips and cards. After this, the most important part of the game begins. It consists of adding the next military units and actions to battles or to other players, in order to break with military force all the units of the battlefield, along with the Muscovite card hidden beneath it. The battles are resolved when everyone has agreed not to add more cards. If players manage to surpass the total military forces of the battlefield and Muscovite, the skirmish has been won, and the players each receive glory points according to the size of their military contribution to it. So it pays to have the largest share in each battle. The game usually lasts until 6 skirmishes have been won. The glory points are then added up, and the winner of the game emerges.<br/><br/><br/>Zima roku 1863. Zniewolona Polska, pod zaborami trzech potęg tamtego okresu - Austrii, Prus i Rosji. Pod okupacją tego ostatniego kraju rodzi się zarzewie kolejnego buntu, kt&oacute;ry przez najbliższe 2 lata będzie targał tymi ziemiami. Niepokorne serca Polak&oacute;w znowu rwą się do walki. Tym razem nie mają regularnego wojska. Uzbrojeni w kosy i broń myśliwską, Polacy łącza się w zbrojne grupy zwane partiami, by stanąć do nier&oacute;wnej walki z licznym wojskiem rosyjskim. Na czele jednej z partii możesz stanąć właśnie Ty.<br/><br/>Rok 1863 to niezwykle dynamiczna gra karciana, przeznaczona dla 2-4 graczy, w kt&oacute;rej naszym zadaniem będzie wcielenie się w rolę partii powstańczej. Partia w kt&oacute;rej skład mogą wchodzić Kosynierzy, Strzelcy czy elitarne oddziały Żuaw&oacute;w Śmierci, będzie potykać się z Moskalami w historycznych bitwach Powstania Styczniowego. Musimy dbać przy tym o odpowiednią ilość amunicji oraz kontrolować czy kt&oacute;ryś z naszych wsp&oacute;łgraczy nie zdobywa zbyt dużej ilość punkt&oacute;w chwały. To one zdecydują, kt&oacute;ry gracz okaże się zwycięzcą całej gry.<br/><br/>Grę rozpoczyna się posiadając po 5 Kart Rozkaz&oacute;w i Żeton&oacute;w Amunicji. Każda runda rozpoczyna się od losowania dow&oacute;dc&oacute;w, oraz wystawienia pola bitwy wraz z ukrytą pod nią kartą Moskali. Gracze co turę uzupełniają r&oacute;wnież liczbę swoich żeton&oacute;w oraz kart. Po tym rozpoczynają najważniejszą część gry. Polega ona na dokładaniu kolejno Kart Oddział&oacute;w i Akcji do bitew lub na innych graczy, tak by w miarę możliwości przebić Siłą Militarną wszystkich oddział&oacute;w Siłę Militarną Pola Bitwy i ukrytej pod nim Karty Moskala. Kiedy wszyscy już postanowią nie dokładać więcej kart, dochodzi do rozstrzygnięcia bitew. Jeśli graczom uda się  przekroczyć sumę siły militarnej Karty Bitwy i Moskali, potyczka została wygrana a gracze przyznają  sobie punkty chwały w ilości zależnej od tego jak duży był ich wkład militarny w nią. Zatem opłaca się mieć jak największy udział w każdej z bitew. Gra najczęściej trwa do momentu zwycięskiego rozegrania 6 potyczek. Wtedy podlicza się zdobyte Punkty Chwały i wyłania się zwycięzcę gry.<br/><br/>",

Then a black checker in the middle and in a certain starting arrangement the blue and red stones of the two counterparties are placed. The trick: The game board stands on a central inverted pyramid and can be tilted by tapping in one of four directions. If it is your turn, roll the dice and tap. Each of the two players now tries by the clever inclination of the field to be the first to move all his pieces or the black stone through any of the four labyrinth exits from the board. Foresighted tactics are needed here.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Decision Games' website:)<br/><br/>Breitenfeld was the first major clash involving the Swedish army of Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus had adopted the advances of Maurice of Nassau, using smaller, thinner formations bringing mobility and flexibility to battlefields dominated by massive blocks of musket-ringed pikemen. But he faced a larger, more experienced Imperial army under Count Tilly, and had to rely on shaky Saxon allies. The battle becomes a contest between Swedish quickness and Imperial stolidity. Victory will go to the player who best utilizes his strengths and takes advantage of enemy weaknesses.<br/><br/>Breitenfeld uses the new Pike &amp; Shot game system to portray the battlefields of the early gunpowder period. Infantry is based on pike formations with varying numbers of attached musketeers. Other musketeers operate independently, useful for skirmishing but vulnerable to both infantry and cavalry. Shock power comes from heavy cavalry, armored horsemen armed with pistol and sword, but relying increasingly on firepower to wear down opponents. Light cavalry roam the battlefield, too weak to stand up to their heavy cousins, but ruthless during a pursuit. The newest form of horsemen are the dragoons, men trained to fight mounted and on foot, ideal for seizing key points in advance of the main body. Artillery is still in its infancy; the large, powerful guns are all-but-immobile. However, different armies at different times experiment with lighter, more mobile weapons.<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map<br/>&bull;    140 die-cut counters<br/>&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series<br/>&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bots Up is a fast paced card game, best played between 2-5 players of any age. This is a last man standing game, where players build bots out of spare parts and the battle them until a winner is crowned.<br/><br/>The bot parts each have different health totals so the aim is to build the strongest bot possible. In the battle phase players use battle cards to damage each others bots, strengthen their parts and wreak havoc on the opponents. Battle cards come in 3 varieties; Action (play up to 2 per turn), Anytime (play at will) and Instant (play immediately).<br/><br/>Powerplay cards are all Instant play cards. These powerful game changers can be good or bad but can make for a perfect hail mary play if you're falling behind in battle.<br/><br/>The last remaining player with a live bot part wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Roundforest is a family game for 2-4 players. Despite the fairy-tale theme, it requires a great deal of strategic thinking. You play as poor lads who compete for the favor of the beautiful princess. The winner will be the one who brings her the emerald ring of the Forest Spirit residing in the Roundforest. But the Spirit is only willing to hand over the ring for three golden apples &ndash; and if certain other conditions are also met.<br/><br/>The task is a challenging one. To begin with, nobody knows where the Forest Spirit is hiding. Then, it is not so easy to find your way in this enchanted forest: whenever you arrive at a clearing (a game space), it makes a quadrant turn clockwise!  This constantly changes players&rsquo; movement options.<br/><br/>Of course, golden apples are not found in the forest. These are acquired by smart planning and a series of actions. You will collect various objects; use them if needed, trade them with the Fairy, or find a magic well to convert them into something else. This way you may come by some golden apples too. <br/>You will encounter various fairy-tale characters living in the Roundforest, such as a magic steed, a witch, a goblin, a beggar, a wealthy merchant, a puzzled sculptor, a bandit &ndash; or even the Devil itself. Some of these creatures are friendly, while others are hostile, trying to make your life difficult. The former might help you in return for a little favor, and the latter can be defeated if you deal with them the right way.<br/><br/>The game field is built randomly of 32 octagonal forest tiles. Components include 12 fairy-tale character cards, a large pack of object tokens, action discs, copper and silver coins, a fairy board, personal boards (haversacks) and a draw bag. The game provides approximately 1 hour playing time. It is recommended above 8 years of age.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Ez a 2-4 fő &aacute;ltal j&aacute;tszhat&oacute; csal&aacute;di j&aacute;t&eacute;k a meseszerű tematika ellen&eacute;re strat&eacute;giai gondolkod&aacute;st ig&eacute;nyel.

The card covers the entire board except for the ends of the axes, leaving room for a mirror to be inserted into the axes perpendicular to and on top of the card. The card displays several spheres that are red, green, yellow, or blue.<br/><br/>Players race to choose which of the 13 axes they think the mirror should be inserted into so as to produce the most points when all the reflected and actual spheres are counted. A player cannot choose an axis that another player has chosen. Once all the players have made a selection, the mirror is inserted in turn into each chosen axis. The player who chose a particular axis decides which direction the mirror should face when inserted into that axis. The axis scores for the player who chose it. Each green sphere adds a point, and each yellow sphere subtracts a point. The player also adds points equal to the difference between the number of red and blue spheres.<br/><br/>Play continues with a new card. The game ends when one player reaches an agreed-upon point total.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Apex Legends: The Board Game is a highly competitive, intensely tactical team vs. team miniatures game for 2-4 players. Each playthrough takes about 60-90 minutes, depending on the number of players and selected game features. Utilizing an original engine and innovative framework, the game authentically captures the voice and imagination of the Apex Legends video game, successfully bringing the stakes, thrills, and kills of the battle royale experience to life.<br/><br/>Taking place on the Kings Canyon map, the core experience focuses on the final zone, where the ultimate confrontation unfolds. Each player assumes the role of a unique Legend. The players activate team by team, trying to outmaneuver enemies in the heat of battle and recreate the unpredictable, unforgettable moments known from the source game&mdash;securing key positions on the map, snatching valuable loot seconds before an opponent, or diving behind cover or shielding a teammate just in time to save them from oblivion...<br/><br/>Once activated, each Legend may perform basic actions such as Move, Interact, Use, and Attack. Additionally, the players can utilize their Legend's unique Abilities (both combat-oriented and utility-based) and a deck of Legend-specific Feat cards to gain the upper hand. Creating a well-built team where Legends complement one another on the battlefield as well as using all available strategic options is the key to victory.<br/><br/>After a team&rsquo;s activation is complete, the game is far from over! On their opponent's turn, Legends can react to enemy actions with Instant and Reaction cards. Reactions allow a player to respond when either they or their teammates are attacked, taking cover, recovering their shield, or assisting an ally. When the conditions on an Instant card are met, the player can activate it as a clever way to thwart their opponent's next move.<br/><br/>Every choice, every move, and every piece of ammo matters!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Gameplay is similar to standard Clue, with special &quot;intrigue cards&quot; new to the game.<br/><br/>Intrigue cards come in two varieties: Clocks and Keepers.  They are obtained in one of three ways: rolling a question mark on the included custome dice, landing on a question mark on the board, or if your character is moved to a room as part of someone starting a rumor (equivalent to Clue's &quot;making a suggestion.&quot;)  The first two situations incur a forced draw, while the third is optional.  There are eight clock cards in the intrigue deck, and if you draw the eighth card then you automatically lose.  Keepers give a one-time bonus that allow you to slightly alter some of the game's parameters...risk of drawing a clock; potential reward of benefiting from a keeper.<br/><br/>Additionally, each of the six characters have a &quot;personality card&quot; which alows for a one-time power.  For example, Dwight's reads: &quot;Once per game, you may move twice.  Roll the dice, move, then roll again.&quot;<br/><br/>The winner gets &quot;an extra week of vacation&quot; from Michael Scott!<br/><br/>",

This desperate battle has recently seen a new player, a secret Agency of Bounty Hunters, attempting to control the endless assaults on inner city life.<br/><br/>Your task: Defeat and arrest criminals, defuse high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy city districts, and prevent assassins from completing their destructive path. You are one of the members of this secretive brotherhood of justice. So...are you ready to survive the crime waves in the big city and uncover the infiltrating androids amongst your team that plan a revolt?<br/><br/>Rogue Agent is a tense cyberpunk adventure game that pitches players against underground networks. The game features detailed plastic miniatures, a large variety of unique criminals to defeat, special icon-driven custom dice, and two different game play modes.<br/><br/>In Rogue Agent, players control an agent working for the shady corporation known as &quot;The Agency&quot;, created to control Rain City's crime rate, which has rapidly outpaced the capabilities of the regular police force. Players win the game by obtaining the most power over the city in a race against the game system that creates a living city in which crime and other challenges await at every corner.<br/><br/>Each round consists of an action phase, which is preceded by an upkeep phase. During this action phase, players score power by successfully eliminating assassins, turning in crime bosses, and defusing high-tech bombs that threaten to destroy whole districts. Through investigation of city areas, players gather resources that will be vital for survival. Positioning collaborators in the different locations of the city aids agents in overcoming confrontations with local thugs. Meanwhile, the city police squad is hot on your trail, hoping to contain the illegal side jobs that agents are known for. The Agency, however, has its own air defenses it can call in for support.<br/><br/>Players can scout locations in search for valuable resources that will help them upgrade their abilities, to get more control over the challenges in the game. As the game develops, agents can upgrade their vehicle, weapon and scout abilities as well as gather information about the true identities of other agents. There might be traitors within the Agency. Some of you might be android agents, secretly planning a revolt. Through careful investigation, players can gather intelligence about the true identity of other players. As the game progresses, traitors amongst the agents could be revealed in the form of androids. These agents have access to new victory conditions &ndash; destroying key locations holding information about android production and eliminating human agents &ndash; in a deadly race for control of the city. The first player to reach eight power wins.<br/><br/>Rogue Agent is a fast-playing, easy-to-learn adventure, resource management, and risk management game using fun, streamlined icon-driven custom dice mechanisms. The Living City System creates a dynamic board with characters and challenges in constant motion, creating unique situations with each play and making Rain City come alive on your gaming table. No trip to Rain City will be the same!<br/><br/>",

Self-published, it has come in various boxes over the years, from cigar boxes to blue and silver cardboard.<br/><br/>Each team (or individual player when playing with a smaller group) rolls a 12-sided die. For 1-3, a Red question is asked, for 4-6 a Green one, for 7-9 a Yellow one, and for 10-12 a Blue one. Each question is worth the number rolled on the die.<br/><br/>The questions are devilishly hard and sometimes feature trick questions. Examples: Which part, the bowl or the grinder, is the mortar? In medieval times, the first hay cut in the season was called the Math. What was the second cut called? (Answer: Aftermath) Most deal with word origins and obscure knowledge. Each card also features a small tidbit of information about the answer.<br/><br/>The first player or team to get to 31 points is the winner. Replay value of the game is somewhat limited since only a single question set was ever produced, but the game is well worth picking up. A nice cerebral change from the usual Trivial Pursuit-type games.<br/><br/>",

To turn face down all the tiles on your board as quickly - and in as few goes - as possible.<br/><br/>Is Triggery fun to play? It's a marvelous game. For one thing it has virtually limitless possibilities. For another, it's highly entertaining. But we are not going to spoil the fun by telling you why. Find out for yourself!<br/><br/>",

Rise Up is a cooperative board game about building people power and taking on oppressive systems to create change.<br/><br/>In Rise Up, the game weaves a story about your movement, which can either be based in reality (like stopping an oil pipeline) or fictional (like fighting for dragon rights). But &ldquo;the System&rdquo; is hard at work too, maneuvering to crush your efforts through tactics like setting up surveillance, making arrests, or causing infighting.<br/><br/>In order to win, players must collaborate to build a movement that scores more victories than the system. To do this, players spend supporter tokens to use Movement Cards that allow them to grow their movement power on the ten different locations on the board (such as Workplaces, Campuses, Internet), take down the System&rsquo;s power, as well as help their fellow players gain more supporters and cards. Players can strategize together by playing Movement Cards with matching symbols and starting a &ldquo;chain of events,&rdquo; which increases their impact. As your movement gains power, the system will retaliate with more cards of its own. Everyone loses if any one player runs out of supporter tokens, or if the system scores too many victories.<br/><br/>Rise Up also comes with two versions with a double sided board: one for more experienced game players, and one for novices as well as younger children. Rise Up is ethically manufactured.<br/><br/>",

The planet cannot give enough resources to sustain all living tribes. So the tribes will enter a trial to decide who will become the favored tribe. So, the goal of the game is to gain as much Godly favor as possible.<br/><br/>Players are scavenging tribes that collect powerful gemstones during their turn on the floating islands of the Broken Planet. A player's standard turn consists of movement and gemstone collection. Movement is performed by secretly choosing an island number on the game board with your compass and then keeping it hidden until all other tribes have chosen a location. Afterwards, everybody reveals their location and performs the movement at the same time. Tribes will find different temples on the islands, each displaying the gemstone type that can be collected there. After adding the collected gems to their hand, a new turn starts and players repeat these steps.<br/><br/>Each round, one tribe will enter the 'Offer Phase' and may discard gemstones cards for special actions.  These actions include building temples for unique effects, creating relics to gain Godly favor, or attacking other players with a divine strike. Each of these actions can gain favor in their own respective way. The offering player cannot move nor collect, but all other tribes can! The offering role is passed down clockwise each turn. The amount of discarded gemstones depends on the costs of the Offer Phase actions.<br/><br/>All players play simultaneously! So it's key to see what gemstones other players need for their actions, and what gems they already have in order to predict their next moves.<br/><br/>The game ends after X turns depending on the amount of players. When the last round has been played, each player counts their favor. The player with the most favor wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Some goblins have special abilities, like the spy, which can be played to steal another player&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Goblin cards are secretly played into armies, which are worth points at the end of the round, with the last goblin card played being revealed when entering battle. On your turn you will start by drawing a card and then taking as many actions as you&rsquo;d like.

These cards will defend you if you are attacked by another player.<br/><br/>To challenge another player&rsquo;s army, choose a player, and play a goblin from your hand face-up. The defender will then reveal their last army card played.  The stronger goblin wins the battle, unless special goblin abilities are activated, and the winning player will take all face up cards from the battle, placing them into their garrison.

        "description": "Mr.M&rsquo;s Code of Murder：The Byzantine Assassin<br/><br/>In the still of the night, Mr M sneaks into the decadent palace of nobles to exact his vengeance under his mask.<br/><br/>A sharp call fills the air, waking the depraved nobles from their dreams of avarice and greed. The duchess has fallen!<br/><br/>A murder note written on lamb skin lays at the side.<br/><br/>&quot;God's Judgement is at Hand, and the guilty will be purged!&quot;<br/><br/>The queen stares in shock at the brutal murder, the duke watches his companions with suspicion. The bard is playing his lute on the balcony. The old scholar strokes his beard. The maid is trembling in the corner and a mysterious smile hangs on the corner of the jester's face. Mr M remains hidden amongst them, poised to exact his justice...<br/><br/>This is cooperative deduction game that pits 1 player against the remaining players who seeks to deduce the identity after 5 rounds or characters have been eliminated.<br/><br/>The 13 characters are placed in the palace and the player playing Mr M receives 10 Murder cards. Mr M takes the top 2 cards from the Suspects deck and picks 1 as his character.<br/><br/>The turn continues with Character cards laid out (exact number based on players) in a row. The other players take turns activating 1 of the laid out Character card (the activated character then moves and activate his/her ability if necessary)each in order to deduce Mr M's identity and/or limit his killing options. Lastly, Mr M either activates the 2 remaining unused characters or 1 of the used characters. He finishes off his turn by playing a Murder card that kills one of the other characters in the palace, following all the rules and limitations listed on the murder card. The other players know which character died - but they do not know how. The used Murder card is then placed over the Character card of the murdered character.<br/><br/>After 5 rounds or 5 characters have been killed, whichever is earlier, players would have to deduce the identity of Mr M.<br/><br/>If a character is moved into a murdered character's location, the players can reveal the Murder card and use the information to isolate their suspect. For example, the Murder card:Death by Hanging might read; use to kill any one character in a room that is in the same column of rooms as Mr M. Another Murder card:Gunpowder Plot, would say; kill all characters in a room adjacent to Mr M.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From inside box cover:<br/><br/>&quot;How to play Michigan Rummy&quot;<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Two to nine players may play &quot;Michigan Rummy&quot;.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT: Michigan Rummy three-dimensional revolving playing board, a regular deck of cards, and chips or counters.  The Michigan Rummy board consists of nine sections.  WINNING PAY CARDS are indicated next to each section on the board.  The round center section is the Michigan Rummy Pot.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>(1) THE DEAL.  The deal is determined by cutting the cards, high card winning the deal.  Players then place one chip in each of the3 nine sections of the plastic tray, except the dealer who places two chips in each section.  The dealer shuffles the cards and deals all of them out, one card at a time to each player, to the left.  One extra, or dummy hand, is dealt in front of the dealer.  It does not matter if some players receive one more card than others.<br/><br/>(2) THE PLAY.<br/>(a) The dealer picks up either one of the two hands before him.  The dealer may, after looking at his hand, have the option of exchanging his hand for the dummy hand (but without looking at the dummy hand) or selling the dummy hand to the player making the highest bid for it.  Any player (including dealer) cannot exchange his hand for the dummy hand if he holds a PAY CARD.  The exchange of hands must be made complete.  Player cannot retain any of the cards in his original hand.  The amount of chips bid for the dummy hand go to the dealer and the player making the bid then exchanges his own hand for the dummy hand.  The extra hand is then put aside.<br/><br/>(b) POKER. Before beginning the actual play of MICHIGAN RUMMY a hand of poker is played for the chips in the poker pool section.  Each player forms their best poker hand with five cards from his hand.  The remainder of their hands are kept face down in front of them for later use. The dealer starts the betting and can bet, or pass, the other players doing likewise.  The bets and raises are placed in the poker pool section, and the winning hand receives all these chips.<br/><br/>(c) MICHIGAN RUMMY. The players take up all their cards and the dealer starts by playing the lowest card of any suit in his hand he wishes (Ace is high, duece is low).  He MUST play the lowest card of the suit he chooses.  He calls out the card and places it in front of him.  The player who holds the next higher consecutive card in the same suit plays it, placing it in front of him and calling out its name, etc., and this continues until the Ace of the suit is played, or a STOP is reached (due to the dummy hand holding the next high card).  The player who played an ACE or STOP card reopens with the lowest card in his hand in ANOTHER suit and play continues accordingly.  If a player cannot reopen with a card of another suit after a STOP, play ends there and there is no payment for the deal.  Any player who plays a PAY CARD takes all the chips from the corresponding section of the playing board (i.e. if you play the King of Clubs you collect all the chips in the King of Clubs section).  In order to collect for some PAY CARDS, they must be played in sequence by the same player (i.e. Queen of Hearts, King of Hearts, and 7, 8, and 9 of any suit).  The first player to discard all his cards wins all the chips in the Michigan Rummy Pot (round center section).  A variation may be played by having the winner collect one chip from each of the other players for every card remaining in that player's hand, in addition to the Michigan Rummy Pot.  The game is then over and the deal goes to the left for the next game.<br/><br/>The players again place a chip in each of the nine sections (the dealer placing two chips in each section) even though some chips may still remain from previous play.<br/><br/>After the final game of play, it may be found that chips remain in several sections of the playing board.  If this is the case, all of these chips may be placed in the POKER POOL section and a &quot;showdown&quot; hand of poker may be played.  Five cards are dealt face up to each player and the player with the best POKER HAND wins all the remaining chips on the board.  If players are not familiar with hand values in poker, below is listed, in order, winning combinations:<br/>(1) Straight Flush (3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of five cards all one suit.<br/>(2) Four of a kind.<br/>(3) Full house (three of a kind and one pair).<br/>(4) Flush--all one suit, but not in sequence.<br/>(5) Straight--(3-4-5-6-7) or any other sequence of different suits.<br/>(6) Three of a kind.<br/>(7) Two pairs.<br/>(8) One pair.<br/><br/>Also see:<br/><br/>    Tripoley<br/><br/><br/>",

Played with different colored sailing ships and on a beautiful large world map board, the game is set in the year 1806, at the peak of Napoleon's power. The game is played on three levels: the first level is rolling dice and moving one of six cargoes indicated on cargo cards from one port/continent to another, avoiding ever changing bad weather and war zones, lest you sink at sea.<br/><br/>The second level features pirates that every player gets a chance to be, by the pick of specially marked new cargo cards, once your voyage is complete. Pirates need not reveal themselves until they so desire. Poker face is critical to this game. Pirates can attack merchant ships by rolling additional dice. Knowing when to hold and when to attack are critical to success. However, there are also a few Lord Nelsons at sea - the game's police force -  that can Neutralize pirates.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the most exciting third level; the Secret Treasure Islands. With every game there is at least one, truly secret treasure worth 50,000 pounds that makes the game a fun, fast, in your face adventure. Since the location of these treasures changes from game to game, no two games are ever the same and although the better strategists more often than not win this game, no one is ever really out of it. The emotional intensity of the game often increases into a climactic finish.<br/><br/>The Box and Board are beautifully designed, money comes in British pounds (paper), ships are wooden and painted with different colored sails, ship manifests are included to keep record of your payouts, and variously colored lighthouses mark where you start and where you end. Weighs 3.3 lbs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A knight and his faithful sidekick amble on a dirty, empty road. The scorching sun blurs the boundaries of land and sky at the horizon. Only the choir of crickets breaks the tedious silence between the two travelers. The knight looks up and sights something in the distance. A gleam in his eyes appears from excitement.<br/>&ndash; Another giant! Quickly, my lance! &ndash; yells at his faithful companion.<br/>&ndash; But my good sir, it's only a windmill! &ndash; blinks the stumpy man towards the distant silhouette.&quot;<br/><br/>Tilting at Windmills is a two-player game in which players control Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The two characters move towards each other on the playing board. Players use movement cards to move either the knight or his companion. One round lasts until the two characters meet on the road. At the end of each round, a player gets a windmill/giant card with a victory point on it.<br/><br/>There are two ways of winning the game. Either you collect more points than your opponent, or you force them to break all their lances; a player loses lances if they acquire a card with its giant side. The key tactic for this game is to force encounters at the right place and in the right time by adding up movement cards.<br/><br/>",

The system emphasizes the limits of command, training, and discipline, all in the milieu of the very linear style of warfare in the pre-Napoleonic era. In addition, it uses a most unusual set of mechanics for resolving shock combat. Will you have your troops go into close order, or spread out for better fire possibilities? What are the pros and cons of the rifle-armed American militia? Can your dragoon forces exert any influence?<br/><br/>Flintlock is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, but they cover almost every aspect of battle at this micro level. Playing time is less than 2 hours.<br/><br/>The battles chosen highlight small unit tactics in the grueling Southern Campaign, where both sides had ample opportunities to watch, learn and practice, with an emphasis on Formation. Some of the great commanders of the war, from Nathanial Greene and Daniel Morgan to Lord Cornwallis and the infamous, but capable, Banastre Tarleton are in full action.<br/><br/>The Scenario/battles, all (well, most) with armies of one or two thousand men, include:<br/><br/><br/>    Camden (17 August 1780)  Lord Cornwallis stands and confronts a much larger force under Horatio Gates, but the rebel militia disintegrates and Gates&rsquo;s army is routed in a major British victory. <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Cowpens (17 January 1781) Daniel Morgan conducts a masterful, tactical battle, defeating Banastre Tarleton and destroying the dreaded British Legion in one of the major victories of the war.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Guilford Courthouse (15 March 1781) Nathanial Greene outnumbers Lord Cornwallis by more than two to one. However, the British take the field but with such heavy losses that, in retrospect, Greene could claim a strategic success.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Hobkirk&rsquo;s Hill (25 April 1781) Nathanial Greene&rsquo;s Marylanders fail to stand against a concerted charge from Lord Rawdon&rsquo;s smaller but better disciplined army. <br/><br/><br/>",

In preparation for the game someone has spray-painted 100 logs in 5 different colors, and stacked them in a huge round tower with layers of 6 logs arranged randomly.<br/><br/>A player takes a free log from the tower and uses it to build his own tower. Each player may only<br/>construct 3 towers and only the bottom log of each tower may touch the table. When a player feels he cannot extend a tower any further he can crown it with a white cap. This prevents any further building on that tower and ensures double scoring. (After scoring the topmost piece is removed.)<br/><br/>When all logs from the central tower has been used, there is final scoring, and the woodcutter with the most points wins a brand-new chain saw.<br/><br/>Also included are 3 variants:<br/><br/>&quot;Easy Going&quot;: The players build up to 5 individual towers, but each of only a single color. The base may be formed from more than one log, but cannot be expanded after the next level has been started.  Scoring is for the highest tower in each color at the end of the game. Logs from collapsed towers are lost.<br/><br/>&quot;Pyramido&quot;: Players build the pyramids with single color surfaces.<br/><br/>&quot;Log Cabin&quot;: Build small houses using as few colors as possible.<br/><br/>Above based on Brett &amp; Board which thanks Adam Spielt for use of the description.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Peace for Galilee<br/><br/>Lebanon &lsquo;82 is a simulation of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in &lsquo;82, an attempt to clear out PLO terrorists and expel elements of the Syrian army from the country. Hoping to establish the pro-Israeli Christians as the legitimate government in Lebanon, the Israelis sent in the IDF, which soon became embroiled in vicious urban battles. The game also includes a 1975 scenario, as well as a 2006 scenario, showing the evolution of Israel&rsquo;s ongoing struggle against the PLO.<br/><br/>Lebanon &lsquo;82 utilizes the Fire &amp; Movement combat system that is designed so that players can augment their units with &ldquo;Support Fire&rdquo; during the course of the battle. From artillery to air strikes, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. Lebanon &lsquo;82 also includes rules for a possible Syrian entry, and features the Syrian Surface to Air Missiles! Israeli air support could come under fire from Syrian fixed SAM batteries; more support fire will be necessary, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Lebanon &lsquo;82, the attritional design of the Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare; Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties during a game, accurately replicating the realities of combat, especially during the street fighting encountered in 1982. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management &mdash; not merely odds ratios requiring numerical superiority. A stunning map of Lebanon depicts the entire battle area, ranging from the Israeli border to the capital Beirut itself &mdash; including all of the famous battle sites, such as the PLO refugee camps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Flowers: A Mandala Game, your goal is to collect flower tiles by achieving majorities through clever card play. Skillfully build mandalas to claim the best tiles, combining and multiplying them to create exquisite flowers of your own!<br/><br/>To set up, layout the game cloth showing three large &quot;mandala&quot; flowers. Shuffle the 36 half-flower tiles in separate decks &mdash; 18 each of black and white, with the black flowers being gray, purple, and red on the opposite side and the white ones being green, orange, and yellow &mdash; then place one black tile and one white tile face up in each flower. Each player starts with a hand of cards, with the cards coming in six colors that match the flower tile colors.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player lays down one or more cards of the same color onto one of the flowers. (Each player keeps their played cards separate, facing toward themselves.) If that color is already present in the mandala, the player then flips the card(s) face down; if not, the player leaves them face up. If the player laid down one card, they draw two cards from the deck; if they played two or more, they don't draw any cards.<br/><br/>After playing, if you have at least one face-up card on a flower and more cards than any other player, take that flower's &quot;claim&quot; token and place it on your cards. Then, if that flower now has all six colors face up around it, destroy the mandala. Whoever has the claim token on their cards places one of the flower tiles from this mandala in front of themselves; if they already have a flower tile of the same color, they flip this &quot;complete&quot; flower face down. Whoever has the secondmost cards on this mandala takes the second flower tile. Anyone who took a flower tile discards all of their played cards on this mandala; everyone else returns their played cards to their hand. Draw a black tile and white tile from the stack to create a new mandala.<br/><br/>Continue play until someone completes their third flower, then everyone scores their points. Each separate flower half is worth as many points as the number of flowers on it. For each complete flower, if one of the tiles is 3x, triple the number of flowers on the other tile; if both tiles have flowers, double the number of flowers on the tile with fewer flowers. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>At the end of November 1939, the Red Army sent about 450,000 men into Finland in an attempt to conquer the Soviet Union&rsquo;s much smaller neighbor. In what became known as the Winter War, ferocious Finnish resistance soon shocked the world and inflicted repeated defeats on the invaders.<br/><br/>The Soviet plan included attacks in the dark forests of Eastern Karelia, attempting to outflank the stout line of Finnish fortifications to the south. Their 139th Rifle Division advanced in early December 1939 along the river Aittijoki, faced by only a handful of Finnish battalions. The Finns panicked in some places, and a near-rout seemed inevitable. Finnish Marshal Carl Gustav Mannerheim sent a small group of reinforcements led by Col. Paavo Talvela, previously in charge of buying artillery ammunition for the army.<br/><br/>Talvela proved that a warrior lived within the bureaucrat, as he put new heart into his men and stemming the Soviet advance. After heavy fighting, the Finns had destroyed the 139th Rifle Division and routed the 75th Rifle Division. But they suffered serious losses as well, as the Soviets here had committed ski troops of their own including the &ldquo;Red Finns&rdquo; seldom mentioned by Finnish writers.<br/><br/>Winter Fury re-creates the twin battles of Tolvaj&auml;rvi and Ilomantsi from 1939, as well as the 1941 Finnish offensive over the same ground. It uses a &ldquo;variable impulse&rdquo; game system to model the two armies&rsquo; very different capabilities. Each turn, each player puts a number of markers into a common container. These are then drawn one by one, the number drawn varying with the current weather condition. The Finnish player has weaker forces, but will usually draw more markers and these allow the Finns to conduct more operations. The good Finnish units are better than the Soviet ones, and more mobile in the forests. The Soviet cannot move his or her divisions together, complicating the Red Army&rsquo;s efforts. But Soviet artillery is very powerful while Finnish guns are little more than a nuisance. The Soviet player also has tanks and armored cars, which not only are powerful in battle (at least on the roads), they also might cause the Finns to panic and run away.<br/><br/>Winter Fury is the second in our line of Playbooks: a 64-page book about the battle and the forces involved that also includes a complete historical game on the subject. The book includes a lengthy background piece by David Lippman as well as rules, scenarios and other historical data. There are 280 playing pieces and a 34x22-inch map.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with seven cards in hand, and three rows of ten face-up cards are placed on the table. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Play cards from his hand onto the table. You can play only one type of animal, you cannot already own this type, and you must play more than are shown by an opponent. The opponents cards of this type must then be placed onto the deposit pile. <br/>    Pick up cards from a row. You take all the cards of a single type from either end of any row and add them to your hand, then place the card in the row adjacent to these cards (and all cards of the same type) in the scoring area.<br/>    Place one card from your hand at the end of a row.<br/><br/><br/>If a row is emptied, create a new row of ten cards from the deck. As soon as six cards of the same type are in the scoring area, players score points for their holdings. If you hold some number of &quot;24&quot; cards, for example, you score a number of points equal to the number of 24 cards in the scoring area; if you score for two, three, or more types of cards, then your total score for the round doubles, triples, etc.<br/><br/>After scoring, shuffle all cards from the deposit pile, scoring cards and all cards players have played, then place them under the deck. After the third scoring, players tally their points and see who wins.<br/><br/>(Gauner accommodates 2-4 players instead of 2-5.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome, brewmasters, to the world renowned Bavarian festival known as Oktoberfest! The 1810 wedding celebration of Crown Prince Ludwig I and Princess Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen swiftly became an annual tradition known as Oktoberfest. Each year the scope of the festival expanded, and by the late 1800s sponsored beer halls and competing breweries were in full operation.<br/><br/>Oktoberfest is a card-driven game loosely based on the folk festival which began as a public celebration of a royal wedding. Based during the festival in the late 1800s, players vie for control of each of six types of beer, even though many of those beer styles are barely available in Bavaria and completely unrelated to Oktoberfest. As patrons arrive at the festival, players bid to decide where they go and how much they drink. By placing cards in the various tents, players can purchase barrels of beer based on the type and number of patrons on the card. The player who gets rid of the most barrels of each gains points for that type of beer at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The problem? The game ends before all twelve tents can be completed, and only closed tents count for points. Whichever beer type is the last in the tent before it closes claims all points for that tent, and the players with the most barrels of each type acquire points.<br/><br/>But watch out for the evacuation card that comes out randomly and wipes out entire tents. Collect the right types of barrels, close tents with the corresponding beer cards on top, and victory could be yours!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a simulation of battleship combat, which abstracts each ship to four numeric attributes: attack, defense, speed and range.<br/>What you get is a thick paper map (22&quot; x 16&quot;) showing some coast outlines in different colors, 200 &frac12;&quot; cardboard counters, a 12-page rule-book and two dice. The counters represent WW2 battleships, cruisers and destroyers of various nationalities, plus markers to show ship speed and direction, targets, and damage inflicted.<br/><br/>[From the back of the box]<br/>Salvo is a fast paced, exciting simulation of surface Battleship actions of the Second World War. Practically every class of battleship that fought is represented, such as the Bismark, Iowa, Yamato and King George V. Cruisers and destroyers are represented by screening units. Scenarios include destruction of the French fleet at Mers-ek-Kebir, Suriago Strait, Second Guadalcanal, Calabria, North Cape and the Bismarck encounters. Hypothetical scenarios include such things as what might have happened if Halsey had deployed Lee's battleships to San Bernardino Strait during Leyte Gulf.<br/><br/>All the essentials of naval warfare are recreated, including gunnery, torpedoes, damage control and maneuvers. Also included are special rules depicting friendly fire, mines, command control, crew quality and shore batteries. Your playing skill will determine leadership quality! The map illustrates islands and land masses used in certain scenarios. Each hex equals 2000 yards and each game turn represents 10 minutes of real time. The game mechanics require no &quot;paperwork&quot; on the part of the players, for the resolution of combat or the execution of movement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Echt Spitze, you want to fill the spaces on your player sheet &mdash; both sides of it! &mdash; to score more points than anyone else.<br/><br/>To play, each player takes a sheet from the score pad of the same level (1-3). The sheet has a 5x5 grid of squares on each side, with the rows and columns being numbered 1-5. Many of the spaces feature an icon (fruit, flower, gem, etc.) surrounded by a soap bubble.<br/><br/>The active player rolls 4-6 dice, two more than the player count, then all players in turn choose one of the dice and place it on the matching number in either the row or column of their sheet. (Dice show 1-5 and a ?, which is a joker.) The active player then either keeps the remaining two dice or re-rolls them. Each player can then use one of the two common dice to target a particular space on their score sheet, e.g., if you placed a 4 on the 4 column and the two dice show 1 and 3, you then mark off either the 1-4 space or the 3-4 space on your sheet.<br/><br/>If this space has a soap bubble, you mark off this space, poke a hole in it with your pencil, then flip the sheet over and mark off the newly poked space. Now you'll continue play on the back of your sheet, flipping it over again only when you &quot;pop&quot; another soap bubble.<br/><br/>When you mark off an icon, no matter which side of the paper, track this in your score column. The first player to mark off all icons of a type receives the large bonus, then everyone else can score only the small bonus for this icon.<br/><br/>One or both of your chosen dice might have an X on them. If this is the case and you don't pop a bubble this turn, you can mark off one or two extra spaces adjacent to the originally marked space for that turn. With two Xs, if you marked 1-4, for example, then you could mark 1-5 and 2-5. If you mark all squares in a row or column, circle the star next to that line.<br/><br/>When someone scores their third type of icon, the game ends. Players tally their icon bonuses, points for each star (which vary per level), and 1 point for each collected icon that didn't receive a bonus. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Level 2 sheets have beehives, and when you mark off a beehive, the bees attack everyone else and they can no longer mark off this space, which means they can't complete this row and column. Level 3 sheets challenge you to create polyominoes with marked-out spaces, in addition to collecting icons.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What If the Japanese Invaded? (IPH). It&rsquo;s a low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic/operational-level, alternative history wargame of the campaign that could've resulted had the Japanese decided to launch an amphibious invasion of Oahu at the same time as their historic air raid. The game is intended for two players, one commanding the Japanese and the other commanding the US forces. The game system is focused so as to present the ground-commanders&rsquo; views of the campaign. Aero-naval operations &ndash; though certainly important in play &ndash; are presented more abstractly than would be the case in a design centered on those aspects of the campaign.<br/><br/>Each hex on the 34x22 large-hex map equals one mile (1.62 km) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents about four hours of daylight or an entire night. Playing pieces (176 iconic counters) represent ground units of approximately company size, or individual aircraft carriers or battleships, or enough aircraft sorties (about two to three dozen) needed to affect battlefield events at this scale. The rules contain a little less than 11,000 words. Two experienced players can finish a match in less than four hours.<br/><br/>The single counterfactual assumption underlying the game is Adm. Yamamoto decided to back the plan he scrapped historically in September 1941. That plan had called for an amphibious invasion, conducted by about two regiments, to land on Oahu at the same time as the air attacks were begun. The further supposition then is, the Japanese, once ashore, would&rsquo;ve had no more than about three days in which to achieve their now more ambitious goal: either secure the whole island or at least fight their way across enough of it &ndash; while thoroughly wrecking facilities as they came to them &ndash; to ensure the American recovery would be delayed as long as possible. The three-day limit is due to the fact that, by the end of that period, the Japanese carrier strike group would had to have withdrawn and the ground force&rsquo;s initial load of combat supply would be used up.<br/><br/>Rules cover such things as: variable landing sites, rough surf, carrier interventions, combat ground support, interdiction, a Nisei uprising, Ford Island and Battleship Row, night combat, banzai attacks and much more. The turn sequence is as follows.<br/><br/>I. Carrier Warfare Phase (only Game Turns 5 &amp; 9)<br/>A. Ship Disposition Segment<br/>B. Carrier Combat Segment<br/>II. US Submarine Attack Phase (only Game Turns 5 through 11)<br/>III. Japanese Landing Phase<br/>IV. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/>V. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/>VI. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/>VII. US Sub-Command Chit-Pull Phase*<br/><br/><br/>    May be preceded or followed by the Japanese Movement or Combat Phase, to the limit of one of such Japanese phase being executed per game turn upon that player&rsquo;s declarations of them.<br/><br/><br/>Magazine: World at War #14<br/><br/>",

Storm the castle walls, make sacrificial offerings, invoke and call up creatures in this highly snappy card game.<br/><br/>In more detail, your objective is to storm the enemy castle and take possession of their copy of the Necronomicon. The shields represent the defense value of the castle, and to storm a castle, you have to carry out an attack (swords) superior to its defenses (shields). To launch an attack, you should gather army formations, which are represented by soldiers, bowmen, and siege weapons cards. (You can attack with one or several cards at once.) Note that a castle cannot be attacked while its walls protect it.<br/><br/>The village deck provides the basic resources of your village: soldiers, archers, gold, cultists, sacrifices, builders, thieves, etc. You start with five cards, and on each turn you steal a card from this deck and carry out one single action: attack, defend, build, call up, sacrifice, etc. Lay ambushes for your enemies, steal their gold, and surprise them with a night-time attack so they can't tell what you're attacking them with. Use the arcane knowledge of your cultists to call up the powerful creatures of the Cthulhu deck and scare the wits out of your rival while in combat.<br/><br/>The siege deck contains siege weapons to carry out more powerful attacks, and you can use builders and gold to construct your siege weapons. Get special cards to scale the walls with greater speed and trick your enemies with the Cthulhu offering.<br/><br/>The sea hides the terrible Deep Ones. If you manage to keep them happy by offering sacrifices, they will reward you with additional resources &mdash; but you never know how many Deep Ones might come!<br/><br/>",

Somewhere there are the fuel tanks you need. <br/>Can you find them in time?<br/><br/>Aim of the Game!<br/>In this solitaire game, you must find three rocket fuel tanks and return to your spaceship before your spacesuit runs out of oxygen or battery power. If either of these levels drops below 1 during a systems check, you have lost the game.<br/><br/>Needed to Play!<br/>The deck of Map Cards (30 cards)<br/>The deck of Event and Equipment Cards (21 cards)<br/>1 Suit Card showing your remaining oxygen and battery power + 2 Tracking Cards which also include the Quick Rules Guide<br/>1 Astronaut, 1 Spaceship, and 3 Fuel Tank counters<br/><br/>Setting the Game Up!<br/>Shuffle the Map deck and deal the cards out face down in a 6 x 5 grid, there will be 5 rows of cards, each row will have 6 cards in it.<br/><br/>Find the card on the grid with the Spaceship icon on it and turn this card over to the other side, placing your Spaceship and Astronaut on it.<br/><br/>Playing the Game!<br/>Each turn of the game will consist of 3 phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1. Movement<br/>At the beginning of your turn you must move your Astronaut, from the card it is currently on, any number of cards in an orthogonal direction (this means up or down, left or right). The first two cards in distance you move you may do so for free. For each additional card you move during the turn you must lose either 1 level of your Oxygen or 1 level of your Battery Power. Move the Tracking Cards down the Oxygen or Battery tracks as needed to record this. You may change directions as you move (i.e. 1 card to the left and then one card up). You may never move diagonally.<br/><br/>You are trying to find, using your spacesuit&rsquo;s equipment, a series of numbered beacons (in pairs) which will locate where the 3 Fuel Tanks are stored. These beacons give you a set of coordinates (one beacon points up and down, the other points left and right). You will need to locate the pair of matching numbered beacons and then move to the card the beacons point to. In the example to the right, X marks the spot where one of the Fuel Tanks is located.<br/><br/>Phase 2. Events and Equipment<br/>After you have finished moving you must now draw 3 cards from the Events and Equipment deck. This deck has two types of cards.<br/>If this deck is empty when you go to draw a card, shuffle the discard pile to form a new deck to draw cards from.<br/><br/>A. Event Cards - these cause you to lose Oxygen or Battery Power due to your exploration.<br/>B. Equipment Cards - these cause you to gain resources you need (Oxygen and Battery Power), as well as give you special actions to help in your exploration.<br/><br/>Keep the Equipment cards in your hand from one turn to the next. You will need a pair of the same cards to gain the listed bonus. You may have no more than three Equipment cards in your hand at the end of the Events and Equipment phase.<br/><br/>Phase 3. Systems Check<br/>You must now check your Suit Systems. If either your Oxygen or Battery Power level is below 1 you have lost the game. Do not forget that you may spend a pair of matching cards at anytime during the System Check phase (Phase 3) to gain the listed bonus, by placing the cards on the discard pile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games website:<br/><br/>At the start of the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the Israelis could only spare two brigades to defend the strategic Golan Heights. On 6 October the Syrians attacked with five divisions, three of them mechanized, supported by mortars, artillery, mobile SAMs, and a heliborne commando brigade. The Israelis were therefore badly outnumbered, but were quickly reinforced by reservists (much sooner than the Syrians had anticipated). More significantly, the Israeli Air Force appeared overhead to impede the Syrian assault. However, the Syrians' surface-to-air missile batteries proved at least partially effective against those aircraft. Thus, among other things, the battle for the Golan would test the preeminence of air support against the ascendancy of the SAM.<br/><br/>Golan utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From artillery to air strikes, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. But Golan also introduces a new element to the battlefield: surface to air missiles. The Syrians fielded numerous SAM batteries during their advance, downing many Israeli jets and compelling that air force to implement new tactics. A single armor battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by air support &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy commando brigade defending a fort. As that attack gets underway, though, the air support may find itself under fire from a mobile SAM battery. More support will be necessary to take the fort, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Golan the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the Yom Kippur War. Winning is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This chess-like variant is themed around the military formations used by the Ancient Greeks. Each player has 15 identical pieces that are set up on opposite sides of the board, which is comprised of an 8 x 8 playing field of squares that is further divided diagonally in alternate fashion (see picture). Pieces are comprised of: 8 small triangles of various orientation (Auxiliaries), 4 squares (Archers), which are the size of two Auxiliaries, 2 Hoplites (which are the size of an Archer with a Auxiliary on top), and 1 Syntagma, a larger triangle (the size of 2 Auxiliaries combined). Since each piece must always be oriented to face it's owner (diagram for set-up is printed on the board), you'll find that some pieces are not interchangeable with others of the same type (like Hoplites and Auxiliaries). This is important as all movement is done by moving pieces diagonally, horizontally or vertically along paths that are not blocked and the piece must end on a space where the board outline matches his piece.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture or &quot;Phalanx&quot; your opponents pieces - not by jumping (Checkers) or by taking it's place on the board (Chess), but by surrounding it on two of it's sides with your pieces. A multiple Phalanx attack is possible if a move surrounds several of his opponents pieces with a single move. When 14 of a players 15 pieces are captured, that player can no longer win and is eliminated. Tied or games that are a draw (you can play to a time limit as well) are determined by the value of each players remaining pieces, which are from 5 - 20 points each.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game the players are pilots of fire fighting planes trying to quench a bush fire spreading around an active volcano.<br/>The main priority is not only to extinguish local fires but also to isolate greater fire areas from the volcano so that the (neutral) ground units are able to extinguish it.<br/><br/>This is a tactical game without any random influence apart from setup. All information is open. The initial bush fire is created by placing hex tiles on a table and defining which of those tiles is the active volcano.<br/>After that, everything depends on the players, who will be forced to cooperate from time to time in order to win in the end.<br/><br/>This game uses the components of Feurio!, but is a stand-alone game.<br/><br/>A player owning a copy of Feurio! can start playing immediately - no additional materials are necessary.<br/><br/>The end situation of a basic Feurio! game can be used as the starting point of a Vulkan! game, because in Feurio! the hex tiles are placed onto the table, while in Vulkan! the tiles are picked from the table to gather points.<br/><br/>The game also includes a solitaire variant and a cooperative variant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to your favorite holiday destination: Hawaii! Hawaii is a place to relax, drink lots of cocktails, and do nothing all day &mdash; except, of course, if you're a dictator. So what are dictators doing during their holidays? The same thing they do every day: Trying to take over the world! And what is a better place to start then that pesky &quot;Ol' Murica&quot;?<br/><br/>Revenge of the Dictators is a way too competitive board game for 2-5 players. For the course of the game (yes, only during the game) each player becomes a vicious self-loving dictator. The ultimate goal of the game is easy: race across the map of North America, confront the President, take over the USA, and by doing so gain absolute control of America's forces and therefore the world! The only thing the dictators have to do to avoid eminent repercussions is disarm some nuclear facilities in order to remove the nuclear threat targeting their home countries. Sounds simple, right? The only thing is that dictators aren't used to working together &mdash; and in the end there can be only one Grandmaster &Uuml;ber Dictator of the world!<br/><br/>In more detail, each player receives a dictator passport with a special ability unique to that dictator. The board shows a map of North America and is divided into four &quot;Nuclear Zones&quot;; each zone consists of several states, of which some include a nuclear facility. Every player receives a unique nuclear facility card for each nuclear zone.<br/><br/>The game is divided into turns, and each turn consists of any possible combination of the following three actions: draw a Command card, play a Command card and Travel (maximum of once per turn). Players start in Hawaii and race across the map towards the White House in Washington DC. During the game, players can disarm any number of the nuclear facilities they received by rolling a die. In the end, the players have to confront the President at the White House and convince him to give up control of the U.S. by rolling a die. The chance of success drastically increases with each individually disarmed nuclear facility. Players are able to gain bonuses by disarming nuclear facilities of Nuclear Zone 4 (Canada and Mexico). In the meantime, the U.S. &mdash; that is, the game system itself &mdash; fights back by increasing the DEFCON level (with various effects) and with the use of random Founding Father cards which are included in the Command deck.<br/><br/>",

One player directs the Islamic Caliphate, the other an assortment of not always cooperative Christian kingdoms. Each turn represents 25 years. Play starts in 850, when the Christian advance began in earnest, through 1250, by which time the outcome was inevitable.<br/><br/>The game includes an area movement map and 200+ counters representing Andalusians, North African jihadist forces (Almohades and Almoravides), Frankish, Catalan, Aragonese, Asturias/Leon, Castilians, Portuguese, Military Orders (Templars, Santiago, etc.) and Christian Crusaders. The Christian player controls the Christian kingdoms except when a &quot;War among infidels&quot; event gives the Islamic player control of one Christian kingdom's units for that turn. The Frankish units are generally neutral, but the Islamic player can try to activate them via random events (simulating the assorted wars between the Frankish and Aragonese kingdoms, especially during the XIII century).<br/><br/>Special rules cover noted leaders such as Al-Mansur and El Cid, North African invasions, the Taifa Kingdoms, independence of Portugal and Castille, rebellions, viking raids, and the St. James sepulchre.<br/><br/>",

This spectre does not distinguish between gods and men, all are crushed beneath the feet of what can only be called...The Cataclysm. Five great beings have formed a Covenant to halt the devastation. Battle rivals to prove that you&rsquo;re a commander that The Five need in order to stop The Cataclysm and earn your place amongst their great champions.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe GamePhoenix Covenant is a tactics battle card game that fans have called &quot;like Magic meets Final Fantasy Tactics&quot; - and yes, you can believe them. It's far more than &quot;cards on a board;&quot; there's real strategic depth and you're not subject to mere dice rolls at every critical moment.<br/><br/>In this universe, you are a great commander trying to prove yourself as the best of them all in a battle of wills. Outmaneuver your foes and create tactical formations by turning your cards, outwit others with well-timed unit abilities, combos and spells, and outplay opponents by taking advantage of our unique special-summoning Commander cards, directional armor and attack system, and built-right-on-the-field structure cards.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMore DetailsCommander Units allow players to forward-deploy units against opposing forces. While you can use them for their native abilities or attack power, forward-deploying can turn the tide of a battle. Position-based mechanics augment keyword-based and event-based mechanics seen in card games up to now. Some cards grow in power based on their position on the board, others might protect units next to them, and others might deflect enemy attacks.<br/><br/>The unique square (80mm x 80mm) card units come with a combination of armor and weakpoints. Damage is reduced when a unit is attacked on an armored side, while a unit suffers a critical hit (extra damage) when hit in a weakpoint. You'll need to maneuver and turn your units to attack your enemies' unarmored sides and weakpoints while protecting your own in deadly tactical duels across the game board.<br/><br/>In the Player vs. Player (PvP) head-to-head mode, you test your tactical and strategic might against everyone at once. Choose your army well, learn spells, and consider constructing powerful structures to support your forces. There is also a 2v2 team battle mode for all out there who want to test their skills while bringing a friend along for the fight!<br/><br/>A Player vs. Environment (PvE) cooperative mode is under development, and multiple scenarios are being tested. With it, you will play alongside friends and take on missions that The Five require you and other great commanders to complete. You may even be able to design your own scenarios.<br/><br/><br/>",

To survive, you'll need the latest laser-guided machine gun and the most arcane magic spells. Every piece of gear you use to customize your figure directly impacts your chances of survival. Game play is fast and deadly. On the mean streets of Shadowrun Duels, life is short &mdash; so come armed to the teeth!<br/><br/>Shadowrun Duels is a combat-oriented game in which shadowrunners wage battles of magic and technology to become champions of the Megasprawl!<br/><br/>Your Figure<br/>Your shadowrunner is a uniquely painted and sculpted figure that represents one of the many types of shadowrunners that prowl the urban sprawl. Pose it on or off its base and equip it with an array of gear.<br/><br/>Your Figure's Gear<br/> Each figure comes with gear. These pieces of gear can be swapped between characters, allowing you to customize your figure for each game. Each piece of gear has a point cost and a game bonus printed on it. Gear may give your character extra dice, damage protection in the form of shield, or both.<br/><br/>Your Figure&rsquo;s Base<br/> Your figure comes with a unique base stand, which is also a playing piece in the game. The base and its three combat dials display all your figure&rsquo;s game information. The base details your figure&rsquo;s name, the number and kind of dice it gets, its collector&rsquo;s number, its point value, and its damage bonus.<br/><br/>The numbers and symbols on your figure&rsquo;s combat dials represent its abilities in the game. As your figure receives damage, you&rsquo;ll click its combat dials, changing the numbers that appear.<br/><br/>",

Players must complete actions from the top of the card to the bottom, but can skip any action that is not locked.<br/><br/>Locked actions are indicated by the lock icon.<br/><br/>Reactive Actions with a black background allow players to perform the maneuver up to the speed listed.<br/><br/>Keywords and unique pilot abilities may also change how actions and cards interact.

        "description": "From DecisionGames.com:<br/><br/>Air War Over the Solomons<br/><br/>The island of Guadalcanal in the South Pacific was the base for American aircraft squadrons that engaged Japanese Navy and Army air forces over the Solomons. Those squadrons became known as the &ldquo;Cactus Air Force&rdquo; (from the codename given to the island itself). Cactus Air Force is a two- player wargame covering the air campaign over the Solomon Islands during critical period late in 1942. Both the American and Japanese players move their bombers to attack critical targets while using fighters to struggle for air superiority.<br/><br/>Each player controls units representing air groups. All of the famous aircraft are here: Japanese Zeroes, Bettys and Oscars, and Allied F4F Wildcats, P-40s, and B-17s. Each unit is rated for air superiority, bombing and speed. The game uses a new and unique system that facilitates aerial operations, dispensing with the usual record keeping. The map covers the entire Solomon Island chain centered on Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>Cactus Air Force is part of the Air Wars mini-game series. Each player has a deck of Campaign Cards. They generate a range of events, including major naval battles such as Eastern Solomons, to which players can commit their air units. Certain cards can be played in combination to gain operational advantage, leading to tense decision making. There are special rules for Henderson Field, fighter-bombers, and the Tokyo Express.<br/><br/>",

The infighting among the city's major factions has only increased since war's end and the city itself faces utter destruction as the dangers of the surrounding wilderness grow. Without leadership the city will soon fall. There must be one who can unite the city under their leadership and restore order. You must be this one.<br/><br/>Welcome to Allegiance: War of Factions, a collectible card game where each player takes the role of a lord or lady vying for control of a mighty city. Extend your influence in an attempt to control the city's major political, religious, and economic powers. While fighting for control, it may even be necessary to join forces with those who you would call your enemies as the city itself stands on the brink of being overrun by the denizens of the wild.<br/><br/>So then, to which Factions will you make your call for support? House Mosfin? Is the strength of Droman Tregorian and his house sufficient to stand with on your way to dominance? Or would your ties to the Goddess Kalim better serve your efforts? Surely those who support the Glory of Kalim would recognize your true strength and the divine calling which Kalim, herself, has given you. Yet, there are those veterans, men of honor and war, who have the taste of freedom and blood fresh on their tongues. Perhaps your call to them to follow you yet again into battle would give you the strength needed to claim control over the city. The decision is yours - but choose wisely who you would call friend, for in this trying time it is unsure where their allegiances lie.<br/><br/>Allegiance: War of Factions introduces a unique system of play which allows everyone to become more involved in every phase of the game. Why sit back waiting for your enemies to make their move when you can stop them before they even get the chance? Form alliances, threaten your enemies, back-stab your friends, hoard the city's resources - the choice is yours!<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to be the first player to play or discard their entire hand.<br/><br/>Players start with seven cards in hand from a deck comprised of 52 suited cards (resembling a standard deck) and 22 &quot;Joker Crabs&quot; that are unsuited. During play, players use two discard piles, one for suited cards (referred to simply as &quot;The Discard Pile&quot;) and another for Joker Crabs (referred to as the Joker Pile).<br/><br/>Suited cards may be played on the discard pile on top of other cards that match their suit or number. Once a suited card is played, a player may also discard all cards of higher value of the same suit from their hand. When a Jack, Queen, or King is on top of the discard pile, no Joker Crabs may be played. Additionally, if a player cannot play, they must draw cards at the end of their turn.<br/><br/>Joker Crabs, which are all based on real crab species, have unique effects. All but one of them can benefit a player by, for instance, forcing an opponent to draw from their hand or allowing them to play unique combos. The final Joker Crab &mdash; the Lobster &mdash; is a barrier to victory as it cannot be played; should you hold the Lobster, you must find a creative way of discarding it without playing it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Campaign for North Africa, 1941-42<br/><br/>What, another North Africa game? Yes  but here is something almost completely different from any WWII Campaign game you've seen: no CRT (or any other tables), buckets o' dice, and cards  all used in a totally new approach to gaming that can be learned in 5 minutes and played in a few hours.<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics for Blood &amp; Sand will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. However, Designer Richard Berg, no stranger to this campaign, has added to this accessible simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no sirree!<br/><br/>The game also uses cards, one deck (of 27) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (The cards don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you're so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units, build fortifications, or bring in Reinforcements. The RP choices are theirs, but there are far more choices than points.<br/><br/>The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent's) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement, to forcing the Allies to Withdraw units, to the effects of Rommel and other leaders.<br/><br/>What the Players are Saying: Here are some the reactions from the Blood &amp; Sand play testers and rules readers:<br/><br/>&quot;Very simple and very easy. No one should have a problem with the rules.&quot;  Adam Freitag<br/><br/>&quot;I would hope to use it as an introductory wargame, but I am optimistic that it would be sufficiently interesting to keep experienced wargames happy as well.&quot;  Paul Marjoram<br/><br/>&quot;This looks like a fun game  The added tension of the need to balance the use of RPs [Resource Points] for units, forts and cards is appealing - a good abstraction of the logistics concerns of the campaign.&quot; Edmund Hack<br/><br/>&quot;Using cards in this manner may make for some very agonizing decisions - a good thing in a game. I also think the combat system is clean and simple, yet effective.&quot; Jeff Paul<br/><br/>The rules for Blood &amp; Sand are only 8 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire, covering four scenarios, ranging in size (the two maps are used only in the full campaign game) and playing time Playing time for the Basic Game has averaged about 3 hours. 176 counters including the blanks).<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to place three of their colored pixels in a row while at the same time blocking the other players from doing so.  The twist in Pixels is where you can place your pixels on the 8x8 grid.  Along the top and side of the board are sliders that point to 1 row and 1 column.  The intersection of the 2 sliders show where you must place you tile.  On your turn you can only move one of the 2 sliders, NOT both.  This limits your placements to a specific row or column.  Be careful not to set up your opponent's next move and you might win.<br/><br/>2008 Mensa Select<br/><br/>",

Summoning their bravest adventurers, they mount a desperate expedition to free the divine spirits of the Ancient Portal.

All Summons are represented with a pawn that you move across the game board. In ACT I there are 3 Non Life Base Summon Classes: Dragons, Beasts and Vessels. <br/>In ACT II Army and Berserkers were added to the game. Also, in ACT II new Summons for each Class were introduced, including a new Life Base.<br/><br/>All effects, power-ups and Summons are managed by using cards. These cards can be activated by using different types of energy. Several game tactics are embedded in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>When Pakistan declared itself independent from India, the enmity that had long existed between the two cultures erupted into open war. Since 1947, Pakistan and India have been military rivals and have fought several wars. Those wars, however, have been inconclusive. Since 1998, both nations have become nuclear powers and, consequently, the next Indo-Pakistani war could potentially become nuclear. Indeed, another war between Pakistan and India may be the final showdown.<br/><br/>Showdown utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From attack helicopters to self-propelled artillery, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. Showdown also introduces a new and disconcerting element: tactical nuclear weapons. Both Pakistan and India now have sizeable nuclear arsenals, and thus what begins as a conventional war may erupt into a nuclear exchange.<br/><br/>In Showdown, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses likely to be sustained during another Indo-Pakistani war. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management, particularly with regard to nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>",

Black Sam took the map with him to his watery grave &ndash; but perhaps the surviving navigator can help to find the treasure by locating the exact position of the islands. Is Antigua one of them?<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Players start with a ship and its crew. Each player during his/er turn uses the actions provided by the crewmen of the ship. Each player may have a maximum of 4 crewmen. Each crewman has an action that may change during the game, thanks to the officer mechanism. A player, by using the officer, may<br/>change the crewmen available actions and thus change the gameplay for all players.<br/>The purpose of the game is to discover islands with treasure (with the help of the crew's Navigator), or while traveling, clash with other players and steal their treasure.<br/><br/>CREW MEN:<br/><br/>    Kanonier: one kanonier crewman draws a card from the crew deck and adds its attack to the battle with a +1 bonus. Two kanoniers add +2 bonus<br/>    Offizier: changes the crewmen actions and then is discarded from the ship's crew.<br/>    Navigator: reveals a sea card your ship is on. If it is an island, gain a crew card from the deck for its treasure value and then discard the Navigator.<br/>    Steuermann: one Steuermann moves your ship twice. Two move your ship three times.<br/>    Maat: one Maat hires two new crewmen. Two hires three new crewmen. (if you have more than 4 crewmen, you must discard down to four).<br/><br/><br/>GAME END:<br/>The game ends when the biggest part of the sea has been discovered (how big is this part varies, according to the number of players), or when a pre-defined number of battles has happened and the winner is the player with the most treasures.<br/><br/>",

The players have a number of turns to find the guilty party by interrogating suspects with the Lie Detector machine.<br/><br/>To play Lie Detector, the Suspect cards are divided among the game players.  One of the six square 'Guilty' cards is inserted into the back of the Lie Detector machine so that no one knows which suspect is the criminal; each 'Guilty' card has four suspects on it, with the guilty suspect being determined by the orientation in which the card is inserted.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player questions a suspect by taking the  suspect's card, placing it over the front of the Lie Detector and inserting the Lie Detector's wand through a hole in the card and into the Lie Detector itself.  If the testimony is false, a bell rings and a needle on the machine points to &quot;False&quot;.  If it is true, no bell rings and the needle points to &quot;True&quot;.  (e.g. - The Racketeer says &quot;the Suspect has a 'Big Jaw'... if it comes up 'True' you know that one of the six suspects with a big jaw committed the crime)<br/><br/>Also included in the game are special 'Secret Information' cards. These cards have testimony that is known only to the player who own the cards.<br/><br/>By process of elimination, the suspects are narrowed down, until a player feels confident that he can make a successful accusation and 'make an arrest'.  He checks the guilty card in the machine.  If he is right, he gets 5 points plus bonus points for the number of face-up suspects still showing on the table.<br/><br/>Additional rounds are played until one player's score is 25 points of more.<br/><br/>Mattel, Inc. re-issued this game as Spy Detector with different artwork, and it did not sell nearly as well.<br/><br/>",

There's all the regular grasping for real estate and struggle for power, but you also have to deal with the media: too much looting or hippie-bashing can cause too much unwanted exposure.<br/><br/>The game was published in issue #336 of Strategist (March 2000) and is now available to download.<br/><br/>",

In the game of San, Ni, Ichi, you will be taking on the role of a martial artist who has mastered combat using the three elements: fire, water, and wood. Each game will engage you in a thrilling battle to determine who is the greatest ninja master of all time!<br/><br/>Each ninja is armed with an array of Attack and Weapon cards with special effects.  Each round ninjas choose a card from their hand and play it face down in front of them. All cards are revealed at once - during which time &ldquo;hi-ya!&rdquo; and other ninja related noises are encouraged but not required.  Cards are played on in order from lowest to highest Strength - the ninja(s) with the highest Strength Attack Card on top of their Combat Pile takes those cards as damage. All other Combat Piles remain in play and can be added to in subsequent rounds.  The game continues until all cards have been played and final damage is resolved.<br/><br/>The player with the lowest total damage is the Ultimate Ninja Master and may karate chop the losers in the neck (or just bask in the glory of victory until the next game begins).<br/><br/>",

These two powerful formations might just turn the tide and defeat the Japanese.<br/><br/>Can the British player hold on long and well enough to convince General Wavell that the situation can be restored?

        "description": "If you know how to play Magic, you are half way there in this blatant Magic clone. What makes this game different is there are two areas to fight/control and the artwork on the cards.<br/><br/>The story, Heaven has fallen and the Angels trapped on Earth are trying to use the Matrix (internet) to open a gateway into Heaven.<br/><br/>There are six basic types of cards.<br/><br/>Locations (lands) that open (tap) to provide aura (mana) or store tau (victory points.) There are 8 different convictions (colors) so from a starter it will still be near impossible to build a deck.<br/><br/>Characters (creatures) represent the fallen hosts and heathen groups that can be called. These can battle in the Wilds (real world) or plug in and leave their body and fight in the Matrix. While there, if they die they're ripped back into their body.<br/><br/>Alephs (artifacts) are powerful talismans that attach to characters or locations.<br/><br/>Enhancements (enchantments) attach to other cards for positive or negative affects.<br/><br/>Celestial Powers (sorceries) can be played on your turn only and are discarded immediately.<br/><br/>Miracles (instants) are instant effects that can be played anytime.<br/><br/>To win the game you need to play cards in the Matrix that can store tau and protect them. Each card can only hold so much, so you will need to call more then one. You will need to store enough tau (5 to 21 depending on the number of players and desired game length) to open a gateway into heaven.<br/><br/>The game is a bit more complicated than Magic but with fewer cards available not as rich. There is also a social voting element similar to V:tES/Jyhad.  Special mention must be made of the cards. The cards are about an inch longer than most ccgs, with most of the extra room taken up by the stunning artwork. Kudos to Rick Berry, the graphic designer, for making one of the most striking looking games out there.<br/><br/>",

A game lasts 20 to 60 minutes depending on the number of players. Every player turn is divided into two main phases:<br/><br/>1. Herophase<br/>2. Monsterphase<br/>The active player plays both phases and then the player to their left becomes the active player.<br/>1. The Herophase:<br/>The player recruits his Heroes and uses spells to conquer his battlefield, defeat the monsters controlled by the opposing player and seal the portals where they emerge.<br/><br/>2. The Monsterphase:<br/>The opposing player recruits and controls monsters on the active player&rsquo;s battlefield. The opposing player tries to stop the active player by overrunning Andoria with these evil creatures.<br/>This abstract strategy allows the player to win the game in two different ways; either by defeating the forces of darkness and sealing the portals, or by overrunning his opponent&rsquo;s battlefield with monsters.<br/><br/>Achieving victory by controlling the battlefields will require both strategic and tactical skill. Players will need to recruit powerful units, such as warriors or dragons, and use their unique abilities. They can be strengthened by casting helpful spells and building protective barriers.<br/><br/>Will your heroes have the strength to unite the kingdoms and close the portals? Or will you aid the monsters in their quest to plunge Andoria into darkness and silence its music forever?<br/><br/>",

There are shops, a few banks (including the bank of England), streets, Scotland Yard (with a prison) and the hideouts of the bands of thieves.<br/><br/>One player plays the police and the other players, a band of thieves each. The goal of the thieves is to rob banks. In order to access the bank the thieves need tools like a blowtorch or dynamite. These items must be collected in the shops.  Both policemen and thieves may get help from different cards. With those cards the thieves can move their pawns to safe places, order a police to go back to the police station, etc... The policemen can use the cards to raid a location, shoot a thief, and conduct other actions.<br/><br/>The are 4 small banks and a big one: &quot;The Bank of England&quot;. The thieves not only have to steal the money from the safe, they also have to be able to escape and bring the money to their hideout. If the police catches them, the money returns to the bank.<br/><br/>The players agree at the beginning of the game on the game length and number of banks they have to rob in order to win. Of course the player who plays the policemen has to stop the robberies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stalingrad Solitaire is a solitaire game simulating the last weeks of the  encircled German 6th Army in the pocket German troops nicknamed &ldquo;The  Cauldron&rdquo; that formed in and to the west of the city of Stalingrad when Soviet troops broke through the Wehrmacht&rsquo;s front lines in December  1942.<br/><br/>You represent 6th Army&rsquo;s commander, General Paulus. All actions  of the Soviet commander Zhukov and subordinate units are strictly  controlled by the game rules. As Paulus, your goal is to save the trapped army in the Cauldron while at the same time cooperating  with the high command (OKW) to preserve the integrity of the entire  southern front in Russia. Each turn you perform various types of actions  within the pocket. Die rolls and rules determine the strategic  situation and strategy employed by Army Group South outside the pocket,  specifically in terms of the commitment levels of the Luftwaffe (air  force) and General Hoth's relief force.<br/><br/>Each turn represents one to five days, depending on the  level of activity. The entire board represents territory  approximately 35 by 65 miles. German units typically represent  divisions, while Soviet units are officially armies that were usually  the rough equivalent of a German division. Each supply point represents about 50 tons delivered per day. Each evacuated wounded factor represents 1500 men.<br/><br/>This war game is big in scope (and lettering) and can be  played in a (long) evening. Rather than standard 9/16&quot; or even 5/8&quot; inch  counters, this  game utilizes our custom 3/4&quot; square counter die to create large, thick  counters that are easy to see and manipulate. The base game  also  contains a map with easy ergonomics, and a well tested game system that  approaches its subject with enough abstraction to keep  the game tight,  but enough detail to do justice to history and create an array of  complex decisions.<br/><br/>The map represents the city of Stalingrad and surrounding area and contains 64 areas for regulating movement and combat. Each area is linked to every other area it is connected to by a line.<br/><br/>The player controls all vacant areas inside the German Perimeter marked on the map. The player also controls all areas containing German units, regardless of their location. Any vacant area outside the Perimeter or occupied by a Soviet unit are under Soviet control. No area may contain units from both sides.<br/><br/>Game counters represent combat units and information markers. German units are blue, their Rumanian allies are yellow, Soviet units are red, and information markers are white. The number of counters provided in the game is deliberately limited.<br/><br/>Cards are used to determine outcomes for weather, offensives, as well as individual attacks, and provide random changes to the game state as well as randomised situations.<br/><br/>",

When you do this, you score 1-4 points based on how many tiles you return; these points are represented by tree segments, with the 4-point tree segment being taller than four 1-point segments.<br/><br/>When the last pair of tiles is removed from the board, players compare the height of their trees, and whoever has the tallest tree wins.<br/><br/>",

The pieces are solid cylinders that lie in the grooves of the board in between the Hubs. The grooves that lie along the longer edges of the board are the goal lines. Each player has two Woods and two Granites while the Flag is a communal piece.<br/><br/>Each move is a single 90 degree rotation in any direction off a Hub. Woods can only do ordinary rotations (Free moves). Granites can do Free moves but can also shunt past any Woods that they&rsquo;re connected to (Shunt moves). The only way you can move the Flag is by rotating it off any of your own pieces that it&rsquo;s connected to (Flag moves). Players take alternate turns to make their plays. You have two moves per play to move your pieces, and you can also move the Flag as many times as you wish and at any time in your play.<br/><br/>Create structures with your pieces to move the Flag forward, and try to break up any structures that your opponent may be trying to build. Once you have moved the Flag onto your opponent&rsquo;s goal line, you&rsquo;re the winner.<br/><br/>",

To start the game, one player reveals a tile, then the next player reveals another tile. Do the ghost colors match on these tiles? If not, advance the clock hands by five minutes, then turn the tiles face down once again. If they do match, however, the next player reveals another tile. Once again, if this tile doesn't match the others, the clock hands advance five minutes. Find the third colored ghost in the trio, though, and you get to stack them together and place them in the room of the same color. In either case, the next player in clockwise order takes the next turn.<br/><br/>If the players return all the ghosts to their rooms before the tower reaches midnight, they win. Otherwise, they've lost the game, and the ghosts will continue to haunt the halls of the tower, forever at unrest...<br/><br/>",

Under the conditions of the Fuero of Teruel (Teruel&rsquo;s laws), the three cultures kept their traditions alive, living their legacy in the streets and in the history of the city.<br/><br/><br/>Populi Turolii is a game for 3 to 8 players. You are an influential person in your community and you must take care of your people&rsquo;s interests throughout some events, without breaking the balance of power among the three cultures. The winner is the one who achieves the objectives written in his/her character card at the end of one of the rounds.<br/> Components of the game:<br/><br/>     1 Rulebook.<br/>     96 Cards.<br/><br/><br/>Playing the game:<br/><br/>The game is divided into a variable number of rounds, which are composed of different stages:<br/><br/><br/>Stage 1: Negotiations<br/>Each player looks at each of the three events that are on the table. The players can negotiate and try to persuade the others to deal with the rest of the events.<br/> Stage 2: Decision-making<br/>Beginning by the first player and clockwise, each player chooses one of his game cards and places it face-up on one of the events. This action must be repeated until all players have played all their cards.<br/><br/><br/>Stage 3: Scoring<br/>Once all the cards have been assigned, all the events must be checked one by one, analyzing the game cards placed on them.<br/>After checking the three events, the total movement of each culture must be calculated. Now check if any player has won. In this case, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Although only one person rolls the dice at a time, everyone can profit from the dice roll and also place a button. But be careful! The fuller the board, the riskier it becomes to play. Then it's a case of getting out in time so as not to lose your buttons!<br/><br/>Buttons is played over several rounds. In every round, the goal of the players is to place buttons on the spaces. At the end of a round, players score for the buttons they've placed; each set of three gives them a star, which is placed on the player board. The first player to have either twelve stars or five stars in a row wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The usual Uno rules - Players race to empty their hands and catch opposing players with cards left in theirs, which score points. In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.<br/><br/>WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Victory Lap Card. When played, each player puts their hand face down on the table and passes it to the next player. Only the player of the victory lap card gets to look at the hand in front of them, which they choose to either keep or pass. If they keep passing, the hands keep getting passed around, until the Victory Lap player selects a hand to keep. Play then continues with all players adopting the new decks they now have in front of them.<br/><br/>",

Very accurate historically.<br/>Its actually not a game on the war at all, but a double battle game featuring a frontier battle from early in the war (the Battle of Fr&ouml;schweiler (or W&ouml;rth), August 6, 1870),  and a major defeat suffered by Napoleon III later in the conflict (the Battle of Sedan, September 1, 1870)...looks like a quad-style game that never got volume 2 with its other 2 battles. It's a shame that Markham didn't revisit the game for more battles; it could have been so much better with a few more engagements.<br/><br/>",

In each game, multiple tactical 'combo' options allow a player to drain opponents of their dice, while trying to control the wild element 'Z' and convert it to one of the four main elements of Air, Earth, Fire and Water. Each player chooses from four different alien races, Master of a single element, each with variable race powers - in a battle to become the Master Zee. <br/>The game is actually 2-in-1. The 3-4 player challenge game and a very different 2 player tug-of-war game, as players attempt to control the flow of energy and energise the monolith with their element dice. ElemenZ is an easy game to learn but nonetheless offers much tactical depth, easily grasped by both kids and adults.<br/><br/>",

Main goal is to win race around the world and collect as much as possible discoveries and treasures from various places. There are 22 secret locations in game and 20 artifacts.<br/><br/>Game has few great features;<br/><br/>     Each player can chose 1 character he will lead. Every character has his bio, statistics which have great impact on every situation player can encounter. There are 6 characters to chose. Each character has 5 stats (Cleverness, Wisdom, Diplomacy, Strength, Navigation)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     During his travel, player can also use a lot of equipment to enhance abilities of his character. These tools are located on markets around the globe, but once they are obtained, they can give new options to a player. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Many of treasures can be sold. Currency is strong point of the game; walking on foot around globe is not good idea, so player can chose transport with Carriage, Caravan, Train or Ship. Those trips costs - and you can earn money sending your character to work in city.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Game uses two systems created by Jaroslaw Bilinski: TnE and Ocean, which - combined, give great feel and increase players control over his character and actions he takes in-game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In some cities player can hire guide and mercenaries to protect him while hi travel to some location. But such party costs a lot of money &ndash;not every character in game is suitable to walk alone into desert without proper gear. <br/><br/><br/>Basically, you chose what you like: be it exploring jungle or dig in Piramids, but be sure you have good stats for either, or at least tools and equipment!<br/><br/>",

If you don&rsquo;t want to be the vampire&rsquo;s next meal, try to successfully match eight pairs of magic items that enchant the castle&rsquo;s gate and escape!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>On the table there are 16 face-down cards (8 items in two colours). The aim of the game is to discover all pairs of cards cards (like in a Memory) within 12 rounds. In his turn, a player has to choose one of two things: observe cards or indicate two identical cards. In the first action, after having inspected two cards, he can also share his discovery with other players, but only in two ways. Where are the cards with the same color, or where are the cards with the same items. The second action, which is an indication of two cards, after the proper indications I am allowed to take another action immediately. So the game can be won in the last round, provided that will indicate correctly 8 pairs in a row. In the case of incorrect reference the team has to take one token of blood. Three tokens of blood causes loss of the game. You also lose the game, if you are not be able to discover all card in 12 rounds.<br/><br/>",

Heel yourself with a proper six shooter and prepare for a real shootout.<br/><br/>In Wanted 3-5 players will take on a roles of an infamous Old West characters and shoot their way to the riches. Each turn the players are secretly choosing one of the five locations they&rsquo;re heading to. After revealing the cards, the characters can use the special ability connected with that location &ndash; you can rob a Bank, buy something useful at a General Store etc. Unless of course two or more players choose the same spot &ndash; then it comes to a shootout with only one gunslinger winning at the end. The player who have the most money at the end, wins the game.<br/><br/>Wanted is a fast and fun experience with tons of interaction. Each character has his own set of 5 cards, which allow him to move and are also used during a shootout. Although there&rsquo;s also a luck factor involved with a single dice used to determine the outcome of shooting abilities, each character plays differently and has his own strengths and weaknesses. You can try to get the best items and use them to your advantage, try to avoid other players and steal as much as you can or just go straight into a fight to stop the other players from using the locations&rsquo; abilities. The choice is yours but remember &ndash; this town is really small and you&rsquo;ll eventually find yourself in the midst of a shootout.<br/><br/>Publisher Note: there's a special 2 player variant included in the box.<br/><br/>",

Will you play safe and bank the points to start a new line, or will you keep trying to add to the line to claim a jackpot?<br/><br/>The deck consists of cards in four colors numbered 1-100 and six &quot;Bet&quot; cards numbered 3-5. Shuffle the deck, then lay out cards in the market equal to two more than the number of players. Starting with the first player, each player must pick a card, then either start a line/add it to their line or place it in their hand. Your maximum hand size is two, and if you can't add the card to your hand or to your line (because it would break the ascending/descending pattern), you must score your line, then play that card to start a new line. You can add one Bet card to your line without regard for its ascending/descending status or the value of your end card.<br/><br/>After drafting a card, you may choose to play one card from your hand into your line, then you may choose to score your line. When you score, if you have a Bet card in the line, see whether you've added a number of cards to your line after the bet that at least equals the value of the Bet; if so, take a positive number token equal to the Bet card, and if not, flip that token to its negative side instead. Next, discard three cards from the line, then flip all the remaining cards face down and place them in your scoring pile.<br/><br/>After everyone one has drafted (and optionally played and scored), discard unchosen Bet cards, then place unchosen number cards under the jackpot token that matches their color: yellow under the star, green under the leaf, etc. If during your turn, you add the third card of a color to your line, you immediately claim the cards under the matching jackpot token and place them in your scoring pile.<br/><br/>When you can't lay out enough cards, each player in turn plays one card from their hand, then scores their line and tallies their points. You earn 1 point for each scored card, then gain/lose points from the Bet tokens you collected. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

If your die lands showing the same face as another one of your dice, call out quickly so that you can reclaim one of those dice, then shoot it again in the same round.<br/><br/>When you claim targets in a round, those targets are placed under your dice stack and opponents can try to land on them in the subsequent round to steal them from you. Any targets not stolen this way are now safe from future theft.<br/><br/>The first player to claim four targets wins!<br/><br/>",

Upon entering they look at the cards in the bldg. If there are Evil Characters in the (small) stack, they must be battled (modified die roll) first, before rescuing ANY Heroes or Lost Souls. Defeat the Evil, rescue your choice. Evil characters can be defeated via the specific attributes (either Strength, Wisdom or Faith) the players' Heroes possesses. Some of the EC's are very strong and the player may choose NOT to battle and leave the bldg.<br/><br/>The game ends when you get 6 points. Points are obtained by rescuing Lost Souls and Heroes and also by vanquishing Evil Forces.

To do so, the players help to build the Grand Canal of China and to construct the Forbidden City. The player who avoids riots and insurrections and who can prove their skill in developing the canal system to the Grand Coordinator has the best chances to win.<br/><br/>In Da Yunhe: Der Grosse Kaiserkanal, the players are Chinese canal inspectors in the year 1400 who are responsible for developing the canal system in the northern Chinese territory. In the first phase of a turn, the players draft action cards in order to use these in the second phase. The action cards have three actions, which all can be used partially or in whole, and in any possible playing order. The players can always get new tiles, and they have the option to build canal tiles on the board or in the Forbidden City. The players can use riot tiles against competitors to damage their competitor's reputation at Court. The building of canals is rewarded with an instant gain of reputation. The building in the Forbidden City allows a leap forward at the end of the game in the final count.<br/><br/>In the third phase of each turn, the Great Coordinator inspects the development of the Grand Canal and grants additional points if it is possible to travel along the canal. If he steps on riot tiles, the player responsible for the territory with the riot loses reputation. In phase four, riot tiles that had been removed from the board might lead to an insurrection, with the player(s) responsible suffering a loss of reputation. In the fifth phase of the turn, the players return the used action cards and exchange the starting player marker, then the new starting player (clockwise from the next player) begins the next turn.<br/><br/>The players play as many turns necessary to allow the Great Coordinator four journeys along the Great Canal. The players gain reputation at Court by building canals and the Forbidden City and successful inspections by the Great Coordinator and lose reputation through insurrections and hostile actions of other players. The player with the highest reputation wins.<br/><br/>",

No, wait &ndash; awesome customers who have done great things that inspire others to come drink with them and your tavern. Thus, you're going to support adventurers on their quests to do great things, which will ideally bring renown upon you and your tavern in the end.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player starts with a hand of adventurers and some coins. Two or three quests are laid out face-up, and each quest shows the strength of the adventurer party &ndash; in terms of warrior, wizard, cleric and rogue &ndash; required to complete the quest. On a turn, you draw two adventurers cards, then play any number of cards (including zero) &ndash; paying their costs at the same time &ndash; in order to complete quests and gain the income and renown associated with it. When a quest is completed, all other adventurer cards are discarded.<br/><br/>Why not just hold adventurers in hand until you can send out a massive party all at once? Your tavern is tiny at the start of the game, so you need to keep sending out adventurers in order to make room for more. As you gain renown, though, you'll increase the size of your tavern and have room to hold more adventurers in wait. Champions are special adventurers who fulfill two roles at once, and special action cards bring spice to the game play.<br/><br/>The first player to collect twenty renown wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Partner up with your favorite buddy and face off against other teams in this wacky card game where players race to collect ingredients and cook recipes. The first team to build enough recipes to gain 12 points wins! Feuding Foodies caters to 4, 6 or 8 players.<br/><br/>Each turn, draw an ingredient card face up. Pay attention to what your co-chef and competitors add to their hand. You CAN'T tell anyone what ingredients you have unless a power allows it.<br/><br/>Then, play an ingredient's power from your hand. POACH your neighbor's reserves with an egg, PEEL AWAY their defenses with banana, BATTER UP with flour to draw more cards, and more - the choice is up to you!<br/><br/>Once you and your co-chef have enough ingredients, build recipes to gain points. But pay attention at all times! Special cards can be played at ANY time and are very powerful. Use ODOR BLOCK to thwart attacks, JAM a recipe so it can't be cooked, or incite chaos with the DEVILED EGG.<br/><br/>Feuding Foodies is sure to be a game that has players coming back for a second serving.<br/><br/>",

You have 15 rounds to build your full course menu and have a chance at becoming &quot;What's on the Menu's&quot; next head chef!<br/><br/><br/>     Each turn consists of two phases, a Prep and a Plate Phase. During the Prep Phase, a player can either select a Menu Card or draw an Action Card to put into their hand. Once all players have gone through the Prep Phase, we move to the Plate Phase. During this phase, players can choose between doing nothing, committing a Menu Card to their menu, or playing an Action card.<br/>     Each Player has 15 rounds to complete their full course menu. After 15 rounds, the Chefs present their Menu and add up their Star total.<br/>     Each Menu Card has a range of 0-3 possible stars.

        "description": "In the 17th Century, the capital of the Dutch East Indies was Batavia (now Jakarta in Indonesia). Many Dutch merchants wanted to get wealthy trading spices and crops. Nobility desire cardamon; cloves were sought for medicine; cinnamon for its deep, sweet fragrance; and ginger and pepper for their strong spicy flavors. Buy spices, send them to Europe, get rich, and succeed as big merchants!<br/><br/>From Batavia (フロム：バタヴィア) is a card-drafting game of sorts. In general, each player has a ship, and they'll place cargo cards on the ship until it's full, after which they get a new ship. Whoever fills three ships first wins!<br/><br/>In more detail, each ship card has a hold number and possibly an icon. The cargo cards come in five types (cardamon, cloves, cinnamon, ginger, pepper), and they have a cost, an effect, an icon, and a money value. Grain cards have nothing but a picture of grain, yet they can be valuable, too. Each player starts with a hand of five cargo cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player chooses a cargo card from their hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If they can afford to pay the cost of their card, they do so, discarding cards from hand equal to the cost (with a card of the same color as the revealed cargo card counting for two cards) and handing those cards to their -left-hand neighbor. All cards are passed at the same time. If a player can't pay the cost of their card, they return it to hand, then give their left-hand neighbor one cargo card from the top of the deck.<br/><br/>All players who paid the cost of their new cargo card now carry out the effect of that card. Ginger, for example, lets you draw grain cards equal to the number of ginger icons on your cargo cards and ship card; grain cards can't be placed on ships, but they can be used to pay for cargo. Cinnamon lets you take a coin and place it on your ship, then discard as many cards as you want to take additional coins; each coin helps to fill the hold of your ship.<br/><br/>If the money value of a player's cargo cards (along with any coins they have) equal or exceed the hold value of a ship, that ship is full. The player places that ship aside, discards the cargo cards, then takes a new ship in a different color.<br/><br/>Each player can discard any number of cards from their hand, then each person with fewer than six cards draws one cargo card from the deck. Cardamon icons can let you draw a card even if you have six or more cards, while cloves lets you draw additional cards anytime you draw cargo, then discard the same number of cards that you drew additionally. Filter cards to find what you want!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lemur Tails is a two player card game where you try to create the longest tails by alternating black and white tail cards. The longer the tail, the better. Sounds easy enough, but you both create two tails and win if your shorter tail is longer than that of your opponent. So use the numbered tail cards to create two long tails and strategically use the joker cards and the sun worshipping lemurs. Only when you combine these factors, can you create the longest short tail and win.<br/><br/>So how does it work?<br/>Every player has two lemurs, both of which have their own tail (of course). The aim of the game is to extend both these tails by adding tail cards. In your turn you can therefore add tail cards or you could use sun worshipping Lemurs for special abilities, or you can do both.<br/> When you want to extend a tail, you need alternate between black and white cards and have the right number on the tail card. You can only add a tail card that is +1, -1 or the same number as the previous card (and it has to be the opposing color).<br/><br/>When you want to use sun worshipping Lemurs, you need to make sure you actually have them. You start with two, and can get more by adding at least three tails cards at once to a tail. Now what special abilities do these Lemurs have? They will allow you to take a card from the open market, take the last card from the tail of your opponent, take a random card from the hand of your opponent or discard and replace up to three of your hand cards.<br/><br/>There are also joker cards that can be used, where only the color has to be correct.<br/><br/>The key notion to keep in mind, is that you win by having the longest shortest tail. So don&rsquo;t focus on one tail but extend both of them for the win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One side of the sheet shows a roughly hexagonal grid composed of black hexes and blue and red circles (collectively &quot;spaces&quot;), while the other side has these hexes and circles arranged like a bear's head.<br/><br/>On a turn, any player rolls the die, then you each must draw one of the shapes next to this die result&mdash; e.g., a circle, two hexes, and another circle in a line &mdash; into the grid, then cross it out to indicate that you can't use it again. You can place the first shape anywhere, then all subsequent shapes you add must touch something you've drawn previously. If you've used both shapes for a number, you can choose any available shape, then cross it out. If you can't place a shape or decline to do so, you must still cross one out.<br/><br/>After twelve die rolls, you will have three or more spaces still open (because the grid has 51 spaces). You then score penalty points for each unfilled space: 3 for red, 2 for blue, and 1 for black. Additionally you score 1 penalty point for each different area of unfilled spaces in your grid. Whoever has the fewest penalty points wins.<br/><br/>As a variant for experience players, each player can fill in 0-3 spaces in their grid before starting play. This possibly allows you to have a lower score, but only if you can still place all of the shapes in your grid.<br/><br/>",

Every player is on their own and does not care about the fate of the others...<br/><br/>The idea is based on a real situation in the 1970s when high class Stasi Agent Werner Stiller fled from East Germany towards FRG. When he left GDR, he took many classified documents with him that compromised hundreds of Stasi Agents deployed in West Germany. They immediately had to flee to avoid being captured. However the game does not adopt this scenery 100%, so players will not play Stasi Agents.<br/><br/>At its core, The Red Claw is a damage avoidance game. Cards are put on the table in four rows of different colors. At their end are two tokens, usually with tracking (damage) points, and on the other end are the counteragents...<br/><br/>In turn order, players play one of the cards in their hands. It contains two symbols. The Counter Agent of each corresponding row moves one card tile per symbol. All cards it touches go into the active player's hand. If a row is empty, the tokens at its end are scored. Whoever possesses more cards of the corresponding color &quot;wins&quot; the token and gets it. (Actually players usually want to avoid winning these tokens.) In case of a tie, the player with cards with the higher number gets it. This player then puts its cards of the corresponding color on the discard pile. Now the same procedure is done again for the second token.<br/><br/>The discard pile of this color is shuffled and players buld a a new row from it and reveal new tokens.<br/><br/>The game ends if one player has a certain number of tracking points. Points get counted, and whoever has the least wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a solo game of determination against increasingly demanding odds. You will attempt to ascend Mount Everest by rolling and manipulating dice to try and beat increasingly challenging scores. Playing the game is easy - succeeding is not.<br/><br/>All you need to play is a copy of the game sheet, pen/pencil and six D6. Game time will be around 15 minutes.<br/><br/>In June 1924, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine began their ascent to the peak of Mount Everest, hoping to be first to ever do so. It was to be a journey from which neither man would return alive, and whether or not they were successful remains a mystery to this day. When asked why he was planning to undertake such a dangerous and gruelling endeavour Mallory had replied simply &ldquo;because it&rsquo;s there&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

In Folded Wishes, you&rsquo;ll compete in a prestigious contest to be named a master of origami.<br/><br/>Each turn, you&rsquo;ll connect a paper pattern tile to the grid of tiles in the center of the table. Each pattern tile has a fold action that lets you change positions of animals in the grid. Then, you&rsquo;ll push your tile into the grid and take a new tile for your next turn. Folding your animals into specific shapes in the grid lets you learn new skills to make your folds even more powerful.<br/><br/>The origami crafter with all four of their origami animals in a straight vertical, horizontal, or diagonal line inside the grid of pattern tiles earns the favor of the emperor and wins!<br/><br/>In addition to wooden animal pieces, Folded Wishes comes with sheets of origami paper so that players may craft their own pieces.<br/><br/>-description from developer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description by Andrea &ldquo;Liga&rdquo; Ligabue &amp; W. Eric Martin<br/><br/>The Palio di Siena (known in Italy as Il Palio) is a crazy horse race that takes place twice a year in Siena on July 2 and August 16.<br/><br/>Ten of the 17 Contrade (or city wards) are represented in the race: the seven that were left out of the previous race and a randomly chosen three from the remaining ten Contrade. Each Contrade has particular colors and coats of arms, and the horse and rider are dressed to embody their Contrade. Riders can use their whips on other horses and riders as well as on their own mount, and the winner is the first horse to cross the finish line with its head ornaments in place &ndash; whether or not the rider is still on the horse.<br/><br/>New Italian game designer Massimo Pesce, together with the help of Scribabs&rsquo; Paolo Vallerga as art director, has produced a nice and simple game about this race. The players control the seventeen Contrade involved in the two races, with ten Contrade taking part in the first race (Palio di Provenzano) and a different set of ten in the second one (Palio dell&rsquo;Assunta). This set-up means that one or more players might hold Contrade involved with only one race.<br/><br/>Each Contrade is assigned a horse (&quot;la tratta&quot;) that can be either a good one (&quot;bono,&quot; with a movement die of 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6) or a not-so-good one (&quot;brenna,&quot; with movement of 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6). Since the race lasts for three laps, that small difference can add up over time. In addition to the decorative jockey, players receive nine cards that can be used during the race to create small advantages or slow down opponents.<br/><br/>As for the race itself, like the real Palio, the beginning is somewhat chaotic as horses and riders jockey for position. During the movement phase, if a horse can&rsquo;t move its entire distance, it risks falling or perhaps just throwing the rider, which doesn&rsquo;t prevent a horse from winning. The game is all about playing the right cards at the right moment and getting the right rolls.<br/><br/>Palio is simple and quick, the materials are good, and the graphics is great !<br/><br/>",

If it's...<br/><br/><br/>    A Nano Minefield, flip it face down again.<br/>    A player's card, that player takes the action on the card with the possible actions being:<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Planet: Return one of your eliminated non-planet cards to play.<br/>        Scanner: Look at three face-down cards, then remove the scanner from play.<br/>        Blaster: Shoot once.<br/>        Double Blaster: Shoot twice.<br/>        Retro Blaster: Shoot once; also, if this is card is eliminated, shoot once before removing it from play.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>To shoot, you place your pinky on the active card, then toss your shooting disc with your thumb and forefinger. When the disc lands, you can remove one card it touches from play, revealing it and returning it to its owner. If a player has no cards in play, they're out of the game. The final player with cards in play wins!<br/><br/>",

Your souls have been shattered, and the only way to wake up is to collect Soul Fragments by traversing your nightmares. But watch out, because the Sandman will haunt you trying to consume your remaining Soul Fragments.<br/><br/>Team up against the Sandman or turn against each other. If the Sandman is killed, everyone wins. But if one of you wakes up first, they win, while the other players stay trapped in the nightmare forever, left as a feast for the Sandman.<br/><br/>Try this game of cooperation, conflict, betrayal, and nightmares<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY SLEEP TIGHT<br/><br/>Sleep Tight is a 10-20 minute game that is dynamic and fast-paced in terms of decisions and actions. Sometimes you&rsquo;re lucky and get a large hand of cards you can choose from, and sometimes you have to micromanage and get the best out of a small hand. It&rsquo;s a game where your luck can change suddenly when the Sandman lashes out, testing your intuition and skills. Will you hide and wait for the attack to blow over, or will you actively attack and escape by the skin of your teeth?<br/><br/>In Sleep Tight you need to constantly be alert and think few steps ahead, as you will need to guess the other players&rsquo; next move or even worse, the Sandman&rsquo;s!<br/><br/>The players uses action cards and Soul Fragments as a &quot;fuel&quot; for their action. They choose to cooperate with other players or can even join the Sandman in his evil goals.<br/><br/>The Sandman has a stack of action cards that represents also his health pool. When the Sandman is out of action he is defeated. There are a lot of ways to inflict faster damages to him.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win:<br/><br/>     Kill the Sandman. If the Sandman deck is empty, all the players win. If you prefer to have one winner in this case, the winner is the player with most Soul Fragments. (The nightmare ends, and everyone wakes up.)<br/>     Escape the nightmare. If a player has 10 Soul Fragments and plays the card, that player wins and the other players lose. (The dream collapses, leaving the other players to be consumed by the Sandman.)<br/><br/><br/>There are two ways to lose:<br/><br/>     Everyone dies. If every player dies by reaching 0 Soul Fragments, the players lose. (They die and are completely consumed by the Sandman.)<br/>     The nightmare traps you. If the Dreamscape deck is empty, the players lose. (The kids are trapped in their dreams and can&rsquo;t wake up anymore)<br/><br/><br/>",

As you and your opponent position blocks, move your pawns up the levels searching for the fastest way to the 5th strata. On each turn, you must move two pawns and position one block. If you climb with caution and construct with cunning, you'll move one of your pawns onto the tip-top strata first and win the game. When moving and building, try to trap the enemy pawns inside the structure, blockade them so they cannot move, or capture them and move them as your own. Strata 5 enforces strict building codes on pawn movement and block placement. But if you're &quot;level-headed&quot; enough to build, climb, block, and capture strategically, you'll reach the 5th level first!<br/><br/>",

Play continues until all tokens have been matched, and the winner is the player who matched the most images.<br/><br/>Damm/Egmont published Nordic editions have the added twist that there are 21 monster tiles instead of just 20, but one is removed before beginning and exactly one player during the game will have a chance to guess (write down) who they think 'mystery monster' is; a correct guess will be worth +2 points at the end of the game, while a wrong one carries a penalty of -2 points.<br/><br/>From the back of the box / translation found at funagain<br/><br/>The old haunted castle is filled with lots of creepy characters, all trying to find their own shadow.

Our witches are vegetarian and real!<br/><br/>Legend says that in a lagoon of Cern&eacute;gula, a town in Burgos, a coven of witches had their meetings. In The Witches of Cern&eacute;gula, you must become the witch who cooks the best and most potions. Collect the required herbs, but these are not always available, so think well about your actions! Cook in your cauldron elaborate recipes and master one or more magic arts. Become the most experienced witch and earn points to prove it!<br/><br/>In more detail, the game consists of several rounds divided into two phases:<br/><br/>&bull; Herb collection: In order to collect herbs, move your cauldron located inside your herb board, so that the ladle, the carrot leaves, and the snake head point to the herbs you want to collect. The players must take all the corresponding tokens according to the placement of their cauldrons, but they cannot store more than three green tokens per type of herb. If you had to place more than three green tokens on an herb, place red tokens from the common supply instead. Each red token near the board equals 2 negative points at the end of the game. The red tokens are permanent: they are still red even if the player has fewer than three green tokens on the herb.<br/><br/>&bull; Potions preparation: During this optional phase, you can prepare one or more available potions as either complete or incomplete potions. In addition, once you have made the potion, you can perform the ability immediately or in another time, as the card indicates.<br/><br/>Using potions' abilities costs victory points. After using the ability of a potion card, turn it 90&ordm; to indicate it's been used. At the end of the game, the value of turned potions cards is subtracted from your victory points.<br/><br/>",

Carefully  position  your  predators  around  the  pond,  so  they  can  catch  their  favorite  prey.

Players continue taking turns until they have played 4 cards: the first 2 cards are placed face up and the last 2 cards are placed face down.<br/>     Resolution phase: the starting player chooses one Water tile and reveals the face-down Predator cards that were placed on it. All cards on the tile are resolved in numerical order, from 1 to 10. When  all  Predator  cards  on  the  tile  have  been  resolved,  the  next  player  in  clockwise  order  chooses  another Water tile to resolve. Continue like this until all Water tiles have been resolved.<br/>     Scoring phase: players move their Frog meeple a number of spaces up the score track depending on how many flies and opponent preys they caught. <br/><br/><br/>The game ends after the fourth round.

Seals, polar bears, and other no flying birds have found an ancient legend written on the ice: &ldquo;Whoever manages to  conquer the Iceberg will be crowned the new king&quot;<br/><br/>Before a game of Iluliaq (which means &quot;Iceberg&quot; in Inuit) you must build the iceberg. A central structure made from the cards and the game&rsquo;s box, where then players will throw their cards with the aim to have them rest on top of the iceberg.<br/><br/>When a card lands on the iceberg, the player who threw the card ends their turn with no further action. But if the card falls in the water (anything besides the top of the iceberg is considered the water) or pushes any other card into the water, that player must collect all of the fallen cards and place them in their own hand!<br/><br/>Some cards contain special Powers that activate once they land on the iceberg. For example, once the bear has landed on the iceberg, it has the ability to eat the first card that lands directly above. This action forces the player who threw the card, the card that landed on top of the bear, to take a new card from the central deck into their own hand. Another animal with a special power is the seal, which has the ability to remain in the water when falling from the iceberg rather than going back into the player&rsquo;s hand. <br/>The first player with no remaining cards in their hand, wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Defend humankind against the perilous alien invasion as the Marine player! Or, on the other hand as the Portalist player, show those mortals they stand no chance!<br/><br/>Mission: Combat! is a tactical sci-fi card game for two players, one commanding the human Marines and the other representing the alien Portalists. Both have unique characteristics and abilities available only to their respective faction. In general, the Marines can perform ranged attacks and have strong firepower and good defensive positions. The Portalists, on the other hand, can deploy units for free, and their units can move quickly. Additionally, the area cards of the game board grant special abilities to the player who controls them. When a player manages to eliminate all enemy units on his turn, the game ends and that player wins.<br/><br/>To set up the game, players determine a start player, draw five unit cards to their hands, and take alternating turns to bring those units into play on their area cards. Then the game begins, with the start player using two action points (AP) in his first turn. In each subsequent turn, players have four action points at their disposal, which can be spent to carry out the following actions in any order as often as desired:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card<br/>     Play a card<br/>     Move a unit<br/>     Attack<br/><br/><br/>In addition to the actions above, players can get free actions and bonuses from the area cards they control and can use special abilities that are available only to their faction only. Units are one of three types &mdash; Regular, Elite, or Colossal &mdash; and can attack only one unit type. For instance, an Elite unit that can deal damage to Regular units cannot deal damage to Elite or Colossal units.<br/><br/>To achieve victory, players need to consider the defense and attack types of their army, and the faction strengths and weaknesses, along with the abilities that they get from the terrain that they control. Choose your side and wipe your opponent from the surface of the planet!<br/><br/>",

Set in a fantasy, Japan-inspired world, the miniatures included are designed with &ldquo;chibi&rdquo; look; this means a cute way of design, with the characters having big and expressive faces.<br/><br/>The players can choose between different heroes: the samurai, a monk, a gunslinger, a priest, and more. Each one of them has a unique set of traits: movement, attack power, abilities, etc. At the beginning of a game, the player will configure the abilities the hero will be able to use during the fight: these abilities will make the hero more defensive, capable of helping other heroes and/or having access to powerful attacks.<br/><br/>The yōkai are the enemies of the game: inspired in the ones from the Japanese folklore, these supernatural beings will follow &ldquo;behavior cards&rdquo;, so their acting is managed by the own players. Those will indicate in an easy to follow way what the yōkai will do in each given situation. The yōkai will be constantly spawning from settled points in random amounts, decided by drawing cards from their specific deck.<br/><br/>Heroes and Yōkai take turns to play: they will move, attack and use abilities while fighting in the tiled boards. The gameplay has a staged feeling, represented by the different scenarios. To advance, objectives must be accomplished: eliminate a number of specific enemies, surviving long enough, etc. This goes until the heroes reach the last board, where the final boss of the mission appears. To win the mission, heroes must defeat this powerful enemy.<br/><br/>",

Every clan raids, battles and pillages its neighbors, regardless of national ties, and the crowns of England and Scotland turn a blind eye to the chaos.

You play a Border clan, warring with and raiding your neighbors, fortifying your borders and taming the landscape as you try to establish your dominance of the Borders through the 15th and 16th Centuries. Use economic, military and subterfuge strategies to thwart the neighboring clans and advance your clan to eminence.<br/><br/>Border Reivers is a game of strategy, warfare and chance  for 2 to 4 players, aged 12 to adult.

        "description": "From the rulebook:<br/><br/>Hull Breach: Corporate Wars is a tactical, operational, and strategic space-combat and logistics card game for two or more players.<br/><br/>Each player has his or her own deck of cards consisting of a Station, ships, modules, Marines, technological breakthroughs, events, and tactics. Players compete head-to-head to destroy each other's fleets and space station; the last player or team standing is the victor.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Players choose from a variety of pre-constructed decks or can assemble their own, then each player takes turns either building up their base or building ships to attack their opponents. First player to destroy (or take over from boarding action) is the winner.<br/><br/>Each faction/deck has a unique power and varied amounts of resources generated each turn. With these resources you can add on modules to your base, or play ships/marines to the table. Your base functions as a mothership where your subsequent ships make up the fleet you will use for offense and defense. Each turn you will get more resources based on your base and the modules attached (which can add to your resource generation).<br/><br/>The ships and marines have different special abilities such as stealth (to avoid enemy detection). Some ships can even retrieve more ships from your deck at no cost.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with d10s. You count up the total amount your roll for offense (based on the current stats of the cards involved) then roll. The target roll is determined by the defense of the ship. Most small ships can only take 1 or 2 hits, but larger ships will need multiple hits to take down. Wounds do carry over but there are mechanisms to remove some wound tokens over time.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSecond Edition Updated RulesStackable Traits are no more! <br/>To reduce the amount of math that HB Commanders have to do in combat, traits that granted a +X ability are being retooled.  Values are now only the printed numbers, and do not increase with any +X effects.<br/><br/>Trait-or-Fire!<br/>Use your weapons or a trait. That's one of the simplest rules in Hull Breach! It also now applies to stations as well &ndash; no more Target Painting for 4 and shooting 6 at the same target with your station. Stations should have advantages but testing reveals that certain station builds were becoming pwnmobiles, capable of ripping apart attacking fleets.<br/><br/>Spicing Up Events!<br/>The tried-and-true Event cards now have two possible outcomes: a Critical outcome and a Nominal outcome. When you deploy the card, you make a D10 die roll to determine what you'll get. A roll of a 1 or a 10 is a Critical outcome, and is in some cases a more powerful result, and sometimes a bad result for the person wielding the card. Any other roll result is a Nominal outcome, which results in the 'usual' outcome for that card.<br/><br/>Faction-Only Cards!<br/>Some cards, specifically some Marines, Upgrades and Events, are now marked as Faction-Only, meaning that only the faction printed on the card gets to use them. This has been done in an attempt to work a little more story flavor into the game. For example, Special Operations Groups represent the RDF Marine Corps' elite troops and are no longer available to non-RDF players. As compensation, Corporate Commanders can now field their own elite Marines known as Direct Assault Response Teams (DART).<br/><br/>Module Overhaul!<br/>There have been significant changes in the world of Modules. In HB Alpha, Modules were further divided into Module-Ship, Module-Station, and Module-Marine cards. No longer! They've been broken into more obviously different types depending on what they attach to, and we've made a more clearer distinction of size on ships, Stations, and Modules. One of the new things we can do is attach multiple mods to ships, and Stations are a little more narrowly restricted to what they can or can't attach, depending on what the purpose of the station is (military versus economy).<br/><br/>Say Goodbye to Characters!<br/>Character cards were a neat idea. Unfortunately they proved to be too frequently used as the basis for an entire deck strategy. So, they're all dead. Most, however, have been reborn as Add Personnel cards that can be attached to Marines and do something cool for your local units. The tradeoff is that they're no longer independent units that can board ships or stations and fire back at you, and they're nowhere near as powerful as they once were.<br/><br/>First-Turn Facefisting is Ancient History!<br/>We have implemented a couple of new mechanics at game start that will alleviate most first-turn knockouts. We've achieved this by revising the initiative rules for the starting phase of the game: the Commander with the smallest fleet and Station size (printed on the card, and mentioned above), begins play after the Setup Phase. So, if you deploy fewer or smaller ships than your adversary, you take the first in-sequence turn of the game rather than leave it to a die roll for initiative.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNew Combat Mechanics!Initiative in Engagements<br/>Now controlled by unit size and progresses from the smallest ships up to the largest. The heavies are much slower and more cumbersome than your Fighters and Frigates, so they take longer to get into firing position.<br/><br/>Attacker and Defender<br/>Volley fire at each other in turn, in order of smallest to largest, with the exception of the defending Station getting first shot.  So: Defender station, then attacker's fighters, defender's fighters, attacker's Frigates, etc, all the way up to Capital Ships.<br/><br/>New Skirmish Phase<br/>The Interceptor Phase has been replaced by Skirmish.  Any ships with the trait Interceptor (defending) or Raider (attacking) get to jump to the head of the attack order line, for the first turn only.  No more extra turns for defenders!<br/><br/>Boarding Actions<br/>Just like volley fire, boarding actions (now part of the Maneuver Phase) adhere to initiative rules: smaller ships act first, reflecting the idea that faster and more maneuverable craft have the advantage in landing Marines on-target. Boards are not declared until the start of the Maneuver Phase, and once they're all declared, Escort effects are applied and then they're resolved in ascending size order.  You can now only declare a board on a ship of equal class size or larger.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Super Race, players try to be the first to complete a lap around the track, using the dice to hug corners and race as quickly as possible. Players first decide which racetrack to use on the double-sided player boards. Then they start racing!<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the five dice, sets aside any she wants to keep, then rolls up to two more times, rerolling dice set aside, if desired. The dice depict curves or straights in three different colors, and after the player stops rolling, she chooses all the dice of one color and must use all of them to move on the track. Colored track on the player board can be moved through only with dice of the appropriate color, while any die color can be used to cross gray track; if a player can't use all movement for a color, she must choose a different color. A player cannot cross the same square twice. End your movement in a tight corner, and you take another turn immediately.<br/><br/>Players take turns until one reaches the finish line, which triggers the final round. After all players have taken the same number of turns, whoever has driven the farthest across the finish line wins. Variants in the rulebook include an option for oil slicks that take two dice to cross, a point system for a multi-race world championship, and a two lap race on the Indianapolis board that includes a shortcut. The challenge in this latter race is that you're still restricted from crossing the same square twice. Take special care the first time around, or else you'll be weaving like a maniac on lap two!<br/><br/>",

According to the designers of Cards Against Humanity, the producers of [_BL&Auml;NK] do not have license to produce this game, thus it is set apart from the official entry of Cards Against Humanity.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>A card game which involves a judge choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card. Each player holds a hand of ten cards at the beginning of each round, and each player contributes card(s) to the &quot;[_BL&Auml;NK]-Master&quot; anonymously. The [_BL&Auml;NK]-Master determines which card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card.<br/><br/>The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent a &quot;Siegkarte&quot; (Win Card).<br/><br/>In addition, there are a few extra rules. First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or &quot;Pick 3&quot; cards, which require each participant to submit cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists. If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may pay in a &quot;Siegkarte&quot; to play a single second answer. If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.<br/>After each round, the role of the [_BL&Auml;NK]-Master rotates around the table, and play continues until everyone decides to stop.<br/><br/>Gameplay is identical to &quot;Cards Against Humanity&quot;, but was translated to German.<br/><br/>",

Attacks can destroy some parts of player tower, block his queue, steal construction (wooden elements from tower) and more.<br/>Winner is player who will build highest tower when there are no wooden bricks (construction) to summon from Source.<br/>During game, tactic is very important, as well as hand management. But game has two modes, for younger and older players:<br/>Basic - for younger players. It's rather building race then real fight. Basic mode will let you learn about game mechanics and summoning Construction (wooden bricks)<br/><br/>Advanced - it's where real magic starts. In this mode players use Special Cards, which contains additional attacks (3 per card). And those spells are much more powerful then basic attacks (from Attack Chart). Also, its easier to get cards to attack, named Elements. There are 4 elements in game: Fire, Wind, Earth and Water.<br/>While your tower is getting bigger, you need to focus to prevent lower sections from being destroyed. For this, you use Section. You can summon Section each 5 levels of tower, and when you have 8 or 6 (depends on game type) constructions in your storage.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s in the box:<br/>- 126 wooden bricks (0,6x06x2,3 inch)<br/>- 20 Summoning Cards<br/>- 24 Elements Cards<br/>- 11 Special Cards<br/>- 12 Securing Sections<br/>- Attack Chart<br/>- Instruction<br/><br/>What is for what?<br/><br/>Wooden bricks allow players to build towers. Each floor of tower consists from 2 bricks. Those bricks are named &ldquo;construction&rdquo;, and can be removed by other player when he uses hostile action (attack) on yours tower<br/><br/>Securing Section building this prevents lower parts of tower from most attacks, however there are some strong spells that can remove it and even construction below!<br/>Summoning cards allows to summon construction elements from &ldquo;source&rdquo;. Summoned construction can be used for building tower or placed in Storage (near tower). Bricks in storage can be traded for Attack Card or Section.<br/><br/>Elements Cards are used mostly to assembly spells, like attacks, area attacks, stealing, blocking move, forcing other player to make bad move, ect.<br/>Special Cards are used in Advanced game. They add 33 actions to the game. Spells and attacks are much stronger. Also, these cards adds some defensive abilities.<br/><br/>",

To start the game, players shuffle all the tiles face down, then draw tiles one at a time, placing each tile in a specific place on their rack.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either draws a tile from the deck or from one of the three face-up stacks of tiles. The player can then either discard this tile or replace one tile on his rack with this new tile, discarding the old one. The goal is to create a &quot;valid&quot; journey in which all adjacent tiles are connected in the proper ways. More specifically, the first and last tiles on the rack must be regions, not trains. Two adjacent region tiles must be adjacent on the game board, too. A colored train can connect two regions of the same color; a bus acts as a wild region.

Game takes about 10 minutes to learn and 1-2 hours to play, high solitaire playability.  The rules are as simple as possible. Units have Zones of control, which cannot be exited. When in enemy ZOC, combat is mandatory. Units may advance after combat. Retreats through ZOCs are forbidden, so you need to surround the enemy to eliminate him. Artillery may fire two hexes away (and not suffer from adverse results). Cavalry units are just faster and weaker infantry units .  There are two scenarios.  The historical one pictures Napoleon in Jena, outnumbering the Prussians, and Davout in Auerstadt, outnumbered by other Prussians. ). To win, you have to eliminate as many enemy units as possible at the end of the game (thus demoralizing the enemy).  The second &quot;what-if&quot; scenario assumes that all the Prussians have been sent to Jena, for the decisive battle. Davout will enter as reinforcement, on the flank/back of the Prussians, but in the end of the game.  Play balance to be pretty good, perhaps slightly favoring  the French.<br/><br/>One on four games included in the Napoleon At War QuadriGame.  The games in this set are based on the Napoleon At Waterloo system.<br/><br/>",

Based on Herman Melville's classic novel, Moby Dick combines cooperative and competitive play in an attempt to loosely simulate life on a 19th century whaleship.<br/><br/>The game is centered around three decks of cards: the Sea, the Sailor, and the Whale. After receiving an initial crew of sailors, players take turns at the topmast, where they draw Sea cards to advance the game. These cards contain various creatures and events, compelling actions between players or triggering the secondary phase of the game &ndash; the whale hunt. During a whale hunt, each player begins by choosing a small group of their sailors to lower after the whale. Play progresses much like the primary gameplay, with players taking turns defending against the whale's assaults and returning the favors.<br/><br/>As the game unfolds, players gain oil from defeating whales or from certain events, which can be used to hire new sailors after others are lost at sea. Over time, key events (Chapters) will be drawn, and after a certain number Moby Dick will cease evading the ship and engage when sighted. This last battle is to the death, and only one player will survive. Call him the winner, or simply, Ishmael.<br/><br/>",

This is a card game which matches the left and right of the Chinese character and fish-shellfish pictures.  Randomly disperse the cards on a table face down and turn over two cards.  It is pleasurable to match correctly a fish picture and/or Chinese character in the left corner of the card.  The Sushi corresponds to each of 29 fish-shellfish that are illustrated.  The 29 fish and shellfish chosen are commonly served in Sushi bars.<br/>There are 3 cards in the pack which have no fish or shellfish, but are generally found in Sushi bars.

Players must guide Ichabod from the Van Tassel mansion through the forest to the covered bridge before time runs out and the Headless Horseman chases him down. Players will need to push their luck, avoid frights, and keep their wits to get Ichabod safely home!<br/><br/>In the game, one player will have 60 minutes (12 units of Time) to travel across 9 Woods cards in the Forest Row and reach the Covered Bridge. To do so, players will draw cards from the Journey Deck, typically placing them next to the deck to form the Fright Row. Woods cards that appear will have one of three good luck symbols on them. When there are two or more Woods cards in the Fright Row with a matching symbol, the player can spend one Time to take one of each matching Woods cards and place them into the Forest Row. The catch is that Woods cards cannot be placed in the Forest Row next to another Woods card that has the same good luck symbol.<br/><br/>Fright cards may appear from the Journey Deck, as well. These three cards - a wolf, a bat, and an owl - are placed into the Fright Row. If at any time there is a matching pair of Fright cards in the Fright Row, the entire Fright Row is discarded. If there was a matching set of Woods cards in the Fright Row then the player loses no time. If not, the player loses one Time.<br/><br/>If there are ever three different Fright cards in the Fright Row then the entire Fright Row is discarded and the player loses two Time.<br/><br/>There are also several Event cards in the deck that, when drawn, trigger an effect and are discarded. These can range from the Torch which allows the player to discard Fright cards from the Fright Row, to the Headless Horseman himself which forces the player to discard the lead Woods card in the Forest Row if there are any Fright cards in the Fright Row.<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile creatures from the wilderness are persistently attacking. If the wilderness deck is ever emptied before you defeat the allosaurus, the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>StoneFire uses hand-management, with a bit of deck-building and set-collection.<br/><br/>Each turn you draw new characters from the tribal deck. These cards will either be humans or tamed beasts. You then get to use your cards to form a hunting party to either travel to the wilderness or to secure an available location card. Lastly, you may add one card face-up to your village (these cards may be used in later rounds) and then draw back up. Alternatively, you may pass on hunting and rest two characters (placing them in your village) and then draw one egg card. Egg cards are gained in many ways, and are used to score end-game bonus points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Avalanche Press:<br/><br/>For over 700 years, Spanish Christians tried to exterminate the Arab kingdoms of southern Spain. This great &quot;Reconquista&quot; fired the crusading zeal of countless generations. The Arabs, or Moors as the Spanish knew them, saw the Spaniards as backward barbarians and fought ferociously to protect their sophisticated civilization. Finally, in 1482 King Ferdinand of Aragon embarked on the last campaign, to take the fabled city of Granada from its Islamic rulers.<br/><br/>This quick-playing, physically beautiful game re-creates the final 10-year struggle for Granada. Players take command of the Christian and Moslem holy warriors. God is on your side. Will you prevail? <br/><br/>Granada is a two-player game based on the 1481-1492 campaign between Ferdinand and Isabella of Aragon and Castille on one side (the &quot;Spanish player&quot;) and Muhammed XII and later Muhammed XIII on the other (the &quot;Moorish player&quot;). The game's designer is Robert G. Markham, known for Soldier Kings: The Seven Years War Worldwide and dozens of other game designs.<br/><br/>The game is not overly complex. The game board (mounted, 22x17 inches) shows southern Spain including the Kingdom of Granada and surrounding areas. A network of key points is laid over this map, with castles, ports and unfortified areas connected by roads. Troops move along these roads from point to point. The object of the game for the Spanish player is to conquer the Moorish kingdom - Granada herself and five other important Moorish sites. The Moorish player seeks to prevent this, or to force peace on the Spaniards by taking their key cities of Cordoba and Lorca.<br/><br/>Each player has troops with which to carry out these tasks - knights, cavalry, and foot soldiers plus warships. The Spanish player also has siege cannon. Both players have leaders to move their troops and assist them in battle, with Ferdinand for the Spaniards and Muhammed al-Zagal for the Moors being much better at this than other leaders.<br/><br/>In battle, both players place their units on a combat display and roll dice to determine how many &quot;hits&quot; are achieved. Four hits will eliminate most units. The best units in the game are the Moorish Jund armored cavalry and the fanatic Spanish Knights of Santiago and Calatrava. A well-manned castle is very difficult to capture, but the Spanish siege guns can make an enormous difference. At sea, the Spanish player is trying to deny the Moor reinforcements from Africa. Many Moorish troops are volunteers from overseas, who must arrive at ports. The Moor can also gain aid from the Ottoman Empire, but only if he or she has kept the ports open.<br/><br/>",

Each Player takes part as a Jarl in charge of his own Viking Settlement on the fictional island of Fj&ouml;rnheim.<br/> Goal of the game is to regain the Favour of the Gods. To do so you will have to raid towns and villages in order to gather resources to construct new buildings in your settlement, as well as recruiting new warriors and building new ships.<br/><br/>Every game starts with the summer raids, the so called &quot;Vikingfahrt&quot;. All Players pick a village to attack with their starting unit of Nordic Warriors. Afterwards they fight, following the intuitive battle system of fixed attack and defense stats combined with dice rolling. <br/>In case of success, the players get to loot the village for treasures by drawing one of 35 unique loot cards, this is the main income the Players have throughout the year.<br/><br/>Back home in their Viking Settlement, the Players make use of their new gained fortune, recruiting more warriors, bringing sacrifices to the Gods and starting to construct more ships and buildings to extend their settlement.<br/>From now on every season will start with the drawing of an event card, there are 60 different ones, and each one of them may bring you joy or pain, or something in between. Every card has it's own story, many of them are inspired by actual mythic stories and events of the time.<br/>Another important part of the game are the ways of the northern Gods. Their will is represented by 60 cards. By bringing sacrifices and certain events, the Gods will grant you their Benevolence. Other events or hostile fellow Players may force you to draw Wrath of the Gods cards. As in the event cards, every single &bdquo;Card of the Gods&ldquo; tells a story, many of them following real Norse mythology.<br/><br/>The Game ends when one of the Players has collected 7 &bdquo;Favour of the Gods&ldquo; points and therefore reaches the Golden Gates of VALHAL.<br/><br/>",

The shape must also rest on top of a previously marked shape or the base of the obelisk itself.<br/><br/>Carving Symbols<br/>Draw the shape onto the wall covered with symbols. Copy the enclosed symbols (without rearranging them) onto a previously built portion of the obelisk.<br/><br/>Be careful, however! As your obelisk rises in height, the shadow it casts will begin to obscure the symbols on your wall, making them unavailable for you to use!<br/><br/>Scribing a Scroll<br/>If the shape is a square, after drawing it onto the wall, instead of copying the symbols onto your obelisk, copy them onto one of three scrolls. On a future turn you can activate the scroll to perform a bonus action (allowing you an additional Tick-and-Write sequence, without the other players being able to benefit).<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/>Once any player has reached the top level of the obelisk, the current round will be the final round of the game.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>For each column in your obelisk, score victory points based on having multiple identical symbols.<br/><br/>For each row in your obelisk, score victory points based on having multiple different symbols.<br/><br/>Score additional victory points for completing various obelisk levels or filling scrolls.<br/><br/>",

Now, after extensive research with a leading electronics company, Parker Brothers brings you a powerful computer designed strictly for family fun.  The CODE NAME: SECTOR computer is capable of making thousands of calculations per second.  Its solid-state memory keeps track of players positions at all times.  And its logic circuitry instantly detects collisions, counter-attacks, misfires, and hits.  A combat information center contains all the controls needed to navigate within range of the sub and fire.  An electronic readout, made up of light-emitting diodes, automatically displays information supplied by the computer.  The computer works with you as you track down an enemy sub on a nautical chart.  Being the first to sink it isn't easy.  With over 3000 possible underwater locations, the sub is unlikely to be in the same place twice.<br/><br/><br/>     An electronic display provides players with complete combat information during the course of the game.<br/>     A ship's direction is shown on a lighted compass.<br/>     A steering capability allows players to change course from left or right to close in on the sub.<br/>     A pair of speed controls allow destroyers to travel at 9 different speeds.<br/>     An evasive sub option makes the game more challenging for experienced players.<br/>     A programmed learning sequence teaches the play quickly and easily.<br/>     A sonar control area is used to determine range information and to aim and fire torpedoes.<br/><br/><br/>The game comes complete with:<br/><br/>     Computer console<br/>     Nautical playing/plotting surface<br/>     Marking crayons (4 total)<br/>     Crayon sharpener<br/>     Parallel rule<br/>     Replica submarines for scoring (8 total)<br/>     Reusable erasing cloth<br/><br/><br/>9 VOLT BATTERY NOT INCLUDED.

Or was he?<br/>Perhaps he succeeded in framing an unknowing employee of his famous Horror Hotel? Let's find out!<br/><br/>In Holmes' Horror Hotel players assume the roles of either employees of the hotel, or the owner himself, H.H. Holmes. The roles are secret, so only the player that is dealt the Holmes character knows who is who.<br/>The employees know by now that danger is afoot in the hotel, but they don't know who is behind it all. And on this dark night in 1896, they find all the doors and windows of the hotel locked.<br/>There is no escape, their only chance is to expose the serial killer before they all die a gruesome death&hellip;<br/><br/>Players in turn draw 1-3 cards. These cards can be traps, clues or dead ends. Traps hurt you and can eliminate you from the game, clues can be used to identify the killer- or frame an innocent coworker - and dead ends are... dead ends and should be discarded. The employees have to play all their cards truthfully, only Holmes can lie and discard unwanted traps or clues. But when he gets called out on this, it's game over for him. Can the employees survive and identify Holmes as the killer in their midst before time runs out?<br/><br/>Holmes' Horror Hotel is a fast game of deduction and hidden identities, for 4 to 7 players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each card has 4 options to chose from and players can play as few as 1 up to their entire hand each round.  They play these Ship cards to control and mine resource laden planets, with all players laying down their chosen cards at the same time. When the resources are divided up (based on a fleet's total Speed, Attack and Cargo) points are awarded accordingly. Then, new Ship cards are dealt, equal to the number that were just played, beginning with the player with the lowest score. New Planets are dealt and the next round begins.

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 is an operational-level game about the largest and most decisive battle of the Chinese Civil War: the Battle of the Huai-Hai. This showdown determined that the Nationalist forces of Jiang Jieshi (Chiang Kai-Shek) would be driven from the mainland into exile on Taiwan. It was the culmination of 20 years of on-again-off-again civil war between the Nationalists and the Communists.<br/><br/>In 1946, the eight-year-long truce between Nationalists and Communists that had held together during the War of Resistance against Japan finally broke down. Both sides raced to seize cities and rail lines in China formerly held by the Japanese. By November, 1948, the Nationalists had suffered severe reverses in Manchuria and the north. The Communist leadership decided the time had come to move into central China, so they targeted the area around the strategically crucial city of Xuzhou, about halfway between Beijing (Peking) and Nanjing (Nanking). The result was an enormous battle of annihilation that involved over half a million fighters on each side. The Communists also mobilized as many as five million peasants to help move supplies.<br/><br/>This is very much an Against The Odds! situation: The Nationalists are well-armed with air support, artillery, road mobility, and tanks. And yet it is the Nationalists who are going up &quot;against the odds&quot;! Despite their material superiority, most Nationalist units have morale so low that &quot;defectors&quot; from their army are the main source of replacements for the Communists! The Communists are light, lean, and very well-motivated. The battle develops asymmetrically between the powerful but ponderous Nationalists and the mobile Communists.<br/><br/>Designed by Earl Dixon, Red Dragon, Blue Dragon: The Huaihai 1948-49 features a map drawn to 20 kilometers per hex, with one week turns. There are over 150 unit counters and markers. Units are mostly Nationalist &quot;Corps&quot; and Communist &quot;Columns&quot; of about 20,000-30,000 soldiers. There are also artillery regiments and tank battalions: the Communists have a few; the Nationalists have a lot more. Both sides are subdivided (as they were historically) into &quot;sub-commands.&quot; The rules cover unique aspects of this struggle: Nationalist Defections, Communist Guerrillas, the Propaganda Offensive, Communist &quot;Short Attacks&quot;, Communist Re-Education, Red Militia, Nationalist Final Defense Positions, and more. Players may discern the early origins of the ferocious Red Chinese attack against UN forces in Korea a mere two years after this battle, as well as elements of guerrilla warfare that later became familiar in Vietnam.<br/><br/>Virtually unknown in the West, this battle is quite familiar to mainland Chinese and to those on Taiwan as well. It's a fair description to call it the &quot;Gettysburg&quot; of the Chinese Civil War.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Before Hitler. Before Napoleon. Another European strong-man invaded Russia&hellip; and came to grief. He was Charles XII of Sweden. In later years, they would call it &ldquo;The Great Northern War.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Whether the blame can tagged to Swedish expansionism or Peter the Great&rsquo;s desire for that warm-water capital city and &ldquo;window on Europe,&rdquo; the clash was a seemingly inevitable clash over who would own what in northern and eastern Europe and what shape Poland would take (if any). When the war started, it resembled something Frederick the Great would face, a &ldquo;everyone against one country&rdquo; conflict that saw Russia joined by Denmark/Norway and a Saxon-Poland-Lithuania combination, with others joining later, all seeking to take advantage of the 18-year old Charles XII&mdash;who was perceived to be weak and inexperienced. Like Frederick, he would parry multiple invasions and survive. Unlike Frederick, he would launch a serious invasion deep into Russia&hellip;and fall from power.<br/><br/>A Thunder Upon the Land looks as the Sweden vs. Russia portion of this war, with the two battles that rather started and finished the conflict. The Battle of Narva took place in 1700, as Russia and a Saxon-Polish contingent aimed to push Sweden out of the Baltic, with the Saxons threatening Riga and the Russians besieging Narva. But it was November, and Peter left his army feeling secure that his 40,000 men could bottle up and capture the 2500 Swedes holding the city. Charles rushed to relieve the city with an army that was well-drilled and well equipped, but numbered only about 8000 men. So, including the troops in the city, he would be attacking at something like 1-4 odds. And attacking in a blizzard. But the surprise and wretched weather worked to his advantage, and virtually the entire Russian army was killed or captured, along with their artillery and equipment. It was Russia&rsquo;s finest force at the time, and an immediate invasion by Sweden might well have succeeded. But there was Riga and the Saxons to consider, and Charles let the moment pass.<br/><br/>Three years later, having knocked the Saxons out of the war, Charles turned again to Russia, who had surprised Europe by founding St. Petersburg on what was then still Swedish territory. Charles aimed for Moscow, and this time, it was a Swedish army that vanished from the map.<br/><br/>A Thunder Upon the Land brings you both battles of Narva and Poltava, with full color maps and over 250 die-cut counters. Each turn represents about one hour of real time and each hex represents about 500 yards. This game uses chit-draw for wing activation and allows players to make tactical choices like forming squares or deciding if their dragoons will press home charges or use the safer (but less effective) Carracole attacks, with optional rules for volley fire and desperation attacks.<br/><br/>Can you, as Charles XII, maintain Sweden&rsquo;s status as the rising power in Europe? Can you, as Peter I, defeat the invaders and open the great city you gave your name to? The choices are yours as you refight the battles of Narva and Poltava.<br/><br/><br/>    Map - One double-sided full-color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet<br/>    Counters - 264 full-color large 5/8&quot; diecut pieces<br/>    Rules length - 12 pages<br/>    Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>    Complexity - Medium<br/>    Solitaire suitability - Average<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>The initial onslaught of the Germans' Ardennes offensive, in December 1944, overran numerous US positions all along the front line, though the Germans simply bypassed other stubbornly defended locations so as to maintain their momentum. The small town of Bastogne, however, with its strategically critical road junctions, became the lynchpin of the entire campaign. The Germans soon realized Bastogne had to be captured; so they set out to assault the outnumbered and surrounded American units there. The desperate defense of Bastogne therefore came to typify the entire Battle of the Bulge.<br/><br/>Bastogne utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the battle. From anti-tank units to mortars, units can receive support assets to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon battalion, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by artillery &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy battalion of paratroopers defending a hamlet. As that attack gets underway, the recon battalion may find itself under the guns of enemy artillery. So more support fire will be necessary to take the hamlet, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Bastogne, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of battles in Europe. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the actual fighting for Bastogne. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Bastogne: The Desperate Defense, December 1944<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to New Orleans, Louisiana, circa 1980: a vibrant city of music, food, and magic. Neon lights flicker in dirty puddles up and down Bourbon street; the innovations of the modern world clash with ancient and terrible traditions; and murder is never simple. The Beaumont Agency, staffed with a roster of brilliant, colorful, and ultimately ﬂawed private investigators, specializes in solving cases that no one else can crack.<br/><br/>In The Dark Quarter, a co-operative app-driven adventure game set in a dark, fantastical vision of 1980s New Orleans, players each take control of a Beaumont agent and work alongside one another to solve the worst crimes that New Orleans has to offer. It's a world full of magic, where hexing curses are sold on every street, where voodoo priestesses and creatures of the night are lurking around every corner, and where even the most mundane crimes have a tinge of the supernatural to them.<br/><br/>Through multi-scenario campaigns, the game tells a rich, dynamic story and invites players to make critical decisions that will not only affect their characters, but change the direction and course of the story. The characters are not simply avatars, easily replaceable from scenario to scenario; instead, they are woven into the very fabric of the story itself. Their destiny and the destiny of New Orleans are inextricably linked together.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tipping point is like SimCity with cards. Players build cities while trying to survive extreme weather disasters that become more and more common as carbon dioxide accumulates in the air. It's a family-friendly game perfect fit for casual and strategic gamers. It's also a great choice for teachers looking for a visual way of introducing their students to climate change.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to grow, sustain and protect a large population. Players take turns pulling new citizen cards and purchasing new development cards to add to their city.<br/><br/>Each citizen has their own special ability, including the construction worker who can help you repair your city, the educator who can teach your workers to use advanced technologies, and the solider who can help protect your city from outside attack.<br/><br/>One of the best parts of Tipping Point is that players can use their imaginations to build the type of city they want. There are dozens of different development cards to choose from, including oil wells which earn more money, hospitals which protect citizens from extreme weather, or power plants which are needed to power buildings. But this growth and development comes at a cost: the release of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide (CO2).<br/><br/>The end of the game is triggered when 1 player reaches a population of at least 10 citizens. Since Tipping Point also has a semi-cooperative mode, it is possible (but quite challenging) for all players to win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As a new recruit your abilities and resources are limited so you'll need your wits about you to try and survive. Push your luck to press deeper into the unknown or play it safe and live to fight another day. The choice is yours!<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of cards representing rooms that contain monsters, clues, and encounters, and a set of dice (the same kind of dice that are used in Hellboy: The Board Game).<br/><br/>Players take turns trying to get through rooms and gather clues before getting knocked out.<br/><br/>On your turn, you start with all of the dice and draw a card. You choose which dice to roll (3 max) in order to overcome challenges (like monsters or hazards) and gain clues (victory points). Once you use a die, it can't be used again to overcome future rooms this turn. After defeating a room, you can either choose to pass, and keep all of the clues you've gained, or draw again. If you're defeated by the room, you lose all of the clues you've gained this turn and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>The first player that gains at least 15 clues triggers the end of the game. Other players get one more turn to try to gather more clues. Player with the most clues wins.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/>- 40 x Exploration Cards<br/>- 3 x red plastic Wound Cubes<br/>- 6 x yellow Attack Dice (least powerful)<br/>- 3 x orange Attack Dice<br/>- 2 x red Attack Dice<br/>- 1 x black Attack Die (most powerful)<br/>- 1 x blue Special Die<br/>- 1 x Dice Game Bag<br/>- Rules Sheet<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Designer: Outrider is a game of post-apocalyptic vehicular combat that utilizes a unique blend of dice and card mechanics that create a fast-playing, highly detailed and customizable experience.<br/><br/>Outrider is a print-and-play game designed to use standard-sized cards and sleeves, ordinary dice and has a ready-made range of the most inexpensive miniatures around: 1/64th scale die cast cars.<br/><br/>Teachable in ten minutes, the focus of Outrider is to keep things fast and furious. Most games are playable in a hour. Even with six players, the rounds are quick. The movement mechanics are designed to feel more like driving and less like geometry.<br/><br/>Players select their vehicles from eight templates that represent a wide variety of vehicles from dune buggies and muscle cars all the way to heavy duty trucks and SUVs - each with its own unique characteristics. Players then use dice to further customize (and arm) the vehicles. The dice represent weapons, equipment and even the driver of the vehicle.<br/><br/>Play is centered around a maneuver deck that allows the players to 'program' their action for a turn. Programmable actions include both movement AND attacks. But players need to be careful, their drivers may not be able to handle EVERYTHING demanded of them resulting in a possible loss of control.<br/><br/>Games are scenario based with clear goals to keep the games shorter and focused. Scenarios include such situations as busting through a police roadblock, attacking a renegade compound, escort missions and more. Teams are used, allowing the players to be creative in their vehicle (and equipment) selections. Some vehicles may be better for certain tasks but it always handy to have someone riding backup.<br/><br/>Players can check here on BGG, as well as dicefestgames.com for info on development, new vehicles, new equipment and new scenarios<br/><br/>",

Thanks to a clever stock exchange system, they implicated the other Helvetian tribes in their dealings, for the joy and well-being of all &ndash; or so they claimed.<br/><br/>But wealth doesn't just fall from the sky, and it takes a good dose of know-how to be able to rival with the skill of a vampire...<br/><br/>In Shafausa, each player represents a Helvetian tribe that has come to propose a new monetary system based on an exchange of resources. Each round players can make purchases (buildings, mines, warehouses) and exchange currency &ndash; and through these transactions influence the stock market for the prosperity of their region. Each player holds three Power cards with special actions, but can use only one during the game as the other two are then removed from play. The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round having seven phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Extraction: Mines and certain buildings produce resources, with some buildings affecting how many resources something produces.<br/>    Order of Play: Players bid for turn order; as players drop from the bidding, they place their marker in line relative to those who have previously dropped out, so whoever stays in the longest can get the position he wants.<br/>    Buying and Constructing: In turn order, players buy at most one available building and construct two warehouses; alternatively, a player can pay to remove a building in order to make space for new buildings next round.<br/>    Management: Players can build mines, add miners to their workforce, construct purchased buildings, buy and sell resources, and construct new towns.<br/>    Administration: Players pay for buildings in reserve and check their resource limits; resource costs are adjusted based on past sales.<br/>    Speculation: In turn order, players pay to adjust the prices of various resources, with each price marker being adjustable only once.<br/>    End of Game Check: If one of a player's towns or warehouses has been filled, the game ends. Players then score points for their towns, mines, buildings, and so on, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to this &quot;Geek&quot; version of the rules, Shafausa includes a &quot;Colonial&quot; version in which players draft start-up tiles (instead of starting with pre-determined characters who come with specific buildings, funds, etc.) and a &quot;Family&quot; version that removes the &quot;Speculation&quot; phase, simplifies turn order, and otherwise makes the game less involved.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you have to roll the dice of your favorite weapons and try to kill as many humans as you can by placing the correct dice combination (number and color) on them. Be careful not to leave any human alive! If they survive your attacks, they strike back, taking away tokens from your threat board. If you run out of threat tokens, the auto-destruction device activates and you all lose!<br/><br/>You have to choose and play your dice smartly and also use your helping cards at the right moment in order to overpower humans. Let's hunt!<br/><br/>(The game includes various game modes, one is a scenario that recreates the first Predator movie, where you have to hunt down Dutch.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Also, the artwork is remade with more detailed design.<br/><br/>The game is comprised of 7 rounds. In each round, players have to roll 3 dice to decide the player order and then take turns to place their dice one by one to any available function on the main board. The dice result also decides the number of resources that could be taken from the supply. A player can always kick out the other player's dice on the main board if their die is smaller than others and all spaces on that function are occupied. Each round has an event card that requires players to pay certain resources at the end of the round.<br/><br/>Some worker placement areas allow for cards to be played for ongoing effects or cards may be played into a city structure (ala tile-placement) for more bonuses.<br/><br/>The game also provides variations that make functions on the main board evolve during the middle to late game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragonfire was an attempt by Target/Heartbreaker to entice young adults into roleplaying, by means of devising a crossover between a roleplaying game and a fantasy miniatures boardgame similar to Milton Bradley and Games Workshop with their Hero Quest game system. This boxed game consists of 16 miniatures, various room and corridor tiles, cardboard doors with stand-ups, and some dungeon dressings represented by die cut cardboard pieces. The aim is to complete the task of each scenario given in the scenario booklet. One player is the Dungeon Master and sets up the rooms and monsters within when the other players reach them; the instructions are very specific about how to place the monsters, traps or items they encounter. Players are cooperative and do not compete against each other. Of course the players won't see the adventure booklet in advance or during the game, only the game master. All the players are knights of different colors (red, blue, green, and yellow). The same four colors are used for the plastic miniatures of: 4 orcs with bows, 4 trolls with clubs, and 4 Dragon Lords with swords.<br/><br/>Between each scenario may the players increase their rank, depending on how many points they have collected during the scenario. They get points depending on which monsters they have killed plus one extra for a successfully done scenario. In the Dungeons are there monsters, traps, magic items and other stuff. Overall, the designers do a decent job of making the scenarios entertaining given a limited amount material in the game. Each turn, a new event card is overturned and strange things take place. This is fun at first but becomes predictable in later games.<br/><br/>The dicing and combat system uses colored dice with different probabilities of scoring a hit - similar to Heroquest's Skulls and shields except that they are just circles on the dice and represent more of a yes/no answer when rolling. The game is slightly more advanced than Heroquest in that players can advance in levels similar to dungeons and dragons. As you increase in levels, you switch color of dice when attacking and defending, thus increasing your chances to score a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;hit&quot; result on the dice. Otherwise the game is very similar to HeroQuest in general.<br/><br/>Heartbreaker Hobbies produced a couple of lead elf miniatures designed for use with Dragonfire. At the same time, they put out a rare poster/magazine called &quot;Symmetry&quot; #1 that included two new magic items for the game, stats for two elf characters, and a short scenario using all of this with the Dragonfire game. One would assume that consumer response was lacking given that no attention was given to the Dragonfire game in later issues of Symmetry and the game went into obscurity. Still, the game could be used for a couple of night's gaming, especially if introducing children to D&amp;D style gaming or if one wanted to pirate the minis and room pieces to use with other game systems.<br/><br/>",

Legendary Showdown: Machines &amp; Magic is a game of comically epic battles where each player uses strategy, sabotage, and one-upmanship to develop a secret battle plan.  This lighthearted and easy-to-learn tabletop game is designed to be enjoyed by experienced gamers and newcomers alike.  Haven&rsquo;t read the comics before? No problem! No background reading is required to help your characters win battles and be the last one left standing! Let the mass chaos, devious strategies, and humorous battles begin!<br/><br/>Who is this Girl Genius?<br/>Girl Genius is a three-time winner of the highest honor awarded for works of science fiction and fantasy: the prestigious Hugo Award.  The webcomic follows Agatha Clay, a seemingly mild-mannered mechanic who discovers she has inherited the abilities of a spark (a feared mad scientist with the natural ability to understand complex sciences and wield them for their own chaotic purposes). Even more shocking, Agatha discovers that she is the descendent of a long lost line of sparks whose unparalleled skills and insanity made them legends in their own time.  Cleverly written and beautifully illustrated by Kaja and Phil Foglio, Girl Genius is full of adventure, romance, and plenty of MAD SCIENCE!<br/><br/>What is this &ldquo;Gunnerkrigg Court&rdquo; of which you speak?<br/>This highly praised comic is the work of the celebrated author and artist, Tom Siddell.  The story follows Antimony Carver as she attends an isolated boarding school called Gunnerkrigg Court.  Antimony soon learns that the Court is no ordinary school - the teachers are hiding ancient conspiracies, it is bordered by a forest full of dangerous monsters, and the school is inhabited by strange creatures and students with special abilities.  In the course of her adventures, Antimony befriends an ancient trickster god, discovers her own supernatural powers, and begins investigating the dark secrets of the court.<br/><br/>Why do we love these comics so darn much?<br/>If you aren&rsquo;t already faithful readers, allow me to let you in on a little secret: these comics rock.  The stories are masterfully crafted, the art is top notch, and the characters are instantly endearing.  It's no wonder that these comics have won so many rewards and attracted such loyal fans.  We also appreciate that both comics feature characters who make great role models.  For example, Antimony Carver and Agatha Clay are some of the strongest and most intelligent women you could hope to meet and their friends will stop at nothing to stand by their sides.<br/><br/>How to play the game that will... change your life:<br/>Each player is dealt a total of five characters from the worlds of Girl Genius and Gunnerkrigg Court.  These characters line up in anticipation for their chance to battle.  During the round, you try to equip characters in your line with powerful weapons and bonuses while equipping characters in other players&rsquo; lines with faulty or otherwise terrible equipment.  You can also give yourself secret advantages or sabotage your opponents.  When the round ends, the characters at the front of each line will engage in a (legendary) showdown.  But the madness doesn&rsquo;t stop there!  You can rearrange your line and the lines of your opponents to change who will be competing in the final battle.  The round suddenly ends when all players but one (the poor chap) are ready to fight.  At that point, each player reveals his or her battle strategy and the winner is decided.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to build up the New York skyline, consisting of twelve numbered sections.    Each section has four pieces, one in each colour - 48 tiles in all.   Each player has a colour for which they will score.   You start with a hand of six tiles, a &ldquo;draw pool&rdquo; of six face-up, and the rest face-down.   On your turn; you lay a tile, you replace from the draw pool, you replenish the draw pool.   The game continues until all the tiles are laid; though you can stop laying tiles if you want (to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; some of your own colours on show), but once you&rsquo;ve stopped, that&rsquo;s it, and other players can still lay theirs.   At the end, you score for any face-up tile of your colour, with bonuses for getting tiles adjacent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Last Front is a WWII-themed strategy card game in which players try to outbid each other and capture the most territories. There are 162 Cards total in the game that are divided into three decks: the Battle Deck, The Event Deck and the Territory Deck.<br/><br/>The Battle deck is made up of Unit cards, Special cards and Icon cards. These cards are drawn by the players and used to make their bids.<br/><br/>Unit cards are divided into four types: Troops, Tanks, Planes and Support. These all have a face value and different ratios within the Battle deck. There are more Troops than anything, but they are much lower value than Tanks or Planes. Support units have two values- a defense value and an attack value. If someone is trying to steal a territory you have captured they can be a powerful deterrent!<br/><br/>Icon cards feature famous personalities from different nations and they each grant bonuses or special effects based on their role in the war. The famous spy Virginia Hall allows you to see an opponent&rsquo;s hand and swap a card. Patton gives a per-card bonus to Tank units. Vasily Zaytsev and Lyudmilla Pavlichenko are snipers that can take out enemy Icons. <br/> Special cards generally have special rules that can be disruptive to your opponents. Advanced Fighters boost your Plane values. Typhus eliminates all opponent Troops in a display. Blockades can stop an opponent from using any territory bonuses they may have.<br/><br/>The Territory deck contains territory cards that players bid for in battles. Winning territories not only gets you closer to winning, but players with a controlling share of a territory type get a bonus that is unique to that country. The USSR gets a bonus to Defense cards. Germany gets a bonus for Tanks. <br/>The Event deck contains random events that can have a major impact on how a battle progresses. Fog of War forces all players to swap the cards in their hand with a new draw from the Battle deck. Winter impacts all Unit cards played for the rest of a battle, forcing players to commit more cards to a bid in order to stay in.<br/><br/>Game play is fairly straightforward. Players make bids to capture territories by placing cards from their hand face up into their display in order to outbid their opponents and capture Territory cards. Bid values consist of the cumulative value of the cards - including any modifiers from Special, Icon or Event cards and Territory bonuses.<br/><br/>The turn order consists of three parts: <br/>1.    The first player declares battle and draws one card from the battle deck<br/>2.    The first player makes their bid <br/>3.    Next player either exceeds the previous player&rsquo;s bid by at least one point or withdraws from the battle<br/><br/>Because players only get two opportunities to draw fresh cards &ndash;one at the start of their turn and one when they either win or withdraw- every card is a vital resource. Players that over commit run the risk of leaving themselves open for attack on subsequent battles.  There is an additional &ldquo;digging in&rdquo; rule that allows players to commit cards in piles of 10 points each. This prevents those cards from being affected by other player&rsquo;s burn cards and has the added benefit of cutting down on the amount of math that&rsquo;s required.<br/><br/>This continues until only one player remains, at which point the territory card is awarded to them and they declare the next battle. Victory conditions are based on the number and type of Territory Cards a player has accumulated. 2 of a kind or 3 different territories will win the game.<br/><br/>",

The cards have to be placed adjacent to other cards according to the placing rules. Thus everybody lays out their own supply network and tries to collect planets. A planet can be collected from the supply network if a player builds a new route with the same planet. That means the planet has to be laid out a second (or third or more often) time and then the old planet card(s) have to be taken as victory point(s).<br/><br/>Every player has got a mission card (with 4 missions) and a top secret card (with 2 tasks). The missions are all the same for each player, for example: &quot;place a planet at the supply network from another player&quot;. This is possible but harder than placing a planet in the own system. It also could hurt the other player but would not destroy his/her whole plan.<br/><br/>Mission cards are placed open, so every player knows always how much missions the other players have solved. The secret tasks are all different and the players hide them till the end of the game. Only then the players show them and thus the secret tasks could be crucial for determining the winner.<br/><br/>",

The outer ring of hexes can be searched for additional equipment (torches, oil to refuel the lamp, mushrooms...) whilst the inner hexes are where the gold is to be found. First player to bring back six gold nuggets wins. Or,if all adventurers are killed, the player whose spider has scored the most kills wins...<br/>Finding gold isn't as easy as it seems; the richest hexes (smack in the mine's center, of course) only yield gold on a 4+ (on a d6); using the lantern gives a +1.<br/>Where it gets really fun is with the mine's other denizens: each player controls, in addition to his adventurer, a spider that hops from rock column to rock column (the pivot points where hexes meet; the board is 3D so this works really well) spinning webs --little cardboard barriers that slide into place between rock pillars. Adventurers &quot;attack&quot; the webs when they try to step through and could stay tangled (the adventurer pieces are slotted so they can be put on top of the web they're stuck in). Whilst thus caught, spiders can try to bite them --four bites and you're eliminated! The lantern is very useful in such a case as its light scares the spiders away.<br/>The spiders can co-operate to build stronger webs, and it isn't unusual for one spider to strengthen the web an adventurer is caught in so another spider has a better chance of biting him.<br/>All in all, a very enjoyable game. Works best with the full set of six players.<br/><br/>",

Your task is to try to help her, while distracting and sabotaging her competitors &ndash; but if you don't keep your loyalty hidden, the other players will definitely stitch you up!<br/><br/>At the beginning of Granny Wars: A Game of Tit for Tat, you receive a secret loyalty card matching one of the Granny cards on the table, and you are dealt ten cards which range from -5 to +5 points. The deck also includes Gold cards, which grant a special Granny power (like &quot;Nana Nap&quot;) in addition to points. Players take turns adding cards to the Grannies, and the &quot;Tit for Tat&quot; mechanism allows a player to &quot;bounce&quot; an equal and opposite card from one pile to another, e.g., playing a +3 on a -3 lets a player move the -3 to another pile of their choice.<br/><br/>After everyone has exhausted their 10 cards, players reveal which Granny they supported and sum the points in her pile of cards.<br/><br/>The game can be played by 2 players, with a small modification to the rules.<br/><br/>",

MOONSHOT is not a trivia game, it&rsquo;s a fast-paced game of strategy based on card-play. NASA projects Mercury, Gemini and Apollo provide the backdrop as players are put in command of the Space Race. Each landmark event, pioneering mission, heart-pounding crisis and incredible machine is represented by a playing card. Players use these cards and a supply of fuel cards to complete the historic NASA space missions in a race to be the first to land on the Moon.<br/><br/>To complete each mission, you must use your fuel supply to assemble the correct equipment, launch the mission and move your playing piece to the corresponding mission patch on the game board. This completes the mission, you receive a replica mission patch and gain a fuel bonus. During the game you can take advantage of special cards called alarms, events and instants. These represent historic events in space history and can be played to speed you progress or hinder your opponents. After completing the required number of missions, be the first to land on the Moon and win the game. MOONSHOT has a wealth of detail and flavor for the space enthusiast. If you're big on space travel or really enjoy space history, this game is a must. And it's collectible, too!<br/><br/>MOONSHOT The Game was awarded &ldquo;Best New Family Game&rdquo; in the GAMES Magazine Buyer's Guide 2000 and called &ldquo;One of the Coolest New Board Games&rdquo; by Inquest Magazine.

Points are scored according to the number of existing pieces in contact with the piece already played, irrespective of color. Additionally, the four corner spaces and the central square are marked with a dot; pieces played over these dots score one extra point.<br/><br/>Each player has 14 pieces: straights, zig zags, &quot;U&quot; shapes, and corners of varying sizes. The pieces must be placed right side up, which is indicated by a groove carved into the top of the pieces. This often leads to difficult decisions needing to be made as to how to get the majority of your pieces onto the board while maximizing the points scored for each piece and also preventing your opponent from getting his pieces onto the board.<br/><br/>Scoring is recorded using wooden pegs and one track for each player with 0-9 &amp; 0-50 holes in the border of the board. For each piece left at the end of the game, two points are deducted from a player's score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rummy 17 is a somewhat standard rummy game in that players want to meld sets and runs &mdash; and play cards on the sets and runs of others &mdash; in order to rid themselves of cards. A round ends whenever one player discards their final card, then everyone else loses 1 or 2 points for each card still in hand.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, five goal cards are chosen at random from the deck, and at the end of the round each player who has satisfied a goal card scores points for doing so. On a turn, a player draws the top card from either the deck or the discard pile; if they draw from the deck, then other players have the option of knocking to take the top card from the discard pile. A player must lay down a set or run of at least three cards before being able to play on opponents' sets and runs, and a player must discard one card at the end of their turn, including their final turn when they go out.<br/><br/>After a predetermined number of rounds, whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Rummy 17 includes one joker card in each of the five suits, with each suit being numbered 1-17. A player can use the joker when laying down a run as long as the run includes at least three numbered cards. This joker can be replaced with the actual number on a later turn as long as the player who does so immediately uses the joker in a new run.<br/><br/>",

Up to seven players may play. Each player has a secret objective, which could involve destroying a certain Manhattan location or just beating up on the other monsters.<br/><br/>Napoleon at Waterloo was one of SPI's standard introductory games. It is a traditional two-player wargame designed by James Dunnigan.<br/><br/>The Tower of Azann is billed as fantasy role-playing, however it is closer to choose your own adventure. One or more players have characters journeying through the Tower. Unlike the other two entries, this game did not include counters or a map. No gamemaster is needed, the game is based on a paragraph system and movement between the rooms is sometimes governed by a die roll.<br/><br/>",

The remaining crew are scattered, marooned on worlds from their past.  Sensors on each of the four Enterprises sense each other as Klingon battle cruisers.

It is the scene in every movie where the humans are trying to get whatever weapon they can to fight the zombie horde.  You know what happens once the horde arrives.  Zombies will be killed but who will be the most Badass Zombie Killer?<br/><br/>Each player will have a character that will grant them special abilities during the game.  The goal of the game is to build the most badass weapon.  Why just have a flamethrower when you can have a laser-guided, black market flamethrower-chuks?  Or, if your opponent's weapon is a little too badass, you can make it pink to make it less so.  The game ends once the zombie horde arrives.<br/><br/>",
