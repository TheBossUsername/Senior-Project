From: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mefuvha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mefuvha</a><br/><br/>Mefuvha (&quot;foggy rain&quot;) (&quot;foggy rain&quot;) is a mancala game of the Venda who are living in north-eastern South Africa. It is closely related to Moruba played in the same area by the Pedi and to games known by the Tonga in Mozambique, e.g. Tchouba and Njombwa. The game is played by men only, while women play Ndode, a game of dexterity.<br/><br/>Mefuvha is mentioned in old Venda legends such as the story of Sankhambi and the Baboons, which was written down by the British ethnologist Hugh Arthur Stayt in 1931.<br/><br/>In the rainy season it is strictly tabu to play the game with stones, for fear that the rain will be turned to hail; fruit pips are used instead. Moreover, it is prohibited to play the game after sunset because this would provoke cattle theft. The symbolic meanings of the game are athmospheric conflict and cattle-raiding.<br/>Mefuvha Board<br/><br/>Mefuvha is played on solid wooden boards made from the trunk of a tree that can measure two meters and longer. Stayt observed boards up to 28 holes per row. The game was thus regarded to be the largest mancala game until it was reported in 1971 that Nsolo is played on bigger boards (up to 4x36 holes). Since 1995, Tchouba is known to be even larger (up to 4x40 holes).<br/><br/>The name of the game has often been misspelled as Mefuhva.<br/> Rules:<br/><br/>Mefuvha is played on a board with an equal even number of square holes in each of the four rows from six to twenty-eight in a row, the usual number being between sixteen and twenty.<br/><br/>The holes contain two seeds except the leftmost hole of each player's inner row, which is empty, and the holes adjacent to them in the inner rows, which have just one seed.<br/><br/>Otherwise, the rules are identical to Moruba.<br/><br/>",

They operated out of a swank office at the Hawaiian Village Hotel, where they were also the house detectives. Assisting them occasionally was a funny, ukelele-strumming Hawaiian taxi driver named Kazuo Kim (Poncie Ponce), whose wardrobe - consisting of a straw hat and crazy Hawaiian shirts - and numerous relatives living all over the Hawaiian Islands willing to help his employers if they needed it, provided invaluable comic relief. They were also aided by a dim-bulbed, scatter-brained, flippant nightclub singer and photographer named Chryseis &quot;Cricket&quot; Blake (Connie Stevens).<br/><br/>",

The suits are Knowledge, Danger, Travel, Companion, Escape, Foe, Puzzle, and Location.<br/><br/>The Artifact Deck is composed of 27 cards, each of which grants a special ability to the player controlling it. Artifact cards are acquired by playing melds of Action cards.<br/><br/>The game is won by collecting a certain number of Artifacts. The players choose the game length prior to play - from a &quot;Short Game&quot; (3 Artifacts) to a &quot;Full Game&quot; (9 Artifacts).<br/><br/>Basic game play is for an Artifact and a number of actions (Fate cards) to be displayed.  Players collect action cards into their hand attempting to collect a meld of 8 different suites in order to claim the artifact.  If no player can claim the Artifact, it remains in play for the next round.<br/><br/>Artifacts currently in player control and optionally disposed of action cards can be used to modify the flow of the game.<br/><br/>",

You look for an opening without leaving<br/>yourself open. The edge of the table can be used<br/>as a defensive position.<br/><br/>The game can be played in matches, playing up to<br/>a predetermined number of wins, or best of a set<br/>number of games.<br/><br/>",

Players accomplish this by accumulating money by performing success rolls in eight different areas of the board (the Pool Room, Stage, Horsehose Pit, Jukebox, BBQ Pit, Store Room and the Crossroads) which pay money, then transporting that money back to the Bar.<br/><br/>Players draw &quot;Club&quot; cards each turn which may result in immediate actions, people encounters, or items that players can accumulate and use to increase their chances of succeeding at gigs.<br/><br/>Players may choose to play as one of five different classes of characters: Musician, Hustler, Driver, Drifter or Cook.  Each class has its share of natural and item-related benefits.<br/><br/>Along the way other non-player characters may appear - &quot;Legends&quot; - which, should players encounter them, affect play.  Legends come into play when the board's &quot;Hot Action&quot; counter is raised by various activities.  Legends include Howlin' Wolf and Ol' Scratch.<br/><br/>",

Would you describe yourself as creative or deductive?  A Mr Spock type or more like The Riddler?  Does your approach to life mirror the sharp analysis of Sherlock Holmes, or the poetry of Shakespeare?<br/><br/>No matter what your style, Cognition is a game that is guaranteed to test your mental stamina and tickle your funny bone in equal measure!<br/><br/>Ask yourself, how well do you know the person sitting next to you? Are your ESP powers in good shape?  Perhaps you&rsquo;re a whiz at solving codes but do you have any idea what your car number plate is?  You might be as wise as Yoda, but do you know the names of Frank Zappa&rsquo;s first two children?<br/><br/>So, if you can combine strategy with smarts, have a bit of luck, can manipulate others without them realizing it, have a knack for languages and a memory for things everyone else has forgotten they ever knew, you&rsquo;re on your way to becoming a Cognition master!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An enjoyable card-board game created after the eponymous novel of a young Czech writer. The game system is based on the adventures during movement in a diversified terrain of old England. In the role of Knights the players have to search for the imprisoned Queen of England and return her to her beloved husband, the grieving King. An original game after an original novel.<br/><br/>In this game the game board is constructed from tiles (initially put face-down) and is revealed throughout the game as Knights move on the tiles. Each tile is divided into 9 segments which are used for the movement and there are 3 Terrain types to be found - Roads, Forests, and Mountains. Each Terrain allows for a different Movement speed.<br/><br/>The Goal of the Knights is to uncover and get to six Castles and find out on which of them the Queen is held (by secretly checking upon a castle card when they enter a Castle, eventually coming to the last card under a small stone, that shows the correct Castle). During their journeys they can use various helpers, for instance Horses, Boats, Eagles or their special versions (awarded from the King for capturing Traitors, that can be found in Taverns).<br/><br/>All-in-all the concept and production quality of the game is fresh and outstanding and is well worth the moderate-to-low price.<br/><br/>The game is language independent, only the manual would have to be translated (currently in Czech only, as of February 2009).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the Trenches: Opening Engagements is the first game of the In the Trenches series. Designed by John Gorkowski, this series enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from The Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during 5-minute, impulse-based turns on historically accurate maps scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems to inspire historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>In the Trenches: Opening Engagements includes three operations. &quot;Cavalry Eclipsed&quot; features a duel between Austrian and Russian cavalry, &quot;Elan&quot; simulates an encounter between French and German forces during the Battle of the Frontiers, and &quot;Rising Sun&quot; depicts the Japanese and British assault on the German colony of Tsingtao in China.<br/><br/>Included in In the Trenches: Opening Engagements are three 12&quot;x18&quot; maps, 300+ counters, one 27-page rulebook, three operation guides, one reference card, and two D6s.<br/><br/>(source: Grenier Games website)<br/><br/>",

The arrows on the tile you moved tell you what happens to the newly surrounding hexes.<br/><br/>     A straight arrow pointing clockwise or counterclockwise means that you should rotate the neighbor hex in that direction 60&deg;.<br/>     The twisting arrow that's nestled between the straight arrows tells you to flip the neighbor hex, keeping the same color touching the new hex.<br/>     The flipping arrow that's unique to one hex tells you to flip the neighbor hex away (the equivalent of doing the above twist, then rotating 180&deg;)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a one-of-a-kind prototype game designed specifically for the 2009 Gulf Games 23 Convention, held in Chattanooga, Tennessee, at the &quot;Chattanooga Choo-Choo&quot; Holiday Inn in the historic railroad station.<br/><br/>The game is somewhat based on Rail Baron, the classic Avalon Hill game, but utilizing auctioning of rail lines on cards as the mechanic. Whereas Rail Baron has 28 rail lines represented, from the pre-mega-merger period (before about 1970), Chattanooga Choo-Choo II only has 27 of the same lines. Each line has it's own card, with cities served (see below) shown as well.<br/><br/>Which one is missing? It is the Norfolk and Western, which on the Rail Baron board serves Norfolk, Cincinnati, and Columbus destinations. It is interesting that the present-day Norfolk Southern is one of the few &quot;Class 1&quot; super-major railroads coming out of the merger period, but the railroad it owes it's heritage to is the one missing in this game.<br/><br/>Rail Baron has 67 destination cities on the board and in the payoff table. Chattanooga Choo-Choo II has only 25 of those cities included in the card deck. The destination cards show which rail lines serve that city. Cities cards are dealt to the players at the beginning. The object is to collect railroads (by bidding for them) such that at the end of the game, the player maximizes the connections with his cities.<br/><br/>The cities chosen to be included are generally those larger hubs with multiple rail connections. Cities in Rail Baron that are only served by one or two railroads are eliminated in the Chattanooga Choo-Choo II deck. There are some interesting anomalies, however: the Louisville and Nashville Railroad is included, but neither Louisville nor Nashville cities are. Of course Chattanooga had to be included! But it seems strange that Portland Oregon, and Pittsburgh are not. Also missing is Dallas, the home of BGG.<br/><br/>Game components consist of printed adhesive labels (&quot;Avery&quot; type) stuck on basic face cards, one blue and one red deck, and a set of simple plastic chips that act as currency for the bidding. There is also a one page printed rules sheet.<br/><br/>",

After the first word, all subsequent words must intersect with previous words in a crossword fashion, using at least one previous letter in making a new word.  Typical crossword rules apply: any adjacent letters must form a word.  Words must be at least 2 letters, and no more than 4 cards may be played in a turn.<br/><br/>The hand ends when a player runs out of cards; players then add the sum of points of cards in the hand to their running total.  When a player reaches 100, the game ends and the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>There is also a solitaire game described.  Deal 12 piles of 3, with the top card face up (leave out the Jokers).  Make words out of the exposed cards, and discard them, revealing lower cards when exposed.  The turn up the remainder of the deck 3 cards at a time, making new words as before including the new card shown.  If all the table cards are gone, then spread the rest of the cards face up and continue.  When stuck, add the value of the unused cards.  15 or lower is excellent.<br/><br/>",

Players respond to ever-changing opportunities to invest in influence and colonial control in overseas territories to obtain wealth, strategic advantage, and prestige. Age of Imperialism substantially covers a full century of history with the shifts in technology, economic conditions, and politics that constantly changed the imperial equation. The future of the whole world has yet to be written; will Great Britain build an empire upon which the sun never sets, or will the French tricolour, the imperial Russian eagle, or the Stars and Stripes span the globe? <br/>  'Age of Imperialism recreates the imperial expansion of Europe, America and Japan in the nineteenth century, combining a strong historical component with a game system that encourages careful planning and player interaction whilst avoiding much of the bookkeeping tedium of comparable games on the subject. Each player manages one of the great imperial powers, managing its resources to enough develop economic, diplomatic and military power to earn a &quot;place in the sun&quot;. Intended to teach as well as to entertain, the game addresses the causes nineteenth-century imperialism as well as its effects on international relations amongst the imperial powers. <br/> Played on an authentic 19th-century map of the entire world, Age of Imperialism includes several scenarios, each playable in an afternoon, covering different stages of imperial expansion, as well as a campaign game that covers the entire century. It also includes rules for solitaire play. Complexity is medium (about 6/10).<br/><br/><br/>",

The randomly drawn action card (or your former goal card, should you choose to override the drawn action card) and your situation determine the exact nature of the options available to you on your turn:<br/><br/>     You can get a snack sold at your current space, then amble onward.<br/>     You can jump on a deal at the space whose number is on the action card.<br/>     You can slide to a location bound by the color indicated on the action card.<br/>     You can dance with someone in your space, which gets everyone else dancing (and hungry).<br/>     You can be a buzzkill and steal from someone in your space.<br/>     You can hang a flag on a trilithon if you're close to one.<br/><br/><br/>Stonehenge Hippie Festival is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game and the Nocturne Expansion.<br/><br/>",

As the name suggests, the game draws from the Kalah tradition, and certainly is a member of the Greater Mancala Family of Games.  In the basic game, each player attempts to bear her discs off the outer ring of Stonehenge as quickly as possible, using the traditional Kalah sowing of discs from a &quot;hole&quot;.  In order to bear a disc off the board, it must land on a space of its color, or on a space that already has 10 discs in it.  Play one round per player, and track their scores.  First one out in a round gets 5 points; second, 4; et cetera, with last place getting 0.<br/><br/>The bluffing variant allows players to keep their color a secret until the end of the round.<br/><br/>In the gambling variant, the players have no colors.  Instead, each turn, the player also takes a bar in the color they think will do best.  For each color the player gets the color's score multiplied by the number of bars in that color she took.<br/><br/>There are a handful of other minor variations, as well.<br/><br/>",

Additionally, you may place an incarnation of your divine self as part of a clan in order to protect that clan from attack.  On your turn, you simply place yourself or a follower, or eliminate an opponent's follower - or discard any number of cards.  In any event, you replenish your hand at the end of the turn.<br/><br/>The game ends one round after either the deck is exhausted, the outer ring is full, or a player plays her last follower.

To do this, the players move the playing pieces the number of spaces as rolled on the die. Players can move on any route, but in a single turn can only move in one direction.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is that the player would get the most amount of points. For the points to be valid, the player needs to get to the space where there is pictured a little paw, next to the space where there is food. He takes the piece from the game board and starts on the way back. If the player safely succeeds to return to the hole, he keeps the piece and can leave for the next one. Depending on where the food piece was on the board, it can have various amounts of points (the amount of points is given on each piece next to the picture with the food). Three pieces (with the navy blue background) have the greatest punctual value (6 points), but when carrying it, the player moves one space less then what was rolled on the die. The collected points are added together. The game ends after a player gets the amount of points that was determined upon earlier, or after there are no more food pieces on the game board (the total amounts to 72 points).<br/><br/>",

All of the plays of  each of the games played in the two historic ballparks (Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field) during the 1952, 1953, 1955, and 1956 World Series is &ldquo;charted &ldquo; with mathematical accuracy for the chance of each event happening.  The game is a cleverly unique system that recreates the history of these series games. All of the actions that actually happened during the games from the 1952, 53, 55, and 56 series are charted onto the fields, and by a roll of the 3 dice (producing  216 different outcomes) these plays will happen according to the actual probability of such an event.  All of the ground outs, hits, (singles, doubles, triples, HR's), fly balls, line outs, strikeouts, walks, and errors! Anybody who is familiar with the &quot;Red Barber Baseball&quot; game of the 1950's will recognize the basic game system.<br/><br/>The game includes simple cardstock ballpark models of Yankee Stadium and Ebbets Field.  As well as Roster Sheets for both teams for 1952, 53, 55 and 56. These sheets include dice roll adjustments for each player in each park to better reflect each hitters achievements for each park during each year according to historical probability.  In many ways this is BASEBALL HISTORY at a glance.  Just looking at the ballpark recreations shows where all of the plays took place in each area of each park. This is a BASEBALL GAME which faithfully recreates the hitting exploits of each team in each ballpark, through all four of the Subway Series of the 1950's.<br/><br/>Additional infomation:<br/>The game as originally published in 1988 came with a short &quot;history&quot; of the four World Series that was written especially for this game by Hall of Fame sportswriter Bob  Broeg of St.Louis.  Very few games were printed and they were used primarily as a promo for BAUER DIAMONDS (maker of model ballpark kits).  Many were sold thru magazine adds, but some were given as gifts to family, friends, and supporters of BAUER DIAMONDS.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crossboard is an abstract strategy board game for 2 or 3 players. The game consists of:<br/>&bull; an 8&quot; x 8&quot; wooden board containing 84 slots which form a grid pattern of 36 squares<br/>&bull; Three groups of 45 colored wooden discs.<br/><br/>Each player is represented by one group of 45 colored discs. The discs are used as walls, which are inserted into the game board&rsquo;s 84 slots, and also as markers, which are placed flat on the game board&rsquo;s 36 squares.<br/><br/>Players take turns adding discs, attempting to be the first to form a path of discs connecting either two opposite sides of the game board. Two-player games average 10-20 minutes, with 3-player games, 20-30 minutes.<br/><br/>The game involves no luck and all strategy in its simple yet compelling blend of offensive and defensive game play. The minimal, simple rules for claiming squares and forming paths make for intriguing game play for players 8 and up.<br/><br/>",

The goal of a player is to get his duke to the center board space at a time when he cannot be attacked by an opposing figure on their next turn.<br/><br/>The theme is that three dukes are vying to be named the monarch of Germany in the 13th century. The game is designed for three players, making it less common, however it can be played with two as well.<br/><br/>",

Use these gangs to tip over the 5 types of vehicle cards in 5 different colors. Your score is based on the set of vehicle cards you tip; Busses are worth more than Cars and Trucks, but they also require a bigger gang to tip over. Motorcycles aren't worth as much, but they're easier to tip (require a smaller gang).<br/><br/>You score for collecting types of vehicles as well as for collecting colors, so you can go for a bunch of Tractors, or you could try to collect all the Blue vehicles.<br/><br/>",

Designed on purpose to be more of a warGAME than a simulation. It addresses a number of pet peeves of mine in regard to Bulge games I'd played over the years. Some of these issues include:<br/><br/>OFF BOARD MOVEMENT CHART [what happens to all those pieces that 'exit the map?']<br/>STACKING POINTS [one of the greatest mechanics of all time - why don't designers use it more often?]<br/>COMMAND &amp; CONTROL [divisional bonuses for unit cohesiveness]<br/>SUPPLY DIFFERENCES [different effects on ALLIES vs GERMANS]<br/>INITIATIVE [essentially, the 5-1 column on the CRT is gone]<br/>NO OVERRUN [squads held crossroads against regiments]<br/>NO WEATHER RULES [weather is reflected in air support]<br/>VON DER HYDTE [ALWAYS gets on the board]<br/>STREAMLINED PLAY [I don't need water allocation points]<br/><br/>Referred to affectionately by wargamers as BOB, I like to refer to it as The World's Finest Bulge Game. All of the artwork was done by myself - including the counters which were hand drawn!<br/><br/>22&quot; x 34&quot; map [printed on four 11&quot; x 17&quot; cardstock sheets]<br/>600 counters [printed on 2 sheets of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; label paper]<br/>2 OOB/OOA set-up sheets<br/>1 OFF-BOARD MOVEMENT CHART<br/>2 Player Aid Cards<br/>1 example sheet<br/><br/>This is the original TERRAN GAMES dtp publication of BOB showcased at ORIGINS '94 in San Jose, not the TERRAN GAMES, INC. version published a year later with all new [gorgeous] graphics by Mark Simonitch.<br/><br/>",

Planes may be able to move to a different space by drawing a new card that must be lower than its movement rating. Thereafter shooting is performed in a similar fashion. At the end of each turn, the planes are removed from the grid, so may reappear on an entirely new angle of attack the following turn.<br/><br/>Rules provide many optional rules and very complete aircraft statistics.<br/><br/>",

Five dice are rolled, and points are awarded ones, fives, 3 or more of a kind, and straights. Several places along the track award bonus points. You may roll multiple times per turn, increasing your distance by accumulating past roll scores, but if you roll a &quot;derail&quot; (a non-scorable roll), you stay put instead of advancing. You can send your opponent backwards if you &quot;rob&quot; their train with dice instead of guns, and hope you prevail, or YOU go backwards instead!<br/>Clever game that is easy to learn.<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to place their tiles in key positions to bolster their own defenses while trying to maximize their position against their opponents tiles.<br/><br/>Each player receives a number of action points to spend on his turn.

With this deck of card you can play the classic Hungarian games but this deck contains five extra cards. With these five cards comes a new game, &quot;Deo Gratia!&quot; The players have to find pairs. Each pair gives you a virtue point and at the end of the game that player with the most virtue points will be the new king.<br/><br/>",

Players compete for points and ultimately victory by laying waste to their opponent one line at a time.<br/><br/>Playing the game is simple: remove your opponent from the board 1 line at a time. This is not one of those one-at-a-time, chip-away-at your opponent games. If removing 9 (of your opponent's 30 total) tokens with 1 card is not enough to satisfy your need to dominate, adapt! There are adapters you can attach to a line to make it act in unique and more devastating ways. But you will need to take care, as any actions you take may affect your own tokens.<br/><br/>In addition to eliminating your opponent, you will need to earn enough points to solidify your victory. Earning points is as easy as placing your tokens in risky locations. Can you manage to outmaneuver and outscore your opponent? Will you pull off a victory even after all of your tokens are removed? Are you worthy of the title Grid Lion?<br/><br/>",

There are two more temporal locations: the unknown future and the permanent past.  Each turn is divided into phases.  Early in the turn, the players get to move and alter the state of the board.  Later in the turn, time moves from the future toward the past.  This means that anything in a:<br/><br/>     distant past version of a physical location moves into the permanent past and off the board<br/>     recent past version of a physical location moves into the distant past version of the same location<br/>     present version of a physical location ***copies itself*** into the recent past version of the same location<br/>     near future version of a physical location moves into the present version of the same location<br/>     far future version of a physical location moves into the near future version of the same location<br/><br/><br/>The layout of the board, combined with the mechanics for the progression of time are the critical elements for representing time travel in the game.<br/><br/>",

For example, a spectacular scandal in a government-run service will make all voters slightly more positive towards privatization, which will benefit parties on the &quot;Free Market&quot; side of that scale. Likewise, a huge oil spill would be beneficial for the greenish parties.<br/><br/>Positioning yourself on different scales gives you points with the different demographic groups: the young/old, the men/women, the educated/uneducated, the rural/urban and the working/non-working. You can't win them all, so concentrate on your niche and keep a watchful eye on your ideological neighbors.<br/><br/>If parties move in the same direction on some issue, they strengthen their relation; if they move apart, they weaken their relation (if they have one). A strong relation means an alliance, and alliances are crucial as voters first choose which alliance that suits them best, and then which party within that alliance. A lonely extreme party has a small chance of presenting a complete and appealing policy package, while a large and stable alliance will harvest many voters. On the other hand, sacrificing your party identity to suit your allies might also mean losing your core voters to the more radical parties.<br/><br/>The game is thus cooperative/competitive; take one for the team, but make sure you're not doing all the work in keeping together - don't forget to grab a bunch of voters for yourself!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A-HAH! Memoritz is a collection of games that can be played with a deck of 40 oversized cards. The cards are numbered 0 to 9 and the numbers come in four different colours. The cards also display 20 pairs of colourful pictures of everyday objects.<br/><br/>The games were developed with the specific intention of using them with people with dementia.<br/><br/>The games that can be played with the cards are:<br/>1) Quick Match<br/>Cards are scattered face-up and players try to locate matching pairs as fast as they can.<br/>2) The Memory Game<br/>Cards are scattered face-down and players take turns to turn over two cards to try to locate matching pairs. <br/>3) 1-2-3<br/>PLayers are requested to find 2 to 3 cards that add up to a specified number. <br/>4) What's This?<br/>Not so much a game as an activity - players are asked if they recognise images on the cards and this is an opportunity to engage players in conversation.<br/>5) A-Hah!<br/>One card is chosen as the A-Hah! card and put aside. The remaining cards are dealt to all players and players try to form pairs with their cards. Players take turns picking cards from the player to their left to try to form matched pairs. The first player pair all his/her cards wins. The player holding the A-Hah! card is the loser and everyone points at him and says &quot;A-Hah!&quot;.<br/><br/>The set was published at the same time as another similar set, A-HAH! Fruito.<br/><br/>",

Another player tries to kidnap one of the ladies. This is done by rolling six dice. Now both the guard and the potential kidnapper try to calculate a result of six from the die rolls by using multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. If the kidnapper manages this first, he gets a lady. If the guard is faster, the kidnapper has to say something in a ridiculous high eunuch's voice and it's the next kidnapper's turn. When all the ladies are gone, the player with most ladies is the winner.<br/><br/>A memory variant and a &quot;Turbanspiel&quot; (turban game) are also described in the rule book.<br/><br/>",

There are different Occupations that you can take on to make this task a little easier.  Add in an interesting placement/bonus scoring system to further drive the choices you have to make each turn, and you've pretty much got it.<br/><br/>Included are some suggested variants, such as a Basic Mode, where you can grab some of your own 6-sided dice and play it without the cards and complexity if you're looking for lighter fare, and also different ways to draft cards and choose roles.<br/><br/>A light dice game with a hint of strategy, a great filler or end to a night of brain burners that can accommodate up to 8 players!<br/><br/>As of 12-19-09, Quick Six is available here at BoardGameGeek as a Print &amp; Play game!

        "description": "A modern twist on the classic game of chess        <br/>Welcome to the realm of Crusade &amp; Conquer! Be wary of flying dragons, defending flag bearers, and the castle&rsquo;s move-restricting levels. A fantastical world where a modern twist on the classic game of chess feeds the eternal feud between King Ulric and King Montfort, the realm of C&amp;C is a place that knows no grandmasters and players enjoy the luxury of an entirely new endgame&hellip; what's your endgame?<br/> Game Rules<br/><br/>Playing Crusade &amp; Conquer is similar to chess... well kind of.  While many of the characters and their movements mirror classic chess,  the new board, castles, and game pieces have introduced twists and turns that will make even the most strategic and advanced players think twice.   But this game is not just for the masters.  Anyone can learn... and once you do you'll never turn back.<br/>The Castle<br/><br/>The Castle has two levels or floors. The upper level is where the King and Queen begin the game; with the King always starting on the X. Remember, the game is lost if the opposing Flag Bearer reaches your King&rsquo;s starting X.<br/><br/>Game pieces cannot jump up or down more than one level in a single movement and must stop their movement as soon as a level is traversed. There are two exceptions to this rule:<br/><br/>&bull;Castle Exception #1: the Knight is allowed to complete the L-shape movement as long as it only moves one level per turn. If the Knight must move up two levels to complete its L-shape movement, the move is not allowed.<br/>&bull;Castle Exception #2: because it can &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, the Dragon&rsquo;s movements in and around the Castle are not restricted. However, the Dragon can only move more than one space in a single turn if it is flying over teammates.<br/><br/>Dragons<br/><br/>A Dragon may move one space per turn in any direction. A Dragon may jump its teammates in any direction for as many spaces as they are in a straight line. A Dragon cannot jump opposing game pieces, even if they are between teammates. With the exception of the Flag Bearer, a Dragon may kill any opposing game piece by moving in any direction. A Dragon may also kill any opposing game pieces (except the Flag Bearer) by jumping teammates to complete the move. A Dragon must end its move as soon as it kills an opposing game piece. A Dragon may traverse more than one level of The Castle in a single move only if it is jumping over teammates.<br/><br/>Flag Bearers<br/><br/>A Flag Bearer may only move one diagonal space per turn. A Flag Bearer cannot jump teammates or opposing game pieces to complete a move. A Flag Bearer cannot kill any opposing game pieces but can only be killed by the opposing King. A Flag Bearer must end its move as soon as it traverses a level of The Castle. A Flag Bearer can win the game by reaching an opposing King&rsquo;s starting position.<br/><br/><br/>Winning Crusade &amp; Conquer<br/><br/>There are two potential endgames (ways to win the game) in Crusade &amp; Conquer. The first endgame is to kill the opposing King. The second endgame is to get your Flag Bearer into the opposing King&rsquo;s starting position (the opposing X).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Farmasum Game description:<br/>THEME: Although this is a version of Checkers, it is done in the style of the popular tile-laying game, Carcassonne. Making fun of the contentious 'farming scoring' in Carcassonne, it uses meeples that are prone (farmers) as the checkers. In keeping with this, the 8x8 checkerboard alternating between the farmer&rsquo;s fields and 'city tiles'.<br/><br/>ADDITIONALLY: Included in the game is a very brief synopsis of the alternate ways that farmers may be scored as well as other common, simple, Carcassonne play-style questions. But, the main focus is checkers, so a pair of dice is included for playing a variation called Irish Draughts. (yes, this could be considered a &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; game.)<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY SUMMARY: Alternating moves on each other, players may advance their farmers diagonally one space to open field. Typically, the black meeples (and blue die for variant) are used by the groom whereas the white 'farmers' (and pink die) are for the bride. You must jump your partner whenever possible.

        "description": "In the second century of the Christian era, the Empire of Rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth, and the most civilised portion of mankind. The frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour. The gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces. Their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury. The image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence: the Roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority, and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government. During a happy period (A.D. 98-180) of more than fourscore years, the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, and the two Antonines. It is the design of this...to describe the prosperous condition of their empire; and afterwards, from the death of Marcus Antoninus, to deduce the most important circumstances of its decline and fall; a revolution which will ever be remembered, and is still felt by the nations of the earth.<br/><br/>The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire<br/><br/>Edward Gibbon, 1776<br/><br/>Empire of Rome is a game depicting the internal politics and wars of Imperial Rome from 27 BC to 284 AD. Players control factions, each one controlling senators, consuls, proconsuls, provinces, legions, fleets, courtiers and trade concessions. One faction controls the Caesar, who can reward and punish, wage war and make peace and takes the cream of Rome&rsquo;s wealth. Every hand is raised against him and to claim victory he must survive assassinations, rebellions and the attentions of the Praetorian Guard. Foreign wars interfere with internal politics, the expansion of the empire leads to great glory and renown, but Germanic tribes and Parthian kings may invade at any time and the generals sent to repel them may march on Rome to claim the imperial purple. If the players place the good of the Rome before their own ambitions it may expand beyond its historical limits, if not they could precipitate its premature decline and fall.<br/><br/>",

The basic premise is that the player(s) represent fire officers trying to combat fires and deal with emergencies in the critical period of the first London Blitz of September 1940 to May 1941. It is a &lsquo;tactical skirmish&rsquo; game - with individual models representing individual vehicles, and stands of figures representing small groups of fire-fighters and emergency workers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;It also requires a model (or at least a detailed ground plan) of the appropriate scale or the buildings involved. To keep the game manageable I have defined buildings as covering a number of &lsquo;zones&rsquo; - both vertically and in area - and these might cover more than one floor of a building, and ignore much the detail of the internal layout. I have done this to make the game reasonably fast-moving and to keep it simple - there is a wealth of detail; that could be represented, but in my view this would slow the game down considerably.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This game is unusual in that there is no &lsquo;enemy&rsquo; played as such. Player cooperate to solve a difficult (or even insoluble) problem with limited resources - I guess this could be called a &lsquo;multi-player solo game&rsquo;. The opposition comes in the form of randomly generated bombs and fires and damage that occur according to the games&rsquo; simple fire propagation model.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums. Salem, Mass.: Parker Bros., Inc., 1905.<br/><br/>The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums is a formalized guessing game, a contest of wit and skill in which players take turns asking riddles. The player that cannot answer loses.<br/><br/>The &quot;What Did the Woggle-Bug Say? Contest&quot; made this Oz character a household name and inspired all kinds of novelties. That was the beginning of a &quot;Woggle-Bug&quot; craze.<br/><br/>Parker Brothers quickly produced their own tie-in for the hype, introducing The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums the same year. The Wogglebug Game of Conundrums is a game of riddles (none having to do with Oz) produced in 1905.<br/><br/>This is the first toy connected to the Land of Oz as it predates The Wonderful Game of OZ. This unauthorized novelty was only in production for a short time, and is the oldest Oz toy to be found.<br/><br/>Neither Baum nor his book The Marvelous Land of Oz (1904) are mentioned anywhere on this game.<br/><br/>The complete game consisted of a chromolithographed box containing a set of 51 gray colored Conundrum cards and 51 buff-colored Answer cards with one page &quot;Rules for Playing The Woggle Bug Game&quot; and Parker Bros. flyer for two other card games, Pit and Quit .<br/><br/>Sampled below are some of the Woggle Bug's silly questions, and the corresponding answer cards for the game. Popular Culture themes of the time were referenced, as seen in the answer to &quot;What was Adam's favorite popular song?&quot;<br/><br/>Some examples of the Conundrums (questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer) are:<br/><br/> Why didn't the dog want to go into the Ark?<br/>Because he had a bark of his own.<br/><br/>With what would you fill a barrel to make it lighter than when it was empty?<br/>Holes.<br/><br/>What was Adam's favorite popular song?<br/>&quot;There's only one girl in the world for me.&quot;<br/><br/>What kind of medicine does the iceman take?<br/>Pond's extract.<br/><br/>It is unfortunate that the colorful design of the box cover did not extend to the playing cards. <br/>As this was an unauthorized game, Parker Brothers might have found it too difficult to reproduce Neill's stylish illustrations past the images of the Woggle-Bug and Jack Pumpkinhead on the box cover.<br/><br/>The earliest toy associated with Oz and one of the rarest examples of Oziana.<br/><br/>",

And so on. Your turn concludes when you add a stone which forms 4 or less connections with neighboring stones.<br/><br/>Certain move types are prohibited in hex hex Flume, unlike its sister game, square Flume, in which there are no prohibited move types.<br/><br/>The object is to have the majority of stones on the board.<br/><br/>",

The modern era has been marked by scientific discoveries, and we must understand its main components.<br/><br/>This game will let you penetrate the world of geniuses and their inventions. Once immersed, not in Archimedes' bathtub, but in a fascinating universe in which you might perhaps be brought to exclaim &quot;Eureka!&quot;<br/><br/>(Translation from the instruction package)<br/><br/>&quot;Eur&ecirc;ka!&quot; is a game in which multiple players compete in trying to complete more of the 13 numbered sets of 4 cards than any other player. Every card contains several (around 5-10) trivia questions. After having distributed the cards evenly among players, gameplay starts. On his turn, a player will ask for a particular card of a set of which he has at least one other card. Its owner will ask the first question on the card - should that card ever be asked again, the second question will be asked, and so forth. Whenever a player answers correctly, the card is transferred to him; whenever a player completes a series or wrongfully answers a question, it becomes the next player in clockwise order's turn. The game ends either after all sets are completed, or after a set time deadline, to the players' choice.<br/><br/>Questions vary in difficulty, as some of them can easily be answered by any 6th grader while some others require an acute knowledge of particular disciplines. Mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, computer science and biology are all disciplines that this game addresses.<br/><br/>(Description by BGG user jgag)<br/><br/>",

Some of the first victims already suffer the effects of the new disease, and rise up from the dead, returning to life as zombies hungry for human flesh.<br/>Some survivors still resist the virus, but their time is short.

There is only one way out.<br/><br/>A summary of the gameplay:<br/><br/>The characters start at the central sector of the board, that is already revealed. The goal is to find the antidote and escape through the hatch in the center of the board. To do this, the players must spend action points to do actions like walk, fight and search.<br/>When a character enters in a unrevealed room, he must take one tile from the pile, and place it adjacent to the room he is coming from, connecting the doors. Then he rolls the encounter dice, that shows if he met zombies, items or nothing.<br/>The fight is conducted by the range and the requirements that each weapon has to kill or hurt the zombies. Then the player rolls a dice and see if the result satisfies those requirements. He can spend action points to add to the result.<br/>The items are managed in the inventory, that shows how many items the character can carry.<br/>When the player choose to search, he takes a card from the correspondent sector pile. It can be items, good or bad events, weapons or the antidote.<br/>When a player finishes his move, then the next player plays with the zombies on the board. He can move and attack with all zombies.<br/>After that, the same player now plays with his human character, an it goes on. When the round is complete, move the players' infection marker. If someone passes the last<br/>mark, he becomes a zombie.<br/>There are some details in the rules about spending action points, fighting, events and items.<br/>The first player to find the cure and get back to the hatch is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player leads an expedition sent to hunt the unicorn, but in the way they could get other valuable things like gold, trading on the Silk Road and to evangelize people in the name of his master Henry IV of Castille. All this if the expeditioners survived the attacks of nomade tribes with whom they have to fight.

Cada jugador dirige una expedici&oacute;n para cazar el unicornio, pero por el camino podr&aacute; conseguir oro, comerciar en la ruta de la seda y hasta evangelizar pueblos para ensalzar la figura de su se&ntilde;or Enrique IV de Castilla. Todo esto si sobrevive a los ataques de los pueblos n&oacute;madas con los que tendr&aacute; que luchar.

Reinforcement Groups in the form of infantry companies, Armored platoons, OBA modules and Gun Batteries - to name a few - may be selected by the players and purchased through the expenditure of Campaign purchase points.

        "description": "Nex is an abstract strategy game for 2 - 4 players. Gameplay consist of players taking turns to either place or move one of their pieces on the board. The goal is to force the other players into a position where they can't make any legal moves. This can be done either by capturing enough of their peices or by maneuvering their pieces into a corner.<br/><br/>This game is no longer available as Nex. It has been rethemed and after a few rules tweaks released as Battle of 4 Armies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Text extracted from the introduction of the game, written by Tony Binarelli)<br/><br/>&quot;The noise of the ball that bounces on the roulette wheel. The rustle of cards that slip on the green table. The sound of dice shaken in the dice-box. The murmur of the players. The silence of expectation. The blue smoke of cigarettes. Anxiety, joy, frustration depicted by the gambling on the faces of the crowd around the tables. This is the atmosphere in the halls of a casino. A thrilling atmosphere that attracts and disrupts all your senses. An extraordinary and unrepeatable sensation that Fortune gives you when filling your pockets with money or taking away everything you have. Because, in fact, winning does not matter.  What is important is risking and defying the Fate at that beloved and, at the same time, hated green table.<br/>The purpose of this game is just to give everyone a chance to try these feelings, tempting fate seamless.

They make each and every one of the Kiumbi characters, which are in the game.<br/>The game itself is mainly focused on children as it the whole design. It contains five characters, that are amazingly designed and handcrafted. They &quot;sleep&quot; on one side of the box in a little space with holes, so they can breathe.<br/>It plays quickly. The game board is round, with five pathways to centre and nine points, that leads to victory. On start of each pathway you put one Kiumbi character and secretly choose one of them, who you will support.<br/>Each player gets three cards with symbol, that matches one game character. When you play this card, that character moves one space to the center. But there are influences between characters - water tames fire and so on, so when you play fire, fire character moves one space forward, but another two characters move too - one forward and one backward. These influences are nicely shown on the board.<br/>When first of kiumbis reaches the centre the game ends and who has supported this character wins. Game can also end sooner, when somebody guesses another players secret favorit.<br/><br/>",

The other player has the composite forces of the Allies (American, British, Commonwealth, Polish, Jewish, Brazilian and Italian) with the objective to pierce enemy lines, catch significant cities and block retreat roads to the river and to Germany. Allies have a mighty airpower, while German has multiple defence lines with improved positions and a plenty of minor rivers. Rules reflect initial Hitler's strategy to hold until last man and, for the Allies, logistic problems to launch two main offensives at once; so German has initial movement limits and Allies must wait some game turns for their attacks: first the British Army,then the American Army.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is designed to teach baseball to people of all ages, allowing them to make decisions similar to those made in an actual game.  To quote the introduction, &quot;This is the only game approved by the Little League for Little Leaguers... It can be played with easy rules for beginners, so that dad can have fun teaching his boy the fundamentals of Baseball.  It can also be played using all the science and strategy of Major League Baseball.&quot;<br/><br/>The game consists of a field with a giant &quot;spinner&quot; embedded under it.  There are nine fielders sitting over small squares on the board, four umpires over additional squares, and a batter.  The knob in the center is spun and aligned to a space in front of the pitcher.  The player at bat then decides to swing, bunt or take the pitch.  If the pitch is taken, the umpire behind the plate will call a ball or strike.  This is done by lifting the umpire off a small square revealing the call.  If a swing is made, the batter is lifted off his square and the result of the swing is shown by a number 1-9 (indicating the player position) and the type of hit (ground ball, line drive or fly ball).  The defensive player then lifts the indicated fielder off his square to reveal whether the ball was fielded or not.  If a throw has to be made to a base, the umpire on that base makes the call.  If a runner gets on base, there are red base runners to indicate which base is occupied.  You can attempt steals, bunts, hit-and-run -- all the regular plays in baseball are available.  In addition, all the symbols are printed on the game board in foul ground so its easy to play without looking things up all the time.  A great, simple game that actually plays somewhat like the real thing.<br/><br/>(Quotes and description from rules printed inside the box lid.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Old King Cole done by both McLoughlin Bros in 1888 and Parker Brothers in 1890. This is a card game in which the cards are divided into 2 suits by means of the number in the corner, those with red numbers forming 1 suit and those with blue numbers forming the second suit. After being shuffled 5 cards are dealt to each player. The reminder of the deck is left face down in the middle of the table. Each player plays a card in turn, the one playing the highest card of the suit lead takes the trick. Each player then takes a card from the deck and adds it to the cards already in his/her hand. The winner of the trick leads the next card. Play continues this way with players taking additional cards after every trick played. After all cards from the deck have been taken play continues with all of the remaing cards until they are all played.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get sets of cards, such as 3 or 4 Old King Cole Cards of the same suit. Anytime a player has in his hand any of the sets he announces it and can then count it toward his final score. The scoring groups are Any 4 cards consisting of the 4 different cards grouped with (an Old King Cole card, a King Cole Pipe Card, King Cole Bowl Card and Fiddler Card), any 4 OLD KING COLE cards, any 3 OLD KING COLE cards of the same suit. Each grouping of cards score differing amounts of points. Highest total points at the end of the game wins. Info from AGCA Archives.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FROM THE PUBLISHER&quot;S INTRODUCTION (EXCEPTS):<br/><br/>Skirmish! is a quick-to-learn, easy-to-set-up game of combat that can be played using almost any miniatures figures.  The point of this game is to simulate small-scale battles and to play as well as possible and to have fun, win or not.<br/>Skirmish! is intended for both veteran and novice players.  It is simple enough to be a beginner's first wargame, and versatile and expandable enough to satisfy more experienced gamers, especially those who want to pull out some of their old toy soldiers out of a footlocker or the closet and use them in a game.<br/><br/>Skirmish! is designed for simplicity and playability.  The basic rules can be read, a handful of soldiers selected, and a game set up in about 20 minutes, and in much less time than that for players already familiar with the rules.  And, while their emphasis is on playability, these rules allow for consistency, taking the gaming action up at least a few steps from merely &quot;playing soldiers&quot;.<br/><br/>Would-be hardcore gamers mau complain that these rules are not &quot;realistic&quot;.  Sure they are.  They are just exceptionally streamlined, and in the spirit of &quot;playing soldiers&quot; are simple and flexible.  There are no cumbersome charts or combat matrices, no supporting papaerwork to keep track of a game in play, and a minimum of simple tables.  Most attacks can be completely resolved with a simple roll of the dice.<br/><br/>Anything beyond the basic rules is optional.  With the incorporation of selected optional rules, Skirmish! can be made as complex as is enjoyable for the players.  Most players will eventually, if not initially, want to use some of the optional rules.<br/><br/>From RPGnow.com:<br/><br/>This book is part of a thematic series of works on miniatures wargaming published by Skirmisher that includes the H.G. Wells books Little Wars and Floor Games, the company&rsquo;s spinoff Little Orc Wars rules, and the Quactica miniatures rules.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 16 playing pieces in his/her color. <br/>At the beginning, the players take turns rolling a four-sided die and can place one of their pieces in any of the holes with the number that was rolled.

Players place tiles to extend their path from a start point towards a target end point. The object of the game is to be the first player to get their path to a predetermined end point &ndash; typically a specific edge of the table, or an end point tile.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>4 or more Player pieces<br/>1 or more sets of Wend tiles, each consisting of 35 Playing tiles and 1 Start/end tile<br/><br/>Wend tiles are square in shape, and have 2 path entry/exit points on each edge. They each have four path sections which go from one path entry/exit point to another. When placed side by side, the path sections from one tile join up with those on the adjacent tile, to create meandering paths. There are 35 Wend tiles in a set, which includes one copy of all possible combinations of 4 path sections on a tile. A 36th &lsquo;start/end&rsquo; tile is also included in a set, which is used by some games in the Wend family, including Wend-edge. This tile has 8 short path sections (used as starting or ending points), two on each edge.<br/><br/>You will find that a single set of 35 Wend tiles is enough for a good game with 2-4 players. There is no hard and fast limit to the number of players in a game, but most players would probably want a reasonable number of tiles, and thus moves in the game. You can use extra sets of Wend tiles to accommodate more players or for a longer and more challenging game with a small number of players. Wend tile sets come with different coloured dots in each corner, so that it is easy to put tiles that have been shuffled together back into sets.<br/><br/>",

If not, the player that lost the previous game starts.<br/>The game is played in 2 phases.<br/><br/>DICE BUILDING PHASE &mdash; This phase is played in turns.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must do one of these two things:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a tile from the drawing area and place it face-up before you or...<br/>     Discard one of your tiles face-down (first show it to the other player) and draw as many tiles from the drawing area as the value of the discarded tile (You can't draw the discarded tile itself). The value of the discarded tile must be lower than the number of tiles left on the drawing area.<br/><br/><br/>If, after drawing the tiles, you have 6 or more tiles, you must build a die. To do this, choose 6 of your tiles and assemble them into a die, and discard the rest face-down to the drawing area.<br/>If the drawing area has no tiles left, the dice building phase ends.<br/><br/>COMBAT PHASE &mdash; Before this phase starts, 9 or 10 dice should have been built.<br/><br/>Both players roll their dice at once (try not to mix them).<br/>Now, for each of the 10 colors, do the following:<br/><br/>     Sum up the total value rolled for that color for each player. The player with the highest sum for that color gets 1 point.<br/>     In case of a tie, no points are scored for that color.<br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score after the 10 colors have been checked is the winner.

I&rsquo;m not talking, I&rsquo;m thinking. but how did I get here? what is this place? The test! yeah, that&rsquo;s it! I was in a room taking part to a ...Rorschach test... what was the reason? Am I crazy? Was I performing the test or... taking it? And what are those people doing here? Maybe... the place looks like a hospital. Maybe I was injured. There is no pain though, no bruises maybe. either way, I am not taking my clothes off in front of these strangers to check on my body. Maybe I have a relation with them. Supposedly I have something to do to them... or they to me... I wonder what it is...&quot;<br/><br/>Inside a mental institution, a group of people wakes up in the commons, the dining place of this sanitarium. nobody remembers how they got there. Amnesia. The only thing they remember is their names and an obscure scene of a Rorschach test. after searching the facility each one slowly begins to remember their role in this place... but that&rsquo;s the easy part.<br/><br/>Sanitarium is a game in which, what you try to discover, is yourself! You try to remember, by gathering pieces of information and items in the facility, who you truly are and what's your purpose in the sanitarium. If you know who you are, then you have a purpose. If you fulfill your purpose, then you are the winner! This game is a tribute to all the b-movies that feature a main plot inside an abandoned hospital, asylum, sanitarium, medical building wing, or haunted medical lab.<br/><br/>The deduction mechanism of the game is very simple. It's allows you to bluff, in being one of the roles that exist in the game, until another player proves you wrong. If no one can prove you wrong then you fulfill your role's objective. There are six different objectives in the game that depend on the player's adopted role.<br/><br/>Sanitarium is best played with 3 to 6 players, but if you have a big group of friends it may be played with a maximum of 9 (if you don't bother with a little downtime, it repays in interactivity!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary: The game is played by rolling five dice, and setting aside aside at least one scoring dice after each role, rolling only the dice that aren't kept for as long as the player keeps scoring.  If, at any point, no dice rolled score, then all points set aside in that turn are lost, and the dice passed to the next player.  Following any roll in which at least one dice scores, the active player may 'bank' the points accumulated that turn, and pass the dice to the next player.  The next player then has the option of building on that score by rolling only the non-scoring dice, or picking up all five dice and starting from zero.  At any time, the active player may call 'portito', which has the effect of flipping all dice following the roll: 1s become 6s, 2 become 5s, etc.  The player remains 'portito' until calling 'normal', which they can only do when the dice are in their possession (so you remain 'portito' while the dice go round the players).  The game continues until one player exactly reaches some pre-determined target score: 5000 or 10000 is common.<br/><br/>Scoring dice within each roll are as follows:<br/>1 = 100 points<br/>5 = 50 points<br/>3 of a kind = dice score * 100<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Foxhole is a series of board wargames planned to cover a number of important battles of World War II and later those of other wars from the Napoleonic Wars to the War on Terror. Players assume the roles of Divisional or Corps  commander. Although there are other ways to play the game, in the historical scenarios the goal is not to &quot;win&quot;, but rather to do better than the historical commanders whose role the players have overtaken. The series' scale encompasses both the Operational and Tactical  levels. Although the product is a wargame its publishers prefer to call it a simulation. It is developed by game designer Glenn Davis and published by Diffraction Entertainment, Ltd. based in Scotland, UK.<br/><br/>Foxhole's first product Utah Beach can be played by two to six players, while future installments are to allow additional players.<br/><br/>The product comes with three ways to play the game: <br/>1) The historical scenario that comes with each product where the goal is to do better than the historical results, <br/>2) A competitive (called tournament-style in the rulebook) system with over two dozen orders similar to Warhammer 40k like sieze and hold, rearguard action, etc. where your goal is to &quot;beat&quot; your opponent to the goal.  Interestingly, in this version you each take one of the hexagonally shaped maps, set up your forces, and then push them together, giving you a bit of fog of war.  <br/>3) TSWW conversion: Although seemingly not fully supported in the original product, the rulebook implies that with later releases of TO&amp;E data players will be able to play out TSWW battles at the Foxhole scale, giving gamers the first opportunity ever to play out World War II at the company scale ... everywhere.<br/><br/>As for playing the game; the following is ripped straight from the rulebook: &quot;A Primer on Foxhole&trade; in 400 Words or Less<br/>Each Player Turn consists of 6 essential Phases:<br/><br/>    Supply-Movement Phase: Units which are adjacent to enemies, plan on firing an artillery barrage or conduct an Activity this turn must Trace Supply instead of do anything this Phase.  Otherwise they may move as usual.<br/>    Barrage Phase: Barrages may be fired this Turn by Sorties and Artillery.  In the case of Artillery, they must have Traced Supply in the prior Phase and not move in the next in order to do so.  Note that the Reacting Player may also be able to fire Barrages.<br/>    Activities-Movement Phase: It is during this Phase and only if the Unit Traced Supply in the Supply-Movement Phase that Units may conduct Activities other than Movement such as digging entrenchments, demolishing them, bridges, etc., crossing a river or un-pin a Vehicle Platoon (which represents Vehicles bogged down).  Units may also move unless they fired a Barrage in the prior Phase.<br/>    Combat Phase: There are two kinds of Combat and each hex may be attacked only once.  Assaulting allows Units to enter and, if successful, secure a hex.  Its disadvantages are that it allows the opposing Player to make Covering Fire against your Assaulting Units, you have less terrain benefits and are limited to 4 Units Assaulting the Hex.  By contrast, Fights allow Units to attack enemy Units from range and has none of the above hindrances, but cannot secure a Hex and is less likely to do serious damage to the opposition.<br/>    Motorized Movement Phase: Motorized Units are all Vehicle Platoons plus any other Unit with the little wheels at the bottom.  Any of such Units can move during this Phase.  In lieu of moving, they may instead make a 50/50 attempt to Un-pin themselves from the hex (but they couldn't have moved anyway).<br/>    Vehicle Assault Phase: During this Phase Vehicles Platoons (not all Motorized Units) may make Assaults.<br/>    Full Turn: A Full Turn consists of Weather Determination and Forecasting followed by a Player Turn from each Player.  The Offensive Player always goes first, which is also the Allied Player in the Utah Beach Historical Scenario.  There are three Full Turns each Day representing the Morning, Afternoon and Night.  Preceding each Morning Turn and the beginning of the day both Players should conduct a Dawn Briefing.&quot; - Foxhole Rulebook, page 36.<br/><br/><br/>The only thing the above misses is a fun little weather forecasting and resolution where players forecast the weather two turns ahead of time, and it may or may not actually end up being the weather they thought it was going to be (but *probably* will), adding a lot a pressure/tenseness as the commanders look overhead to see whether those clouds will clear up, start a drizzle, or remain overcast as predicted.<br/><br/>",

Once the Dragon took the bait, House Davion forces would spring their trap. Yet when a real Star League cache is found, all bets are off and Davion forces are fighting for their lives, while attempting to secure the ancient ruins that could hold ancient treasures!<br/><br/>Historical Turning Points: Galtor extracts the sourcebook details from the classic Galtor Campaign scenario book and represents it in the phenomenally successful Jihad Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to an earlier time in BattleTech history, when centuries of Succession Wars have honed an animosity to a razor's edge between the Great Houses of Davion and Kurita! This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the world of Galtor, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players' imaginations are the limits.<br/><br/>",

Two cards per position will be played, in order, over a series of eight ends.  As each position will have sixteen cards available, care must be taken in how the cards are managed.<br/><br/>As cards are played, disks (representing curling stones) are added or removed from the board, representing the results of the 'shot' taken.  A good deal of leeway is allowed in the position of the stones.  This is important, as some cards will be able to affect stones in some positions, but not others.<br/><br/>In this way, choosing your shots and placing your markers, players can utilize (and learn) actual curling strategy.<br/><br/>Advanced rules has one player on each team acting as the skip or captain.  This player calls for the shot, and the shooter (active player) must try to play a card matching the shot.<br/><br/>",

The main rules and mechanics from the classic wargame remain all the same, but the original board is replaced by one depicting the city of Rio de Janeiro. This new board is divided in 42 &quot;favelas&quot; - how the slums and shanty towns are called in Brazil -, which are arranged in six different sections, following the geopolitical areas of the city of Rio de Janeiro.<br/><br/>In addition, the colored armies now represent the different groups struggling to control the &quot;wonderful city&quot;. Two colors represent the government forces: black is the &quot;BOPE&quot; (Special Police Operations Battalion) and blue is the &quot;Pol&iacute;cia Militar&quot; (Military Police). Three colors represent the major criminal organizations in Rio: red for &quot;Comando Vermelho&quot;, green for &quot;Terceiro Comando&quot; and yellow for &quot;Amigos dos Amigos&quot;. The white pieces represent the several other militias &quot;Mil&iacute;cias&quot; that also play a role in the urban war.<br/><br/>Fabio Lopez, the Brazilian designer who created the game, has already informed that he didn't intend to publish the game or even share it for free. His purpose with War in Rio was solely &quot;to generate a discussion through a shameless invitation to enjoyment.&quot; However, such an original idea could not be ignored by Brazilian players and several anonymous fans soon joined forces to recreate the map and the cards based in the original photos posted by Lopez in his blog.<br/><br/>Given the subversive status of this idea, this game probably will never be officially published.<br/><br/>",

In this reality, corporations maintain vast data fortresses that act as their servers and storefronts in cyberspace. Users of cyberspace plug their minds into this world wide reality to work, be entertained, or socialize. While the daily use of cyberspace holds the world's attention, beneath the surface rests the world of hackers and those who stand against them.<br/><br/>In Data Fortress, two players pit themselves against each other in an attempt to either crash a company's data fortress or to defend it. One player takes control of the Hacker, entering the area through the use of hidden Jack Points while the other player sets up the defensive protocols of his company's data fortress. The Hacker initializes and maneuvers his programs through cyberspace attempting to crash the defensive programs on his way to destroying all protection the Central unit has over its data. Meanwhile, the Admin brings his own programs to the fray as he holds off the Hacker until the rest of the Sys-Admins can log into the network. A truly skilled Admin can even trace the Hacker back to his actual Jack Point and crash the connection.<br/><br/>The game uses 54 tiles that represent programs, computer network and Jack Points. During a player's turn, he will be able to move a tile and play a tile in either order. Results of program-on-program interaction is based on the strength of all tiles that form a solid line to the interaction. The Hacker and Admin utilize different programs that have their own movement and abilities in this asymmetrical tile maneuvering game.<br/><br/>",

It is of the shogi branch of the chess family but does not involve drops. Set-up is on the back row identical to international chess <i>except</i> that king is placed on the center left column for either player so that kings are not facing each other. Pawn however occupy the third rather than the second row.<br/><br/>For simplicity, I'm using the international chess names of pieces rather than the traditional Japanese names. The king moves one space in any direction but castling does not exist. The queen moves one space in any direction except diagonally backwards. Bishops move either one space diagonally in any direction or one space forward. Knights move only forward in an otherwise normal knight's move so that the piece jumps to a space on either side of the space two rows ahead of its starting position. Rooks move only forward but otherwise like a standard rook. Pawns move only one space forward with no initial two-step move, and all pieces including pawns capture as they move.<br/><br/>The promotion zone is the last three rows on the board for either player. All pieces except the king and queen promote to the queen. Promotion is optional so long as a piece still has a legal move in its non-promoted state. The promotion happens at the end of the move and the move must either begin or end in the promotion zone.<br/><br/>The object is to check-mate the opponent's king. Both bared king and stalemate count as a win, but a bared king becomes a draw if the other player can bare one's king in the next move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Muzundrum is a game of creating musical triads and scales by placing 12-sided musical dice on a hexagon-based playing board.<br/><br/>From the publishers' website:<br/><br/>Muzundrum is a crossword-style game of music theory developed by composer J S Kingfisher. Players interlace 12-sided musical dice to form scales and triads on a giant honeycomb, forming unique tonal weaves... it&rsquo;s great for beginners, challenging for pros, and always mind-bending fun!<br/><br/>In the box<br/><br/>21 Twelve-sided Musician&rsquo;s Dice<br/>The Honeycomb Gameboard<br/>Embroidered dice pouch<br/>Instruction Booklet<br/><br/>Number of players, time required<br/><br/>Muzundrum can be played by 1 to 4 musicians of any age (see &ldquo;knowledge required&rdquo; below); or by 2 to 4 teams of musicians (playing in teams allows musical novices to learn from their more experienced partners). The average game lasts 15 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Object of the game<br/><br/>In Muzundrum, players intertwine triads with scales, rather like a musical crossword puzzle (albeit a three way one). Triads are built vertically; scales are built diagonally. Points are earned as players add to or complete triads and scales; double and triple scores are earned when dice are played in the &ldquo;honeypot&rdquo; cells (the ones marked with 2&rsquo;s and 3&rsquo;s). The game is over when all of the dice are played; points are then tallied, and the player or team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Knowledge required<br/><br/>A basic working knowledge of key centers, major scales, and triad construction is needed to play Muzundrum &ndash; all stuff taught in first-year Music Theory classes and by most private music instructors. In addition to being a heap o&rsquo; fun, Muzundrum is quite educational: it&rsquo;s a great way to become fluent in all 12 keys.<br/><br/>",

Though designed as a &quot;hex-n-counter&quot; board game, Quantum Legions can easily be adapted as a miniatures wargame. Details on how this can be accomplished are provided in the rulebook.<br/><br/>Finally, like most Majestic Twelve products, Quantum Legions includes rules for creating your own units so you can add to its exciting background, simulate your favorite movies and television shows, or create your very own universe!<br/><br/>Quantum Legions: Wargaming on an Epic Scale.<br/><br/>Additional Details:<br/>Units are represented by counters with basic information (movement, range, attack dice, etc.) Players roll 2d6 for the number of command points available at the beginning of the turn. Command points are used to remove suppression markers, activate ordered units and place orders on units to activate on future turns. Combat is bucket of dice with the target number depending on the attack order and number of dice modified by the target's terrain.<br/><br/>The PDF includes five 11&quot;x17&quot; map sections. Two map sections are used in the basic scenario. Also included are 1&quot; unit counters and 5/8&quot; order and suppression markers.<br/><br/>",

The Juggler card deck actually consists of two decks, one of 22 vowel cards with red backs and faces, the other of 48 black consonant cards.<br/><br/>Object/Overview<br/><br/>&quot;A game comprises several &lsquo;rounds&rsquo;. At the start of each round, each player is dealt just seven of the black consonant cards; the remaining cards are placed face down on the table as two decks (one red, one black). Players play in turns around the table in a clockwise direction. The aim is to build the best word you can in your hand by drawing and discarding cards. If you turn your whole hand into a word, you can then &lsquo;declare&rsquo;, which means you stop the round, hoping to catch the other players with valuable cards they can&rsquo;t use.<br/><br/>&quot;After a player has declared, everybody else has just one more turn in which to make the best of their hand. When play comes back round to the declarer, all the players place their hand of cards onto the table, announcing their word for that round and scoring the total face value of all the cards they have used for their word (MINUS the total face value of any remaining unused in their hand). The scores for each round are recorded on paper and when any player&rsquo;s running total hits 70 or more, the highest total wins. &quot;<br/><br/>",

There are also cards showing each of these denominations and four cards showing pay-offs.<br/><br/>A player takes on the role of banker and hands a die to another player to cast. After rolling the first die, that player decides how much to bet and subsequently decides whether to roll more dice, one by one, attempting to come as close to a total of twenty-one but not exceeding it. If he exceeds twenty-one the banker takes the player's stake, but if he stops below twenty-one, the banker then rolls two dice and attempts to beat or equal the player's roll. If the banker fails to equal the roll or goes bust, the player wins the appropriate amount as indicated on the cards.<br/><br/>Optionally, the players may play with side bets. For this purpose, the other cards showing card faces are laid out and players may bet on these faces appearing on the dice for each roll of the dice.<br/><br/>The instructions mention that other games in the Jackpot Dice series include Clipper, Crown and Anchor, Liar and Crossword Dice.<br/><br/>",

The game is 3D four-in-a-row game with some distinct differences from the common forms such as Score Four:<br/><br/>The game is for two or four players.<br/> The game box contains a brief rule sheet in French, a game board, and 64 beads in four colors, 16 of each color.<br/> The middle of the game board consists of a four by four array of 16 rods, the central four of which are placed on a turntable. Thus, the central four rods may be turned relative to the board. In the periphery of the game board is space for an additional 16 rods which may be arranged in the corners (four player game) or along the ends (two player game). Each rod is able to contain a stack of four beads.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player starts out with 32 beads, eight of each color (two player game) or 16 beads, for of each color (four player game). All of beads are positioned at the peripheral rods at start.<br/><br/>On turn, each player is either placing one of his/her beads on one of the 16 central rods on the game board, or turning the central plate 90 degrees clockwise.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to create alignments of four different colored beads. Each such alignment earns the player one point. The player with most points at the end of the game (when all the beads have been played) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

In the shadow of an old palm tree four bold nomad sons are planning a dare-devil adventure. What is their plan? Will they really try to cross the desert by the infamous west route? Don't they know the treacherous quicksand and all those other dangers which lie in wait for them? Have no fear! With cautiousness, good companionship and some luck this route is passable. Each caravan still has one place open - dare this adventure and join them!<br/><br/>The rules:<br/>Each player has three pawns with which to reach the large oasis in the middle of the board. Pawns are moved by throwing the die. A pawn can get stuck in quicksand, and then has to be rescued by another pawn of the same player. (Optional: or by rolling a six.) A rescued pawn is carried on the back of the other to the next oasis, where the pawn which was stuck has to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the player.<br/><br/>When a pawn ends its move on a field where another pawn already is, it can climb on the others back, and be carried/ported by it. This is possible with both your own or other players pawns. (Multiply carrying is allowed.) However: a carried pawn should hop off  before reaching the next oasis, as once the porter reaches it, it will drop off all carried pawns in the oasis! And likewise with resting pawns from being stuck in the quicksand: formerly carried pawns will have to rest till another pawn ends its turn there, or a six is rolled by the corresponding player.<br/><br/>When a pawn ends it turn on a place from which a short track continues (shown by a road sign), this may be taken on the next turn.

The two-year final push to Terra was the bloodiest fighting seen in centuries. In the end, Terra had been freed with the Word of Blake scattered to the darkest corners of the universe. Stepping into that vacuum, Stone forged a new &quot;Terran Hegemony&quot; in The Republic of the Sphere. With the end of the Jihad, the survivors are rebuilding their shattered armies, introducing new machines to replace those whose factories ceased to exist in the fires of the Jihad.<br/><br/>BattleTech Technical Readout: 3085 gives a detailed look at the machines introduced during the waning days of the Jihad and into the founding days of Devlin Stone&rsquo;s Republic of the Sphere. This book includes the latest &rsquo;Mechs, battle armor, aerospace and vehicles as well as new late-Jihad support vehicles. In addition, this sourcebook heralds the long-awaited update of Technical Readout: Project Phoenix, featuring brand-new art and additional variants. Conventional infantry make their Technical Readout debut with fifty-six individual infantry formations from classic foot infantry to xeno-planetary soldiers. And finally, after more than twenty years of silence, Land-Air BattleMechs explode back into a Technical Readout with a look at the original four LAMs and their Star League history.<br/><br/>",

One side of every piece is one color, and the other side is a different color.  (So that for instance one player has triangles with one side black and the other red, and the other player has squares, also with one side black and the other red). Each player controls a different shape, and each player aims to win by making a line of his or her particular colour.<br/><br/>Drop Phase: On alternate turns, each player drops one their pieces (displaying whichever colour they choose uppermost) on an empty cell.  When this phase ends, assuming neither player has achieved a win, there will be two empty cells left.<br/><br/>Move Phase: Player move alternately, and must do one of the following actions:<br/>1. Move a friendly piece.<br/>2. Jump a friendly piece over any other adjacent piece, flipping the latter over to display the color on the other side.  This is a &quot;short jump&quot; as in checkers/draughts, with no space between the initial positions of the moved piece and the flipped piece, nor between the flipped piece and the final position of the moved piece).<br/>3. Takes no action player if he/she does not have any legal move available.<br/><br/>Goal: Play ends when one player wins by making a 4 in-a-row of their chosen color.<br/><br/>In the basic game, winning lines and jumps are permitted horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.  For longer and &quot;more stable&quot; variants, outlaw diagonals from the win conditions, or from jumps, or from both.<br/><br/>",

Through played missions, the stories of this universe unfold.<br/><br/>Akzinal - Brilliant thieves on a race against time to rescue a world from implosion.<br/>Felian - A brutal race hell-bent to control the galaxy.<br/>Homin - An evil force has destroyed the home world of Erychosia. Can they find the key to time travel and stop the disaster before it happens?<br/>Morph - Shape-shifting people seeking to develop their civilization through technology.<br/>Ralyk - Fighting &quot;the madness&quot;, a terminal disease, the Ralyk try to improve their genetic codes and overcome the disease by stealing genes from other species.<br/>Varpor - Fed up with the wars, kidnappings, thieveries and utter violence that has overtaken the galaxy, the Varpor, and their liveship Sunrays take it upon themselves to police the galaxy and restore order.<br/>Wallaboo also make an appearance in the form of a powerful ally.<br/><br/>Aside from missions, Ethereum adds worlds into play. Trading is introduced as a playing mechanic, and civilizations develop by developing technologies that will help each to fulfill their story. Each world has a unique power, and when the powers collide, the battles are certain to be epic.<br/><br/>This is, at this time, a print and play game. The rule set, all cards and sheets are provided on this site for your printing and reference.Again, the rules are quite simple, and play should begin perhaps less than 10 minutes after resources have been printed. Though cubes can be purchased for easier game play, scratch paper works as well.<br/><br/>This is NOT an expansion. This is a completely new game with the same incredible characters. This might be compared to a much easier way of learning a thematic game like Twilight Imperium or Galactic Emperor. And thank you Christian Peterson and Adam West for your incredible contributions toward playing mechanics and story-based game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mario Kard<br/><br/>Mario Kard is a free PnP version of the popular Mario Kart videogame saga. So, this is a racing game composed of four kind of cards: <br/>1. Road Cards destinated to make modular circuits.<br/>2. Object Cards representing special items that drivers can use for themselves or against the others, these are the well known shells, mushrooms, stars,...<br/>3. Character Cards for each driver with his atributes: speed cards, first card, brake, attack and defense.<br/>4. Speed Cards; each driver has a set of four speed cards to determinate the movements and aceleration.<br/><br/>Drivers must move using Speed Cards. If you want play Child Mode you can use a D6. <br/>D6 is needed for attack and defense.<br/><br/>-Preparing the game<br/><br/>First you have to build a circuit and decide the total amount of laps to win the race. There must be at least one finish line and one special Road Card  where objects appear. Then each player chooses a driver (or randomly) and takes his Speed Cards. In the Driver Card is determined what is the first Speed Card to use (that is the acceleration rate somehow).<br/><br/>-The Race<br/>Player generally moves using a Speed Card that limits the maximun positions he can move on. He'll choose to move more or less, but allways within that limit.<br/><br/>-Start:<br/>Put Drivers on/beside finish line. Then each driver takes a random Speed Card and moves in turn. The first will be the<br/>younger player and then continue clockwise.<br/><br/>On the road:<br/>Each turn, every player must choose secretly one Speed Card; then Speed Cards are shown and drivers move.<br/><br/>Get objects:<br/>In the circiut there will be a Road Card with the object icon. When drivers pass on this, they get a Object Card from the Object Card deck. Drivers only can have one object card.<br/><br/>Attack/defense:<br/>When drivers are moving they could attack other players using Object Cards. The result is decided using Drivers Attack/Defense values, Object Attack/Defense values and a D6. Something like this:<br/><br/>Bowser attacks Mario with a Red Shell:<br/>  Bowser attack + Red Shell attack + D6 &gt; Mario defense + D6<br/><br/>Total attacker value must be greater than total defender value; if equal then nothing happens. Some objects could be used to add more Defense value (shells, bananas,...)<br/><br/>If the attack is successful the loser goes off the road, loses any Object Card and must wait one turn without moving. Then He must start using Drivers first Speed Card.<br/><br/>-Dangerous Curves:<br/>Some Road Cards have a special values like -1,-2,+1. These cards decrease Driver movement unless the Driver has a brake value bigger than 0. <br/>So if a player must go through a -2 curve and has a +1 brake value the movement decreases is only -1. Anyway if the driver finish a movement in a curve this decrease is not applied.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the midst of a heated forest conflict, an electrical storm damages the communication equipment of the telematons, telegraph-controlled war machines, of both belligerents. As the battlefield dissolves into a frenzy of nearly unguided machines controlled in only erratic bursts, the opposing sides must salvage the situation by using balloons and ground crews to locate and regain control of strayed telematons. However, the armed telematons are unpredictable in their damaged states and the battle is by no means over, so artillery has been brought to bear as well. Victory can be attained through the recouping of lost telematons or the destruction of the enemy headquarters.<br/><br/>A strategy game where the majority of the action revolves around 33 randomly-moving unkown units in the center of the board. Players can interact with them by learning their identities (observation balloons), firing on them (artillery) or attempting to salvage and control them by forming lines of retrieval crews, telegraph wires, and telematons. Only telematons within these lines can be controlled, and control of these units is lost through the severing of the line through hostile attack or poor tactical movements. Thre are two ways to win; either recovering 10 telematons and returning them to your headquarters or destroying the enemy's headquarters before they can reach this goal.<br/><br/>",

Nobody wants to search through three or four books in the middle of a heated battle, so we've conveniently combined them in this chapter, letting you concentrate less on flipping pages and more on shooting holes through your opponent.<br/>There are a few changes and expansions to the existing rules here, but that's not all. We've even collected all the new abilities and weapons from the GRW expansions to date. There are also the complete rules on duels and how to handle experienced and veteran troops.<br/><br/>From Chapter Two: The Lay o' the Land Introduction:<br/><br/>We just talked about how you fight your battles, and now we're going to talk about where you fight them. Here, we clarify a couple of areas from the GRW rulebook, but we also give you some new regions and strange locales for your battles. <br/>There's also a section detailing the Strange Locales rail warriors may encounter. We've beefed these up and given the heroes more reason to explore these outposts of the Weird West.<br/><br/>From Chapter Three: More Magic, More Mayhem Introduction:<br/><br/>In the Great Rail Wars rulebook, we gave you about a dozen spells to arm your spellslingers. Since then, we've come out with a stampede of Deadlands: the Weird West sourcebooks filled with new arcane incantations and miracles to make the average cowpoke's ride even rougher.<br/>This chapter contains the GRW conversions of many of those new spells. We've also tacked on complete spell lists for all the types of spellslingers in the game.<br/><br/>From Chapter Four: Fleshin' Out the Dead Introduction:<br/><br/>In the original Great Rail Wars rulebook, we gave you just the bare bones on using the Harrowed in your games. In this chapter, we show you how to make a Harrowed hero, plus we've got special Hindrances just for them, and a lot of powers only available only for these Boot Hill rejects. We've also included guidelines for converting your Harrowed character from the Deadlands: the Weird West roleplaying game.<br/><br/>From Chapter Five: The Miracles o' Weird Science Introduction:<br/><br/>There's a whole passel of strange devices that have found their way onto the battlefields. Guns that shock the opponent into next week, contraptions that let a man move underwater, and even steam-powered chainsaws! And there's the latest development in the area of science: alchemy and its potent chemical effects.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A baseball dexterity game that uses all the rules of baseball and devices that hit and pitch a small metal ball. Advertised as &quot;The Fastest, Most Realistic Baseball Game in the World,&quot; it uses a plastic ballpark with a &quot;pitcher,&quot; &quot;batter,&quot; and &quot;catcher.&quot; The batting player uses the &quot;batter&quot; (a small metal bat attached to a spring that swings like a bat when a button is pushed) to hit a small metal ball from the &quot;pitcher&quot; (a set of three levers controlled by the pitching player that pitches the ball toward the plate and controls it) before it lands in the &quot;catcher&quot; (a pit behind home plate.)<br/><br/>If the ball is put into play, it may land in a cup, stay in the ballpark, go foul, or be hit outside. Various cups are labeled as to the result, which may be an out or an extra-base hit. If the ball is still inbounds but not in a cup, it is a single. If it leaves the ballpark, then it is a homerun.<br/><br/>The controls of the pitcher allow the ball to be shot forth at varying speeds, moved with a magnet beneath the playing field, and dropped through a trapdoor so the batter is unable to hit it. The game rules describe six different &quot;pitches&quot; that can be thrown: a fastball, change-up, curveball, screwball, slider, and sinker. The game revolves around this element of the pitcher/hitter struggle. While it is very difficult to hit any pitch but a fastball or change-up, if the batter does not swing at anything else it is a ball, as in baseball. Various deceptions by the pitcher can be employed, such as opening the trapdoor while the ball is approaching the bat then closing it at the last moment so it will be a strike.<br/><br/>",

A set normally contains one disk of each color: White, red, green, blue, yellow. Players LOSE one point for each disk not in a set.<br/><br/>Equipment: Deck of 60 cards, excluding the Trilithon cards.<br/>50 disks, 10 per color. Each disk type represents a different item type from Camelot.<br/>1 gray figure (to mark start player).<br/>1 colored figure per player.<br/><br/>Playing the Game<br/><br/>1. Starting player picks a card, from the bottom of one of the vertically arranged line of cards, adding it to his hand to make a hand size of 6.<br/>2. Going clockwise, each player picks the last card at bottom of a vertically arranged line. More than one card can be taken from the same line during a turn.<br/>3. Players simultaneously play one card and place face down.<br/>4. Players then flip their cards face up.<br/>5. Non-black card playing players go first, highest to lowest, players put their figure next to the pile of disks matching their color. In event of tie, the player closest to start player places first, then the second place player goes.<br/>6. All black card playing players then place their figures, starting with highest number and going to lowest, next to any color on the board. In event of tie, break same way as non-black card players.<br/>7. If every player is next to a unique color, each player takes a piece.<br/>8. If more than one player is next to the same pile of same colored disks, In order of highest the lowest number played next to each pile (colored card played first, then black card played after), player take and set aside disks. Players may not set aside disks from the disks they are taking.<br/>9. Player add the disks they just took (if any) and puts it into their pile of disks they took prior, or new pile in front of them, if they don't have any. It is recommended players sort their disks by color to make tracking easier. Which disks were taken prior is public knowledge. In addition, any disks they set aside to be put back, go back into the pile(s) the color(s) of the disks they are to put back. Also, if there are not enough piece to take or set aside, players take or set aside whatever they can. This means that players may take and/or set aside no disks.<br/>10. Cards are replenished, left to right (one card at a time per line), replenishing each line of cards to the number of cards equal to the number of players in the game. Cards remaining in lines that were taken slide down, and new cards back filled in so each line equals the number of players in the game. The last card dealt onto each line, is the last card in that line, and would be the last card players would take from that line in future turns.<br/>11. Each player takes back their figure.<br/><br/>Game ends when all players are unable to replenish their hands to five cards. At that point, game is over, and players total up their points. The player with the most points wins. In event of a tie, all the players who are tied look at their remaining cards in their hands. The player with the highest card wins. If two players tie, they each look for the next highest card. Continue until one player has a card that is greater than their opponent. That player wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each cheese card also offers a special ability:<br/><br/>     Runny Cheese - While this card is in play, your wine card may not be moved or stolen.<br/>     Sharp Cheese - While this card is in play, you draw 2 cards (instead of just 1) when you survive a Drink Challenge.<br/>     Stinky Cheese - While this card is in play, you may not refuse a Drink Challenge nor may a Drink Challenge issued by you be refused.<br/><br/><br/>Each player can only have one Cheese card in front of her at a time.<br/><br/>The expansion also adds three cheese-related Action cards: The Cat's Eaten It! (discard a Cheese card in play), The Cheese Stands Alone (discard all other players' Cheese cards), and Rats! (steal a Cheese card from another player).<br/><br/>This expansion contains 18 cards:<br/><br/>     3 Runny Cheese cards<br/>     3 Sharp Cheese cards<br/>     3 Stinky Cheese cards<br/>     3 The Cat's Eaten It! action cards<br/>     3 The Cheese Stands Alone action cards<br/>     3 Rats! action cards<br/><br/><br/>",

These visions so troubled the Primus that she created the Explorer Corps, a division of ComStar dedicated to probing the Deep Periphery, to hunt down the threat she had foreseen.<br/><br/>A century later, the Clan invasion made the nightmare come true - and gave the Explorer Corps a vital role in the Inner Sphere's survival. With the backing of the Draconis Combine, the Explorer Corps has expanded its operations and embarked on a massive hunt for the Clan homeworlds. Small mercenary units from all over the Inner Sphere are joining the search, hired by the Explorer Corps for secret missions into the Deep Periphery - missions from which few return...<br/><br/>The Explorer Corps sourcebook describes the Explorer Corps' history and structure, including key personalities, operational procedures, and the Corps' efforts to locate the Clan homeworlds before the Truce of Tukayyid expires. Also included is background material on life aboard a 31st-century spacecraft and descriptions of various colonies and Clan bases in the Deep Periphery and other inhabitants of that little-known region of space. Special game rules for BattleTech, MechWarrior, and BattleSpace are designed to enhance campaigns involving space travel or planetary exploration; new material includes rules for creating new solar systems and planets to explore, as well as new types of vehicles and 'Mechs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Number of players: 3&ndash;4<br/><br/>Object of the game: Have enough control of player-colored disks on the outer rings of the board to draw them into the inner ring. First to 4 disks of his or her color (out of 7) on the inner ring wins...<br/><br/>Equipment: Each player is a color. Choose a color to be neutral. Players need: The board, 10 disks per player (separate into 7 and 3), a figure for each player, 6 bars of a neutral color (separate into 3 and 3), 9 disks of the neutral color, the figure of the neutral color, the gray figure, and the deck (without trilithon cards).<br/><br/>During a player&rsquo;s turn, he has 1 of 3 actions that he can take:<br/><br/>- Move as many neutral disks from a single inside cup. Take the disks into your hand. You will replace them after taking an action or two. For each disk taken in hand, you may move a component in the corresponding section to the left or right 1 space. You may move any component even if it is not your color. You may use multiple energy disks to affect a single component or spread them out as you wish. You may move the component into a new section, but cannot continue to affect it this turn (since it is in a different section, and disks from a certain cup only affect the corresponding section).<br/><br/>If you a place component onto a spot that is occupied, the component on the spot is moved either left, right, in, or out 1 space as per your choice (no more out than the outer track, no more in than the inner track. Again, it is possible to push a component to another section). It is possible that moving the component pushes it into another occupied space, in which case, repeat the above process until there is no conflict.<br/><br/>After using all disks in a cup that you want, take the disks that are in the hand and place them into different cups that the one they originated from. You may place the disks into inside OR outside cups, and you can split them up as you choose (all in one cup or split into multiple cups, etc.). This is supposed to represent energy conversion, which is necessary for casting a spell<br/><br/>- Move as many outside energy disks as you want (regardless of the section they are in). Likewise, take them into hand first, and after taking an action per disk, replace them in different cups than the one(s) from which they originated.<br/><br/>For each disk moved, you may move your figure, the neutral figure, or the gray figure 1, 5, or 20 spaces in either direction as long the figure is in the section the disk was in. You may use multiple disks on a single figure (i.e., move a figure 20 spaces using a disk in one cup, and then another 2 spaces using 2 disks from a different cup. If you move the figure onto a space occupied by another figure, both figures simply occupy the same spot (nothing special).<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s movement, but you can also move components using the outer cups. If yours, the neutral&rsquo;s, or the grey figure is on the inner track on the same space as a component, you may use an energy disk from an outside cup to pull the component in 1 space, or push it out 1 space. If you push/pull a disk into another, the disk is displaced as described above. If a disk is pulled down to the inner track, it gets pulled to the space the figure is on<br/><br/>- Take any 2 neutral disks and put them into your hand. You may take these 2 from the same or different cups. Just before your next turn, place them in any cup or cups of your choice.<br/><br/>For recap, the 3 actions are: a) take as many energy disks from a single inside cup, b) take as many energy disks as you want from outside cups, or c) take 2 disks off the board for a turn.<br/><br/>As a special bonus, if a component of your color gets to the inner track, you may place one of your 3 extra disks on any cup of your choice. This counts as a disk that only you may use. When you use it, move it as any other disk in a cup. Also, once a component is on the inner track, it cannot be moved and no other component may move to that spot. Figures may ignore it for the sake of movement, and just move on top of it or through it.<br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>When a player has gotten 4 of the 7 components into the inner track, he casts the spell, and thus wins. For a shorter game, play to 3 of the 7 components.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carrier based starfighter combat.<br/><br/>Fighter-Tac is a deeply strategic card game for two players. Each player is in command of a massive warship called a Battle-Carrier, and each uses a customized deck of cards called the Flight-Deck. The goal of the game is to use your Fighters and other cards in your Flight-Deck to destroy your opponent's Battle-Carrier, before he or she destroys yours.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of drawing cards from your Flight-Deck on your turn, then spending Resource Cards (Fuel, Energy and Ammo) to launch Fighters and shoot their weapons in an attemp to destroy the opponents Battle-Carrier. The Flight-Deck also contains other cards to aid in the fight, such as Skill Patches for your pilots, Refits for your Fighters, Modules that upgrade your Carrier, and even Support ships to increase your firepower or defense. Resources must spent to play these other cards as well.<br/><br/>There are various kinds of Fighters at your disposal: Interceptors, Assault Fighters and Bombers are just a few. Each has their own strengths and weaknesses. Knowing when to attack with which Fighter is vital to winning the game.<br/><br/>Using your Resources, dice rolls, and other cards in your deck, your goal is to get your Fighters across the Combat Zone to the opponent's Battle-Carrier so they can make attack runs in an attempt to destroy it. Your opponent will send out Fighters to try to intercept and destroy yours as well. Any of your Fighters that make it through will be able to attempt an attack run on the enemy Battle-Carrier. Each Battle-Carrier has a limited amount of Armor Points. Once the enemy Battle-Carrier's Armor Points are depleted, it is destroyed and you win!<br/><br/>A combination of deck construction, Fighter tactics, and using your Resource Cards wisely is the key to victory. Resources can give a Fighter or a Pilot strengths and abilities that can win the day over the enemy. They can also be used to make your Battle-Carrier more efficient and deadly as well, thus increasing its chances for survival, and increasing your chances to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Yes, I said Hungarian Paratroopers!! This battle is the one fight where the Hungarian paratroopers actually did a combat drop. Ok this is not 100% historically accurate, the landing was unopposed and the Hungarians marched into battle but still somewhat captures the action of a bridge capture. Uses boards 23 and 49 and is medium sized.<br/><br/>FE 51 Wolf Pack in the Hills: Many of you have been clamoring for a good ambush scenario. Ok maybe one of you, but here is a cool situation. An Italian convoy moves across the board 50 hill and runs into a Partisan ambush. Partisans basically have to annihilate the convoy, while the Italians basically have to survive.<br/><br/>FE 52 With Friends Like These: Set on boards 32 and 50 this scenario features the Italians (actually Albanians serving for Italy) fighting the Bulgarians. A nice tourney sized scenario the Italians have to capture some buildings from the defending Bulgarians.<br/><br/>FE 53 Operation Braun: This is the meatiest of the bunch with a large Partisan force defending against Croatian troops backed up by some armor. Set on boards 41 and 50, the Croatians have to capture some buildings. Tough to accomplish against stone buildings.<br/><br/>FE 54 Dubrovnik 2: This is an interesting one set on board 48. Attacking Croatian troops have to kick out a small Partisan force from the village. Then they have defend against a counterattacking force. The victory conditions are tied around holding buildings, with fortified buildings (which can be made during play) counting for more VP. A smaller sized scenario that should allow for some good replay.<br/><br/>FE 55 Friends No More: Here is cool scenario set on boards 4, 8 and FE1 (free for download from my website, for use with VASL). Germans and Rumanians try to control a bridge with the Germans having to get some VP over the bridge. Again, another smaller tourney sized scenario.<br/><br/>FE 56 Covering the Retreat: This is a medium sized scenario set on boards w and 18. Defending Germans get some armor including French tanks and have to defend against a tidal wave, well a small wave of Russian combined arms. Germans try to hold onto a building or 3.<br/><br/>FE 57 War Without End: Defending Germans with some Italian tanks and assault guns defend the board 12 village from very powerful British armored troops crossing the board 50 hill mass. The Germans who are very brittle try to keep a hold of a building or two while the Brits race against time.<br/><br/>FE 58 The End is in Sight: A medium sized scenario featuring Croatian infantry and armor trying to break through a Partisan blocking force. Set on boards 10 and 44. This is another one of those scenarios featuring vehicles from Armies of Oblivion; another example of the vast amount of scenarios that can now be played with ASL.<br/><br/>FE 59 But We&rsquo;re Not Quite There!: Once again a tired Croatian armor and infantry force, this time smaller due to previous battles tries to blast through a Partisan blocking force. This is another tourney-sized scenario set on board 45.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a hand of character cards which represent key players in the &quot;Amelio Tale.&quot; These cards provide tiles and special power tokens for placement on the board.<br/><br/>Tiles denote a number or symbol on each side. When a tile is first placed on the grid it automatically attacks all of its neighbors (if the number/symbol is greater on the attacking tile, the attack is successful). Some tiles are considered &quot;scoring&quot; and the majority of the game revolves around capturing and recapturing them.<br/><br/>There are only 15 spaces on the grid to lay tiles so games are typically fairly short (10-15 minutes).

This action, set on boards 50, 48 and 44 is a race for the board edge as a fleeing Polish column including tanks, tankettes, cavalry and infantry try to fight their way past a blocking force of Russian tanks with reinforcing infantry.<br/><br/>FE 15 Contested Landing, May 1940: The German invasion of the west is on. The elite German paratroopers attack using a novel approach to war, the vertical envelopment. But not all goes well at the Waalhaven Airfield. This close-run action features both gliders and paratroopers trying to capture the board 14 airfield against Belgian Infantry and AA Guns. Also uses board 13.<br/><br/>FE 16 Where the Bullet Meets the Bone, November 1941: The former Yugoslavia was a dangerous place for the Axis. Partisans were everywhere. In this action set in November 1941, Tito's Partisans, using captured tankettes try to kick the Italian Garrison out of the board 48 village.<br/><br/>FE 17 Philippine Scouts at Mabatang, January 1942: The battle of Bataan would prove two things; that the Japanese soldier was much better than the propaganda said and the Philippine Scouts were a tough breed. In this night action, the Japanese assault a fortified line of Scouts protected by wire, mortars &amp; SP on boards 16 and 17.<br/><br/>FE 18 The Bear Battalion Attacks, September, 1942: Guadalcanal with all its horror is featured in this night action between the dug in marines and the best the Japanese army has to offer. The Japanese must break through the Marine line and capture Henderson Field on board 38.<br/><br/>FE 19 Lemon Bridge, July 1943: Summer 1943 was a hot time in the Mediterranean. This all-infantry scenario pits the British attacking across boards 16 and 44 to capture some key buildings against the infantry of the Hermann Goering Division.<br/><br/>FE 20 Collision Course, September 1943: This action occurs in the Salerno Bridgehead. Two strong forces smash into each other on board 46 and 11. Both American and German combined arms square off in a fight to the finish.<br/><br/>FE 21 Tiger of Vitebsk, December 1943: The Tiger of Vitebsk, Albert Ernst is featured in this battle from which he earned his sobriquet. In this action three Hornets ambush an attacking force of Russian infantry and tanks. Can the Germans repeat their success where the Tiger killed 14 tanks with 21 shots? The deadly 88's will help! This scenario uses boards 18, 19, 44 and 46.<br/><br/>FE 22 Rampage at Ritpong, May 1944: Despite frequent complaints from the Americans about the slow pace of the Chinese army this battle showed what an aggressive Chinese force could achieve. This action features the Chinese conducting a successful assault against a fortified Japanese village on the road to Mytchinka. This scenario uses boards 32, 36, 38 and 39.<br/><br/>FE 23 Operation Spring, July 1944: Operation Goodwood was a bloody failure for the Allies. The SS troops atop Bourguebus Ridge had stopped the British attack. Operation Spring followed up Goodwood and threw the Canadians at the same ridge adding more bodies and burning wrecks to the battlefield. Can the Canadians break through the board 2 hills across boards 19 and 44?<br/><br/>FE 24 An Unconventional Attack, March 8-9, 1945: It wasnt often that the armor was called upon to attack at night but such was the desperate measures of the German army late in 1945. In this action a lot of heavy metal is called upon to clear dug in Russian defenders from the board 2 hill.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the company website)<br/><br/>The British invasions of the Rio de la Plata were a series of unsuccessful attempts to seize control of the Spanish colonies located around the La Plata Basin in South America (today part of Argentina and Uruguay). The invasions took place between 1806 and 1807, as part of the Napoleonic Wars, when Spain was an ally of France.  The invasions occurred in two phases. A detachment from the British Army occupied Buenos Aires for 46 days in 1806 before being expelled. In 1807, a second force occupied Montevideo, remaining for several months, and a third force made a second attempt to take Buenos Aires. After several days of street-fighting against the local militia and Spanish colonial army, in which half of the British forces were killed or wounded, the British were forced to withdraw.<br/><br/>THE WATERS OF OBLIVION is an operational level wargame of the British attempt to conquer the River Plate area in 1806-1807.  There are two players in each game. One player controls Spanish and Platense forces, the other commands the British forces.  The game uses a simple, but realistic, system to model Napoleonic operations at this scale. Basically, each player's turn consists of the following components:<br/><br/><br/>     Reinforcement: Place new units on the map.<br/>     Siege: attempt to reduce enemy fortresses by using siege units.<br/>     Movement: attempt to move friendly forces by using the March Table; (since command control in this area was limited at best, movement itself can be problematic).<br/>     Combat: friendly forces adjacent to enemy forces may attack them.<br/>     Logistics: out of supply units may be removed from the map.<br/><br/><br/>",

There were two battles outside this tiny Missouri town, one in 1862 as the Confederacy sought to tap the agricultural produce and mineral resources of the surrounding region, and another in late 1864 when Sterling Price&rsquo;s Army of Missouri sought a brief rest during its retreat after the Battle of Westport. Each scenario exemplifies a different tactical situation.<br/><br/>I Newtonia shows a Federal &ldquo;demonstration&rdquo; against the town. A &ldquo;Demonstration&rdquo;, in Civil War parlance, is a threatened attack on a stronger enemy which doesn&rsquo;t actually intend to get heavily involved. Demonstrations are economy of force missions, occupying a larger enemy to support other operations. Here, a &ldquo;Demonstration&rdquo; simply reminds the Confederates that there was an active opponent in the areas.<br/><br/>II Newtonia is a classic delaying action. Both armies are fatigued and at the limit of battle worthiness. In addition, Confederate morale was low because of their defeat at Westport, lack of food and absence of any meaningful time to rest. The Federal army is buoyed up by their victory, but is equally tired and hungry.&quot;<br/><br/>",

But it is easy to design your own track.<br/><br/>Main goal of design is speed of play (faster than other games, ref. Formula D) but still with as much simulation as possible. You must set your gearbox (6 gears) prior to race, select tire type and spoiler. On the track your stamina, tire wear, and fuel weight will have an impact on your driving. There are no &quot;artificial&quot; rules to the game, only rules reflecting real racing.<br/><br/>The name Next Generation is based on a couple of innovative design mechanisms, never seen before. Most significant is the lack of spaces on track to control movement. Instead you gain distance by adding chips, or cubes, or similar to your pool. With no spaces to count, you finish your turn almost instantly.<br/><br/>A Print and Play (15 pages) simulation. You find the files here in BoardGameGeek file section.

When this is no longer possible, it is the turn of their opponent. The game ends after a player has placed their last pawn. This player is the winner and receives an amount of points corresponding to the opponent&rsquo;s remaining pawns.

Players roll custom animal dice to determine which animals are in the lanes ahead, then decide which lane to swerve into, rolling dice to see if they hit or miss the animal in the new lane.  Each round has the players in a different turn order and each players' choice can affect the other players by removing available options.  The animals are assigned a point value from 1 to 6 and the players roll six sided dice to see if they can roll a number equal to or greater than the animal's value.

This player chooses a card, and passes the cards around the table, so that there are a dwindling number of choices. As players collect sets, these are played in to clear space in a player's hand. Each player has a hand-limit of 5 cards. If any player exceeds the number of cards he can hold, the team is defeated. If all 72 cards are either held (without exceeding hand-limit) or presented in sets, all players win.<br/><br/>MICROBADGE NOW ABAILABLE!<br/> Nova's Ark Fan<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box:<br/>Contents: 4 boards with perforations, 126 banknotes, 10 fixed cards, 4 insurance policies, 80 random cards, 80 pegs, 1 die.<br/>The purpose of the game is to trade goods in such a way that you can keep your business going, avoid bankruptcy, if possible make a profit and become the foremost firm on the market. Each player has a business, in other words a board with columns for 6 kinds of goods, and a starting capital of $100,000. Each player buys one kind of goods. There are 6 different kinds of goods with various prices. Before a player can buy one kind of goods he must throw a certain number on the dice. When he does so, he can go ahead and buy a maximum of three units of the chosen kind of goods. If the player throws a smaller number, he must then take a card from the pack of random cards and follow the instructions. These can be helpful or unhelpful. Once a player has several kinds of goods he can start selling and by doing so try to make a profit. However, he can sell only goods of one kind each time, and only - as with buying - when he throws the right number on the dice. Once he has thrown this number the bank gives him  the specified selling price which contains a certain profit margin. If the player throws a smaller number, he may not sell and must draw a random card whose instructions he must follow.<br/>What makes the game exciting is that all the players have the chance to bid for goods being bought or sold. In other words, when goods are being bought each player can make his own bid and acquire the goods. The same applies to selling. The specified selling price can be undercut, giving the player an opportunity to find a buyer for his goods. But remember: the purpose is still to make a profit in the end.<br/>The winner is the player who reaches the topmost square with his goods. The other players then count up their capital (goods and money) and work out their relative positions on the market.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The original Pentathlon of the ancient Olympic Games were based on the ideal soldier of the time, skilled in running, jumping, wrestling, and throwing (javelin and discus).  Thus Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the founder of the modern Olympic games, invented the Modern Pentathlon based on the ideal soldier of his time, recreating the experience of a 19th century cavalry soldier behind enemy lines: running, swimming, riding, and fighting (with pistol and sword).  In the vein of Reiner Knizia's Decathlon, this is a collection of dice games loosely based off the real-life events.<br/><br/>The five events capture a wide spectrum dice game mechanics, including push-your-luck, calculated risks, bluffing, and set collection.  Players who have read Dr. Knizia's book Dice Games Properly Explained will find the events draw upon various traditional games, but combine and develop their mechanics to place more emphasis on decisions than luck.  For example, in the 200m Freestyle Swimming and Pistol Shooting events, players may continually purchase rerolls to mitigate bad luck but should consider the trade-off of how much that would benefit their opponents.  In Epee Fencing, players always have exactly 7 points to allocate each round, and so the event is more about bluff and discerning their opponent's actions.<br/><br/>",

This is our second of five battles in the Jackson Valley Campaign of 1862 and the sixth battle in our series of the American Civil Wargames in 3D.<br/><br/>Historically Front Royal was minor action before the First Battle of Winchester, but what if both sides had committed their forces here and this minor action had escalated. This is a battle that could have easily happened.<br/><br/>Front Royal initially has a time limit of 14 bounds in which the Confederates must achieve their task objective. Its design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 1 to 2 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavor of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game, keep the chain of command together and everything is fine, lose it and it could cost you the game?<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally, this takes a little more time to construct but it is well worth the effort for the impressive game board you get at its completion. The final 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.<br/><br/>",

Every village, every town has its own team.<br/><br/>WHAT IS QWIK?<br/>To learn about the game you must first learn about the people that play it, the Qwikers. Qwikers come in all size, age, and sex. If you can play, you can find a team. Each team is made up of: <br/>Drivers - Drivers use their two-handed weapons to knock their opponents out of the match, literally.<br/><br/>Chain - Swinging metal chains their objective is to protect their Qwik by keeping opponents at bay.<br/><br/>Qwik - Only the Qwik can touch the dog skull. The objective of the Qwik is to fight his way through the opposing team and stick the skull on the opponent's stake, winning the match.<br/><br/>You start as the player-manager of a team in the Heart of the Wasteland. Win matches and you get famous, lose matches and the team will disband. Gain better matches until you win your way to the Cities where it's a pie in the sky life and you want your piece!<br/><br/>But playing Qwik is not without its dangers. Break a bone, lose a limb and yes maybe even die. What happens when you can&rsquo;t play anymore? Your team leaves you behind and finds a replacement. <br/>HEY, WE NEVER SAID IT WOULD BE EASY!<br/><br/>Inside you'll find:<br/>&bull;    A full color Qwik field and counters to play your matches.<br/>&bull;    Rules to create your individual Qwikers and build your team. <br/>&bull;    Nineteen pre-generated Qwik teams to play against.<br/>&bull;    Three different Locales to play in from the harsh Heart of the Wasteland to the luxurious Cities. <br/>&bull;    Campaign rules that cover every aspect of the sport.<br/><br/>Your time grows short as you make your way towards the field for your first match. All the training and the pain that you endured to make it here, you hope that it will serve you and your team well. The crowd roars as you, the Qwik, stride to the center of the field. You look across the dirt into the eyes of your opponent, a man as desperate as you. Gong! The game starts, welcome to hell.<br/><br/>Qwik is fully compatible with All Things Zombie, 5150 and other THW games. Can you play a game of Qwik using your characters from other THW games? Yes you can!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 2021. Environmental upheavals, accelerated resource depletion, and escalating warfare have destabilized world politics past the point of no return. Political alliances have long since dissolved as each power block struggles for survival. In this declining world, technological advancement has ground to a halt, while the world&rsquo;s armed forces make do with the weapons available from bygone decades.  You enter this desperate struggle for survival as the leader of one of the six remaining factions.<br/><br/>Game Design<br/><br/>Global Domination uses the &quot;deck Building&quot; game mechanic used by some popular recent games like Dominion.<br/><br/>Deck building is very cool. It takes all the good and none of the bad from collectible card games. In a deck building game, you lay out the different types of cards on the table, and everyone starts with the same handful of cards. As the game plays, you get to select which cards on the table you wish to add to your individual deck, thus creating your own means of winning the game.   To add an additional decision point, deck building games might come with 20 card types in the box, but you randomly select 12 for any given game. Figuring out the best strategy based on the cards in play, and what your opponents are doing is the challenge.<br/><br/>Global Domination has an Axis and Allies level of difficulty, so it is easily playable by new people or experienced gamers. Each game lasts about 1 to 2 hours and supports 2 to 6 players.  The game also plays very intensely because a game only lasts 6 turns. This means that everyone knows they have to make each turn count.<br/><br/>You score points at the end of each of the 6 game turns, so game play is very intense.<br/><br/>",

The basic game mechanism is a kind of reverse werewolf/mafia game where the secret character, The Doctor, is the only person who can&rsquo;t kill anyone and has to survive on wits and confusion alone.<br/><br/>Background: (Or buy the DVD and watch it!)<br/>Human soldiers and the mysterious headless monks are working together in an uneasy alliance. They have kidnapped The Doctor&rsquo;s companion (Amy Pond) and taken her to the asteroid know a Demon&rsquo;s Run. The Doctor arrives on the asteroid disguised as one of the monks but reveals himself and demands Amy&rsquo;s return. The lights go out and then back on, all orchestrated by the doctor, of course. Now the soldiers are stood there facing the monks. The soldiers know that one of the monks is their feared enemy, The Doctor, determined to foil their plans. All they have to do is to work out which monk is The Doctor in disguise and shoot him before he escapes. But if they shoot the wrong monk they will feel the wrath of their allies and be killed themselves by the monks dying blast. The monks themselves know that the soldiers are trigger happy and might shoot them. It might be best for them to zap any of the trigger happy soldiers before they themselves are killed - at least the other soldiers would know that they were a monk and not The Doctor. But the monks&rsquo; plan needs the soldiers and if they lose all of their soldiers then their plans will fail and The Doctor will triumph. The soldiers and monks need to act quickly before The Doctor is able to escape. The scene is set for the Demon&rsquo;s Run Standoff.<br/><br/>The Game:<br/>The players take on the role of soldiers, headless monks and The Doctor through a series of standoffs. During each standoff: the soldiers try to kill The Doctor; the monks try to direct the soldiers to The Doctor, and The Doctor just tries to survive. At the end of the standoff, points are given to players whose characters are still alive.<br/><br/>",

Play time for a full game of 50 points is usually less than an hour.<br/><br/>Players are pirates who vie for the position of Captain on a pirate ship.  To to this, players must roll their dice to assemble sets that first match the number on the &quot;Crew Dice&quot; which represent the Cabin Boy, Ship's Cook, and First Mate.  This becomes more challenging as there are limited spaces on the boat for dice sets to be placed, and the first player can change throughout the game.<br/><br/>The game is normally continued until one player scores 30 to 50 points, when the player with the most points overall is dubbed the new Captain of the ship.<br/><br/>Keel-Hauled has been discontinued, and is no longer available at The Game Crafter website.<br/><br/>",

The name comes from the the L-type shape that the movement of pieces resemble during their turn.<br/><br/>Play is similar to regular Backgammon, except that spaces on the board can totally block the movement of enemy pieces, unless doubles are rolled.  In addition, pieces start off the board in a reserve, and enter the board through a player's a home space, as game progresses.  Besides this, when pieces are hit, they are sent back to the reserve area, rather than a bar (L-Gammon doesn't utilize a bar).  A player only bears off pieces when they have none in their reserve.<br/><br/>The game has the feel of regular backgammon, but the 2 dimensions adds increased tactical considerations.<br/><br/>",

Ties are resolved by playing another round, with the eventual winner collecting all of the acumulated cards.  Wild Cards win a round automatically.<br/><br/>After each round the die is passed along and rounds are played until one player has won all of the other cards.<br/><br/>The game came packaged with two Monster in My Pocket collectible figures ('The Beast' and 'Witch').<br/><br/>",

Something dark and terrible that has been hidden for eons in forgotten cr&egrave;ches locked in a stasis of bloody dreams of conquest.<br/><br/>The Overlords are awakening from their deep slumber and returning to the planet&rsquo;s surface once again! The Gray servants of the Skvani are gathering their Tripod War Machines! The future of Mars bears dark days of war!<br/><br/>WTNW is more than just a Victorian Science Fiction Game. It is a springboard for imagination and a high-level game of tactics and battles set amongst a 'what if' world inspired by the classic authors of Victorian Science Fiction and Retro Science Fiction.  In WTNW, players take the reins and command massive armies of men, fantastic beasts and steam-driven vehicles of leviathan proportions.  In the end, the thunder that cascades across the battlefield to settle in the souls of the fighting men will only be assuaged with the assistance of the landship.<br/><br/>This Conflict on Mars supplement is not a stand-alone game. You will require the full version of When the Navy Walked, Second Edition, to play the game.

A number of letter dice are rolled and a timer is started. Players now take turns putting a die into the grid, trying to fill it in a way that words appear on their side. This should be done as fast as possible, as the game is timed. When all dice have been placed, the remaining time starts running for both players. They now have some time to note down as many words as possible that are contained in their grid. If a player thinks s/he has found all possible words, s/he can end his/her turn early for bonus points. Each word counts the number of letters used. The player with most points is the winner.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the game that introduces a unique concept of custodial trapping pieces and delaying their capture until a later turn. It is playable using a regular chess board and some of the pieces from a regular chess pieces, which start on the board in a set configuration.  Since its launch, several other games by the same author have appeared which borrowed from the concept.  These games include Crossing Stonehenge and King's Crossing.<br/><br/>In the game, players will end up trapping one or more pieces in a line between two of their own pieces.  These pieces are then frozen and are not able to move.  After this, a piece bookending the pieces will end up moving and occupying the space of one of the pieces it traps and removing it from the board.<br/><br/>Players win the game by either capturing the enemy Commander piece or getting their own Commander across the board.<br/><br/>",

Clash of Empires  is a full colour, hardcover book  Here are some key features:<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>We mainly play with 28mm figures but the rules are adaptable to 15mm and 20mm armies as well.<br/><br/>For a typical sized game of Clash of Empires, number of models will vary by army &ndash; our own Carthaginian army has 155 men and our Early Imperial Romans 125 men.<br/><br/>There will be plenty of dice to roll.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is: Orders Phase, Movement Phase, Shooting Phase, Hand-to-hand Phase and Combat Outcomes Phase.<br/><br/>SOLDIERS OF ANTIQUITY<br/><br/>Troops&rsquo; profiles are:                                                                                                                Movement Rate; Shoot; Attacks; Hand-to-Hand; Defence; Kill; Hits; Discipline; MoralE.<br/><br/>Troop morale is vital but troop discipline is a separate characteristic and can be just as important.<br/><br/>Units have profiles to determine how good they are but may also have Unit Special Rules such as Cantabrian Circle (Skythians), Expert Swordsmen (e.g. Legionaries) and Shieldwall (e.g. Saxon infantry) to name a few.<br/><br/>Different weapons are well represented according to their historical uses - the pilum is used as a thrown weapon before combat disrupting the enemy formation, and the pike enables more attacks but suffers if the unit is pushed back in combat.<br/><br/>ARMY LISTS<br/><br/>Army lists are very expansive and you choose your unit size by individual models within set minimums and maximums (e.g. a Roman auxiliary infantry unit has 10-30 models in it).<br/><br/>Units within the army list are 'flavoured' for that period so that a Roman Legionary is different to a Viking Hirdman, rather than both being superior Heavy Infantry.<br/><br/>Generals and other characters command, they are not super killing machines. This can be a good excuse to do diorama bases for your leaders if you are so inclined.<br/><br/>Clash of Empires even has a use for those casualty figures you never painted!<br/><br/>THE RULEBOOK<br/><br/>In the rulebook will be lists for the Early Imperial Romans and its enemies in the west &ndash; Ancient Germans, Ancient British, Caledonians and Dacians.<br/><br/>The first army list book will cover Early Achaemenid Persia to the death of Alexander.<br/><br/>Many army lists will be free to download from the web. They will be official but will be living lists reviewed by us and the wargaming community.  Some of these will go to print but many will stay on the website as free downloads.<br/><br/>The rulebook also contains rules for four different scenarios including elements such as terrain placement, terrain types, army initiative and flanking manoeuvres.<br/><br/>",

This game has been entered in the 2nd NESTORTILES game design contest.<br/><br/>Players are architects who construct buildings over three rounds. The player who lays out the best plan and builds the most appealing structure to the proper height at the right time will win.<br/><br/>Each turn, players either draw a new tile, exchange two of their tiles for two new tiles or play a tile from their hand to their board.  Tiles must be placed adjacent to another tile already on the board; a tile placed on top of another tile must be a higher number; a tile cannot be the same color or number as the tile immediate beneath it or any adjacent tile.<br/><br/>Round 1 ends when one player has 6 tiles on their board, round 2 ends with 10 tiles and round 3 ends with 14 tiles.  After every round, points are scored according to the number of dots visible on a player's board, points are lost for tiles still in hand and bonus points are added for tiles at the level of the round that just ended.  For example, at the end of round 1 players earn 1 point per tile at level 1.  The bonuses have the potential to score much higher after rounds 2 and 3.  At the end of the game, players earn a bonus by squaring the highest level on which they have a tile (e.g. having a tile at level 5 earns a bonus of 25 points).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction<br/><br/>You are the Bretwalda, rulers of Anglo Saxon England. It is 400AD and Britain is on the brink of a power vacuum as Rome looks to leave these shores and defend her empire closer to home. Foreign invaders, like the Picts, Scots, Vikings and Saxons, will take advantage and claim this land for their own. Romano-British rule is coming to and end and we are at the dawn of the Anglo-Saxon era. You must defend the Anglo-Saxon heptarchy from these foreign invaders and quash the rebellious Britons. But history is written and there is an ever looming threat. In 1066, William Duke of Normandy became king of all England and ended the Anglo-Saxon era once and for all. Can you make this land your own before the Norman invasion?<br/><br/>Seofan, the Anglo-Saxons board game, is a game for 1 to 4 players. You progress through the game from 400AD to 1066AD. Your Bretwalda will travel the seven kingdoms of England along roads like the great Fosse Way, Ermine Street and Watling Street, seeking to control towns by building forts (to exercise your military might), monasteries (to convert the pagan settlers), mints (a source of wealth), and burhs (Anglo-Saxon settlements of power). You will use warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders to settle and defend the kingdoms, and resource cards to fund your settlement, your armies, your church and your economy. Each turn your Bretwalda can take actions to travel the seven kingdoms, to enact great battles, to convert pagan settlers, to trade, and to build your realm.<br/><br/>Game events will be throwing unexpected surprises at you as you proceed through each decade, like the legend of Arthur, the writings of the Venerable Bede, the Viking invasions, the revolutionary laws of Aethelberht, Offa and Ine, or the glorious coronation of King Alfred the Great. These events may be your saviour, or they may signal your downfall. All the while, rebellious uprisings can cause the level of civil unrest to rise. Can you conquer and control the seven kingdoms before the level of civil unrest explodes, and rewrite history by building a permanent Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman invasion of 1066?<br/><br/>Overview of Gameplay<br/><br/>The game can be played solo or co-operatively, with 1 to 4 players.<br/><br/>The game board shows a map of the seven kingdoms of England (Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia, Essex, Sussex, Kent and Wessex), and the towns of those kingdoms in which you will settle, battle, trade and rule. These towns are linked by roads along which the players (and invaders!) can travel.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken into distinct phases. In the Draw phase you draw resource cards from a resource deck into your hand. In the Actions phase each player has 4 actions which they can use in a variety of ways: they can spend resource cards to place red, green, yellow and blue blocks (representing warriors, farmers, missionaries and traders) across the towns of the seven kingdoms; they can build mints, forts, monasteries and burhs; they can travel the map from town to town, repelling invaders and rebels (represented by black blocks); they can trade or crusade or appease local unrest, and progress through the game by adding a decade to the game calendar. During the Conflict phase you resolve battles between your warriors and the pagans. During the Rebellion phase you draw cards from a rebellion deck, which determines in which towns the locals are rebelling against your rule (and more black blocks appear). Finally, in the Progress phase, you can advance the game time through the seven eras from 400AD to 1066AD, and an event card is drawn to re-enact real events from history on the game board. You can choose to progress more slowly, giving you more time to build and settle and defend the realm, but when you do the level of civil unrest will rise too. As you progress through the game you progress through time, and real events from history will throw up surprises - some good (like a great coronation feast), and some bad (like a mutinous group of mercenaries).<br/><br/>To win the game you must control all seven kingdoms. To control a kingdom you must repel, defeat, convert or settle all black blocks in the kingdom and build one of each type of special building (fort, monastery, mint, and burh). This allows you to place a celtic cross in the kingdom and cement your rule. The special buildings can only be built by settling your warriors, missionaries, farmers and traders in the towns on the game board. You must do all this before the level of civil unrest rises (through out of control rebellions and invasions) and before the Norman invasion of 1066.<br/><br/>",

Bottles can be exchanged for money at the supermarket, while trash can earn special action cards to be used with additional movement or rolls of the dice. Best of all is the Schadenfreude you'll feel when you dispose of trash in another player's garbage bag!<br/><br/>Players earn bonuses for every area cleaned, and in the end the balance of your savings accounts determines who wins.<br/><br/>",

Forty-two connection cards are laid face-up on the table (grouped as desired by the players), along with multipliers of value 2, 3 and 4.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can play cards from his hand to create any of the connections on a card. The player can simultaneously rearrange cards on the table to create new compounds, using the multiplier cards as needed to create molecules like O2 or H2O. If you leave element cards on the table, you must pick them up, but your hand limit is three cards; should you need to pick up more, those extra cards will count against you at the end of the game. A player's score is the sum of compound cards claimed and noble gas cards collected, minus penalties from dead cards collected during play.<br/><br/>The second game is &quot;Chemuno&quot;, with all of the cards being shuffled together and each player receiving a hand of seven. The first player lays a card on the table; the next player must lay down a compound, element or multiplier that &quot;matches&quot; this first card. (A compound must use an identical element as a compound on the table or use the element or multiplier present, and so on.) If the previous card was a multiplier, the next player must draw 2-4 cards (equal to the mutiplier value) unless she can play the same multiplier herself, thereby doubling the penalty for the next player. The first player to run out of cards wins.<br/><br/>",

In this game, two players take turns drawing and placing cards, and construct a gridwork of tracks on the table over which their commuters and other pieces navigate.<br/><br/>The game uses 2 decks of ordinary playing cards, though more (or I guess fewer) could be done. Each player has a chess king representing his &quot;commuter&quot; and several checkers that act as blockers.<br/><br/>One player is &quot;black&quot; the other &quot;red&quot;. The players simply take turns drawing cards from the deck, and the player whose color matches the card chooses how to use it. The cards can be used to build a road grid, or to move your commuter, or a blocker. You can only move your commuter onto a card by discarding a drawn card with an equal or higher number. Thus, players try to use high cards either to hinder the opponent's moves, or to move their own commuter. Low cards are used to build out one's own road grid.<br/><br/>",

You begin in an ancient Castle, which represents the 9 steps of brewing your Transmogrification Potion. While you race through the halls to complete your concoction, the bewitched game board works against you by counting down precious hours. Each revolution (as it passes the 24 hour mark), your grades are collectively lowered one level, and continue to spiral downwards towards &ldquo;Failure&rdquo; the longer you take. You must split your actions between moving through the 9 steps of your potion (the further you get, the faster time counts), casting basic spells (powerful, but they can harm you), rewinding time (strategically use this to gain grades back) and fighting Cryptids (a selfish action testing the strength of your Potion and thus raising your individual grade). Roll the dice, move your markers, and choose an action. Work together to complete this dastardly exam, but only one student will prevail, leaving with the knowledge that could save you all. Will it be you?<br/><br/>x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x<br/><br/>Finally, there is a bonus educational element to the game.  One of the dice used can be replaced with any self-provided questions (homework, trivia cards, flash cards...), anything about any topic that you can answer quickly.  If you get it correct, you get to perform an action this turn, incorrect and you must wait until your next turn.<br/><br/>x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x<br/><br/>The game boards are all hand made, printed on Nepalese paper, covered in a matte gel medium and backed with canvas.  This allows the game board to be flexible enough to roll into a scroll, the coating keeps the artwork protected, and when you unroll it, the game will lay flat.  It has an incredible texture, very tactile, and ships in rolled up in a tube with all the components.<br/><br/>",

Some rough edges were smoothed and three new features were added: a procedure for free setups, play on a closed surface and a tactical approach to offering draws.<br/><br/>",

One of the players is chosen to be the gamemaster, each of the other players is given a character with a secret objective. The gamemaster controls non-playing characters and is the only one to know each character's goal. Each character has three stats (SKILL, STAMINA and MOVE), some of them have extra rules, like a spell they can cast or a magic item they can use.<br/><br/>Each turn, players move their character on the board, then characters adjacent to each other can interact, often by fighting but other interactions are possible (like exchanging objects, talking...). Combat is resolved using standard Fighting Fantasy rules.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the last character standing, having fulfilled his/her objective.<br/><br/>In April 2020, Ian Livingstone made the game available as a print and play with updated art assets. This is a free download, and he asks that a charitable donation be made to the National Videogame Museum. (See the Web Links section.)<br/><br/>",

They have to work together, using each other as a resource, to build and make better the structures they own to create a better future for everyone. But, when it comes to business, someone has to get ahead, and in the universe of Windfall, being the best means being the one with power.<br/><br/>Windfall: Galaxy is a tableau building game where the goal is to get the most VP's from the central pool and build the best structures.  It's fast paced as player turns are just 1 action, and unlike other games, everything on the table can be used, not just by the player that controls it.<br/><br/>Windfall: Galaxy takes trading to heart as one of the first things a player gets to do during his turn.  There are many reasons to trade: To get a resource you need, to make a card you own better, or to use something of someone elses.<br/><br/>The sector board gives players a chance to use other player's turns to their advantage.

        "description": "Around 1300 A.D., Scotland and England are at war. The Scottish clans no longer tolerate the oppression by the English kings and ally themselves with each other in order to gain their freedom. Only by working together can they overcome the powerful English army in the battles of Stirling, Falkirk and Bannockburn. But there is a heavy rivalry between the clans; each of the clan leaders wants to contribute as much as possible in order to be crowned as king of Scotland in the end, and they are not afraid to resort to treachery if needed.<br/><br/>In order to have the most points at the end of 1314 A.D. and rule over Scotland, you will need to increase your clan's prosperity without neglecting warfare and heroism.<br/><br/>",

Each player is a pilot of one of his company&rsquo;s spacecraft, on the way to the planet GH-328 in the Panajay system. This undeveloped planet has large deposits of the white mineral.<br/><br/>The goal of each player in TF22 is to leave the planet with as much white mineral and as many units as possible. At the start of the game, each player lands on the planet with a landing craft and several units: a production unit, transporters, and combat units. The production unit can be used to create new units by consuming white mineral. The transports can be used to gather ore and bring it to the landing craft (though they can also carry some of the other units). The combat units can be used to capture or destroy enemy units. Each turn, players receive a number of action points to perform these actions.<br/><br/>Players should not only watch out for the units of other players. They also need to keep an eye on the tide. This can change every round. Areas that were previously accessible only by naval units may suddenly become accessible to land units instead, and vice versa.<br/><br/>",

In order to succeed, you&rsquo;ll make Moves, collaborate with Allies, put on Shows, employ Crew, experiment with Venture strategies, and buy Shine. As your Hype and Cash grow, your Career will evolve with your Opportunities, and you&rsquo;ll learn to count your Bars as you kick your rhymes in a cycle of Ciphers and Battles that lead to the acquisition of skills, wisdom, and respect. Strategic deckbuilding and card play gives rise to multiple lyrical Battles and Ciphers in a revolutionary game that concisely emulates the reality of hip hop today... ALL of hip hop.<br/><br/>Gameplay Summary<br/><br/>Legend of the Cipher is a deckbuilding game, where players start with a basic deck that produces Bars and Cash, which they will use to acquire Opportunity cards each turn to add to their deck. Each turn, players must also perform at Shows, using their Bars to attempt to out-rap the other players. This involves actual rapping, although one can easily play the included variant without raps. Successful raps will be rewarded with Hype, which is used to level up your rapper, in turn increasing both your hand size and production of Bars. The objective of LOC is to be the first player to level up enough to become a Legend of the Cipher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dinosaur Cowboys is a fast playing (45 to 60 minutes) skirmish game of competing posses composed of up to 5 members and 1 dinosaur. Each character in the posse can be customized to fulfill a different role and purchase weapons and equipment from the many options available. Combat takes place in the futuristic landscape of the year 2285, where a supervolcano erupted and changed the course of mankind forever.<br/><br/>In the general the game is built around D12s and is meant to be light, thematic, and fast playing. Players build a Posse containing a Leader, 2-4 Members, and up to 1 Dinosaur, all of which benefit from some unique mechanics. Each Member has an Allegiance such as Duster or Neotechnoist which helps differentiate them (both thematically and statistically). Otherwise there are fairly standard statistics (Speed, Defense, Hitpoints, etc.) which can be customized by spending Improvement Points to really help define a role for each character. Furthermore Active and Passive Traits are selected to let characters do cool things like Crippling Shot, Speed Reload, Go For the Eyes, etc. Weapons and equipment are then purchased from a list of over 75 items ranging from laser Six-Shooters to plasma Shotguns.<br/><br/>A standard game takes place on a tabletop covered in terrain and uses 28mm miniatures and plastic dinosaur toys. Activation of entities is done on a model-by-model basis instead of the entire Posse at once, so the battles are very fluid with plenty of time to react to the enemy. This is especially true as Initiative is rolled at the start of each Activation &quot;set&quot; instead of staying the same for the whole turn.<br/><br/>Posses battle each other in one-off standalone games or in a linked campaign where further Improvement Points and Neodollars can be used to build and grow the group. Likewise injuries can accrue on characters that were taken out of action during an encounter. Deployment, objectives, and features can be used to add depth and variety to each battle beyond &quot;kill everything&quot;.<br/><br/>The full rules are free to download and can be used with any range of miniatures. There is also a free &quot;beginner version&quot; (called Quickdraw) which condenses the core mechanics to under 10 pages, so players can jump into the game very easily.<br/><br/>",

The capturing Khans and the captured piece must lie along an orthogonal or diagonal line. A Khan can make multiple captures when jumping.<br/><br/>Support:    A Khan supports a special move by a Soldier. If a Soldier is adjacent to a friendly Khan, the Soldier can move to any empty square also adjacent to the Khan.

        "description": "The title is meant to sound like an car engine when you accelerate.<br/>A party game. Pin the 9 Place Cards on the walls of the house or garden, at suitable distances apart depending on the area available for play. Give each player a Log Card which it will be noted bears the name of a car. Explain that they must use the side marked 1st Race. Ensure that each player has a pencil. <br/>At the word Go each player sets out to find in the left column of a Place Card the name of the place printed on the first line of his Log Card. He then copies in the Speed Column the speed printed on the Place Card alongside the place name. He also writes on the next line the name of the place printed on the right of the Place Card next to the speed figure. He then proceeds to find the latter place name in the left column of a Place Card and enters up his Log Card as before. He continues entering up the card until he reaches London which is the last place on his journey. <br/>The players try to complete the journey as quickly as possible, filling in the Log Card as described above. <br/>The winner is the player who is first to hand to the host a correctly completed Log Card. <br/>The Log Cards are printed on the reverse side for a second race. Twelve Log Cards are provided for twelve players. If more are taking part extra Log Cards should be obtained. <br/>The game can be played over and over again. New Log Cards will of course be needed and they are supplied in packets of 12. The game comes in a box, with an illustration showing a speeding motor-car driven by a young lady, zipping down the leafy lanes of Britain.<br/><br/>",

The game is designed to be very completive, use risk management, be tactically complex in options, and played through multiple rounds, with some games yielding multiple game points, so the far behind loser has a reason to fight with a bad hand.<br/><br/>Players involve themselves in gameplay in which they draw cards during their turn, maintaining hand sizes of 10, and play those cards down on differing piles, to accumulate points, matching the suits.  However, the opposing player is constantly battling for victory as well, with his piles point totals.  Players also discard and recycle cards onto the various piles.  Many cards have special attributes which mix up the play.  First player to reach an objective of 5 game points, (added from various round points), is the winner.<br/><br/>",

All players in turn take one cube till all pass, then first the active player and then all others compare the colour codes of the chosen animals - for correct choices they move 1 spot forward, for a wrong choice 1 spot back. Dog spots on the scoring scale earn a point for actions, rabbit actions earn one point for the active player if he finds out which animal cube was removed behind his back.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBackground:The depths of the oceans were the last unexploited frontier on our world, until scientists detected a new element formed by the combination of high pressure and intense volcanic heat.<br/><br/>The element, Gottahavium, exists as a quantum fluid.  This wonder element acts as a super conductor, and would launch a new epoch in technology for all humankind, and the Conglomocorporation that controls stands to make a fortune.<br/><br/>Since Gottahavium can only be found in deepest reaches of the ocean, a very inhospitable places for humans, Deep Sea Drones (DSDs) are utilized to locate and then mine the deposits.<br/><br/>With so much on the line, the ConCorps have covertly shifted resources from military contracts to ensure they will be the sole proprietors.  And so, a quiet little war has sprung up under the sea.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplay:Each player controls one of three ConCorp exploratory forces, which are vying for control of the limited deposits in the volatile oceanic depths.<br/><br/>The game is patterned after the classic Micro/Mini-games in the late 70&rsquo;s early 80&rsquo;s, and is meant to be a light quick wargame that can be played in a single session.<br/><br/>Before starting, players must choose the scale of the game they wish to play.  This can range from a small skirmish, allowing for multiple sessions in a night, or have a much larger scale conflict that would allow for a much more in depth battle.<br/><br/>Once the size of the game is decided, player will pick a ConCorp to represent, and the pick their force of DSDs.  Each ConCorp has 5 different drones to choose from, with an overall theme for each of the 3 ConCorps.<br/><br/>After setup, players take turns mining &amp; moving, with a simultaneous fire phase between each player&rsquo;s move phase, so as not to give any one player an advantage in being able to move in, without repercussions.<br/><br/>However, this is not just a straight up shooting gallery.  As with many games of this genre, the map is hex based, and the terrain has an impact on both movement and combat.  There are also oceanic events, such as strong currents, undersea volcanoes and seaquakes that provide a random element that can ruin even the best-laid plans of AIs and Drones.<br/><br/>While the main goal is to attempt to mine a set number of resources (depending on game size), players can also take a more offensive stance and attempt to annihilate the other player&rsquo;s base going for the more brutal total victory.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe Future?:The game was created as part of the Microgame contest here on BGG, but there are plans to expand it beyond the bounds of the initial restraints of that contest.<br/><br/>The goal will be to release expansion modules over time, which will add new drones, ConCorps , maps and rules, all of which will be compatible with the existing system, including having map halves being interchangeable.<br/><br/>",

Japans once mighty fleet was all but shattered and unable to support any garrisoned island against an U.S. attack. With Iwo Jima taken earlier in the year the U.S. had an island to land damaged bombers that were hitting the mainland island. To launch an invasion of the main island of Japan the U.S. would need a bigger stepping stone to launch from; Okinawa was the answer.<br/><br/>This is a 2 player game set on the island of Okinawa and surrounding waters that recreates the battle between U.S. and Japanese forces during World War 2. The basic rules follow the concepts laid out in Axis &amp; Allies, but combat resolution has been modified to a D12 system. The game can be played to 10 turns or 20 depending on the length of time desired; and victory is determined by the number of airbases held or carriers destroyed. The map is divided into areas that are controlled by the players' armies represented by the plastic Axis &amp; Allies pieces.<br/><br/>The rules incorporate a number of new features to the Axis &amp; Allies style of play including terrain effects, country specific units, and all new unit types including flame tanks and LCMs.<br/><br/>",

Players are in charge of a squad or several fire teams and control the individual actions of their soldiers, weapon teams, vehicles or support weapons. The rules are focused on the tactical concepts of fire and maneuver, command and control, and morale as well as training and experience. Any period of modern firearms combat can be simulated, from The Great War all the way to today and beyond.<br/><br/>The Point Blank book contains everything you need to run games with infantry, artillery, and vehicles as well as rules for spotting and hiding, as well as night, weather, smoke, and fog. There are three major periods represented for the army lists in the book: WWII (which includes Germany, U.S., Soviet, British, French, and Polish. Vietnam (which includes U.S., ARVN, Australian, NVA, and VC. As well as modern forces for the Global War on Terror or any other modern hot spot (which includes U.S., British, Mujahideen, and Insurgent). Rounding out the book are three scenarios, each one concentrating on one of the periods covered in the book and focusing on a tactical concept. The missions include Combat Patrol, Ambush, and a VIP Snatch. There is lots more besides in this 94 page rulebook to keep players busy and gaming.<br/><br/>",

The game is a word-game, where players try to descibe words without mentioning specifics (very similar to Alias).<br/><br/>Players take turn to try to describe the words on the card, each one with a specific theme, without mentioning the specific word or part of the word. The other players, teammates or opponents depending on the variant, try to guess as many as possible in a set period of time; and players score accordingly. First one to a set target of points is the winner.<br/><br/>What sets the game apart from Alias is the distinct tongue-in-cheek &quot;lundahumor&quot;, i.e. humour from the student city of Lund. The themes and words on the different cards are often odd, screwball or intergroup.<br/><br/>In addition to the original rules, several variants is included in the base-game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spagyric (a.k.a. White-Black-Red) is a two-player game designed for play with a Shibumi set.  It uses a 4&times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).<br/><br/>White beats Black beats Red beats White<br/><br/>Goal: Create a connected group of 4 same-colored balls, neither first creating a group of only 3 same-colored balls, nor creating a group of 5 or more same-colored balls.  If you create a group of precisely 3 or more than 4 same-colored balls, you lose.  If the pyramid fills with 30 balls before a winner or loser is determined, each player takes 1 white, 1 black, and 1 red, and the winner is decided by a sudden-death white-black-red (see below).<br/><br/>Rules: The 4&times;4 board starts empty. Each player starts with 8 white, 8 black, and 8 red balls. Keep this supply of 24 balls hidden from your opponent at all times during the game. Use an opaque container (e.g. the Shibumi bag) to receive defeated balls over the course of the game. It should be able to hold 24 balls. Never look in this bag of defeat during the game.<br/>Both players simultaneously and secretly select a ball from their supplies. Simultaneously reveal them on a count of &quot;White, black, red, go!&quot; The stronger ball (White beats Black beats Red beats White) goes into play wherever the &quot;winner&quot; likes; the weaker goes into the bag of defeat. If both players revealed the same color, those are stunned, and set aside until this turn is done; then they will go back into your supplies.  The game ends when your supplies are empty, even if it&rsquo;s due to stunning.<br/><br/>Included in the Shibumi Rule Book<br/><br/>Soft cover:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...</a><br/><br/>Downloadable PDF:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to world of Dark Legacy. A world ruled by the ruthless battle mage by the name of the Kaiser. The planet of Titan is at war. The Kaiser is bringing the world to its knees. This is a war where anything is possible and anyone can become a legend. It is here where your journey begins.<br/><br/>Will you join the Kaiser and his allies in the total domination of the planet or will you be part of the opposition? You get to decide how this story will tell itself. Make sure to choose wisely, for the fate of the planet lies within your hands.<br/><br/>Make your choice!<br/><br/>Dark Legacy is a unique strategy game that mixes the best elements of Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons and Chess and wraps them all up into a in-depth sci-fi/fantasy story. In Dark Legacy, players are no longer bystanders of the battle,  they get to be part of it as a war general within one of six different factions. With the unique and various weapons, armor and relics, that a player can equip themselves with, players can become whomever they imagine themselves to be.<br/><br/>In Dark Legacy, it is the players objective to destroy their opponents and their armies, by building a deck of magic spells that no one can withstand, rolling the d20 in their favor and strategically summoning their army to be the strongest. Just like in real battle you will have to anticipate the probability of the unexpected. Don't make choices too hastily for they may be the demise of your army and yourself.<br/><br/>Dark Legacy is a game that can be played one-on-one or in team battle.<br/><br/>Here are the type of cards that can be played in Dark Legacy:<br/><br/>     Enhancement cards are for summoned creatures, weapons and the Hero. These cards can either strengthen or weaken that which it is place upon.<br/>     Creature cards are just that. They are the faction specific cards that each one of the six different factions use to strengthen their army to win the battle.<br/>     Magic cards are the spell cards used to tip the balance in battle. There are faction specific magic cards and general magic cards.<br/>     Armor cards are only for the Heroes in battle. This gives each Hero extra defense points on top of their life points.<br/>     Weapon cards are only for the Heroes in battle. There is a wide variety of weapon cards and as the Hero levels up there are stronger and more magical weapons that become available to them.<br/>     Relic cards are ancient cards with abilities that are available to every player if you find them. There are relics that will fit every players style of fighting.<br/><br/><br/>The Evolution System for Battle<br/><br/>     Before the battle begins, players must decide who is going first.<br/>     At the beginning of every battle each player draws five cards.<br/>     Each player is now allowed to place one card on the equip side of the mat. This card has to cost 0 and the player has to have the correct skill level to put that card down.<br/>     There is no damage permitted for the first round in battle, meaning that no one can attack or cast spells that deal damage until it is the first person&rsquo;s turn again.<br/>     The player that is going first must begin the battle by drawing a card. (At the beginning of every turn players will draw a card.)<br/>     In order to cast any of the player&rsquo;s cards they must roll the d20. There is only one roll per turn, unless there is a card in play that allows for another roll. The number that you roll will be the<br/><br/><br/>number of casting points you have to cast cards from your hand.<br/><br/>     In order to cast spells you have to have a high enough SKILL LEVEL (SL) and have enough CASTING POINTS (CP).<br/>     The player can then cast any number of cards as long as they have the proper SL and CP.<br/>     If the opponent has the ability to counter the spell they can do so after the card is cast.<br/><br/><br/>Now the second round begins.  At the beginning of the player&rsquo;s turn they must draw a card and then decide weather to attack or cast and use the cards abilities to help you win the battle.<br/><br/>Charging Field<br/><br/>     Players may put any card, within their faction or subsection, on this field face down. This card is now charging. This field is to be used for cards that are above of your skill level. <br/>     You may place cards that are in your skill range, but that would defeat the purpose of charging the card. In order to cast the card that you put on the charging field, it must charge for the difference of your skill level and the skill level required to cast<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a horse race simulation board game.  In this game a roll of a D6 is referenced to a chart to determine the movement of each horse.  Each horse has a separate card with its movement chart thereon. The charts have three rows of numbers, each for a different section of the track. Turn order is by lane in the first round and then till the finish, turn order is by leader. Lane changes are permitted only as the very first move of a pawn (horse) on its turn.  The first lane change is allowed as a forward diagonal movement of the pawn.  Additional lane changes in a turn are at a cost of one movement point each,  So, if you have five movement points and make two lane changes as the first two movements of your pawn then you can move four spaces forward along the track. There are areas on the track where lane changes are prohibited.  <br/>   A bit of statistical analysis was made by Cincinnati native Howard Hughes in creating the horse cards.  The horse cards reflect the performance of real horses in that those that excel in sprints fair poorly in long distance races and vice versa.  There is no provision for betting in this game.  The components are somewhat primitive, consisting of; horse movement cards, pawns and coin money all punched from a perforated sheet of card stock.  The box art has a beautiful charcoal drawing of a jockey on his horse making their way to the starting gate.<br/><br/>",

To do this, you'll buy goods from the ships arriving in the harbor, repackaging some of them to create &quot;donations&quot; (i.e., bribes) to the Senate, while placing other goods onto the market in order to recoup funds needed for future purchases.<br/><br/>The Senate gives victory points for the best three donations. Which one is best? The Senate has different interests each round, which doesn't take into account the price of goods or how often those goods appear.<br/><br/>The players decide simultaneously which cards are gifted to the Senate, which sold at market, and which placed in the storehouse for later rounds. Therefore before the cards are revealed, you know neither whether your donation will succeed nor whether your goods will create enough income for the next round. You do have a lot of information as to which cards are in your opponents' hands, but you never know what they're going to do with them.<br/><br/>At game's end, players with the most money and filled storehouses receive extra points, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

SHIBUMI MEETS POKER!<br/><br/>Equipment: the 4x4 Shibumi board and 10 balls of each color (white, black and red). Two players.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>The board starts empty. Players take turns taking a ball at random, for example from an opaque bag, and placing it either on empty board holes or stacking on 2x2 platforms of existing balls.<br/><br/>When a player, with the ball just placed, has formed a visible winning group of balls (see below) he shows it and challenges the opponent, so also the other player takes at random a ball and places it trying to do a group of higher ranking.<br/><br/>The player with the higher ranking group wins the challenge and scores one point. If the two groups have the same ranking, each player scores one point. Obviously if the other player is not able to form a winning group he loses the challenge.<br/>Winning groups can be in any level and also composed by balls placed in different levels. Between two groups of the same ranking, the winner (if exists) is the group with at least a ball at a higher level than the other group.<br/><br/>The game ends when the 30 balls pyramid is complete and the winner is the player with the highest score at the end of the game.<br/>Apex ball can be used only to respond to a challenge, or to form a &ldquo;straight flush&rdquo;.<br/><br/>If the placement of a ball creates two or more winning groups, you must always consider the highest ranking group.<br/><br/>When a player has formed a &ldquo;straight flush&rdquo;, he wins immediately the game, regardless of the score.<br/><br/>WINNING GROUPS in ASCENDING RANKING ORDER<br/><br/>Three of three kinds: a straight line of three touching balls of different colors, in any order, orthogonal or one on top of the other (when they are in different levels);<br/>Flush three: a straight line of three touching balls of the same color, orthogonal or one on top of the other (when they are in different levels);<br/>Full house: a five balls pyramid formed by two touching balls of the same color and two touching balls of another color in the platform, and a ball of one of that two colors on the top;<br/>Flush four: a straight line of four touching balls of the same color, orthogonal or one on top of the other (when they are in different levels);<br/>Straight flush: a five balls pyramid of the same color.<br/><br/>",

The board is rotated 45 degrees to have clearly seven columns with varying number of balls (1-3-5-7-5-3-1 on the surface of the Shibumi pyramid).<br/><br/>Rules: the board starts with two red balls placed in the left and right corner holes. Two players, White and Black, take turns placing one ball of each color adjacent to each other. The balls can be placed on board holes or on top of 2x2 platforms of existing balls. You can place a ball on a hole and the other on a platform, as long as they touch each other.<br/><br/>Aim: without the left and right corner holes there are five columns with an odd number of balls on the pyramid surface (3-5-7-5-3). When the pyramid is complete, the player with the most visible balls in a column wins that column. The winner is the player who has won at least 3 columns.<br/><br/>Variant for expert players: players score one point when they have conquered a column composed by three balls, two points for a five balls column and three points for the seven balls column. The winner is the player with the highest score.<br/><br/>Note: the game has an odd number of columns composed by an odd number of balls.

Purple cubes and/or Unit cubes from the Unit bag are used to keep track of game play aspects in Dragon Valley Tourneys.<br/><br/>Players start with Jousting. If finished before the other player(s) have completed the dividing in Dragon Valley: Rise of Corundia, they move on to Archery. If there is still time, they move to the Trebuchet Tourney and afterwards back again to Jousting. If the dividing is complete, finish any score checks but do not continue. If a scoring criteria was not met, no player gains score in Dragon Valley: Rise of Corundia from the current tourney. They do keep the score earned in previous tourneys during this division. Make sure to return any purple cubes to the board and units back into the cloth bag. The next division starts with the next mini-game.<br/><br/>If players are not comfortable playing traditional Rock Parchment Swords, an alternate is to pull Blue, Red and Yellow cubes from the bag and secretly selecting one (if enough are there, otherwise use cubes from the board, but remember where they came from.)<br/><br/>",

It uses a 4&times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).<br/><br/>Aim: Score the most points you can, without losing the game by disconnecting a white or a black the others of its kind.<br/><br/>Setup: The 4&times;4 board starts with the 16 base holes filled as shown to the right.<br/>The game is played from the 3&times;3 level up.  Empty the bag, and put 5 balls of each color (white, black, and red) into the bag.<br/><br/>Rules: Draw a ball from the bag, and add it to the pyramid according to these rules:  When there are no free spaces on a level, you may place the ball on any edge point of the new level; otherwise, you must push a ball from the side with a new ball.  White and black balls must end up touching others of their kind; red needn&rsquo;t do this.  If a white or black becomes stranded, you lose.  You may not push balls off the pyramid.<br/><br/>Once the last ball is on the pyramid, you score according to the following:<br/>7 points for a visibly connected path of red from corner to corner; otherwise, red is worthless.<br/>A color (black or white) that is split into separate visible groups is worth the product of the number of balls in each visible group of that color.<br/>A color (black or white) that is in one contiguous visible group is worth negative the number of balls in that visible group.<br/> Random Setup: Start with the two red balls in the corner, then put 11 white and 11 black in the bag.  Spiral clockwise inward from one of the reds, drawing a ball from the bag and adding it to the board.  Now spiral clockwise inward again from the same red, and each time you reach a white or black that is not touching any others of its kind, replace it with the other kind from the bag.  (Apologies for the difficulty in replacing the center four!)  Note:  The base may thus contain more groups than just one white and one black.<br/>After setup, dump the bag, and put the usual 5 white, 5 black, 5 red in the bag to start the game.<br/>When playing with random setup, you should play several games in a row with the same setup, so you can really experience the setup.<br/><br/>Multi-player Solitaire: Any number of people can compete, as long as each person has a Shibumi set.  If you do a random setup, everyone should copy one random setup, so everyone starts with the same base.  If players can see each others&rsquo; pyramids, each player should draw randomly from her own bag during the game; if players cannot see each others&rsquo; pyramids, you can have one person draw from her bag the whole game, announcing the color drawn, and the other players simply pull out that color and place it.  The latter allows for more pure competition, but the former is often more practical.<br/><br/>",

All antiquities ar kept secret until a complete series is collected.<br/>as the game progress they move around a board where they land on squares that causes auction to occur; new antiques enter the market, opportunity to loan more money, more money (salary) or random event cards.<br/><br/>The central mechanic is the auctions and the players auction antiquities as well as the bank. Asking price and acceptance price is set by the player. What is to be auctioned, asking and acceptance price is kept secret until the auction starts. Players that win objects include them in their hands and keeps them hidden until a series is completed, (but as the game moves along you can get more and mor knowledge about what the other players have, based on what auctions they won, if you remember this)<br/><br/>",

Players take turns laying a single card in a 3x3 grid with each successive card sharing at least one side with a card already in play. When cards are first played, numbers on shared sides are compared to determine if the new card defeats the old card, allowing control of cards to be gained and lost throughout play. Victory occurs when one player controls three cards in a row (horizontal or vertical). Scratch has a minimum of rules but deep strategic game play.<br/><br/>",

Do I want to play first, and seize the initiative, launching preemptive strikes and attacks, at the price of acting first during the reinforcement phase, or do I temporize and play second or last.<br/><br/>Tech Phase: each player may advance their tech level by one point, knowing that they have 4 levels of tech possible divided in 4 Elements, Earth (strenghtening their land army), Fire (to make Atomic attack), Water (to strenghten their navy and protection against fire attacks) and Air (for aerial supremacy and range of fire attacks). Each Level of tech give access to new capacities and units. for example, a level 2 of the Fire element give the player the opportunity to launch each turn a fire attack succeding on a 5+ with a 6 sided die. Do I try to proceed in a balance way, or do I specialize in an Element ?<br/><br/>Build Phase : counting their colonies, the alliances with minor powers, the orichalc zones they control, the wonders they have built, the players may then spend their build points to make new alliances, build their cities and upgrading their already existing ones, build wonders, and of course, build their combat units, according to the tech levels they have.<br/><br/>Activation phase: the heart of the game. Each player must, in turn, do one of two things: launch a nuclear attack from one of his colony. If it is successful, and the targeted player do not defend himself with a Water Shield Protection, the area is destroyed once and for all! even if it fails, a unit in the area can potentially be destroyed!<br/>The other possibility is to activate one or two areas and the units they hold. Units begin the turn face down, giving a nice fog of war, and are placed face up once they are activated.  Choices must be made once again, do I activate my units early but limiting my potential actions for the rest of the turn, or do I buy time? A fragile balance between those two actions must be achieved. Combat is resolved with a die roll on a differential of strength chart, adding a number of &quot;artefact events&quot; according to the tech level of the engaged units.<br/>During the end phase, the players check to see if a sudden death victory is taking place, that can occur if a player dominates a majority of the orichalc zones, or of the wonders.<br/><br/>The Atlantean Wars is a dynamic game designed for two or three players, with a rich and simple system of play, which can be taught in 20 minutes to a player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The hardest part of design isn&rsquo;t doing the design. It&rsquo;s working with everyone else without wanting to run screaming for the hills.<br/><br/>Collaborating with smart people on challenging problems is, inevitably, fraught with conflict. Conflict can be good for creative work, moving a project forward as designers wrestle with the challenge. But not all conflict is healthy, and frankly most designers aren&rsquo;t, shall we say, diplomats.<br/><br/>Surviving Design Projects is, among other things, a little game to help designers hone their people skills. It&rsquo;s pretty easy. Each player takes turns being the Creative Director. He or she turns over a Situation card, and then tells a little story about the situation shown. She can make it up or draw from her own experience.<br/><br/>Let's say I turn over the situation &quot;Lack of Inputs.&quot; Maybe I make up this story:<br/><br/>Though the client has provided stacks of user research, they can&rsquo;t offer us any clear business priorities. They&rsquo;re just asking us to make their site better without giving us a sense of what they want to accomplish. I need to go talk to the client about this, and try to get them to give us some inputs.<br/><br/>Each player around the table chooses a Pattern card from their hand and places it face-up next to the situation card. The Creative Director chooses one player to go first and describe how they would apply the pattern to the situation. That is, to describe the technique would they use to make the conflict productive. Let&rsquo;s say one player uses &ldquo;Make Educated Guesses&rdquo; and describes it this way:<br/><br/>The Make Educated Guesses pattern suggests we fill in the holes ourselves with some assumptions. I guess the idea is that we&rsquo;re smart people, so we should know what the starting point is. We could brainstorm a list of assumptions about the project&rsquo;s business priorities, then share that with the client to validate it.<br/><br/>The Creative Director then chooses which technique she would use to deal with the situation and leads a group discussion about the choice. The person who suggested the pattern receives the situation card. The player to the Creative Director&rsquo;s left becomes the next creative director, flipping the top Situation card, and starting again. At the end of the game, the person who has the most Situation cards is the winner.<br/><br/>So that&rsquo;s it. It&rsquo;s a pretty simple game, but the idea is to get people talking about difficult situations in a no-strings environment.<br/><br/>",

Once a player believes a cone is complete he selects the cone card and flips it along with all his used ice cream cards. Players can clock-out for additional points once they feel that their remaining ice cream cards can't build more cones, leaving the last player without bonus points.

        "description": "Absolution is a cooperative game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.  To quote the designer:<br/>I like cooperative games, especially &quot;Shadows Over Camelot&quot; by Serge Laget and Bruno Cathala, so I designed Absolution as a cooperative adventure with a Stonehenge theme. Similarly to &quot;Shadows Over Camelot,&quot; I wanted Absolution to be difficult, but not impossible to win with the right strategy among the players. Many Stonehenge scholars can agree upon two points: It looks like some sort of astronomical clock, and people died there. In Absolution, the clock is ticking. Whether anyone dies tonight will be determined by you. Save the Druid!<br/><br/>The usual &quot;no telling what your cards are&quot; rule for collaborative games applies.  Utilizing a central exchange field to swap cards, players try to set up their hands to be able to play a single card that matches the current turn number (1&ndash;30), or a pair of cards whose sum or difference equals the turn number.  Your success at doing this determines the pace at which the poor druid walks to the altar to be sacrificed.  Don't let it happen!<br/><br/>Absolution is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.<br/><br/>",

There are no miniatures to paint, and no sprawling maps to eat up table space.  A game can be played in fifteen minutes, and on a surface as small as an airplane tray table.<br/><br/>In Chains of Command, mobility is as important as might, and players must maneuver their units around the periphery of the battlefield, trapping or attacking their enemy, while being careful not to get their own forces pinned or destroyed.  If a Commander is destroyed, or an army is unable to use all four of its action points in a turn, the game ends.<br/><br/>Will you play as the heavily armored Crusaders, relying on coordination between multiple units for success?  Or possibly the mobile and deadly Saracens?  Don't forget the devious Pirates, able to manipulate units in strange ways, or the brutish Natives, who can deal nearly limitless damage.  Or create your own motley bunch by choosing from any or all factions you wish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ECONOMY CHESS<br/><br/>Economy Chess is alot like normal chess, pieces move the same way and the objective is the same (checkmate the king). The difference is the economy: harvest money from the lands you own, and buy and place pieces strategicaly. Spend -or save- your money wisely!<br/><br/>GAINING INCOME AND PURCHASING PIECES<br/><br/>When your pieces move around they automatically conquer squares. Each square = 1 coin income per turn. Use the coins to purchase pieces and place them in your productionarea. The player may not move in the turn that the pieces where bought. Losing a tempo can be extremely costly.<br/>Managing your money is an important aspect of the game. If you lose ground to much, the opponent can build alot of material. However, if that leads to sloppy positional play you might get mated while being rich!<br/><br/>ECONOMY CHESS 960 (Fischer Random)<br/><br/>Play standard chess with the pieces on your backrank shuffled. Chess960 is the most common chessvariant and can also be played with an economy.<br/><br/>SANDBOX (create your own Economy Chess variant)<br/><br/>In an economy people are stimulated to buy cheaper goods. By adjusting the prices of pieces you can alter the economy to your own will. Or players recieve starting money, giving them a sweet boost. <br/>Adjustig those variables is an easy way to create a handicap. A handicap can be used to make the game challenging when a strong chessplayer plays a lower rated opponent.<br/><br/>",

Related to the Sami boardgame Dablot Prejjesne and to Dablo Daares.<br/><br/>Theme: Abstract game with soldiers and kings<br/><br/>Gameplay: Turnbased checkers type of game<br/><br/>Goal of the game: Either to capture the enemy king or reduce his forces so that only the king remains<br/><br/>Rules: All pieces move by single steps and can capture, by the short leap, in all directions. The soldier (&quot;d&aring;rake&quot;) can only step in the three forward directions. Promotion does not occur. For the soldier, capture is mandatory. For the king (&quot;g&aring;nneka&quot;) capture is optional. One can only capture a piece of the same rank or lower. Where the king is of higher rank than the soldier.<br/><br/>A piece moves to an empty adjacent point. If an adjacent point is occupied by an enemy piece, of the same rank or lower, and the point directly behind is vacant, then one may jump over it and capture it, as in checkers. Several pieces may be captured like this in a single turn. Dablo Frostviken follows the same rules. For soldiers a capture is mandatory. For the king a capture is optional.<br/><br/>",

All cards enter play face-down, even the cities, and you can flip only one card per turn face-up plus one card per battle. Cities are flipped face-up whenever a face-up character is at its location and flipped face-down again when the last face-up character leaves that location.

        "description": "Nickropolis is a grave robbing game, where you, as a thief, try to swipe as much loot from the necropolis as you can before you're sealed in forever. The hex card graveyard is laid out differently each game. Move from tomb to tomb, fighting the undead for their treasures, while avoiding traps and the other theives. One word of warning though. You'll want to race to get your goods to the surface. The necropolis locks itself down as you play, so you not only have to collect the loot, you must return to the center periodically and toss the loot up to score it. You can also pickpocket the other thieves if you don't want to fight the undead for it. Nickropolis is a quick, easy to learn, and rather brutal game. If you do join the undead in the tombs, you can still haunt the other thieves and win. Happy stealing!<br/><br/>The Story:<br/><br/>Your buddy Marley motions for you to join him at a dark table crammed in the corner of the bar. You and the other thieves go over and seat yourselves around him. He looks around nervously before he speaks.<br/><br/>&quot;Got a job for you. You know they're planting Ol' Lady Elston tonight? Gonna do some spooky ceremony before they put her in that family necropolis. Listen up. Gatekeeper Willy is in charge of unlocking the mausoleum, and Willy likes his bottle. So I'm gonna make sure he has a nice full one tonight, because that's the kind of guy I am. Once he's hammered, you break in. Got a good map. I'll keep a lookout up top and sort out your loot. Just one thing, you got to be quick. That place has some kind of clockwork mechanism that will seal you down in there with all them dead Elston's, and you don't want that. They say some of them ain't quite as dead as they should be. Now whoever tosses up the most loot items will be known as the king of the thieves around here. You in?&quot;<br/><br/>",

But the Allies still had to push the Germans back behind the Siegfried Line before they could resume their strike into the Reich. By January 13&mdash;eleven days after it was launched &mdash;the counteroffensive had expanded far enough to the east along the battle line to engage the American 30th Infantry Division into the fight, with the capture of St. Vith as a first objective. While its sister regiments were plowing south over the hills, the 120th Regiment was locked in a bitter three-day struggle for Thirimont, a ridge village which controlled the east flank of the attack. By irony of fate, this village was defended by the 1st Battalion of the 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, the same unit, whose soldiers so full of confidence, earlier rode on the tanks of the powerful Kampfgruppe Peiper, and had traversed Thirimont one month earlier on the way to the Meuse bridges.<br/><br/>Here comes an entirely NEW way to enjoy your ATS gaming: Geomorphic boards that link in a myriad of ways! And no one has a cooler scenario collection to put you into the action with on the new boards like CH! Battle of the Bulge I for ATS TT includes all the combat counters and large markers you need to play, just bring your ATS rulebook and play aids and the standard &frac12;&quot; small marker counter sheet and you are ready for this all new take on the Battle of the Bulge and ATS gaming!<br/><br/>",

However, in the second edition the rules and game sets for 1 player will be presented.<br/><br/>The War of Races takes place in Ithilion world and 12 different races and 1 neutral race take part in it. The goal is to conquer the opponent&rsquo;s residence or to eliminate his leader from the battlefield. The game also becomes more strategic as you play on two fronts.<br/><br/>Racial Wars in not a collectible card game but thanks to random additions, the player can make his own, exclusive card deck. Each card has its own unique abilities and unrepeatable pictures.<br/><br/>Players start with only leader in front of them and build plateau of cards in front of them - some cards generate resources - different for different races - which are then used to put more powerful creatures into the table. Then, each turn the battle takes place - player who is currently attacking chooses units to attack and defending blocks their attacks with his own to protect his leader. The purpose of the game is to kill enemy leader.<br/><br/>The game is based on a fantasy world of Ithilion, which arose in author&rsquo;s and his coworkers&rsquo; minds. If you want to know the new world and characters living in it, or make a new era in Ithilion world and fight at one of the races&rsquo; side, join the Racial Wars community and create with us new days of Ithilion world.<br/><br/>Leader's set &quot;Petronus&quot; is a set which includes the deck of Savands, which is based on a sandy shaman, the creator of time amulets &ndash; Petronus.<br/><br/>Savands are a race of desert creatures that live in symbiosis with sand and rocks. They love hot and dry air. Savands race includes creatures made from sand and stone called Seekers as well as powerful worms living under the desert sand.<br/><br/>",

Large bars beat medium bars, beat small bars, beat no bars at all! The same goes for red bars, but red bars always beat white bars, no matter what size.<br/><br/>To battle each player draws four cards and places three cards face down in a row with the long side (side) facing the other player, who then does the same. Turn over troops a pair at a time and compare the combat bars to find out who wins each battle.  Loser places their card face down and the winner places theirs face up. The player with the most face up cards wins and collects all face up troop cards (including the other players surviving troops who have changed sides) and puts them in their army.<br/><br/>To have peace talks each player places three of their four cards face down in a row with the short side (top) of each card facing the other player and announces which skill is being challenged. Turn over troops a pair at a time and compare the combat bars of the chosen skill to find out wins each peace talk. Loser places their card face down and the winner places theirs face up. The player with the most face up cards wins and collects all of their face up troop cards along with all face down troop cards of their opponent and puts them in their army.<br/><br/>When your opponent no longer has any troops (no more cards), they are defeated.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Clang! gamebox Poker Tuck Box (54 cards)<br/>Army of Emperor Maximillian Ravenclaw Deck (1 deck of 25 cards)<br/>Army of King Henry Oakenheart Deck (1 deck of 25 cards)<br/>Poker Deck Instructions Deck (1 deck of 2 cards)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Skystrike is a World War 2 Pacific Theater of Operations Nautical wargame  cited by the designer as very suitable for novices in that genre.<br/><br/>The game is based on the crucial battle for Midway Island on the 4th June 1942. To win, the Japanese player has to sink the United State's aircraft carriers and thus capturing Midway Island. The American player wins by preventing the Japanese taking the island and inflicting more losses on the Japanese forces than his own suffer.<br/><br/>Each player has their own board and the game thus uses a blind/search system. Only when the enemy is found can combat occur. Each turn represents 8 hours, so three turns per day are the limit. The searching rule owes a debt to dear old Battleships and the board is overlaid with squares so that movement is by square to square.<br/><br/>Once combat starts, results are determined by a die roll. I think there could be very quick combat rounds &quot;Roll a 6 and the enemy carrier is sunk&quot;, that sort of thing (it is intended for beginners after all). When it comes to invading the island, the Japanese player gets only one attempt per game so the player must be pretty sure he has timed it correctly.<br/><br/>There are variants - a quick game and an advanced game, plus rules for designating your aircraft as fighters and/or bombers.<br/><br/>",

In a Waves Round, the dual-use cards in the main deck are used to setup waves of aliens attacking the player's ship, and also give the player a hand of cards for blasting away at those aliens. The blaster value on the card played from the player's hand is used to remove aliens in the attacking waves. Once the waves have been dispatched, the Boss Round starts where the player has a back-and-forth match with the Boss alien &ndash; with the Boss taking an action based on a reveal &quot;Boss Action&quot; card, and the player responding. If the player is able to defeat the Boss, the next Level begins. The player wins the game after defeating the Boss on Level 5.<br/><br/>The game includes Health indicators and PowerUps, such as shields, missiles, bombs, Health improvements, and even a &quot;Wingman&quot;.<br/><br/>",

It is currently a proposed Kickstarter project.<br/><br/>There are three main layers to WW3.  The first is industrial/economic production.  Control the centers of industry, and you earn their production points.  However, such control can be gained either through economic investment OR military adventurism.  To invade or to invest, that is the question!<br/><br/>The second layer is fuel and resource production.  Fuel helps your armies move faster, and your fleets to move MUCH faster.  But use up all your fuel on movement, and you may not have much left over for battle.  Remember that an army fighting without fuel will be struggling for its very survival.<br/><br/>The final layer to game play is, of course, the military dimension.  The basic version of the game will have two types of military units: armies and fleets.  Unlike in Risk, where ridiculous numbers of armies start crowding the board very quickly, WW3 forces you to make tough choices with limited military forces.  The loss of just one critical army at a key moment could prove lethal; every strategic choice in this game is critical.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of 30 mystery cards, 40 black cards with taboo words and a grim reaper card. The players try to guess the stories behind the scene outlined on the mystery cards without using the taboo words.<br/><br/>Like the other Game: Black Stories games, the central element are the mystery cards. They contain an illustration and a short statement about a spooky or crime event. On the back of the card, the story is presented in more detail. Only one of the players reads the back of the card. The others try to reconstruct how the crime happened by asking yes/no questions.<br/><br/>New about &quot;Black Stories: Die Erweiterung&quot; is that there are cards with taboo words. At the beginning of each rounds, three of these are selected. If one of the players mentions one of these words, the others try to slap the grim reaper card as quickly as possible. The player who correctly slaps the grim reaper card the fastest, wins the taboo card. The person who has contributed most to finding the solution gets the card. The player with the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>The game can be combined with other games from the series. You can either just use the taboo word cards with other Black Stories instalments, or mix all the cards together.<br/><br/>",

The first player to write out the numbers 1-100 wins.<br/><br/>Place the pencil in the middle of the playing area. Players each roll the die in turn until someone rolls a six. That player takes the pencil and starts writing out the numbers 1-100 as fast as they can. The other players continue rolling the die in turn. When someone else gets a six they gently grab the pencil from the player currently writing and start writing 1-100 on their sheet. Continue until someone gets to 100. Numbers may be checked for legibility.<br/><br/>The game doesn't sound like much, but usually generates a lot of laughter, especially when someone is just beginning to write and the pencil is grabbed away. If grabbing pencils sounds dangerous then you can try ringing a bell to stop play in order for the writing player to give the pencil.<br/><br/>",

One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.<br/><br/>During a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how he/she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is 'L&uuml;neburg' west or east of 'Blankenese'? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.<br/><br/>After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &ndash; and the card placed wrongly &ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.<br/><br/>After 15 cards are placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.<br/><br/>After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

It's a Girl's World and the classic SCRABBLE crossword game is now played on a beautiful pink game board and includes a special bonus world list to help you score big points and have more fun!<br/><br/>Many of the basic rules from Scrabble apply. Players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>Variants:<br/>1) Players take 9 tiles instead of 7 and any word that uses 7 or more tiles score the 50 point bonus<br/><br/>2) Play until a player reaches a pre-decided score based on skill level and the number of players.<br/><br/>3) Bonus words! There are 50 different words that when played will score bonus points. 12 which score 5 extra points such as coat, sun, hair, text); 27 which score 10 extra points such as school, flower, ballet, cool, camera); and 11 which score 15 extra points such as stripes, journal, clothes)<br/><br/>",

The cycle began every time a kingdom beat the other remaining three in a battle. This winning kingdom enjoyed only a short stay in the castle before the neighboring kingdoms attacked once again. This endless cycle repeated itself constantly &mdash; until one day a monk known in the four kingdoms for his wisdom and pursuit of peace, while observing this absurd dynamic of endless battles, decided to end them by creating a board game with the following decree: &quot;The kingdom that manages to capture all the knights of the neighboring kingdoms will be the owner of the Sagario.&quot;<br/><br/>Sagario is played on a cross-form board made up of 212 boxes. The Sagario castle is placed in the center of the board game and is surrounded by four towers, which are the landmarks that delimit the territories of the four kingdoms: Sazio, Galia, Risko, and Orbis. Each of these kingdoms has an army of five soldiers and four knights as well as four assault towers to siege the castle. Each player must try to capture all the knights of the bordering kingdoms, at which point he now owns the castle and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A tile based game of building and scoring closed loops<br/>for 2 or more players<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/>The game consists of 144 square, double sided tiles, each containing an image of a unique arrangement of one to four white strands.  Each strand connects any two of eight positions spaced equally around the perimeter of the square, with no two strands sharing edge positions.   The images on the two faces of each tile are mirrors of each other.  In addition to the 144 unique tiles there are 6 single stranded tiles that each appear twice, forming a 150 tile set.  Tiles have a colored background that indicates the number of strand crossings contained on the tile:<br/>Blue - no crosses - 50 tiles, 44 unique<br/>Green - one crossing - 40 unique tiles<br/>Yellow - two crossings - 30 unique tiles<br/>Orange - three crossings - 10 unique tiles<br/>Red - four crossings - 6 unique tiles<br/>Purple - one each of five, six, seven or eight crossings<br/><br/>OBJECT OF GAME:<br/>The object of the game is to have the highest total points when the game ends.<br/><br/>HOW TO SCORE POINTS:<br/>(1) Each player scores points whenever they arrange one or more tiles, alone or in conjunction with other tiles already played, such that some of the strands on the tiles meet up to form a closed loop. Points scored are equal to the number of times the loop crosses itself or any other strand.<br/>(2) Bonus points are awarded when tiles are placed in such a way as to form a ring of tiles enclosing an empty space.  Bonus points scored are equal to the number of free strands pointing into the empty space, but only if it is an even number.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>1. Each player draws twelve tiles at random from the box.<br/>2. Players attempt to arrange their tiles to form a closed loop. The first to succeed places his loop in the center of the table, counts his score, and then draws enough tiles from the box to return his pile to twelve.<br/>3. Play continues to the left until some player reaches an agreed upon value or until the last tile in the game has been drawn.<br/><br/>RULES OF PLAY:<br/>1. Adjacent tiles must always be placed edge-to-edge and corner to corner, and strands along touching edges must always line up - no dead ends or jogs are allowed.<br/>2. If you cannot build a loop you must forfeit your turn.<br/>3. You may build more than one loop on a single turn, but you cannot place any tile that is not part of a closed loop.<br/>4. If you forfeit your turn you may set aside one or more tiles from your pile and draw new tiles to replace them, returning the others to the box.<br/>5. You may, before placing tiles, swap any tile in your pile with any other tile on the board as long as the swap does not break any closed loop or strand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Friday the 12th, 1964<br/><br/>It is raining today as I stand in front of the Amityville Asylum. I'm here, well because I'm a detective and that's what I do - solve mysteries. This one began when a strange note fell into my possession. Now that I'm here, I don't feel as if I'm alone - the voices are back... Are they phantoms of an insane mind or possibly shadowy thoughts of a deranged personality? Maybe they are all entities living within the world of our detective's mind. In Phobos, each player takes on the role of one of these personalities. Your goal is to eliminate the personalities of your opponent(s). Once accomplished then your personality prevails allowing you to control the detective. Each of you chooses a Mentality board, 8 Ghost Miniatures, 12 Character Miniatures, a D12 Die and 3 Action cards. Players then each get 3 Phobos cards (from 12 different possibilities) and keep these face down. These cards represent your Fears and an extension of the Detective who is imprisoned inside the Amityville Asylum. (Note that the Mentality board includes all the 12 different fears matching the 12 Phobos cards.)<br/><br/>In each round you play an Action card which will instruct you to place your Miniatures either on your board or your opponent's (depending on the card) trying to find their fears. If you place a Miniature on an opponent's Mentality Board that matches one of their fears, they are forced to reveal that fear. Then, based upon how you placed your Miniature you will have accumulated movement points which will be used to place and move your Ghosts on the main board (comprised of 16 tiles). The board includes four central halls where your Ghosts enter the detective's head and 12 fear rooms which represent each of the Phobos cards. When you place 2 Ghosts in a room which represents one of your Phobos cards, you are protected (for as long as they remain). This then makes it so that when an opponent places a Character Miniature on your Mentality board matching one of your fears, you are not forced to reveal your Phobos Card. It sounds simple but nothing is simple in the dream world where nightmares and demons prevail! On the other hand you can play an Adrenaline card and bring the upside down in the game. But these cards cost one of your Ghost, if you to claim one.<br/><br/>If your Fears are revealed by your rivals, then you lose but you are not eliminated. You become a Ghoul that can take revenge on the other Personalities still in play. As a Ghoul you can help control how the game unfolds by playing the right cards and destroying the rival Personalities. You have more advantages like you have more moves or you can even create a modular board. It is time to explore your personality in the ultimate interactive horror game!<br/><br/>Fear is your only god!<br/><br/>",

The most famous character in it, Bernd the Bread, is illustrated on the box.<br/><br/>The six chilipower tiles are shuffled and placed face down. Players are dealt some cards that will have a number on each one, from -2 to +4. A start card is revealed and in your turn you play a card and add it to the start card, announcing the new total. Now next player adds a card and reveals the new total (that is, Start card + previous player's card + his new card). And so the game progresses. If any player takes the total to 13 or more, that player takes one of the 6 Chilipower tiles. The number of chillies on it is bad news because the winner will be the one with the fewest chillies on his chilipower tiles (they range from 1 to 6).<br/><br/>After taking his chilipower tile, the previous round's cards are collected up and put on the bottom of the stack and a new start card is revealed and you play as before.

This is the evil snake's fault, because she has coaxed the time watchman into turning back the time. Who is going to help the Little Prince and his friends to scare away the snake and bring the hours of the day and night into the correct sequence?<br/><br/>Setup: The starting tile is placed in the middle of the table. The time rays are placed to its sides so that a long time ray from 0 to 24 hours is created (the time rays have numbers from 0-24 printed on them). The hour tiles (showing clocks) are shuffled together with the snake tiles and put face down on the table. Each player gets a character tile and places it in front of him/herself on the table.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: To put as many hour tiles as possible in the correct position on the time ray and by doing so collect as many cogwheel chits as possible. Remembering where the evil snakes are hidden will help you to defeat them and win the game!<br/><br/>Gameplay: The start player puts his/her character tile in a position of the time ray that isn't yet taken up by an hour tile. Then he/she turns over one of the face-down tiles from the middle of the table. If it shows the same time as the position the player has put his/her character tile in (e.g. the character tile is on the &quot;11&quot; position of the time ray and the tile depicts a clock showing 11 o'clock), the hour tile is put in that position, the character tile is returned to the player, and he/she earns a cogwheel chit. If the hour tile doesn't match, the hour tile is returned to its old place in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>If a snake tile is turned over, the player has two options: First, he/she can simply return the snake tile face down to its old place. Second, he/she can return it face up and try to turn over the other two snake tiles. If he/she is successful, he/she immediately wins the game. If he/she isn't, he/she loses a cogwheel chit and then it's the next player's turn.<br/><br/>There are two ways the game can end:<br/>a) The evil snake has been defeated (i.e. a player has turned over all three snake tiles). In this case there are two winners: The player who has turned over the snake tiles and the player who at this moment owns the most cogwheel chits.<br/>b) All the hour tiles have been correctly placed on the time ray. The player who has collected the most cogwheel chits wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Before the game begins each player chooses cards and buys an army of different units up to a fixed amount of money. The players start on the opposite side of the battlefield. Each player got three actions per turn, where he can command his units or play a card, which affects units or the battlefield itself. There are different hex types like swamp, street, bridge or forest. Some objects like buildings, cliffs and rocks may block the line of sight or can't be entered.

        "description": "DAM IT the River Conquest Game<br/><br/>Great strategy board game DAM IT takes place on a grand river system. With your crew of skilled beavers you will be charged with the task of damming rivers that legends say can&rsquo;t be dammed. To make matters worse your enemies on the other team will be fighting for the same goal. A good balance of military strategy and well placed dams will be the key to your success. To master this game you will have to use strategy, team work, and just a little bit of luck. During game play you and your team will be faced with tough choices, but don&rsquo;t be afraid to get wet just make sure you can swim. DAM IT Two Sides&hellip; As the game begins, six beaver tribes march onto the battlefield. The Red, Green, and Yellow tribes form the Honored Beaver Alliance, fighting for peace, justice, and wood. The tribes of Blue, Black, and Purple unite to form the Midnight Warriors, fighting to protect the homeland of their ancestors. One Battle&hellip; There is an uneasy calm as both teams face each other from across the river. Each tribe raises its flag as the architects discuss their building strategy. The kings stand nobly to ensure victory, and out of the silence comes the command of a warrior: &ldquo;Charge!&rdquo; One River. There can be only one victor, the team with the will to Dam It.<br/><br/>The game Dam It is a team game that can be played by 2 players, 4 players or 6 players. Games involving 4 or 6 players are always played in teams. There are 4 ways to win. <br/>(1)_eliminate the kings of opposing players <br/>(2)_capture the dens of opposing players <br/>(3)_dam the end of the main channel river and control it for 6 consecutive allied turns; and <br/>(4)_control 50 or more worker beavers.<br/><br/>Game time: approximately 1 hour<br/><br/>Note: It&rsquo;s important to spend 10-15 minutes, or so reading the rules carefully. The more time you spend learning the rules, the more fluid and enjoyable the game will be.<br/><br/>The five types of beavers <br/>1. Worker beavers <br/>2. Flag beaver <br/>3. Warrior beaver <br/>4. Architect beaver <br/>5. King beaver<br/><br/>In Dam It, each beaver serves a different purpose and has unique skills. All +1s and +2s are numbers added to die rolls during the combat phase. The combat abilities of these beavers are summarized on the reference sheet under &ldquo;Combat Statistics&rdquo;.<br/><br/>1. Worker beavers comprise the bulk of your team. These beavers are easily persuaded. These beavers can collect wood and may be led into battle. The red and blue chips are used to represent the worker beavers of each team. <br/>2. A Flag beaver is an elite beaver that has been trained to repel attacks. To represent this, he is given a +2 while defending. This is the beaver holding a flag. <br/>3. A Warrior beaver is an elite beaver that has been trained in the art of war. To represent this he is given a +2 while attacking. This is the beaver with a Mohawk or with a Viking helmet (for early editions the warrior is also represented by: muscles, snorkel, eye patch, and hair). <br/>4. An Architect beaver is an elite beaver that has studied his/her whole life to become the leader in dam construction. This beaver must be present to construct dams. If the Architect beaver is eliminated, that player can not build dams. This is the beaver holding a book. <br/>5. A King beaver is an elite beaver that is cautious and effective in his war tactics. To represent this he is given a +1 while attacking and a +1 while defending. If this beaver is eliminated from the game, then all other elite beavers from that player are also eliminated, and that player&rsquo;s turn is skipped for the rest of the game. This beaver is the one with a crown on his head.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a free do-it-yourself print-and-play game for parents and kids to use to divide up the variety of Halloween treats they acquire, although any good variety of treats can be used, and not just on Halloween!  Playing the game without a decent variety of treats (using generic tokens for treats for example) eliminates much of the fun in choosing which delicious morsels your monsters get to grab from the pot, and steal from other players.<br/><br/>The game is played by rolling 3 custom dice (which have to be assembled from the files included here) in order to roll a MONSTER(s) which then can use the other 1 or 2 dice to perform an action.  One-headed and two-headed MONSTERS can GRAB a treat, STEAL a treat, or EAT a treat, for each head they have.  A player who GRABS takes a treat from the pot and puts it on their STASH plate, a player who STEALS can take a treat from the pot OR take a treat from another player's STASH.  A player who EATS a treat puts it in their STOMACH CONTENTS bag and that treat can not be stolen by any other players.  Rolling triples has special effects, like being caught stealing.  After all the treats are gone from the pot, players score 1 point for each treat in their STASH and 2 points for each treat in their STOMACH CONTENTS bag.  I suggest having at least 10 treats per player to play with.  For fairness reasons, sometimes the players agree that if they don't roll at least one monster they can physically eat one treat from the pot.<br/><br/>The dice are made by cutting out and gluing the sides on 3/4 inch wood blocks, or printing them out with adhesive backed paper and pasting them on cubes.  The file might have to be re-sized to fit smaller dice; it contains enough icons to fill 6 dice even though you only use 3 to play.  If anyone would like to have me make a custom set for them for a little $ I will make them for you.  Geekmail me here (NoodleArtist).  within a year have a few laser-engraved dice made, and re-release the game with some added rules as a more professional, packaged game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from the designer<br/><br/>Breach is for 2 players and is played with Go stones on an initially-empty square grid.<br/><br/>When you take the lead (i.e. when you build a row longer than any built up to that point in the game), your opponent can (optionally) replace one of your stones with her own, in lieu of placing one of her stones on her next turn.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>1. White begins by placing 1 stone on any empty space.<br/> 2. Then, starting with Black, the players take turns. On your turn you must place 2 stones on any 2 empty spaces. <br/> 3. If you complete a row with a score of at least 2, and that score is higher than any previous score by either player, you must move your scoring marker to that score on the scoring track. <br/> 4. After you move your scoring marker, your opponent gets an additional option on her next turn (and only on that turn): instead of placing 2 stones, she may choose to place 1 stone and then replace any one of your stones on the board with one of her own. <br/> 5. If the longest row is broken up due to a stone replacement, the scoring marker is not moved back - scoring markers never move backwards.<br/> 6. The game ends when the board is full and the player with the highest score on the scoring track at that time wins (in practice the winner will be obvious well before the board is full, and the trailing player should resign at that point).<br/><br/>",

Sticks have to be removed without wooden ghost figures tumbling down.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Clear plastic sheets are put on the sides of a wooden castle towers. Wooden sticks are then put through holes in the plastic so that they cross the tower. Wooden ghosts (in black, white and orange) are put on top of the sticks.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>A six-sided number die is rolled to determine the start player. Players then take turns rolling a six-sided colour die. The active player has to remove a stick marked with the colour determined by the die roll.

If a ghost hits the floor, the player responsible loses a turn. Players keep the sticks they removed and any ghosts they caused to fall. At the end of the game, points are counted as follows: Each stick is worth one point. Each white ghost counts one minus point, orange ghosts two minus points and black ghosts 7 minus points.

        "description": "A cooperative, zoo-themed educational game for children aged 2+ in which they get to know the numbers 1-3 as well as some shapes and colours in a playful way.<br/><br/>Background story:<br/>Milly, the animal keeper, has lots of work today. She has to deliver the mail to the bear, the two lions and the three elephants, bring them food or paint the animal houses. And Dapdap, the penguin, has escaped from his enclosure and visits all his animal friends. Can you help Milly with her tasks and return Dapdap to his enclosure?<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- 1 board<br/>- 18 tiles (9x food, 3x flags, 3x paint bucket, 3x letters)<br/>- 16 task tiles<br/>- 1 wooden &quot;Milly, the animal keeper&quot; token<br/>- 1 wooden &quot;Dapdap, the penguin&quot; token<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>For the basic variant, 6 food tiles are removed from the game. 3 food tiles (showing 1 honeypot, 2 pieces of meet, 3 lettuce heads) and flag, paint bucket and letter tiles are put close to the corresponding corners of the board. The task tiles are randomised and stacked face-down. Dapdap is placed on the penguin enclosure.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>The start player takes the Milly token and puts it in front of him/herself to show it is his/her turn. He/she draws a task card. If it is a Milly card, he/she gets to help Milly. He/she looks which house (red, yellow or blue roof) Milly is running to and if she is delivering the mail, carrying the paint bucket, a flag, or if she is distributing food. He/she then looks for the correct tile at the board corners and puts it in the corresponding area on the board and gets to keep the task tile as a reward. <br/>&quot;Correct&quot; means: matching colour for the paint buckets, matching shape for the flags (shape on the flag has to match the shape of the animal enclosure), matching number for the letters, and matching food (honey for the bear, meat for the lions, lettuce heads for the elephants).<br/>If the tile drawn is a Dapdap card, the active player puts the Dapdap token to the next animal enclosure. Dapdap greets the animals in their language, so the player makes the corresponding sounds. For the correct greeting, they also get to keep the tile.<br/>After completing the task, Milly is given to the next player, whose turn then starts. Incorrectly completed tasks are put at the bottom of the task tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends either when Dapdap has returned to his enclosure or when all items have been distributed (players decide which of the two they prefer). The game is intended to be played cooperatively, without deciding on a winner (but it can be played competitively by counting how many tiles each player has earned).<br/><br/>The advanced variant is played with all the food tiles and the players have to choose the tile showing the same number as food items as there are animals of that type, e.g. if Milly is going to feed the elephants, the player has to pick the food tile that shows three lettuce heads because there are three elephants.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Totem unit for the Neverborn, specific to Pandora.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/><br/>Overview<br/>The Poltergeist is a totem specific to Pandora that is often overlooked for other options. It does bring a few tricks to the table though that make it worth considering.<br/><br/>Mobility<br/>With a movement that some would call on the lower side of average the Poltergeist can have a hard time keeping up with Pandora once she begins her train of effects. It should be able to keep up with most other models okay though, or at the very least have little issue getting into a useful position when thought out a turn or two ahead.<br/><br/>Offense<br/>With no range attack some would quickly overlook the capabilities of this model, but it has a rather good severe damage for close combat. It's strength lies more so in the distraction abilities it brings to the table, however, in that it can make enemy models slow (and your own as well do not forget) and a few other shenanigans that suit a Pandora list quite well. Magical extension lets you use one of Pandora's spells another time each turn, and who doesn't want to cast Self-Loathing or Project Emotions another time?<br/><br/>Resilience<br/>This model is short and so can hide easily. It has a high defense, but low wounds, so can die fairly easily if the opponent focuses on it. Spirit will help reduce the damage too, though, so the model can be quite survivable.<br/><br/>Magical Extension<br/>Remember that any enemy model failing a WP duel within range of Pandora takes a wound, so casting spells that keep this going or give an opposing model negative flips while freeing up Pandora herself for other actions is always a plus.<br/><br/>Tips and Tricks<br/>One trick with this totem is to use its Persistent Distraction spell while your own models are clustered near it to force your opponent to activate and use all of his models before you use any more of yours effectively out activating their entire crew with all of yours. This can be very situational and is probably not a good idea later in the game as you can leave yourself very exposed to attack, but can give you an early game advantage to seeing what your opponent has planned.<br/><br/>Using Magical Extension to cast Project Emotions and give enemy models a negative flip can help out several of the models often found in a Pandora crew.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This box set expands the Malifaux universe by adding the Legion of Sorrow. The crew contains Pandora (leader), Baby Kade, Candy, and 3 Sorrows.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki page:<br/><br/>Pandora is the Master of Willpower (Wp) duels. She features powerful debuffs, crushing offensive abilities, and deceptive maneuverability, making her one of the more dangerous Masters in the game. But she is also known for her steep learning curve, taking many hard fought games to fully grasp her potential.<br/><br/>Pandora is focused around a web of effects consisting of The Box Opens, Emotional Trauma, Expose Fears, and Fading Memory. These four abilities form her core and are utilized by her spells and actions. The Box Opens allows her to affect just about any model in the game with her Wp-based effects while Emotional Trauma harms any enemy model failing a Wp duel near her. Expose Fears is her main defense against enemy models and forces any enemy model targeting her into a Wp -&gt; Wp duel. Finally, Fading Memory adds a deceptive amount of maneuverability to an otherwise slow Master and, when paired with the other three abilities, provides her a unique defensive option of darting away from (or towards) an opponent trying to target her.<br/><br/>Pandora's starter box is about perfect. It gives you a nicely rounded list of 23ss, leaving you 2 more for your Soulstone Pool during the game, and has a mix of Wp based models and dual purpose models. It comes with Pandora, Baby Kade, Candy, and 3 Sorrows. If you're a beginning Pandora player, it is highly recommended you play with the box set as it is for several games, or until you get a good handle on Pandora's mechanics and practice using your Sorrows to their greatest effect.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>The Steampunk Arachnid Swarm is the primary workhorse for crews led by Ramos, but you can utilize them with any Arcanist crews, and even in crews led by C. Hoffman or Leveticus. This model is typically well worth the 9 SS cost, and overall has good survivability, a good attack, and consistent damage output.<br/><br/>Overall, the Arachnids are pretty straight forward, and are basic melee attack units.<br/><br/>On the other hand Scatter uses a Summon technique, so if you plan to do the Scatter action, always be sure to use 1 general AP for something else first, and use your (+2) Melee Master and probably Self Repair or Disruption Field as well. Then when you Scatter, if you activated Disruption Field, it will automatically pass onto each of your newly summoned individual Arachnids. When they come into play, since they are Summoned, they are treated as new models, each with their own activation, but they will be Slow during that turn which they were summoned. The Scatter action is also different from Swarm Together, in that the individual Arachnids do not activate immediately, as in the Swarm Together scenario.<br/><br/>Against models with high Df, as mentioned above, Latch On is typically a good approach. One thing that works well is to move a Swarm up to the opponent, as long as it's less than 4&quot; total, attack twice with (+2) Melee Master, activate (0) Disruption Field, and then use the Swarm's last (1) to Scatter. Since you have to put the individual Arachnids in base contact with the Swarm, you should be able to place at least two of the new Arachnids in base contact with your target. Then, when those individual ones get to activate (thus, good to do this at the end of your turn, after your opponent has activated all their models, if possible), you start out with the one not in base contact to move into base contact and (0) Latch On. Then your two Arachnids in base contact can (0) Latch On and attack vs -4 and -6 Df. If you can manage to set this up where your Steamborg Executioner or another Arachnid Swarm still need to activate after all of this, then you should be able to really do some damage. This is one of the best ways to handle high Df opponents like Lilith, Perdita Ortega, or the Coryphee Duet (if you can get them to stand still, that is).<br/><br/>Lastly, the Overwhelm trigger, as mentioned above is one of the most dangerous things about the Arachnid Swarm, and it is worth learning how to utilize it well, both in the game itself, and as a psychological tactic. If your opponent knows that you have not yet activated a Swarm or two in range of some of his better pieces, he may be cautious about playing higher cards from his hand earlier in the turn, because he wants to keep those for cheating up his Df against the potential Swarm attacks. So there are some good mind-games that can be utilized with the Swarm.<br/><br/>",

Its based on a fantasy world where they literal gamble with their fates using this game. If you are losing a hand and you can't follow suit you could use a Major Arcana card to switch the hand from high to low and make your partner win the trick.<br/><br/>When the north and south players lead a trick the low card wins, and when the east or west players lead a trick the high card wins. Following suit is necessary and the Major Aracana cards switch high tricks to low ones or visa versa unless Major Arcana was what led the trick.<br/><br/>The team gets points for each trick they win and the team with the most points at the end of a hand wins that hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion for Malifaux includes 1 Silent One ,Arcanist Minion specifically designed to work with Rasputina.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki site:<br/><br/>Silent Ones are the priestesses of the Cult of December. Upon learning that the Vessel of December was to be a woman the male priests (December Acolytes) turned on the priestesses, cut out and ate their tongues to prevent them speaking for December. Upon the arrival of Rasputina the Silent Ones attend her loyally and lend devastating magical assistance on the battlefield.<br/><br/>The Silent Ones are designed to work with Rasputina primarily, but may have some limited synergy with other Masters, they run 6 Soulstone cost.<br/><br/>Rasputina should not go to war without a Silent One, two are useful if you have the stones as they can buff each other. Rasputina will naturally benefit from the range boost in the initial turns off the game, but as the enemy gets closer the Silent One can offer a plethora of support abilities; healing, offensive casting and slowing the enemy down. All this and Rasputina can cast through them from a safe distance and with less of a Ca detriment than through, say, a Gamin.<br/><br/>Silent Ones have been described as mini-Raspys and should be treated as such. They are very good casters, but with low Df and Wd they can be defeated in melee in short order. Ranged strikes will have to contend with Bulletproof and ranged or melee Spells can be ignored with Counterspell. Remember that a lone Silent One can freeze your minion's heart, turn them into a statue and walk out of combat so if you go after them make sure that either they have already activated or that you can dispose of them in one activation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion adds an Arcanist Minion to the Malifaux universe.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki site:<br/><br/>The Hoarcats are the cute and cuddly kitties of Malifaux that will rip your throat out. One isn't much of a problem, but the more of them there are the more trouble you are in.<br/><br/>The Hoarcat Pride's mobility is nothing to write home about, but they aren't bad either. They have a walk on the low side of average at 4, but their charge is slightly higher than most minions at 7. Their Pass Through ability also helps them to get around models trying to block a charge lanes.<br/><br/>What the Hoarcat pride lacks in Mobility it makes up for in Offense. They have an average Cb on their Claws, but their damage track is quite high for their Soulstone cost. Add to this their (+1) Melee Expert and they have a lot of opportunity to lay down the hurt. The one caveat is that their damage is based off of how many Wd they have left. So the more damage they take the less damage they can deal out.<br/><br/>You'll also want to save your high crows so that you can get their Rip Throat trigger. This will give an extra boost to damage against defenders without Armor.<br/><br/>The other Offensive ability they bring to the table is their Devour spell. This allows them to sacrifice a Ht 1 model. If you have more than one Hoarcat Pride within 3&quot; you can benefit from their Voracious ability. This allows the them to double their Ca when casting Devour and allows them to cast it on Ht 2 models as well. Keep in mind though that the target of Devour has to be living, so this isn't going to work well against some crews.<br/><br/>Being a Beast, the Hoarcat Pride is going to get the most synergy out of working for Marcus. Pack Leader can help to get an alpha strike with the Hoarcat Pride's high damage. While Howl can boost the Hoarcat up to an impressive 8 Wp. Finally, Primal Flame can help to heal them up and keep their damage high.<br/><br/>Myranda has a few of synergies with the Hoarcat Pride. First off, like Marcus, Myranda can companion with other Beasts granting the potential for alpha strikes. Second, if she takes the form of the Hoarcat Pride with her Shapechange Spell it is enough to activate the original Hoarcat's Voracious ability. Thus giving the benefits of Voracious without have to actually hire two Prides. In the same vein Myranda can use her Animal Instincts Spell to cast Devour herself with her higher Ca. Finally, her Primal Flame Spell can help to give the Hoarcat Pride back those few Wds it needs in order to keep the damage high.<br/><br/>",

The game may be used to establish a tactical confrontation for a miniature table top battle.<br/><br/>From the Introduction<br/><br/>The game is designed for Wargamers either as a &quot;board game&quot; or as an adjunct to a tabletop Battlegame using miniature figures and scenery on a 5' x 5' or larger table.<br/><br/>As a BOARD GAME, a small campaign can be played using MAPS, ROSTERS and MARKERS supplied.  A complete campaign can be played in two or three hours.  In such a game, there is a great deal of &quot;the fog of war&quot;, grand tactical maneuvering, scouting, and simulated conflict between forces, and the issuing of basic pre-commands.<br/><br/>As an adjunct or OVERLAY to a miniature wargame, the game still uses MAPS and FORCE MARKERS, but also sets up circumstances for a Sudan era (1880's thru 1890's) tabletop battlegame using miniature figures.  Often during such a campaign there will be two or three separate table top battles and sometimes reinforcements can be brought in.  The game also has rules for combat between gunboats and feluccas.<br/><br/>The rules have been devised for straight forward and fast play with minimal referencing to tables, and uses ten-sided (percentile) dice for moving, combat and morale resolution.<br/><br/>The game includes copiable maps, roster sheets and markers (counters) that the player needs to cut-out and mount themselves to play the MAP game.<br/><br/>",

It is in the &ldquo;marriage&rdquo; family of traditional card games, along with Bezique and Pinochle, and uses a &quot;piquet&quot; deck of 7-A in four suits. Penchant&rsquo;s unique scoring, method of setting trump, and the addition of blocking melds add extra dimensions of skill to the basic bezique framework.<br/><br/>Each round consists of two phases: the first ten tricks and an end-game of six tricks played from each player's melds drawn back into his or her hand.<br/><br/>Players score for winning aces, 10s, and 7s in tricks (&ldquo;brisques&rdquo;), and for melding combinations. Scoring combinations include four of a kind, marriage (king and queen of same suit), sequences, and Penchants (queen and jack).  Players systematically block and unblock each other from melding by playing &ldquo;elder&rdquo; (face)  combinations. Scoring includes a &ldquo;book bonus&rdquo; of the most brisques reminiscent of Whist.<br/><br/>",

Rig up your escape contraption by raiding the salvage pile and sabotaging your opponent&rsquo;s machinations. This quick, easy-to-learn game of luck and strategy will leave you eager to play round after round!&quot;<br/><br/>Both players roll 4 six-sided dice each. The player's goal is to be the first to build an escape vehicle with 1 of each type of available rig parts (six in total) found in a pile in the middle of the playing area. Both players roll their dice simultaneously and tally the results. On the player's turn, they may take one token for each color that they rolled, assuming there are enough to grab from the pile. After collecting the tokens, they are placed into the player's queue, but the player must decide for each token if it is going to be a part to their rig or an action. On the player's turn, the top two tokens from the queue are always activated. If it is a part, it is attached to the player's rig. If it is an action, the action is taken and the token is returned to the pile. The first player to collect 1 of each 6 parts to complete their rig wins!<br/><br/>",

These will be played onto the points of the squares and triangles, and there is a total of 62 playable points on the board. Goal: to occupy the the four corners of any square with your pieces.<br/><br/>Game play: during the first phase, players take turns placing their pieces onto any point of the board. If the winning configuration hasn't been achieved yet, then the second phase begins, in which pieces can be moved to an adjacent point in any direction.<br/><br/>Capturing: a piece can only be captured if it is on a corner of a triangle and is the only piece an opponent has on that triangle or pair thereof. This means that only one piece can be captured at a time; if a move causes you to corner two of an opponent's pieces nothing happens. A captured piece is replaced with a red one.<br/><br/>Red pieces: once placed, they cannot be moved around, but must remain next to at least one black or white piece. If they become isolated, then during a player's turn, he or she may decide to remove such an isolate instead of moving one of his or her pieces.<br/><br/>",

Wings is designed for recreating Arab-Israeli War air combat using Tumbling Dice's 1/600th scale aircraft models.<br/><br/>The games are designed to last around one or two hours. As the sky tends to be a lot less cluttered than the ground, games can be set up quickly and fewer models are required - making for a cheaper night out.<br/><br/>Any number of people can play. As the victory target is dependant on the size of a force, opposing sides don't have to be equally balanced, a smaller or less sophisticated mix of planes can defeat a larger or more advanced enemy by reaching their (lower) victory target first.<br/><br/>Each model represents an individual aircraft or balloon. Elevation is abstracted using 4 levels, and the game uses D6 and D3 (a d6 numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3) for combat resolution.<br/><br/>",

If all the Runners make it safely across the playground without being caught that player is the winner; if the Bulldog catches all the Runners then that player is the winner.  Additional Teacher Squares offer protection for the Runners as the Bulldog cannot enter or pass through these squares.<br/><br/>The game introduces elements of both chess and draughts, and combines luck with strategy making it an easy game to learn but with additional depth for older players.<br/><br/>",

With four players, an additional free 1er-celestial body is placed on the pulsar so that the celestial body there becomes a 4er-CB.<br/><br/>In a pulsar, the ownership of the elements can change before the active player throws the die. This uncertainty is rewarded because at the end of the game the asset markers placed in the pulsar get twice as many points.<br/><br/>The active player, before throwing the die, sees whether there are unoccupied elements on the pulsar and, if so, the 3er-celestial body in the pulsar is rearranged as follows: a-b-c becomes b-c-a, but the asset markers remains were they laid, so the ownership structure on the celestial body changes (with four players, the 4er-CB changes from a-b-c-d to b-c-d-a).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lai Shai is a two-player game that uses a 10 x 10 red- and white-checkered board. Its square, wood pieces are either red or black (with their designations painted on in gold paint) and placed on red squares only.  Players' halves of the board are separated by a &quot;chinese wall&quot; that marks the boundary of their home court vs. their enemy court.  Each player has the following pieces: 1 Emperor, 1 Empress, 3 Princes, 5 Guards, and 5 Archers.  To begin a game, the pieces are arranged as follows: the red square in the player's lower left corner has a pagoda and gets the Empress, the red square in the lower right corner has a crown and gets the Emperor, between them (in the row nearest the player) are the 3 Princes, on the next row's red squares are placed the 5 Guards, and on the third row's red squares are placed the 5 Archers.<br/><br/>Players then roll dice every turn to determine how many moves each may make, depending on the difference between the numbers they have rolled.  Moves may be made with any combination of the player's pieces, for example: one piece moving three times in a row, or three pieces each moving once.  The pieces are moved only on red squares, with each type of piece having its own type of moving privilege.  Movements must be from one red square to the next unoccupied red square; if the next square is occupied by an enemy piece but the one after is not, the enemy piece must be jumped and removed from the board, and points are scored depending on the point value for that type of piece.<br/><br/>Archers may only move towards enemy court until they reach the enemy's home row and are then turned over to become Princes. Guards, while in home court, may only move towards enemy court, but having crossed the Chinese Wall can then move in either direction.  When a Guard reaches the enemy's home row it becomes a Prince.  Emperor, Empress, and Princes may move in either direction from the start.<br/><br/>The winning player removes both his enemy's Emperor and Empress by jumping.  Point totals have accrued throughout the game, and the instructions are not clear as to what this has to do with the ending outcome, though the text on the cover of the game box indicates these scoring rules may be optional.  There are additional choices to be made to do with the effect the dice rolls have on movements and scores, some optional, some not.<br/><br/>",

In their turn, players have to decide wether to place a route-tile, which is taken from a common face-down tile pile, or a city-tile, which is taken from the players own limited city-tile reserve.

In each round, players are dealt ten cards which move the price of one stock up or down. (There are also a few special cards which allow special actions.) They then go around the table taking one action each (buy shares in one company, sell shares in one company, or play a special card.). After each player has taken three actions all of the cards are revealed, and the changes to each stock's price are tallied, as is the tax or interest rate for cash in hand.<br/><br/>The first player to get to 50% holding in a company is its Chair, and may suppress the worst price-reduction card (played by anyone) affecting that company in each round.  Players holding between 25 and 49.5% of a company may suppress one of their own cards, of any type. (The Chair may veto plays affecting their own company.)<br/><br/>At the end of the game the player with the greatest net worth wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overnight, the Goblin King and his henchmen snuck into the Elven King&rsquo;s treasury and stole all the magical coins stored in it.<br/><br/>Players try to get back as many of the precious coins as possible.<br/><br/>They do so by overcoming Evildoers like Goblin Minions, Trolls, Dragons and even the Goblin Queen and King themselves with the aid of Friends, like Elvish Warriors and Magicians, helpful animals, good Dragons and other helpers. In their quest to outsmart the Goblin King's minions to get the magic gold coins back, enchanted Treasures strengthen the Friends you play.<br/><br/>In this easy-to-pick-up card game for 2 - 4 players, which is mainly geared at children and/or families, players do not play against each other, they cooperate in order to get back the stolen gold coins. The unique cooperative mechanics make this game ideal for kids as they learn how to work together to overcome great evil without leaving any player behind.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is that each player collects a given number of gold coins depending on the number of players. Players draw cards from a shared draw pile of 60 cards that contain &quot;Evildoers&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; and &quot;Treasures&quot;. Friends are used to get rid of Evildoers, whilst Treasures help your friends in doing so. When a player manages to beat a bad guy on his or her own, he or she gets 2 gold coins. If other players assisted him or her in doing so, every involved player gets 1 gold coin. When the draw pile runs out everybody counts their gold coins. If one or more players did not manage to acquire the given number of coins, all players lose.<br/><br/>In &quot;Elves vs Goblins&quot; either all players win together by cooperating and playing their Friend cards wisely, or all lose if even only one player is &quot;left behind&quot;!<br/><br/>This game is a children's version of my &quot;Social Worker Game&quot; &quot;Together We Are Strong&quot;.<br/><br/>",

No captures are made, but pieces can move vertically or horizontally only either jumping in an empty space immediately beyond an adjacent piece or into an adjacent empty square. If a jump is made, the same piece can jump again indefinitely i the board position permits. A win is either by being the first to occupy all 16 spaces of the opponent's starting position or having the most in the other player's starting area when either player has no legal move.<br/><br/>Notaly it improves on some of the faults of the related game Grasshopper.<br/><br/>Taken on its own, it is a game where every move to a player's own advantage is likely also to benefit the opponent.

        "description": "&quot;Grand Prix&quot; is one of the bestselling Polish games in the 80's. Its first version showed up in 1984. Its successor is &quot;Formu≈Ça 1&quot; (published in 2007) by the same authors (Jan Rojewski and Micha≈Ç Stajszczak), which is in fact renewed &quot;Grand Prix&quot; with some corrections and changes to the rules and track design.<br/><br/>Game mechanics of both games mentioned above is quite similar to the &quot;Formula 1&quot; from Waddingtons, which was published in 1962 (see: Formula 1).<br/><br/>In every turn the players set the speed of their cars and try to drive through curves without an accident to reach the finish line before opponents. The speed is converted into number of boards which their cars can pass by - every 30 kmph is one board. Maximum speed is 270 kmph.<br/><br/>When safe speed for the curve is exceeded, the player has to roll the dice specified number of times to check if the car would stay on the track after breaking or if the accident (and some additional damage to the tyres and brakes) would happen.<br/><br/>The players are equipped with some amount of tyres and brakes points (represented by cards), which are used during the game when players brake hard to indicate the tyres and brakes wear.<br/><br/>Both types of damage points could be reset to the amount from the beggining of the game in the pit stop during the race.<br/><br/>During the race players can also use tactical cards. Everyone gets 4 types of cards: &quot;Safe braking&quot; (&quot;Hamowanie&quot;), &quot;Start with speed 180 kmph&quot; (&quot;Start 180 km/h&quot;), &quot;+1 board&quot; (&quot;1 Pole&quot;), &quot;+2 boards&quot; (&quot;2 Pola&quot;). Players who start from 2nd and 3rd line get extra cards (&quot;+1 board&quot; and &quot;+2 boards&quot;).<br/><br/>There were three editions of the game. Artwork for the two first editions was done by Tomasz Poniatowicz. In the third edition game box artwork was done by Andrzej Gosik.<br/><br/>",

Airborne dropped by parachute or landed by glider created completely new and different aspects in warfare; tactics, placement, the element of surprise, the mere psychological effect of the threat that must be taken into account. In this book, Donald Featherstone shows how to re-stage the major operations of the war to make many fascinating games. No aspect is neglected: how airborne forces came into existence, their uniforms, equipment, weapons, vehicles and aircraft, British, German and American. He discusses in detail several major engagements., including the two mentioned above, and then goes on to suggest how to adapt these for table-top games, with advice on rules, models and terrain. This edition contains a new set of rules Tarred and Feathered that have developed the original rules of Tarr and Featherstone for the modern wargamer.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players take the roles of megacorporations&rsquo; CEOs to enlarge influence and dominance of the world. To do so they must spend resources to get control of cyberpunk freelancers - but it's not as easy as it sounds. The cyberpunks are very hard to control and everyone will try to recruit them. Each player will bet on different resources to get best results.<br/>Future INC. is all about getting control over locations and gathering resources.<br/>Each player starts with the same amount of skyscrapers and tries to expand by building new and capturing or destroying those belonging to other players. Thanks to skyscrapers players gain control over locations &ndash; areas of the cyberpunk world - and gather resources.<br/><br/>There are five types of resources in the game:<br/>Credits - represent financial capabilities - used to build new skyscrapers.<br/>Cybernetics - represent technological advancement - used to change ownership of enemy skyscrapers to yours.<br/>Gear - represents military potential - used to destroy skyscrapers.<br/>Programs- represent defense against &quot;cyber terrorism&quot; - used to counter enemy actions.<br/>Influence - represents political power and intel &ndash; used to gain an advantage by manipulating game&rsquo;s mechanics.<br/><br/>The most important thing in Future INC. is using free mercenaries - known as Cyberpunks - to do the dirty work. Using resources, corporation may influence a group of Cyberpunks to capture enemy building and gain victory points.<br/><br/>Game is divided into five turns, each has three phases:<br/>1st phase, collecting resources: in which players gather resources, determine new targets for Cyberpunks and update points status.<br/>2nd phase, mission: in which players, using bluff, bet on resources to gain control over the Cyberpunks.<br/>3rd phase, actions of corporations: in which players spend resources to perform actions against each other.<br/>Points are gathered by winning control over Cyberpunks and locations. The player with the highest score at the end of the fifth turn wins the game.<br/><br/>Future INC. High-Tech Stakes is a dynamic strategy for everyone who likes power struggle and a poker-like experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>The Peacekeeper is the Guild's massive premiere construct. Its heavy armor and powerful weaponry are offset by a pair of setback Talents that can Paralyze the Peacekeeper or reduce its defense.<br/><br/>Despite its bulk, the Peacekeeper is a very fast model, especially considering it's a Guild model. His movement is slightly above average 5/8, but he is allowed to discard a card to take an additional Walk action each activation due to (+1) Relentless.<br/><br/>The Peacekeeper has two separate abilities it can use to move models. This is a great way to put enemy models into harmful terrain. It is also a great way to get them to drop a Treasure Counter or just move them off the terrain they need to be on for there Strategy or Scheme.<br/><br/>The Peacekeeper is a big mean-looking model and people naturally want to take him out. This is actually a great trick to take advantage of. Many players will concentrate a lot of firepower on the Peacekeeper and ignore the rest of your crew. The fact that the Peacekeeper can survive a beating means they have to dedicate resources for several turns sometimes. Take advantage of this. Let your enemy take out the Peacekeeper while you maneuver to take the Strategies and Schemes you need to win the game<br/><br/>Like most Guild Minions there is not a whole lot of synergy with the Peacekeeper. He works okay in Perdita and Lady Justice crews. He does better in Sonnia Crews because he can use his abilities to push models onto Flame Pillars.<br/><br/>The exception is Hoffman. In a lot of ways they seem made for each other. Hoffman can make the Peacekeeper ignore his Experimental Automation and Faulty Circuits abilities. Meanwhile the Peacekeeper can be a great ride for Hoffman.<br/><br/>Leveticus<br/>This Guild construct is a big brutal enforcer with some solid stats and good Cb. It will return its investment in Scrap Counters on death as well. However, it can be unreliable and is a Control Card hog, so be wary as it could leave Leveticus high and dry. There is no additional benefit to giving this minion Blessings of Desolation.<br/><br/>",

Not all meerkats fight fair, though, and players can employ a number of dirty tricks in order to get one up on his rivals.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is dealt 15 cards in five piles, one card in the first pile, two in the second, and so on. Turn the top card of each pile face up, then place the rest of the deck face down in the middle of the playing area. Someone flips over the topmost card of the deck to create the discard pile, then the chaos begins. Every meerkat clan card features a fighting score. You may place any of your face-up cards on the discard pile so long as its fighting score is one below or one above the number of the topmost card on the discard pile. Once you play a card, you can turn over the topmost card of the pile from which it came. In addition, you can always have five individual piles, so if one pile empties, move any face-up card from an existing pile to create a new one.<br/><br/>Event cards can be played at any time. Slam them down next to the discard pile and shout the name of the card. Play stops so that the event instructions can be carried out, after which a new round begins.<br/><br/>The objective is to get rid of all your cards. This alone, however, is not enough to claim victory as many potential clan leaders have come undone at the last moment. As soon as a player is rid of his last card, any player may slam his palm down on the discard pile to claim the victory.<br/><br/>",

On his turn, a player must displace one of his stones, performing one of the following legal moves: 1) a stone can be moved orthogonally to an adjacent free field, 2) a stone may jump in a straight line over at least one same-coloured stone, and onto the next free field, 3)a stone can jump over at least one same-coloured stone and into a pit occupied by an opponent's stone which is then captured and removed from the game.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to capture 10 stones from his opponent or to leave the opponent without legal moves. If both players have only four stones each in play, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>The 'Trio Trio' Clemens Gerhards' game set (2010 edition) includes rules and components to play this game, along with two additional Frank Stark's games (Trio Trio and Soli-Bi).<br/><br/>",

The period of Haitian history called Salnave&rsquo;s war by some and The War of the Cacos by others saw Haiti split into three competing states and both brilliant naval strategies and inept anti-insurgency campaigns.<br/><br/>The intent of the game is to provide the simple rules, short to medium playing times, indirect player interaction and abstract physical components of a Euro-game and the simulation of strategic combat of a war game.<br/><br/>The game uses a Euro-game approach to simulate the interplay of economics, politics, and military action. This approach is tied to the specific places, personalities, and events of the Caco War to present a compelling way to play out the flow of this intriguing part of history.

        "description": "Factory Fever plays in the warehouse of the Factory Fun factory. Instead of building the machines in your factory, now you must store the products in the warehouse, which is a very different task. What's more, you must store products of the same type in a group or have them connected by conveyors. These products are both dangerous and extremely heavy, so for safety reasons you must not drag them more than once, and all products of one type must be together. Building conveyors helps to connect similar products.<br/><br/>You know which products will need to be stored, but you don't know when and in which combinations, so you must anticipate the future by holding different good options for stocking the goods. The pillar in the middle of your warehouse is as annoying as it was in the factory (Fun) halls.<br/><br/>When your warehouse is finally filled, the game is complete. If each of the six different goods is stored in a single group, you are doing well. For one product that task is easy because you have to store that type of product only once (i.e., 1 tile). The very dangerous product you should place at the wall, and for the mixed product you decide at the end which product type it is. The conveyors should not have dead ends (to the walls or pillar). Each error results in 1 error point, so try to have the fewest errors.<br/><br/>For a new challenge, the B-sides of the boards get used. The player with the best score on the A-sides gets the hardest difficulty level B-side warehouse, and so on.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sellsword is a simplified gaming system that prioritizes play.  Players command small warbands in small unit combat situations.  You can acquire 28mm miniatures from any source you choose.  The skirmish game uses a stat card for each unit, and each card has a brief description of an appropriately sculpted and posed miniature.<br/><br/>Sellsword is frequently played with very limited magic.  It has a number of different fantasy levels, each listed on a particular unit&rsquo;s stat cards.  The more fantastic a unit&rsquo;s abilities, the higher its fantasy level.  This permits each skirmish played to have a cap on the fantasy level, as the players desire.  This is different from a number of roleplaying and skirmish games currently available, where magic runs rampant and high fantasy is the norm.  The Sellsword world is perhaps just a bit darker, and a bit grittier.  In this way, the Sellsword world is also closer to our own earth.  There may be magic, but it is frequently subtle.  In similar fashion, science is very limited in Sellsword.  You may find that a lightning bolt and a bonfire both do similar types of damage.  There is no &lsquo;electrical&rsquo; damage, since electricity does not exist.  Most people in the Sellsword world know that bad things live in the dark corners of the world, that poison and disease are kindred maladies, and that this is the world where they earn their place in the afterlife.<br/><br/>If the game seems a little daunting, don't despair.  The basic game is a good introduction to the system, and you can graduate to the full skirmish game after that.  The skirmish game is designed to be played by friends at home, or in a tournament scene.<br/><br/>For those of you that don&rsquo;t like Grids, we&rsquo;ll have variant rules for that as well.<br/><br/>",

When playing as a judge, a player chooses one &quot;Assignment card&quot; and reads the cooking assignment to the other players, who take on the role of &quot;Chefs&quot;.<br/><br/>When playing as a Chef, a player follows any special rules of the assignment to assemble a hand of &quot;Ingredient&quot; cards and then uses these cards to invent a food dish to present to the judge.<br/><br/>Some example assignments:<br/>&quot;Chef's Choice&quot;: Chefs prepare a single dish of their choice. Judge deals each Chef 7 cards; they may trade in up to 3; they must use at least 4.<br/>&quot;Sabotage&quot;: Judge deals each chef 7 cards and instructs each Chef to pass one card to the player clockwise. Chefs must use the card passed to them in their final dish. After exchanging cards with their neighbors, Chefs may trade in up to 3 and must use at least 4.<br/>&quot;Special Ingredient&quot;: Judge chooses a Special Ingredient of their choice from the Ingredient deck and places it face up on the table, and deals each Chef 7 cards; they may trade in up to 3; they must use at least 3, in addition to the Special Ingredient.<br/>&quot;Distasteful Dish&quot;: Judge deal each Chef 7 cards; they may trade in up to 3; they must use exactly 4 cards to create the worst tasting dish they can think of.<br/><br/>After the Chefs create their dishes, they take turn describing them to the judge, who chooses how to divide up points to the chefs based on the quality of their creations. The role of judge then rotates for the next round.<br/><br/>After all players have had a chance to play the role of judge, scores from each round are tallied up; the winner is the player with the most total points over all rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From publisher's site:<br/>Quadrant 13 (Q13) is a company-sized game covering science fiction warfare aimed primarily at using 6-15mm figures. It uses the same basic mechanics as I Ain&rsquo;t Been Shot, Mum! and/or Charlie Don&rsquo;t Surf, but is as different in flavour from them as they are from each other. It is a stand-alone game: no other rulebooks or supplements are necessary to play.<br/><br/>The rules are completely generic, allowing players to use them to play any sci-fi conflict that they choose: whether based on background from another system, background from a film or book, background from a range of figures, or even a background that they have made up themselves. It also allows gamers to play the type of science fiction game that they want to play: &lsquo;hard&rsquo; sci fi, where realism is the key; space opera style games which run almost like a film; battles featuring a small number of super-tough figures against a large number of not-so-tough opponents&hellip;you name it, you can play it.<br/><br/>Q13 is written by Robert Avery, author of eight scenario books for I Ain&rsquo;t Been Shot, Mum!, all of which are also available from theTooFatLardies.<br/><br/>",

In all the world, no item is more sought after than the Feorhyrnan strawberry: wars have been waged and kingdoms have been lost all in an effort to possess its mysterious, magical fruit.<br/><br/>But that was last year (things are more civilized now); instead of war, the kingdoms of Feorhyrna have agreed to send eight champions to the royal strawberry patch to collect this year's harvest. It's first-come-first-serve, though, and there are no rules about how to divvy up the fruit...but they'll work on that next year. In the meantime, it's time to bust some skulls and grab some strawberries!<br/><br/>Royal Strawberries is a whimsical game of tactics and strategy in which teams of fabulous characters navigate a garden maze and fight for the fabled fruit of Feorhyrna. When the last strawberry is plucked (or the Royal Bazaar is exhausted), the game ends and each kingdom tallies up its victory points (from strawberries and other bonuses): the kingdom with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Players take turns adding a ball of their color to any board hole or 2x2 platform. If the move completes a 2x2 platform containing at least three friendly balls, then the player places another ball on the platform; if that move completes another 2x2 platform containing at least three friendly balls, then the player places another ball on it, and so on. It is possible for a single ball placement to complete multiple friendly-majority platforms, in which case they are each completed with a friendly ball.<br/><br/>A player wins if it's their turn to move and they have no balls remaining. This can occur mid-move when a majority 2x2 platform is completed or at the start of the player's next turn.<br/><br/>Spout is similar to Upper Hand except that a 4x4 board is used, no &quot;wild&quot; ball is needed for the opening move, and there's a next-turn delay on the winning condition (which avoids a significant first player advantage).<br/><br/>For the three-player version of Spout, each player starts with ten balls and only two friendly balls are required to own a 2x2 platform.<br/><br/>",

Players can board enemy pirate ships, fire cannons, and fight the winds as they maneuver their ships around the island.<br/><br/>Players win only after the island's defense have been destroyed and each other player has been eliminated, either through destroying the ship or killing the entire crew.<br/><br/>",

Our Games Gang play-tested 12 new word games.  WOW was undoubtedly the simplest of the 12 games we played, and this is a tough crowd.  But we all loved playing it.  Sometimes simpler is better, especially in a situation like Words Weekend when getting up and running on a new game is so great.  Gloria totally concurs, too.

Words are various - from very easy to very hard. Some are made of several words defining one thing (example: &quot;Silver Medal&quot;). There is also a board with tiles. Each tile is marked with number from 1 to 6.<br/><br/>Alias is played in teams, usually in teams of 2, but more people are also allowed. The &quot;explainer&quot; must change every turn. Each team gets a figure representing them on the board. Their goal is to get through the board. Each time a figure stops one team member must take cards from the pack (not showing it to the other team member(s)) and explain the words on every card that have the same number as the space their figure landed on. The hourglass (also included) is set just before the team member starts explaining the word. (Looking at the first card and thinking about how to explain the word before the time is set is allowed.) The Player must get the other team member to say the word that is written on card by using sentences to describe the word. For example, if the word is &quot;Silver Medal&quot;, a player can say &quot;something that a sportsman wins at the Olympic games&quot;. But if other team member says just &quot;Medal&quot;, it isn't correct. Then the first player must further define what the hint might be. Second player can answer as often as he/she wants until the time runs out. If time runs out or first player accidentally uses the word which is written in card, the team loses a turn. Variations: opposites and/or foreign words are allowed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Near Space is a strategic 4X war game that turns the dice you own into a fleet of ships to conquer the universe. In the game, two fledgling empires stare across the void at one another.<br/><br/>The Terran Alliance explores space eager for new frontiers and resources to exploit. They are a cantankerous collection of conflicting factions united only in their refusal to accept any limitation to their individual ambitions. They are at their strongest &mdash; and happiest &mdash; when challenged.<br/><br/>The Alpha Centauri Regime advances into space to meet the alien threat and eliminate it. They are a single people united under a single banner. The State gives every citizen a purpose, and every citizen gives their all to the State. Anything less is unacceptable.<br/><br/>Now aware of the existence of the other, both sides advance eagerly for the conflict to come. The one thing they share is an appetite for war. Seize the stars!<br/><br/>In game terms, players take on the roles of stellar empires fighting for survival and supremacy amongst the blackness of space. The field of cards between the home worlds of the opposing forces defines Nearspace and the resources that both players have to work with. As players explore their surroundings, each card reveals new threats to overcome and new resources to capture. The war ships that the two opponents bring to battle are dice. Any polyhedral die works as a ship for Near Space. The number of facets on a die are the strength of its armaments and defenses. The more facets, the more powerful the ship and consequently the more costly to field. Polyhedral dice come in a multitude of colors that are used to define the job of a ship and the design specifications involved. Four-sided fighters race forward in the vanguard while d10 battleships bring their firepower to bear at a more ominous pace. Each fleet must explore uncharted space, control colony worlds, pacify unaligned forces, and prepare to battle the ever-advancing enemy!<br/><br/>",

The Union force, badly outnumbered, launched a bold attack that caught the Rebels still encamped. Both sides armies&rsquo; were made up of militia and volunteers who were in combat for the first time. The intensity and casualties sustained in this day&rsquo;s battle surprised many of the officers and further reinforced that this Civil War would not be settled quickly or cheaply. Can you do better?<br/><br/>Terrain scale is about 250 yards per hex, while the infantry and cavalry units are mostly regiments, artillery units are batteries of 4-6 guns. Each turn is about 30 minutes.  Each strength point represents 250 men.<br/><br/>",

Nearly every element of sitting in your tree stand waiting for the big buck to appear is woven into the fabric of this wonderful game. Players pick cards from 4 piles representing different locations in the woods, these cards include the deer, its orientation to the hunter and the range. When a player has all three he can shoot if he has the available tags. The deer are constantly moving and players need to make decisions about using an extra shot, buying an extra deer tag, or a scope.<br/>Hunters can fall asleep, spook deer, and track blood trails if not a clean shot. Not only is it fun for hunters, but non hunters love it too. The player with the most weight wins. There is also two score modifiers, the Deer Magnet razz given to a player who misses his shot, and the Warden who visits once per game. <br/>There is also a legendary King (ghost) Buck that is so elusive the game provides a hall of fame certificate to record any hunter who manages to bag this enormous buck!<br/><br/>",

It has 1 to 4 combatants &quot;Gladiators&quot;, plus Beasts, and Slaves!<br/>The mechanics are slightly similar to Combat in the Lists with a new hex tile game board for the arena, 7 direction movement, new character sheets with abilities, new weapons and armor, beasts; such as lions and bears, slaves &quot;non-trained&quot; combatants, new tactics, and all new images and graphics for cards and components.<br/><br/>Each Gladiator has nine equipment counter locations on his reference card:<br/><br/>Head<br/>Left shoulder<br/>Right shoulder<br/>Chest<br/>Groin<br/>Right hand<br/>Left hand<br/>Right leg<br/>Left leg<br/><br/>These [9] locations can hold [9] different pieces of equipment which can be picked up before the match.<br/><br/>These new counters make up part of the new mechanics of the game where the equipment and weapons are represented by counters and cards!  The counters fit into specific locations on the player&rsquo;s reference cards and are distributed before the match through a process where each Gladiator takes turns picking a certain number of equipment pieces from an rack.  This process can leave the Gladiators with a mix-match of different types of equipment and weapons but also make for a different game each time its played.<br/><br/>Each equipment counter is also represented by a Equipment Defense point card, which is used to keep track of the amount of damage a piece of equipment takes during a combat session.  This new system makes up the other part of the new mechanics for Ave Caesar...  Each piece of equipment depending on its type will use up to three different D6 die to help record the amount of damage that piece of equipment can take before it becomes useless. Once the piece of equipment take its max damage allotment, it no longer prevents damage from hitting the player.<br/><br/>Once equipped, the Gladiators take turns moving, fighting, repositioning, devising tactics and strategies to maneuver into position for the best attack and defense. If a Gladiator is killed all his equipment &ldquo;counters&rdquo; are placed on top of his player piece and are available to any of the combatants in the arena!<br/><br/>Each weapon and piece of equipment has a card explaining the attack and defense characteristics.  Attach and Defense cards are used for combat to help devise a tactical strategy against other players.<br/><br/>This game will consist of the following components:<br/>A combat arena<br/>Gladiator player reference cards<br/>Weapon cards<br/>Equipment Defense point cards<br/>Animal cards<br/>Slave cards<br/>Attack cards<br/>Defense cards<br/>Specialty type cards for combat and defense - Attack and Defense styles<br/>Player game board pieces<br/>Animal game board pieces <br/>Slave game board pieces<br/>Movement cards<br/>etc...<br/>And a new rules book<br/><br/>",

The player with the most diabolical laugh gets to be the first to raid graveyards with the help of Igor and collect Spare Parts such as brains, lungs, and hearts. This loose collection of organs is brought back to the players lab where, with the help of a little electricity,  they attempt to reanimate the undead creations currently on their lab tables. As zombies are completed their uniquely engineered characteristics can be used to interfere with the competition, or speed up your race to victory.<br/><br/>There are 11 different types of zombies each of which has an appropriate and unique cost to go with their ability. Lawyer zombies for instance only need lungs and brains- after all they only need to think and talk. The undead's special abilities are designed to keep competition close and give everyone a chance at victory- a careful mix of luck and strategy. The first player to amass an army of 6 undead creations wins the game and has permission to laugh and cackle manically for as long as they are able.<br/><br/>Players start the game with hand of five spare parts and two zombies recipes. At the beginning of each turn players draw two spare parts cards, and bring in fresh corpses to fill any empty lab tables. Players then play spare parts from their hand to match the costs of zombies they are building. Players can trade spare parts with other players on their turn to try to get the parts they need. When a zombie is completed it's special ability triggers, and it goes into the player's Army Pile. At the end of your turn you discard until your under your maximum had size. Play continues until a player has amassed an army of six zombies.<br/><br/>",

Or at least have as few as possible.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 24 cards numbered 1&ndash;7; players are dealt 3 cards. Each turn starts with that one or several cards are sent to the next player, and then players play one card each. Players who play a card that are not yet in the common pool, place their played card in the common pool. But if there already is a card of that number in the common pool, it's placed in the player's &quot;point&quot; area.<br/>If a player manages to get a total of 12 in his point area, he wins, but the road there is paved with the other players getting into your way, and seven different weird special effects, one of which flips the whole deck face up.<br/><br/>",

Send your Dungeonling Minions to attack and defend, all the while casting powerful, game-changing spells in an epic battle for victory!<br/><br/>Dungeonling:Battle is a dueling card game in a similar style like Magic:tG, but with its own unique elements. Player must gather resources (the Spoils), and play Minion and Spells cards against each other. However, instead of custom deck, player use a shared deck, and the Spoils can be taken and looted away by attacks. And with the 3-Actions per Turn system, Players also have much more freedom in choosing what strategy to take, and not simply restricted by phases. This creates a more dynamic playing field, where a great hand could win you a comeback and net you the victory.<br/><br/>Easy to learn, but with deep strategy. It&rsquo;s a great game for both young and casual gamer, as well as card game veteran alike. It's Time to Battle!<br/><br/>",

In a race against the other players to explore and fortify the Caribbean, the one who can assemble the largest armada will secure ultimate control.<br/><br/>This is a card game that is easy to learn, quick to play, and each game is different with 85 unique crew and ports, plus a variety of resources and ships.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will search for and collect resources, maps, ship plans, and crew references. You will use these to visit exotic ports, construct forts for permanent bonuses, expand your fleet with various ships, and recruit a powerful crew.<br/><br/>The first one to survive the battles and build the largest armada wins!<br/><br/>The game is played exclusively through actions listed on cards in your 'Armada' (cards in play on the table), and a few base actions which are available to every player.  You begin the game with two cards in your Armada (3 in the shorter game), which contain basic actions, such as drawing a new card to your hand. Each player takes as many actions as they would like, and then announces their turn is over, beginning the next player's turn.<br/><br/>Actions are divided into two types based on how often you may use them: one time per turn, and unlimited times per turn.<br/><br/>Through these actions, you will be able to acquire cards to your hand and draft cards from your hand to your Armada. Each card added to your Armada (ports, forts, ships, and crew) will give you additional actions you may perform each turn. You may not use the actions of cards in your hand, but the cards themselves may be spent in various ways (or drafted to your Armada).<br/><br/>In addition, certain cards (such as most ships) are worth between 1 to 4 victory points.  The first player to 8 victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The player with the last gunslinger left alive wins the game.<br/><br/>During the game set up procedure location cards are randomly placed to create a western town for the players to move around. Each location the players visit opens up options that they can interact with to aid them in building up a strong group of gunslingers.<br/><br/>Starting the game with just one gunslinger card each, the players must move around the town and reach specific locations to play action cards, hire gunslingers or buy and sell items or weapons in an effort to build up their posse and eventually shoot it out to the death.<br/><br/>By buying Items or weapons the players can enhance their gunslingers abilities during specific actions, such as giving a gunslinger a holster during a shoot out action will make them faster on the draw.<br/><br/>The action cards get the players gambling at the saloon, mining at the mine, brawling outside the sheriffs office and capturing gunslingers from the rival posses, only then marching them off to the gallows and sending the prisoner to boot hill. Many more actions cards exist that can change the strategies of the game, like the explosion card, that could blow up the train station and thus prevent the only place the players can go to hire more gunslingers, their only choice would be to wait until it was rebuilt.<br/><br/>As soon as one player has hired a gunslinger from the train station, the fighting can begin so you had better earn some cash fast and be that first player or you may be sent to boot hill sooner than you think........<br/><br/>",

A unit's status is tracked on a simple roster that records losses to the unit. Troops also have an assigned relative points value that can be used for play-balance.<br/><br/>Shooting resolution uses a number of six-sided dice (D6), while melee resolution uses the cumulative melee values of the stands engaged multiplied by the result of a single average die (2-3-3-4-4-5) and the totals compared. There is also shock combat resolution to take account of the impetus of charging troops.<br/><br/>A stand of miniatures is removed after a specific number of roster hits are recorded. The amount required varies by the type of unit; for example, peasants remove a stand for every two hits, while knights remove stands after five hits.<br/><br/>Gen D'Armes is a playable set of rules that has stood the test of time and uses some well thought-out mechanics.

An 8x8 board, 16 black and 16 white stones is all you need.<br/><br/>Starting with your stones on the first 2 lines of your side of the board your goal is to move one of your stones to the opponent's end. To get there stones can only move by jumping vertically or horizontally over at least one adjacent stone (or a row of stones) of any color composition onto the next free field. But be careful! Finding the right balance between offense and defense is key. Because whenever you don't jump forward on your turn, your opponent may say &quot;Hop&quot;, forcing you to a second move that MUST be forward. But using the &quot;Hop&quot; rule in the right moment yourself can free the way to victory!<br/><br/>Find the complete rules in the Files section.<br/><br/>",

Each roll represents one day in the journey.  Magi must carry enough food and water (Supply Cards) to get to the next city or oasis.  For each daily roll, the magi must turn in a Supply Card.  If the magi run out of supply cards on the trail, then they must go back and replenish their supplies.<br/><br/>The magi must overcome hazards on the dangerous caravan trails as they cross over mountains and through deserts, such as: blinding sand storms, attacks by robber bands, fog and clouds that obscure the guiding star, and hidden assassin spies. These obstacles can be overcome with the right cards: Tent Cards for sand storms, Weapons Cards for robbers, Compass Cards for fog, and Secret Code Cards for spies.  These Equipment Cards can be obtained at different cities on the trails in the North-- if one can answer a trivia question.  The player can choose from two types of questions: History &amp; Geography, or Biblical Scriptures.  Young children can play without having to answer the questions.<br/><br/>So as well as a Race Game, Stella Nova is a Strategy Game where players must decide which is the most efficient path to take, and what resources and equipment to keep and what to leave behind.<br/><br/>Of course the magi must also obtain the three precious gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh to give to the Christ child.  These Gift Cards are only available a specific cities in the South.<br/><br/>Magi can capture a wild stallion at the oases and get a Wild Stallion Card.  These cards can provide an advantage, such as racing ahead or jumping over other magi, or can give a disadvantage to an opponent, such as going back three spaces.<br/><br/>Stella Nova is a great Party Trivia game too.  Players demonstrate their knowledge by answering questions on Biblical history and geography to obtain the needed Equipment and Gifts Cards.<br/><br/>Note: Stella Nova is an Educational Game for students, because it's historically and geographically accurate.  The cities have their ancient names from the time of Christ.  For example, Yathrib in Arabia is called Medina today.  It was renamed by the Muslim prophet Mohamed in about 622 AD.<br/><br/>",

Players start with one area (size depending on turn order) and claim a new one each turn as long as they last. The other thing a player does on each turn is select one of their sites and roll two dice, with a high enough roll producing oil and a lower roll condemning it to be dry.<br/><br/>Drilling next to producing wells (no matter who owns them) adds a point to the die roll for each such well, making it easier to strike oil. Players can (before rolling the dice) declare that they are going for double or quadruple production, which requires higher rolls.<br/><br/>Players score points for producing wells (more for double or quadruple wells, of course) and bonus points for getting all sites in an area to produce. The first player to reach a target score wins, or the player with the most points if no one manages that.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the company website:<br/><br/>The game is played out between forces composed of several vehicles and infantry squads per side. Each vehicle has a number of design options regarding which weapons are selected, engine size and various offensive and defensive accoutrements such as extra armour, targeting devises, smoke dischargers etc. This means that players can create very different vehicles from the same chassis. <br/>With the infantry we have divided them into a number of categories such as Light Infantry, Assault Infantry, Warriors and Heavy Weapons. Each category has a defined profile, a set of stats, weapons and armour that help it conform to their definition. This means that each type of squad has a particular function on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Light troops for instance move fast across the battlefield are good at scouting out the enemies dispositions and also getting out of trouble fast. Assault troops are designed to get in close with the enemy - they have the armour and firepower to take the fight to their opponents. The Warriors role is obviously to make contact with the enemy and destroy them in deadly hand-to-hand fighting. And Heavy Weapons teams are designed to hang back a bit and support forward units with heavy long-range fire.<br/><br/>Players will therefore need to learn how to use their troops to their best advantage as well as how to combine them with other squads in their force for maximum efficiency and effect. For instance, using light troops to identify targets, using heavy weapons to weaken and suppress the target and then sending in the warriors to finish them off at close quarters. Sounds easy? Not so in practise! What this simply means that it is not just a case of the dude with the biggest gun winning the day (although the game does have plenty of big guns!). The right troops have to be used at the right time in the right way.<br/><br/>The game also includes a number of leader types. These are heroes with certain special skills that will boost the performance of the force. Some of these figures might be just great individual fighters, others may have leadership skills that can enhance the power of the rest of the force.<br/><br/>What is very apparent to players is the amount of choice that they have in creating their force, from vehicle design to infantry squad selection and leader choice. A different army can be assembled for every game. <br/>Most battles will be fought over very challenging terrain. All manner of risks and rewards can be found - from hidden obstacles, explosive and flammable materials but also extra ammunition and weapons. The terrain always plays its part in games of Sulphur.<br/><br/>Another vital component to the game is the use of Asset Cards. These are played and collected during the game to further enhance the performance of a force. Each card is specific to a certain troop type (for example light squad, leader, vehicle etc). Each card will award the player a special skill or piece of equipment that will benefit that squad (and hopefully encourage the player to use the squad to its maximum advantage). These Asset Cards can have great significance in the game and add to the players burden of command and decision making - but they are a lot of fun too, especially when they thwart the plans of your opponent.<br/><br/>And from time to time there are the deadly and unpredictable incursions of Sulphur. The deadly field of  battle is made even more challenging by this unholy threat. Will the combatants form a temporary truce and turn their guns on this new and devastating threat or will they abandon their opponents, withdraw from the field and let them face the terror alone? The menace of Sulphur hangs over every battlefield like a cloud. Most times it does not appear - but the fear and unease that it generates is ever present&hellip;<br/><br/>",

Therefore, challenges have to be overcome by the child or the mother-child combination. Being published in an RPG doujinshi, the game has a lot of flavor text/descriptions.<br/><br/>The players decide when to rest or when to move to a different location (from a set of 6 locations), but otherwise is dependent on the luck of the roll. Each turn (defined as 10 years), unless the mother is resting, a die is rolled to determine the needs of the child and the mother then has to match or come within 1 of that die result. Success leads to a roll on a positive event table (modified by the care attribute/skill) while failure leads to a roll on the risky event table for the current location (which are often but not always negative events). In addition, after handling the events, the player may move the family to an adjacent location.<br/>At the end of each turn, tiredness is checked to see whether the next turn is spent resting. When playing with 2+ players, players in the same location may attack each other to steal loot from each other.<br/><br/>The first player to lead the child to adulthood (which requires 20 units of loot) wins the game. Solo play is mentioned as an option, but no special rules are provided and some of the possible player powers are incompatible with solo play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kings of Sun Tzu is a 2-4 player competitive game played in rounds centered on situational strategies, resource management, and calculated gambles. Each player is a king of a powerful military state, vying to unite and rule all of China.  Players start each round by rolling dice and placing them on the battlefield. Each player must then puzzle out the best move they can make by evaluating dice positions, resources on the battlefield, and the opponent&rsquo;s goals.  Troops, heroes, tactics, and strategies can all be used to alter the outcome as players try to defeat their opponents and be declared the first emperor of China.<br/><br/>Kings of Sun Tzu is inspired by the history of China from around 475 BC through 221 BC known as the &ldquo;Warring States&rdquo; period.  The rulers of many powerful states were embroiled in war to determine who would emerge as the conqueror and king of a unified China.  This is the era in which many military innovations occurred in China; the use of iron weapons over bronze and the modernization of armies with mass infantry, crossbowmen, and cavalry.  Around this time, many intellectual developments were also taking place, such as the Hundred Schools of Thought, which included philosophies like Confucianism and Taoism that were being cultivated and spread across the land.  This period also saw the utilization of many great Chinese military classics, including the most celebrated of them all, Sun Tzu&rsquo;s treatise on military strategy, The Art of War.<br/><br/>",

If the token lands blank side up, there is no effect, and play proceeds as usual. If it lands bad gas side up, immediately move your belt down one notch.<br/><br/>Additionally, neighboring players might be affected by your gas. The player to your left and the player to your right must check to see if they are affected! They each flip the bad gas token. If their flip lands gas side up, then they are forced to purge and immediately move their belt down one notch.<br/><br/>If both your left and right neighbors purged, you are sickened by their acts and must move your belt up by the same number of spaces as the poison you originally received.<br/><br/>Family Business: Blood Brothers and The Moll Expansions<br/>If you currently control the weakest mob (fewest surviving members), you may take the Blood Brothers tile and place it Blood Brothers side up in front of you.<br/><br/>Blood Brothers: Whenever one of your mobsters is added to the Hit List, you must move one mobster already on the Hit List to the space directly in front of your just-added mobster (effectively making them a higher priority on the Hit List). The mobster you move can be one of yours, or an opponent's. If there are no other mobsters on the Hit List then ignore the effect.<br/><br/>When you activate Blood Brothers you must make a choice: either keep the tile Blood Brothers side up, or turn it over to The Moll side.<br/><br/>The Moll: Whenever one of your mobsters is added to the Hit List, you may take a mobster that is controlled by the player that put you on the Hit List and place it on the Hit List in the space behind your just-added mobster. When you activate The Moll, you must flip the tile back over to the Blood Brothers side.<br/><br/>When your mob is no longer the weakest in play, or you are eliminated, you must give the tile to the player with the weakest mob. If there is ever a tie, nobody may control the tile until one player has the weakest mob. When there are only three players left in the game, this tile is taken out of play and is returned to the box.<br/><br/>Zen Garden: Tea House and Tools<br/>Each player begins the game with a Tea House and Tools tile. The tile is placed using the same rules as a lantern tile. However, when you place it, you have a choice which side you want to place face up: Tea House or Tools.<br/><br/>A tea house is treated much like a lantern: it is wild, and it can still be a part of a pattern. However, it cannot be replaced like a lantern. A tools tile can be replaced exactly like a lantern. However, it is a part of NO landscapes. It cannot be a part of any pattern.<br/><br/>",

The first player to unite all of his pieces on the board into a single group wins.<br/><br/>To start, white places one piece anywhere on the 8x8 square board. Players then alternate placing pieces on the board, with the first piece being adjacent to the opponent's most recently placed piece and the second piece being adjacent to no pieces, either orthogonally or diagonally.<br/><br/>Once a player can't place a second piece, the placement phase ends and the next player starts the movement phase. On a turn, a player moves one piece akin to a queen in chess, with movement ending after passing through any number of empty spaces or by landing on an opponent's piece and capturing it. If this move increases the total number of groups on the board &mdash; with a group being a single stone or a series of straight- or diagonally-connected like-colored stones &mdash; then the move is illegal. Gameplay continues until one player unites all of his pieces into a single group; if he simultaneously creates single groups for both players, then the game is a draw.<br/><br/>Instead of using a chess board, Inertia can be played on a hexhex board with pieces moving like hex rooks.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s played with trapezium-shaped pieces on the cells of an initially empty basket-weave grid. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored red; the left and right edges are colored blue.<br/><br/>All pieces are the same and only differ in color. They can be placed with any side (front or back) up. A cell can accommodate two pieces, and no piece can be placed in a way that makes this physically impossible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTwo pieces are point adjacent if they share nothing more than a vertex, and edge adjacent if they share at least part of a side longer than a vertex.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayStarting with Red, the players take turns placing pieces of their own color on empty spaces of the board, one piece per turn.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, for any two point adjacent, like-colored pieces there must be at least one like-colored piece edge adjacent to both.<br/><br/>Passing is not allowed.

        "description": "Four stealthy thieves slip the perimeter security of an anonymous warehouse. Springing through air ducts they silently merge with the shadows that dominate the building&rsquo;s interior. Each criminal tries to outdo the others and reach a vault hidden at the furthest end of the silent storage facility. However standing in their way are the two security guards of the Shadow Shift who relentlessly patrol the darkened corridors trying to apprehend any trespassers.<br/><br/>In Shadow Shift stealth is the name of the game. Criminal players choose to guide their thieves, through the darkened maze of corridors using subterfuge, bluffs, misdirection and cunning to be the first to reach the vault doors. The Security Guards player must use his two Guards and powers of deduction to uncover which of the warehouse&rsquo;s many shadows conceal the criminals.<br/><br/>The object of Shadow Shift depends on what role you choose. Criminals must get from the break-in point, one of four unsecured air vents, to a vault without being detected by a Guard. The Guards must find all of the Criminals before any of them reaches a vault.<br/><br/>Shadow Shift is a point to point movement game where you either have to gaurd a vault or rob a vault. The gaurds spend the games trying to work out which of the many moving shadows are hiding a criminal while not straying too far from the vault lest a criminal sneeks past. The criminal player spend the game shuffling the shadows, confusing the guards and them making a dash for the vault but only when the time is right.<br/><br/>",

All players try to increase their influence with partymembers and their assets such as business, news papers, TV etc. (75 influence cards). Some of the character- and asset-cards show guaranteed votes. The assets must be assigned to a character.<br/>Players can trade their influence cards (assets) freely.<br/><br/>There are 120 event cards with positive and negative effects - so there is a lot of luck. These generate income, which is needed to pay some bad events or the travel-costs from region to region by car or plane, or have direct effects to your political reputation.<br/><br/>The partymembers travel throughout the country canvassing in the regions. Each region has a base resistance of 7. The influence of the canvassing partymember(s) + their assets + D6 must be greater to win the region. Players mark their regions with vote counters - each region is worth 1 vote.<br/><br/>An election is called - 2 ways:<br/>- Automatically after all 50 regions are won, or<br/>- A player can call for an election if he has one of 3 election-card (and only after a minimum of rounds are over, depending on number of players).<br/>Than the last 5 rounds are played. In this &quot;window period&quot; nearly everything is allowed. Players can play special influence cards such as muckrakers, callgirls, third forces or assassins to &quot;destroy&quot; the political reputation or even kill the party leader. Hopefully he has (and can pay) bodyguards ...<br/>Only in this period a player can take a region from another party.<br/><br/>Winning of the game - 2 ways:<br/>- When all other party leaders are killed you win<br/>- After the election, the player with the most votes wins.<br/><br/>",

The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.<br/><br/>",

Not an ambush, as is popularly thought, the battle was actually a meeting engagement. The French in Fort Duquesne, told by scouts that a large British force with guns was approaching, sent elements of the Duquesne garrison on a preemptive strike. The French force met the British vanguard column before they could set up an ambush.<br/><br/>Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat is a two player game with each player taking the side of either the French or the British. Both players have allies to control: the British side American colonial and Indian units, the French side Canadian militia and Indian units.<br/><br/>Braddock&rsquo;s Defeat also is highly suitable for solitaire play.<br/><br/>This game was issued as a separate game as a gift to Gold donors for the 2014 Consimworld Donation Drive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Created in October 2011, Tails and Tactics had been in development for almost two years before being released in July 2013. Creator Pedro &ldquo;Reynard&rdquo; Loustaunau first started with a very serious game concept and quickly found it to be lame. After realizing it needed a sillier tone, he quickly went from &ldquo;a little bit lighthearted&rdquo; to &ldquo;quite a bit silly&rdquo; as he realized Jan&rsquo;s art would be perfect for his new vision of the game. Having found his ad in the programming schedule for Anthrocon 2011, Reynard contacted Jan with his crazy idea for him to become Lead Artist for the project. The ad pointed to Swords and Sausages (now Reynard&rsquo;s favorite webcomic), which showcased Jan&rsquo;s vibrant imagination and his talents as an artist.<br/><br/>Jan quickly became the Lead Artist for Tails and Tactics and development continued for almost two years before finally releasing at Anthrocon 2013. Thanks to the pledges of many wonderful people on IndieGoGo, Series 1 of Tails and Tactics became a reality.<br/><br/>Objective of the Game:<br/>To win. Duh.<br/>In order to do that, though, you must fight through your opponent's front line and attack his or her base enough to deplete its health to 0 - before they do so to you.<br/>Each player begins the game with 30 Base Health. Base Health is lost when a unit controlled by an opposing player attacks your base (represented by you, the player). They may only do so, though, when you have no units on the field to defend with. If you do have units on the field that are able to defend, opponents must remove them before being able to attack your base directly.<br/>1 base health is lost per attack, no matter how powerful (or weak) the attacking unit is. Some powerful units make up for this by having the ability to attack multiple times, so watch out!<br/>Base health may also be lost when an opponent attacks one of your units and you choose to dodge the attack. Any dodged attacks will be applied directly to your base.<br/>Once your opponent's base health reaches 0, you are victorious! Gloating and victory dances are acceptable at this point.<br/><br/>",

Compete against your fellow pirates to hunt and take down merchant ships of varying value in order to increase your overall wealth.  The pirate with the most booty after all merchant ships have been captured becomes the most infamous pirate and wins the game.<br/><br/>The board is made up of hex tiles and can be set randomly or as agreed upon by all players.  The majority of the hexes are open seas, but watch out for obstacles! Sea serpents, giant squid, super volcanoes, ship wrecks, and sand bars all stand in the way of you and your reward.  Navigate through the obstacles by moving in only one direction each turn.  Land on a hex on which a merchant ship lies to capture your booty.  To secure your prize permanently, take the merchant ship to Black Bart's Lagoon.  Be careful to avoid other pirates, as they can steal the ship before you get to Black Bart's Lagoon.  The lagoon, along with the tavern, fortress, and port, are all special hex tiles that serve different purposes in the game.  As you roam the seas, watch out for the navy!  If the naval ship lands on the same hex as you, you are sent back to your home port.<br/><br/>Once a ship is brought to Black Bart's Lagoon and secured, you can either hold on to your booty or invest it in special equipment that could potentially help you commandeer additional ships.  In the end, the player with the most cash in hand, not including special equipment, is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

Start recruiting from the local thuggery and make a name for yourself launching war on this treacherous turf!<br/><br/>Treacherous Turf is a card drafting combat game for 2 players.  Each player draws a hand of seven cards, takes one and passes it on to the other player, until each player has a new hand of seven cards. Players then take turns to place these cards one at a time simultaneously onto one of three arenas. Once all seven cards have been played each arena is totaled, whoever has the most points on their side of the arena gets 1 point.  After each arena has been totaled, the deck is shuffled and the drafting starts afresh.  Play continues until one player reaches 5 points. If two players hit 5 points at the same time, another round continues until one player has more points than the other, revealing a clear winner.<br/><br/>",

Strength Point markers are attached to the back of each stand, and are changed when the unit loses Strength Points as a result of combat.<br/><br/>The ground scale used is very large (1:25,000 in games using 20 mm scale figures and vehicles and 1:50,000 in games using 1:300th scale figures and vehicles).<br/><br/>The game moves represent two hours of actual time.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Babababa Burger, you are working in a busy burger shop.  In order to fill the orders, you'll need to collect the ingredients for making the perfect burger for each customer that comes into the shop.<br/><br/>There are four decks of ingredients: a red deck that includes beef patties and fried eggs, a yellow deck that includes chicken nuggets and french fries, a blue deck that includes pickles and cheese, and a green deck that includes tomatoes and onions.  All four decks also include buns.  You start the game with two food preparation areas and a card from each deck.  Three orders are turned up that can be filled.  A fourth order is turned up on top of the deck, this is a future order that will become available when one of the current orders is filled.  On your turn, you can play ingredients into your two food prep areas.  Then you place your worker token next to one of the four decks.  You draw two cards from that deck and place them under your token.  These cards can be taken when it is your turn again.  If someone also places their token next to the same deck, then you can take those cards at that time.  If at the end of your turn you have more than four cards in your hand, you have to trash ingredients until you are down to four cards.  Once cards are in the trash, you may also send your worker to get ingredients from the trash--with the added benefit that you get to choose which two cards from the trash you put under your token.  The game continues until one of the decks is exhausted.  Add up the total value of the orders each player has filled.  The player with the highest value wins.<br/><br/>",

For each success the model can take an action. For each failure the enemy protagonist has a chance to react. If two failures are rolled the player's turn ends and passes to the other player.<br/><br/>From the publishers website:<br/><br/>A Fistful of Kung Fu brings the hyper-kinetic, bullet-spraying, demon-slaying, kung-fu-fighting action of Hong Kong movies and Asian cinema to the wargames tabletop. In a modern world walking a precarious line between the advances of next-generation technology and the tradition and mysticism of ancient cultures, Kung Fu schools face off in no-holds-barred tournaments, corporations hire agents and spies to steal each other's secrets, overworked SWAT teams respond to gunfights between feuding Triad and Yakuza clans, and ancient artefacts are sought by hopping vampires, demon sorcerers and cyborgs alike. Combining the gunfights of John Woo&rsquo;s Hard Boiled, the hand-to-hand combat of Enter the Dragon, the sheer mystical weirdness of Big Trouble in Little China, the wuxia action of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and everything in-between, A Fistful of Kung Fu is a skirmish wargame unlike any other<br/><br/>",

The goal is to be the first to use all one's Trilos or, if reaching an unplayable position, to score the fewest points on remaining Trilos.<br/><br/>Rummy Trilo &ndash; three players draw seven Trilos and privately try to match a pattern drawn in the rulebook, taking turns swapping out pieces until someone completes the pattern.<br/><br/>Crazy Pavement &ndash; a more complicated version of Stones and Windows, with players trying to match pieces around the numbered sides of the small board, tracking several different ways to score points.  When the game becomes unplayable, the score determines the winner.<br/><br/>Khuti &ndash; two players lay Trilos on the larger board (which features a grid of twenty-two triangles,) attempting to fill the board while outscoring each other.<br/><br/>Khefren &ndash; two players engage in a slightly less difficult version of the above game, Khuti.<br/><br/>Two Patience Games &ndash; there are two solitaire games included in the rules, Pyramid Patience and Trilex Patience.<br/><br/>Troulette &ndash; a game of chance utilizing a scoring board drawn in the rules and the Trilos pieces.<br/><br/>",

Opposing squads draw one of the 20 missions offering a large variety of tactical challenges that reflect historical tactics and weapon effects.<br/><br/>Stats and weapons for American, Commonwealth, Soviet, German, Italian, Japanese, and Partisans forces are included. Additional appendix expands the game into the Korean War with new weapons and missions.<br/><br/>Monstrous tanks, zooming jeeps with 30 cal blazing, flame throwers and mortars raining death, along with random battlefield events, create a chaotic and dangerous battlefield where a realistic morale system recreates the reactions of soldiers and their squad leader's attempts to motivate them.<br/><br/>A complete campaign lets you keep the same squad over multiple games (if you can keep them alive). Survivors gain experience and skills, scrounge for weapons and gear, and try to get some sleep before drawing replacements and ammunition for the next patrol.<br/><br/>",

Some cards, or combinations of cards, are explicit in their depiction of sex and violence, which will either put players off the game or push them to create the wildest stories possible.<br/><br/>",
