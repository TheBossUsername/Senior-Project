        "description": "Promotional card offered to the winners of the official &quot;Challenge of the Gods&quot; 2021 qualifying tournament.<br/><br/>This unique card is the only one to offer 3 different effects: immediate, reinforcement (activation), and permanent!<br/><br/>The Horn of Plenty card has 3 types of effects. The immediate effect is on the front of the card. Once the feat is completed, turn the card over to find the reinforcement (activation) and permanent effects on the back.<br/><br/>Immediate Effect: Choose one side of each of your dice. Replace your dice on your Inventory displaying the chosen faces. Apply the powers of the displayed dice faces, as if you were receiving favours from the gods.<br/><br/>Permanent effect: Choose a face on your clear die. Replace it on your Inventory with the chosen side showing and apply its power, as if you were receiving a minor favour.<br/><br/>Reinforcement Effect Activation Condition (activation): After you have been chased by another player.<br/><br/>Reinforcement Effect (Activation): Choose a side on your dark die. Place it back on your Inventory with the chosen face up and apply its power, as if you were receiving a minor favour. Then give this card to the player who kicked you out. He is the new owner (until he is kicked out in his turn).<br/><br/>Important: The immediate effect is only fulfilled when the player who normally performs the feat first acquires the card. Players who get the card by chasing the card owner can only get the permanent and reinforcement (activation) effects.<br/><br/>Note: Only the player who owns the card at the end of the game scores the 10 victory points granted by the card.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to reach the appetizing greenery before the competition.<br/><br/>In this push-your-luck game, the players will have access to four consecutive decks of cards, coloured green, yellow, orange and red respectively. Starting with the green deck, the player will draw cards, having the option to either stop afterwards or draw a card from the next deck of cards. Each consecutive deck contains more interesting cards that the last while also being more dangerous.<br/><br/>To move forward, the player must draw Raindrop cards in the decks, and will move forward from as many spaces as the number of raindrops they drew that turn. But the decks also contain Sun cards that will force the player to move their snail backwards and end their turn immediately.<br/><br/>There are also several item cards, such as the Salad, which prevent the player from moving backwards when drawing Sun cards, or the Umbrella, which prevents another player from moving during their turn.<br/><br/>The first snail to reach the garden wins!<br/><br/>",

If a non-matching fish part is flipped, return all flipped cards face-down (memory style).<br/><br/>Game ends when all 12 fish have been built.<br/>The winner is the one with the most cards.<br/><br/>The game includes 36 playing cards and 4 rule cards.<br/><br/>Longfish can be played in 3 different modes: match, build, and fish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The assassination of Archon Melissa Steiner-Davion in 3055 sent shockwaves throughout the Federated Commonwealth. In the secessionist Isle of Skye, it lit the fires of rebellion once again. The Free Skye Separatist movement brought things to a boil in April 3056 on the insignificant world of Glengarry. Only one obstacle stood in their way: the venerable Gray Death Legion mercenary command.<br/><br/>With the bulk of the vaunted mercenaries stationed elsewhere, the Skye Separatists believed the planet Glengarry would fall quickly. The cadets and reserve units of the Gray Death Legion, under the command of Alexander Carlyle, son of their decorated leader Grayson Carlyle, had a different opinion. What followed was a savage guerilla war, with the fate of Glengarry and the entire Isle of Skye region hanging in the balance...<br/>Historical Turning Points: Glengarry extracts the details from the classic Gray Death Legion scenario book Day of Heroes and the novel Blood of Heroes and represents it in the phenomenally successful Jihad Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to an earlier time in BattleTech history, when rumors of rebellion and strife threaten to tear apart the fabric of the mighty Federated Commonwealth!<br/><br/>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the world of Glengarry, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage up to a world-wide invasion. Only the players' imaginations are the limits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the Fourth Succession War, the fiercest fighting lay along the contentious Draconis March, pitting the elite DCMS not against the forces of the Federated Suns, but against a singular mercenary enemy: Wolf's Dragoons. The firestorm that erupted on Misery fanned the hatred of Coordinator Takashi Kurita, who gave his now-famous &quot;Death to Mercenaries!&quot; edict and directed nearly the entire might of the Galedon Military District against the three worlds garrisoned by the Dragoons.<br/>Operational Turning Points: Death to Mercenaries picks up where Historical Turning Points: Misery leaves off, opening up the battle for players to join in the fight using the successful Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to one of the defining moments of Dragoon lore as they held the line against the honorable samurai of the Dragon.<br/><br/>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual Missions and Touchpoints, following a campaign arc, and inserting it into their own campaigns. This PDF exclusive includes detailed information on the worlds involved, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict, an overview of the historical campaign, and several tools and tracks that players can use to run historical characters and battles from this time period.

        "description": "In late 3048, Kerensky's Clans voted to invade the Inner Sphere. The leaders of Clan Wolf, staunch opponents of the invasion, immediately called for a Trial of Refusal against the vote. Desperate to prevent invasion, the Wolves faced incredible odds and the might of four opposing Clans. After the Refusal, all seventeen Clans met in a series of bitterly fought Placement Trials to determine who would spearhead the invasion. However, not all of the Clans that remained behind in Clan space were happy with the trials' outcome. In 3049, once the invasion began in earnest, Clan Ice Hellion took matters into its own hands.<br/><br/>Operational Turning Points: REVIVAL Trials puts players in the middle of the most pivotal events in Clan history. Using the Turning Points PDF exclusive format, players can fight the Wolves' iconic Trial of Refusal, vie for a coveted Operation REVIVAL invasion corridor, or wage war against their neighbor Clans.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 3055, an unknown pirate menace threatened several Lyran border worlds. Known only as the &circ;_&Ntilde;??Red Corsair,&circ;? this brutal pirate leader broke several militias and preyed upon its victims with no mercy. In response to ComStar's pleadings, forces from Clan Wolf and the famed mercenary Kell Hounds pursued the mysterious pirate band across several Lyran worlds to a climactic showdown deep in Clan Wolf space.<br/><br/>Operational Turning Points: Red Corsair opens up the battle for players to join in the fight (as detailed in Michael Stackpole's novel Natural Selection) using the successful Turning Points PDF exclusive format. Return to a time when tensions were high along the Lyran-Falcon border, and one wrong move might spark another interstellar war!<br/><br/>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual Missions and Touchpoints, following a campaign arc, and inserting it into their own campaigns. This PDF exclusive includes detailed information on several of the worlds affected by the Red Corsair, a rundown of the forces involved in the conflict, an overview of the historical campaign, and several tools and tracks that players can use to run historical characters and battles from this time period. Only the players' imaginations are the limits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wolfs' Dragoons, one of the Inner Sphere's most enigmatic mercenary units in the early thirty-first century. The Draconis Combine Mustered Soldiery, one of the most honorable and ruthless military forces among the Great Houses. On the tiny planet of Misery, the culmination of political plotting, jealousy, and fanaticism played itself out to a bloody, exhaustive end.<br/>The extension of the stubborn wills of Jaime Wolf and Takashi Kurita, Misery became a bloody milestone in the history of the Dragoons and a shocking embarrassment to the Dragon's throne. Forever after, Misery became synonymous to both forces as a symbol of pain, dishonor, and unshakable devotion.<br/><br/>Historical Turning Points: Misery returns to an earlier time in BattleTech history, when the mysterious Dragoons were manipulated into a life-or-death battle by the jealousy of a Kuritan warlord, and nearly paid the ultimate price just to survive.<br/><br/>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns and even create their own scenarios. This PDF exclusive includes a detailed map of the world of Misery, a run down of the forces involved in the conflict, and several tracks that players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles, or stage the complete, desperate battle for survival.

Everyone who was anyone in the industry had come together for the new edition of the &quot;Schlager-Megaparade&quot;. The Christmas edition of Germany's most successful TV entertainment show was to be recorded in midsummer of all times. For it neither costs nor efforts were spared! Presenter and pop star Michael Prinz would again present a mix of well-known stars and promising newcomers. The show with snow cannons and a skating reindeer ballet should not only provide for Christmas mood in the living rooms of the spectators, but also strongly boost the record sales of the performing artists.<br/><br/>The recording began punctually at 6:30 p.m. in the sold-out Magdeburg Stadthalle. All the artists were eagerly awaiting their turn. But shortly after the show began, a shrill scream echoed through the hall: a production assistant had found the artist Janine Bayer dead in her dressing room. The singer, who had won the industry award &quot;Der Goldene Gockel&quot; a few weeks ago, was supposed to present her new No. 1 hit &quot;Ich tr&auml;um von mir heut Nacht&quot; that evening.<br/><br/>Of course, you immediately called an ambulance and the police. But the emergency services that were called in could only determine Janine's death. Apparently, the victim was beaten to death with her own prize statue. While you now wait for your interrogation, you are left on your own with the question: What happened that day? How could this hit fest end so tragically?<br/><br/><br/>         Players<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>4 female and 3 male roles (with 7 people).

The terrain will make it a difficult task. If they fail, the Allied forces will launch a counter-attack with the aim of driving the Japanese into the sea.<br/><br/>The system focuses on the effect prolonged periods of combat in difficult terrain had on combat units. Units which fight for too long without respite are vulnerable to counter-attack. Each side must manage their forces with respect to fatigue, which represents combat exhaustion and ammunition expenditure, and the inherent logistical difficulties this campaign posed.<br/><br/>Can the Japanese capture Port Moresby? In this simulation they can, but it is difficult.<br/><br/>Also challenging is the task of crushing the Japanese beachheads on the north coast.<br/><br/>Purchase via direct digital download at : <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.wargamevault.com/product/379181/Operation-RI?src=hottest\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.wargamevault.com/product/379181/Operation-RI?src...</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Make the most of being stuck at home with the Monopoly At Home Reality game. This family board game celebrates the new way of living. Board spaces are rooms in the house -- the bedroom is the office, the living room is the movie theater, and the kitchen is the school.<br/><br/>The gameplay is similar to the standard Monopoly board game but with humorous differences. Tokens can't share a space because of social distancing, and players will want to watch out for the screaming child because they'll have to pay to entertain the kid.<br/><br/>This version of the Monopoly game makes the most of life at home with social distancing and missed activities like visiting a movie theater, yoga studio, and more.<br/><br/>     HILARIOUS TOKENS: Racecar with parking boot, Rubber duck with babies, T-Rex with boxer shorts, smaller dog, penguin with coffee cup, Cat with bath cap., <br/>     UPDATED UTILITIES AND HOME-THEMED BOARD SPACES: In this family board game, WiFi and video streaming are necessary utilities, and board spaces are places in the home, such as the kitchen turned school.<br/>     AVOID THE SCREAMING CHILD: When a player moves their token, they also move the screaming child; if the tokens land on the same space, the player must pay to entertain the screaming child.<br/><br/><br/>&quot;Community Chest&quot; becomes the &quot;Community Cupboard&quot;. Chance is still called Chance, but is now illustrated with boxes shipped from online orders.<br/><br/>The money tweaks the classic design to look like a house, and each denomination features different food items inside the 'house'.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Innomination, the customizable card game. Set in a world of Science Fantasy, select a Nation of various humans, lizardman, or giant insects, pick a leader, make a deck, and battle with another player. This is a one-versus-one game where you win by defeating your opponent. The language on cards does allow play with more than two players (but the game isn't competitively balanced around this).<br/><br/>Innomination is a customizeable card game with deckbuilding elements. It similar play structure to games like Magic: The Gathering with elements from Yu-Gi-Oh!, Force of Will TCG, and the Pokemon TCG. Digital card games like Hearthstone and Shadowverse were also in mind. If you've played any of these, Innomination may feel familiar to you.  Innomination is not a trading card game (TCG). It is to be sold as a complete game right out of a box, like a board game. You'll get a full playset of every card. No rarities, no booster packs, no time spend scouring the secondary market for singles... Open the box knowing you have a complete card game.<br/><br/>Every turn, you will set a Source card into play. Source cards produce Aether, the main resource used to play cards in your hand. The better the card is, the more Aether it costs. Unlike most games, the Source cards are in their own deck, and you get to choose which card you put into play every turn. There are six nations, each one with their own people, culture, and each specializing in an archetype, like aggro (win early with cheap, efficient cards), midrange (playing progressively stronger cards), and control (hold on until the late game and win with powerful, expensive cards).<br/><br/>The Named Deck is the main mechanic of Innomination. Use the Named Deck to name (evolving) your nameless cards in the Main Deck into upgraded versions. You can only do this as a player action once per turn, but there are many Nations that have ways to do this multiple times.<br/><br/>",

So players only have to get to something-meru in order to identify the card in question. However, the kanji are so tricky, and the game gives no assistance to help the readers, so there is no expectation for anybody to read it correctly, not the reader nor the players.

You can change the circuit board's pathways, or force your opponents to move when they don&rsquo;t want to. The goal: build and negotiate the pathways to reach your charge point, before returning to the master node and eliminate other players.<br/><br/>How to Play: <br/>Take circuit-board card #1 and put it with the numbered side face-up between all the players. Each player chooses a coloured pawn and places it on the matching coloured NODE of card #1.<br/><br/>The CHARGE POINT circuit-board cards (#2-#7): each have a different coloured charge point.<br/> Each player takes the CHARGE POINT card that corresponds to their pawn's colour and the rest of the CHARGE POINT cards are now put away and no longer used.<br/>The remaining circuit-board cards (#8 - #30) are shuffled and each player is dealt an additional 3 so each player now has 4 circuit-board cards in hand (which includes their CHARGE POINT card). The rest is put away.<br/><br/>The gold-back mini cards (movement and certain action cards) are shuffled and placed in their own deck (face down). The green action mini cards are separated into their own corresponding piles (6 of them) and placed face up.<br/><br/>Turns: <br/>Each turn a player selects 2 mini cards of any combination that they wish to take. <br/> A player can have as many mini cards in hand as they wish, and may play any amount of mini cards in any order during their turn<br/><br/>Each turn a player may also play (but does not have to) a single circuit-board card at any point in their turn, any way up and in any orientation, as long as it connects to a corresponding edge of another card (i.e. longest edge to longest edge, etc - you get the gist).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bloody Retribution: The Battle of Inkerman is a two-player Grand-Tactical level board-wargame of the largest Russian offensive of the Crimean War. Even so, both players have the necessity of both attacking and defending. It uses the alternating-actions system introduced in Paper Wars issue no. 93 Wagram and issue no. 98 Alma games.<br/><br/>The emphasis is on players&rsquo; mastery of overall operations rather than the minutiae of tactics. In effect, they role-play the supreme commanders, not the whole chain of command as is common in most complex tactical-level games. It&rsquo;s a mechanically simpler approach that is at the same time more realistic, given the fact no individual in such situations would have the timely knowledge needed to make detailed decisions.<br/><br/>The battle was personally ordered by the Czar as a final attempt to break the Allied siege lines along Sevastopol&rsquo;s southern perimeter. The British were initially caught by surprise along the steep slopes of Mount Inkerman. Both sides threw in everything they had available, hoping for a decisive victory. That made for a fierce day of back and forth combat characterized by soldier-level heroism and high-command incompetence. In the end the Russians retreated, but it was a near-run thing that could&rsquo;ve gone either way.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 200 yards (183 meters) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver are brigades, regiments and battalions. Each full turn represents one or two hours of real time. The first two turns were dominated by dense fog across the whole battlefield; therefore they each represent two hours to take into the account the inescapably slower tempo of operations under such conditions. Artillery is represented abstractly via bombardment markers. There is one full sheet of 228 medium-size (5/8&rdquo;) iconic counters. Playing time is about three hours, and complexity is low-intermediate.<br/><br/>Published in Paper Wars issue 100<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players have the opportunity to stick their opponents with the painful penalty cards.  If they feel brave, they can try to collect all of the penalty cards and bring down their opponents' scores even more. Sichere Six begins as a free-for-all.  As the game progresses, temporary partnerships will form, backstabbery will ensue, and only one will escape Fate's game with the victory.<br/><br/>Over the course of no more than nine rounds, players will be trying to collect as many tricks as possible while avoiding dirty tricks that contain 9's.<br/><br/>During each round, the player who first collects a 9 becomes The Chosen and is granted Fate's Mercy. They get to exchange one card with the kitty.  If they are feeling brave enough, they can try to collect all of the 9's and trigger the special scoring known as Fate's Mirth.<br/><br/>The first player to earn 9 points wins the game.  If the game does reach the final round, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

On the front of the card is a picture, while on the back the rules are laid out neatly.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to color in the hearts in different colors. One player takes the inside of the hearts, while the other takes the outside. You score points for hearts that are not next to, i.e. that don't fall into the same row and column as, a heart of the same color. To play, lay the card flat on the table. Label the columns 1-3 and the rows 4-6. Next, choose a different color for each roll of the die, so 1 might be red, 2 might be orange, and so on.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll three dice, then allocate one of the results to a column, one to a row, and one to a color, then fill in a blank heart in that column and row using that color. So if you roll 3, 4, 6, then you could fill a heart in column 3 and row 4 with color 6, or you could fill a heart in column 3 and row 6 with color 4. The game ends when all hearts are colored, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The warrior ways of the Dothraki might make them appear as simple barbarian savages, screaming into the sky as they charge into battle. And many commanders have underestimated them because of those stereotypes. A Dothraki will spend more time on their horse than they will off of it, and with that experience comes skill that regular training will never achieve. Despite being unarmored, it is still difficult for a trained swordsman to land a significant hit on a mounted Dothraki.<br/><br/>The Dothraki Screamers unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives Targaryen commanders a solid cavalry unit for their forces. These fearsome fighters can charge quickly into battle, dealing out deadly blows. Skilled commanders will use them as a lightning-fast strike force, avoiding getting them into protracted combats, lest their fewer numbers start to catch up with them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In October 1740, Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI ate a poisonous mushroom and died, leaving no sons. Over the weeks that followed, one European power after another reneged on their promises to support his daughter Maria Theresa&rsquo;s inheritance of the &ldquo;crown lands&rdquo; of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary. In December the newly-crowned King Frederick II invaded Austrian territory without the courtesy of a declaration of war.<br/><br/>Maria Theresa&rsquo;s ministers counseled compromise. Her husband urged Maria Theresa to placate Frederick with gifts of territory. The 23-year old Archduchess refused. &ldquo;I found myself,&rdquo; she wrote later, &ldquo;without money, without credit, without an army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because each one of them wanted to wait and see how things would develop.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The War of the Austrian Succession would last for eight years and eventually involve almost all of Europe. The resolve of Maria Theresa and the fierce loyalty of her soldiers assured that Austria would not perish.<br/><br/>Pragmatic Sanction is a complete game for two to eight players, based on the events of the War of the Austrian Succession. Players represent the crowned heads of the great powers of Europe: Austria, Prussia, Russia, Sweden, Britain, France, Spain and the Ottoman Empire. It uses the same game engine as our Soldier Kings game, and is very similar to Soldier Emperor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each coin has a number of different characteristics. Your task is to locate sets of three coins where each of these characteristics is either all different, or all the same. And you have to do it quickly &ndash; because everyone&rsquo;s competing at the same time and waiting for the opportunity to spot patterns, shout &ldquo;Set!&rdquo; and claim the coins for themselves.<br/><br/>The game is played exactly like Set, but the rules simply state the winner is the person who manages to find the most sets during the course of the game. The game ends when the bag is empty and no more sets can be found.&quot;.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s trickier than it might seem, because every one of every coin&rsquo;s four defining characteristics needs to be considered. As a result, Coin Set is a test of your observation and thoroughness as well as how quick-witted you are. If you think you&rsquo;ve found a set, but have failed to consider one of the characteristics, you&rsquo;ll lose three of the coins you&rsquo;ve collected so far. So you need to pay real attention to detail, thinking fast but not being too hasty. One thing is for sure: keeping a cool head will help you find order in the chaos.<br/><br/>Legend has it that these coins were found at the bottom of the Med by none other than Jacques Cousteau. But whatever the backstory, Coin Set is a quick and quirky brain-teaser, a fast-paced and intermittently frenetic way to test your attention to detail and your ability to see a slightly bigger, more complex picture than one coin alone can show you. Plus: it&rsquo;s small enough to fit in your pocket, and encased in a robust little tin that&rsquo;ll keep it safe wherever you might take it.<br/><br/>",

Choose any kakuro and place it in the magic board. The rules of the game: Each player now has 1 minute, clockwise, to place numbers on the board. The time is measured by the hourglass. Players receive points as follows:<br/><br/>     1 point for each correct number<br/>     3 points for each number that completes a group<br/><br/><br/>Example: If a player places 2 numbers correctly on the board and another number that completes a group, he receives 5 points for it (2 points for the 2 numbers and 3 points for the number that completed the group).<br/><br/>The bonus points are awarded only if the player can complete a full group within his minute (there are no bonus points for completing a group already partially placed by other players).<br/><br/>If a player places a number incorrectly, his turn ends immediately. In addition, the wrong number is removed from the board again. The player who notices a wrongly placed number receives the number of points for a correctly placed number. The game ends when the Kakuro is completely solved. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>_________________<br/><br/>One year earlier in 2005 JUMBO started the mini-series of 'Japanese Cult Riddle Games' with Code Sudoku.<br/><br/>",

Ruled and guided by the enigmatic Ethereals, the T&rsquo;au seek to unite every sentient being under the light of the T&rsquo;au&rsquo;va, or Greater Good. They prefer that others join this growing alliance willingly, but do not hesitate to use force to fulfil their destiny wherever they must. At the forefront of this fight are the Hunter Cadres of the Fire Caste. Comprising highly mobile and well-armed soldiery, led and supported by veteran warriors piloting deadly battlesuits, gunships and strike fighters, these armies sweep all before them in a blizzard of devastating firepower. Signature battle strategies such as the decisive Mont&rsquo;ka or the cunning ambush of the Kauyon see the enemy outmanoeuvred at every turn, while their potent blend of technological might and ideological fanaticism ensure the T&rsquo;au achieve victory after victory.<br/><br/>This 136-page book comprehensively covers the T'au Empire. It has everything you need to bring the technological might of the T'au to bear on the tabletop in order to expand the empire, plus a selection of lore and art to inspire your own collection.<br/><br/>You will need a copy of the Warhammer 40,000 Core Book to use the contents of this supplement.You will need a copy of the Warhammer 40,000 Core Book to use the contents of this supplement.<br/><br/>",

The play order stays the same throughout play. Players create two score sheets, one for each of the left and right hand neighbors at the table. At the end of the game, each player will receive points for the number of gifts shown on the cards they collect for each of the scoring categories on the score sheet. Before play, decide whether the play will be &quot;generous&quot; or &quot;greedy.&quot;<br/><br/>Beginning with the first player and proceeding in order, turn gifts face-up from the top of the draw pile until there are six or more gift icons showing. Choose who will get which cards. In &quot;generous&quot; mode, you must give away all but one card (but may give away all of them). In &quot;greedy&quot; mode, you must give away at least one card (but may give away as many more as you like, up to all of them). Players negotiate and make suggestions about who should get which cards, but ultimately, the current player decides. You cannot refuse a gift.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, count up the number of each kind of icon, and score points for each according to how your neighbors filled out the two score sheets they passed to you, except that you don't score any points for the type of icon you collected the most.<br/><br/>",

Don't expect to be alone.<br/><br/>Dungeonrunner is a solitaire card game inspired by classic pen and paper fantasy RPGs. The player takes a hero on a quest through one of nine adventure decks. Each adventure deck is filled with danger and peril as the player guides the hero through hazardous traps, countless monsters, and dreaded curses.<br/><br/>Each deck of 54 cards make up ten separate adventures with varying difficulty. Infiltrate Emperor Zinn&rsquo;s castle with the Lowly Thief, trudge through Muck Elf Swamp with the Amazon Warrior, or if you dare, confront the Demon Queen, Lawnadynn with the Paladin of Truth!<br/><br/>Each turn, you play a card from the adventure deck. It may be a monster, trap, event, or item. Once that card is resolved by combat or your decisions, you draw the next card. If you can make it to the quest card for the given scenario, the hero completes the adventure!<br/><br/>",

Your task is to spend their money wisely to get goods that are worth points. Additionally, you have secret tasks and privileges that will sway how you bid.<br/><br/>To set up, one player takes the role of auctioneer and deals each other player a face-down agent card that includes a breakdown of all 27 artifacts in the game, while listing that player's specific privileges, such as receiving extra money for winning certain types of auctions. The auctioneer records the starting funds for each player &mdash; $40-50M depending on the player count &mdash; and sets up the artifact deck by shuffling three gift cards with the 27 artifacts. Only 10-20 items will be sold during the game, with that number being determined by the player count.<br/><br/>For each auction, the auctioneer reveals the item, then conducts the auction specified by that item, such as an open auction in which players write bids on their personal boards and raise them, an auctioneer bid in which the auctioneer calls out amounts and players lower their hand to drop out, a sealed bid in which agents reveal their bids simultaneously, and a second price bid in which the winner pays only the amount of the second-highest bid. If the auctioneer reveals a gift card from the deck, this gift goes to the player who won the most recent bid.<br/><br/>The auctioneer tracks the funds that all players have available, and an agent must track their own holdings &mdash; and everyone else's &mdash; mentally.

        "description": "Pangaex is a world-conquering game with aspects of Risk, Catan, and Terraforming Mars. The game is played on a modular board (81 2&quot;-square tiles), each of which indicates one of the following resources: Culture, Food, Weapons, Commerce, Mountains, or Lakes. Each player starts with a Capital game piece and two village game pieces, which are placed in a snake-draft system. Each player also begins with some resources and a soldier, who begins the game on the Capital tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in two repeating phases: Production phase (collecting resources based on villages and/or soldiers in play), and Action phase. The Production phase happens simultaneously, where all players collect resources at the same time. The Action phase is where the bulk of the game is played. Players can move their soldiers; they can also use resources to build villages, train soldiers, and even convert enemy villages to their own culture. Like Terraforming Mars, each player may take up to two actions on their turn--however, a pass is not a pass for the whole Action phase, but merely a pass on a given turn. The Action phase ends when all players have passed consecutively.<br/><br/>Soldiers are more than just soldiers in Pangaex. Soldiers raze enemy villages, but they also help to rebuild their own villages. They prevent peaceful cultural conversion, and they even collect resources at times.<br/><br/>When any player plays their final village, the game ends after the Action phase concludes (i.e. final village signifies final round, not final play). Points are awarded for villages on the board, enemy villages that you've collected (by razing or converting), and other metrics to balance out the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The leaders of the USA, UK, France and USSR &ndash; the four most powerful countries in the world - are meeting to foster peace between East and West and to stave off the rapidly growing divide now dubbed The Cold War. Naturally, the summit will be neck-deep in spies, rumours and complex loyalties. But as head of the Swiss security forces, you must descend into this miasma of truth and half-truth, for you have learned there are traitors here, anarchists that would gladly catapult the world into lawless chaos. Can you identify all of the anarchists before they derail the summit and threaten global security?<br/><br/>Each card in the deck represents a person who was actually present at the 1955 Geneva Summit, from Ike Eisenhower, US President, down to Germaine Goutte, French Personal Assistant. A pile of random anarchists is dealt at the start of the game, with the remaining cards acting as informants from which you might extract clues. A cunning series of icons lets you compare the front of an informant with the back side of a hidden anarchist to detect whether they match by suit, value, or as a multiple or factor of the value. By clever hand management and astute use of clues you may deduce the suit and rank of each anarchist. But can you find them all before your clues run out and they act?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It gains an additional hit point over its American friend, but at the cost of two crew slots and the Arrow Shot special rule (which means it is less likely to cause critical hits). This means that straight of the box it will hang around longer, but possibly at the cost of dealing less damage&hellip; but if you are in the fight for one extra round that may be all the time you need to win the game! If you are looking to reduce the cost of your tank you can upgrade the gun to an OQF 3-inch Howitzer MK.I which removes the Arrow Shot rule and gives your tank High Explosive.

        "description": "&quot;Rainbow ore is a legendary mineral that is more beautiful than any mineral. Many alchemists are trying to figure out how to make Rainbow ore from different minerals. Every day these alchemists have to find the necessary ore. But finding the required ore is not an easy task. They may have to rely on some luck sometimes. Sometimes it may be ore, But sometimes it might get a stone.&quot;<br/><br/>Prime Stone is an educational board game designed for classroom use. The game rules are simple enough to develop calculating skills, which are a necessary basis for learning mathematics at a higher level. The prime Stone game can be used to educate about integer factorization and review content such as the greatest common divisor and least common multiple, prime numbers, composite numbers, powers, and other related topics. Teachers can use it to schedule classroom activities and play outside of school hours. Parents can play with their children to help them improve their math skills.<br/><br/>Players can choose to do one of three things: Pick, Mix and Build. Details are as follows: 1) Take two tiles from the bag and place them in front of the player. If the player picks up one stone tile, the player places the picked tile in front and puts the stone tile back into the bag. 2) Combine two or three tiles placed in front of the player using Multiply and put the old and new tiles back into the bag. 3) Create Rainbow ore from the target card. Using two or three tiles placed in front of the player multiplies any number of the target cards. Players can use those two or three tiles to create rainbow ore by having the player put the tile used to create it back into the bag. Then put the target card in front of the player and put the number of stone tiles specified in the target card into another player's bag. (will give stone tiles all with one player or distributed to multiple other players) and then open a new target card to replace it.<br/><br/>There are two conditions to ending the game, either 1) the player generates eight rainbow ore or 2) the player collects four target cards. When one of the players meets the condition, play that round as the last round and count rainbow ore number. The player with the most number of rainbow ore is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ロジカル真王 (Logical Thinking) is a two player deduction game from Japan. Designed by a manga artist and published by a manga publisher, the game is sold in their stores and has a manga produced with it.<br/><br/>The deck has cards numbered from 0 to 9, and each card has a special action on it. Each player chooses two cards and hides them from the other player, standing them up in small standees. The players must deduce which cards are hidden.<br/><br/>The players start with two hit points. Each time a player makes a correct deduction, and accurately identifies a hidden card (an attack), the hiding player loses a hit point. When a player gets to zero, or starts their turn with no hand cards, they lose the game. But players can recover points when playing cards during the game.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of the remaining cards, and take turns playing a hand card and then making a guess. The hand card played has a special demand, such as, 'is this card a 5 or higher?', or 'which card has the higher value?'. Other cards have actions such as, return a played card to your hand, and, your opponent may not attack this turn.  As cards are played out to the table, it becomes more obvious what cards are hidden.<br/><br/>However, when a hidden card is revealed, it goes back to the player's hand and they may place another card hidden.<br/><br/>By logical deduction, a player should be able to work out which cards are hidden and eliminate their opponent.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Rouse your companions!<br/><br/>In the First Watch box, you&rsquo;ll find 85 verse cards suited by the Fruit of the Spirit. These are divided into a 50-card Lightraider deck and a 35-card Battle deck. You&rsquo;ll also find rule cards plus a key card to help you use this deck with other Lightraiders games. The Battle deck includes the cards you need to score victories. These are verses used when battling allegorical enemies in the Lightraiders realm.<br/><br/>If you don&rsquo;t remember the verse referenced on the battle card in play, use a lightraider card from your hand that matches its suit. Or recite a verse from a card in an opponent&rsquo;s hand. Of course, you can only see the reference on the back of your opponent&rsquo;s card, so you&rsquo;ll have to rely on memory.<br/><br/>Lightraiders play this game on the road and at Lightraider Academy to practice sacred verses and prepare for battle. Now you can play First Watch at home. Even better, use your First Watch cards for organization and reference during other lightraider adventures. This set makes a great companion to the original DragonRaid Vintage Boxed Set or Starlots the Game. Game effects are listed on each card, and each card also incorporates a real-life Scripture application to expand your discipleship learning.<br/><br/>Intended as Bible memory verse tool that has been gamified to support an expanded/enhanced play method for DragonRaid and/or Starlots.<br/><br/>",

Like its predecessors in Gandhi and Fall of Saigon, Calixto is quick to use and easy to implement but presents a challenge to any Cuba Libre player.<br/>When selecting Operations and Special Activities, cards are drawn from the Calixto deck&mdash;there are six cards for each Cuba Libre faction. Each card examines the current state of the game and selects the appropriate action for the active faction. A single, faction-specific table then determines where that action will occur. The same table is used to select spaces for Operations, Special Activities, and Events, minimizing the need to flip between multiple player aids.<br/><br/>Playing against Calixto feels like playing against a human opponent. It is unpredictable yet responsive to strategic needs, it goes after its enemies while keeping an eye on its ally, and makes moves until now limited to human players&mdash;like choosing a Limited Operation to block an opponent&rsquo;s Event. Calixto can take the place of any faction in a Cuba Libre session and can be used in any combination of player and non-player setups.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to score as many resource points as possible before the end of the game. But your opponent might have other ideas. Both players have to decide when to return back to the ship with the current resources or press your luck, trying to weather the events and retrieve a much bigger load.<br/><br/>Your ship has five expeditions to send out and collect resources. When it is time, collect the resources and return back to your ship and count the booty. Events may alter the success of your expedition.

As fish show up you tell them where to reside, sneakily putting together groups of the same fishes so they will leave and make a home elsewhere. You only have this position for a short time,  and then one of the other fish will take this responsibility. Don't let the reef get too crowded or you fail and the reef falls to decay.<br/><br/>In Something Fishy, a solo mostly abstract game, the player takes the position of Reef King. The job that is placed on each King is to maintain a balance of fishes. Fish tokens are drawn randomly, two each turn. The player will roll three dice to indicate where the tokens may be placed. The player take two of the rolled dice, add them together, forming a number of an area to place the token. <br/>Each area of the reef, has 1-2 numbers that correspond to it, providing an overlap for each number, so each area has two groups of numbers for placement, kind of like a Venn diagram with &quot;lanes&quot; that hold three fish each, and an area consisting of two lanes that overlap to the left and right groups of numbers as well. <br/>If,  after the two fish tokens are placed, eachv area is checked for three or more fishes of the same color; those fish tokens are taken off the board and placed to the side, making more room for others &quot;arriving&quot;. If,  after 24 turns and the reef areas have not been overran by having three fish in one lane, you win. If,  after checking for full lanes, and removal of the threes that are duplicates, a lane is still full with three tokens,  you lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Word Poker takes the well-known framework of poker and transforms it into a compulsive family word game. Instead of normal playing cards, it uses letter cards with each letter having its own score value. The aim is to make the highest-scoring word using any combination of the five cards on the table and the five cards you are holding. There are rounds of betting where you can bet on the strength of your word to win the pot of chips. Quick start rules mean that you don't need any knowledge of poker to get playing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box (adapted)<br/><br/>The rules are for Texas Hold 'Em poker. All the steps are there: the flop, turn, river, etc.  Besides using letters to make words, the only rules difference is that players start with a hand of five cards rather than two.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

It can be used with any scale figures (typically 15mm or 28mm).<br/>Each figure on the table represents one man, and the game is designed for battles of around 50 &ndash; 100 figures per side.<br/><br/>Basic Concepts:<br/>This game is played on a hex grid. Each hex must be big enough to contain at least 8 singly based foot figures, or four mounted figures.<br/>It is designed to be played with singly based figures.<br/>The game is card driven, so each player has a hand of cards, and cards are played to activate groups of figures and for other events.<br/>There are no units in this game. Figures can move around freely, although they will benefit from the presence of Leaders. Figures are activated for movement, combat and shooting by hex (so some or all of the figures in a hex may move, shoot or fight when activated).<br/>Each army has a Warlord and some Leaders. All rules applying to Leaders also apply to Warlords.<br/><br/>Game mechanisms:<br/>All dice used are normal 6 sided dice. When the rules refer to a particular number that must be rolled, that number or higher must be rolled for success.<br/><br/>",

Everyone collects a player mat, coloured dice and drinking cup. Each turn, the leading player turns over a card, showing an arrangement of dice then the players race to stack their own dice (plus extra from a shared pile) to match the pattern on the card.  They then grab their cups, raise them into air and call out, &ldquo;SK&Aring;L!&rdquo; (Cheers in Norwegian).  Whoever does this first wins the card, which is worth 1 or 2 points, depending upon difficulty.  The first player to 9 points wins!<br/><br/>There are extra cards, rules, special powers and added challenges to keep the game interesting.  It can be played as a fun family game or as a rowdy adults-only drinking game if you choose. It plays really quickly (10 &ndash; 20 mins) and will be fast-paced, loud, exciting and fun!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Your mine will strike the earth at the Barrier Mountains, and uncover the secrets of an ancient artifact buried deep below. Will you discover its secrets? Or will your mine fall to the odd creatures that inhabit these mountains? Play to find out, as your mine tells its story!<br/><br/>Barrier Mountains is an expansion to Dwarf Mine (the Dwarf Mine base game is required to play).<br/><br/>Like Dwarf Mine, Barrier Mountains is a game played by drawing a mine on graph paper. On your turn, you will first draw (dig) rooms, hallways, and ladders for your mine! Rooms will benefit your mine, and hallways and ladders let you reach other areas of your mountain.<br/><br/>After drawing, you will make two dice rolls - a treasure roll, and a combat roll. These rolls determine what treasure you find, and what creatures you may encounter in the mountain - after all, mining is dangerous business!<br/><br/>Each mine made has a story, and every story has a beginning, middle, and sadly, an end. Your game ends when your population reaches 0. By the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll have created rich and unique history for your mine &ndash; no two games are the same!<br/><br/>Players are getting VP during the game and trying to see how many VP they can get each time they play. Kind of like a high score.<br/><br/>Barrier Mountains expands on this experience, by offering a sci-fi style of gameplay, which includes:<br/>    A brand new Dwarf Mine map<br/>    4 new rooms for your Dwarf Mine<br/>    4 new final bosses to fight<br/>    4 new Treasure Tables (one for each mine level)<br/>    4 new Combat Tables (one for each mine level)<br/>    New mechanics unique to this map<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You will need two six sided dice, a pencil, the rule book, contract and map.<br/><br/>The world has changed&hellip;.<br/><br/>These are dark times. The world is being battered by an alien threat. We did not know what to call it at first but now it is known as Pod Fall. A wave of unidentified objects, hundreds of thousands of pods, carried by a solar current, struck the planet atmosphere and rained down upon the lands. Where they came from nobody knows but it was soon clear that the pods carried aggressive alien creatures bent upon terraforming the world in their own image. To our horror the pods were too numerous to repel, the outer shells hard to crack and the aliens within monstrously difficult to fight. But they had one vulnerability. They take time to hatch and so traps can be set up around the pods and as they emerge, they are triggered, and the aliens would have an unexpected and often lethal welcome to our world.<br/><br/>The fight back began. There were too many pods for the military to destroy by themselves though and the tide turned against us. So, the general public came forward and formed Pod Task Forces, small groups that went in and setup improvised traps around the pods the army did not have the resources to deal with. Even lone fighters embraced what was being called the Human Responsibility. Now the future has a chance as the tide has been slowed as fewer aliens can break free to seed the world in their terrible image. But it is on a knife edge as circumstances could easily turn in the enemy&rsquo;s favour. So, until enough of the newly emerged aliens have been exterminated, the Pod Task Forces must continue their work for the sake of humanity.<br/><br/>Your Role<br/><br/>You have gathered together some willing volunteers and formed a small Pod Task Force and will be taking available Pod Contracts. These are issued at the town hall by Sarge, the resident Warrant Officer. By setting up the Pod Contracts the government acknowledges that, as well as doing their duty, ordinary civilians should be rewarded for carrying out the trapping of pods and therefore the killing or injuring of aliens. If completed these contracts reward the player with Experience Points and Resources Coupons. The world has come out of a ravaging few months and resources are in short supply and the government needs to distribute these who they can trust to do the job properly.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We must be seen to be helping the cause and when the time comes, and the world is free of the vile alien grip, then those who have fought the invasion will be rewarded.&rdquo;<br/>Sarge reminds you of your responsibility.<br/><br/>Aim<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to eradicate as many aliens as possible, through the use of traps, in your allocated Pod Contract location. Pods will attempt to hatch when they sense movement nearby so there is a small window in which to construct the trap and then see it triggered as the alien attempts to confront the intruder. In each session you have one Pod Contract and encounter one location but once cleared there are plenty more and your Pod Task Force can continue on their campaign of eradication. You can keep the same characters and try harder maps as they become more experienced.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All players take one card from the order deck without looking at the card, and hold the cards above the center of the table face-down. One player takes two cards. The order cards are placed face-up in the center of the table at the same time. <br/>     Everyone races to make one of the burger orders from their ingredient piles. All players go simultaneously. <br/>     When a player finishes an order they grab the order card from the center of the table and place it on top of their gathered ingredients. They place the stack in their section of the table and flip over a new ingredient card from the order deck. <br/>         When building a burger the player should hold the cards for the current burger they are working on in their hands. <br/>         Ingredients must be in the same order they are on the order card with the top burger ingredient on top and the bottom ingredient on the bottom of the stack. <br/>         Players can make an order from any of the cards that are flipped over, they do not have to make an order from the card they flip over. <br/>         If another player completes an order and grabs the order card you were working from, you need to start over with a different order. <br/>         Players can only build one burger at a time, but they can always modify their current, un finished burger that is in their hand. <br/>         Once a player picks up an order card for their burger, the player cannot modify that burger anymore. <br/>         A player can grab any face-up order card whether or not their burger fulfills the order. If it doesn&rsquo;t fulfill the order exactly, the player may lose points. <br/>    <br/>     Players continue to make orders until one player runs completely out of one of their ingredients. Once they run out they say DONE and everyone must stop what they are doing immediately. <br/>     Players now become the customers and move one spot to the left to verify each burger order is correct for that player.<br/><br/><br/>",

In desperate attempt to recreate the 1940 success, German armored divisions attacked Americans in Ardennes, fighting their way to cross the river Meuse and to capture Antwerp. But despite the initial successes, Germans failed to capture Bastogne and some other key points. With Allies reinforcements coming every day, German offensive was stopped, even the use of the 150th Armored Brigade, armed with the captured US equipment, couldn&rsquo;t change it.

Mixing compounds has players laying out chemical cards from the deck to find out what chemicals they must mix based on the fire level in the laboratory (the higher the fire level grows the more volatile the mixtures become). The chemicals mixed can be placed in your available flasks for the turn and the process is repeated until you decide to stop to score or an explosion is triggered by an unstable mixture with certain combos of chemicals in your flasks. The more chemicals you can safely mix the more points you are able to score, but your luck may run short when the wrong chemicals get mixed causing an explosion (and ending your turn without scoring).<br/><br/>Beaker cards sitting in the middle of the table act as a game timer and indicate the fire level and scoring potential of mixtures. As players score beakers and at the end of each round beaker cards rotate changing the point values of the chemicals you've mixed while also moving it closer to the end of the game as once a beaker reaches it's boiling point it will bring an explosive and abrupt end to the game.

        "description": "Deep below Magestone Mountain there lies a source of great power. Leylines of magestone wind their way through the stone of the mountain! Your mine will dig deep as you gather the two types of magestone &ndash; pure and corrupted &ndash; and learn the arcane spells needed to unleash their power. Will this magic bring glory and prestige to your mine? Or will the dangerous elementals and power-hungry wizards that roam deep in the mountain spell your doom? Play to find out, as your mine tells its story!<br/><br/>Magestone Mountain is an expansion to Dwarf Mine (the Dwarf Mine base game is required to play).<br/><br/>Like Dwarf Mine, Magestone Mountain is a game played by drawing a mine on graph paper. On your turn, you will first draw (dig) rooms, hallways, and ladders for your mine! Rooms will benefit your mine, and hallways and ladders let you reach other areas of your mountain.<br/><br/>After drawing, you will make two dice rolls - a treasure roll, and a combat roll. These rolls determine what treasure you find, and what creatures you may encounter in the mountain - after all, mining is dangerous business!<br/><br/>Each mine made has a story, and every story has a beginning, middle, and sadly, an end. Your game ends when your population reaches 0. By the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll have created rich and unique history for your mine &ndash; no two games are the same!<br/><br/>Players are getting VP during the game and trying to see how many VP they can get each time they play. Kind of like a high score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal is to form pairs of stones and keep them from merging.<br/><br/>The board starts empty, with players alternating in placing a stone of their color onto an empty node of the board.<br/><br/>When the placement forms a pair, the player chooses a grid direction in which to move the pair, pushing all the stones in front of them one step. However, the move must not cause any of the opponent's stones to be pushed off the board, nor may either stone of the pair, itself, move directly off the board. (Other friendly stones can be pushed off by the move, if desired.) The moving player becomes the leader if, after the push, he now has more pairs of stones than the opponent.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players elect to pass, or when the player who doesn't have the leader's token has no way to form a new pair in the future. Then the leader wins. Playing time is shown for an  order 4 board, which is the smallest playable size.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. The board squares alternate between a light and a dark color in a checkered fashion. On odd-sized boards, the center square must be light-colored.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Place a stone of your color on an empty light square and on each adjoining dark square that you now control. You control a dark square if your stones occupy more than half of its adjacent light squares.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Place a stone of your color on an empty dark square that you contest. You contest a dark square if your stones occupy exactly half of its adjacent light squares.<br/><br/><br/>You win by completing a chain of interconnected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. Two stones are connected if they occupy orthogonally adjacent squares or diagonally adjacent dark squares.<br/><br/>The pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsQualos: On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty light square, or place a stone of your color on an empty dark square that you contest or control, or flip an enemy stone on a dark square that you control. To flip a stone is to replace it with a stone of the opposite color. Controlling and contesting are based on orthogonal lines of sight rather than on mere adjacencies, and stones on dark squares also count towards them.<br/><br/>Fast Quabble: On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty light square and on each adjoining dark square that you now control. You control a dark square if your stones occupy at least half of its adjacent light squares.<br/><br/>Conquare: Play on an uncheckered square board. Vertices take the place of light squares, and spaces take the place of dark squares. Two stones are connected if they occupy orthogonally adjacent spaces or a space and an adjacent vertex.<br/><br/>Fast Conquare: Conquare with the control rule from Fast Quabble.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In the actual events, the out-numbered and out-gunned Lithuanians did not offer armed resistance. Lithuania suffered brutal German and Soviet occupation anyway.<br/><br/>Legend of the Iron Wolf is a Campaign Study that continues the story with two more campaigns that never actually happened, both involving the Lithuanian Army. Campaign Five sends Lithuanian troops into battle against the Soviets in Operation Barbarossa. Campaign Six has them fighting the Germans in June 1941. In both cases, you get to use all of those tank pieces on the Lithuania&rsquo;s Iron Wolves sheet. Each campaign of course wraps up with a battle game.<br/><br/>Two play all ten scenarios, you&rsquo;ll need Lithuania&rsquo;s Iron Wolves as well as maps from Fire in the Steppe, and pieces from Fire in the Steppe, 1940: The Fall of France and Slovakia&rsquo;s War.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

To succeed, they must successfully manage Enablers, the array of skilled troops and machinery that exist to support and augment the power of the main Maneuver Units in the forces they command and maneuver these units for victory.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round both players will draw or select colored cubes and then take turns using them to perform actions. The color of a cube determines what can be done, and with what unit. During play Enablers will be brought onto the battlefield or returned to it by being allocated to larger Maneuver Units, and these reinforced Maneuver Units will engage the enemy assisted by the special powers and abilities of their allocated Enablers.<br/><br/>The player who is best able to exploit the mechanisms and timing of movement, combat and appropriate design of task forces will win.

As the approach approaches, the companions of the magical girls also decrease one by one, and in the end, will the remaining magical girls be able to successfully defeat Witch Night, or will the witches eventually devour the souls of all magical girls?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>這是一個以2011年1月在日本播放的動畫&quot;魔法少女まどか☆マギカ&quot;為基本概念設計的遊戲。在這個遊戲中你是一位魔法少女，共同與世界上的罪惡根源，也就是邪惡的魔女進行戰鬥。<br/>但是在戰鬥的過程中魔法少女們會受不了精神的折磨，精神的創傷，身心漸漸變得污穢不堪，而變成魔法少女們最大的敵人--魔女，在瓦爾普魯吉思夜到來的日子不斷迫近之下，魔法少女們的同伴也一個一個的減少，而最終到底是剩下的魔法少女們能夠成功擊倒魔女之夜，還是魔女們最終可以吞噬所有魔法少女的靈魂呢？<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now the ruins are a popular destination for adventurers and treasure hunters, many of whom are never seen from again.&rdquo; - Jaden the Elder<br/><br/>Ruins of the Lorn Keep is an easy-to-learn, quick-to-play dungeon crawl. Play a warrior, a thief or a wizard searching for treasure, powerful magical items, and fame. Each character excels at one of the three different dungeon challenge types. Part dungeon crawl, part memory game, Ruins of the Lorn Keep is highly portable and can be played nearly anywhere.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, a card is turned face-up and dice rolled to try and beat a monster or win a treasure. Each card is worth victory points. The first player to 10 points wins.<br/><br/>",

There are also bonuses on the board fields that can be obtained by answering questions on religious knowledge. Our movement can be accelerated by the graces of the Holy Spirit or of the Eucharist. When answering questions, we collect good or indulgence cards. There are also saints on the way to heaven, which can make children familiar with the saints.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Players take turns by rolling dice and moving their meeples through part of the board representing earthly life. While doing so they need to answer Christianity-related questions and gain positive cards that speed them up or negative ones that slow them down.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches the last judgment the cards gained impact on how many fields (if any!) the player has to cross in the purgatory before finally reaching heaven. While moving within the purgatory players need to do extra tasks.<br/><br/>After the player finally reaches heaven, they keep moving and helping other players reach there as well. The game ends once all players reach heaven in which case, they all win. But should even one of the players show up on the last judgment with a grave sin in their cards they might go to hell instead and the game is lost.<br/><br/>",

Yes, you&rsquo;re having the time of your life and loving all your classes, but nobody is taking you seriously. You keep telling your parents that there is a career for you and you won&rsquo;t become a starving artist. When you find out that your local botanic garden is holding an open competition for a succulent wall installation, you&rsquo;re ecstatic. Finally, a way to prove your legitimacy! However, your professor knows the board and cautions you to submit two designs. Since succulents are trendy, the board will not choose the design that is the most popular, but the one that will be the least controversial. Can you make the best arrangement while navigating the shifting tide of public opinion and secure your first installation?<br/><br/>In this game, you and your opponent will select cards from a display to place in one of your two succulent walls. Cards must follow three simple rules when being placed<br/><br/>     In each column, each card must have a higher number than the card above it.<br/>     In each row, each card must have a color further to the right in the ROYBGV coloring order.<br/>     No orthogonally adjacent cards may share the same number or color.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of each round, you and your opponent will place one card to increase or decrease the point values of each type of succulent. At the end of the game, only your lowest scoring wall will count, so be careful in your choices!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fun and unique game!<br/><br/>Namast&eacute; introduces players to the world of Yoga through 5 different simple and engaging motion games.<br/><br/>The game was developed with Lorena Pajalunga, founder and President of the Italian Yoga Association for Children AIYB.<br/><br/>The positions of yoga are numerous.<br/><br/>We have chosen 40, which are representative and affordable for children. These 40 positions were illustrated by the magical pen of Lorenzo Terranera (Ballar&ograve; and many other spells) and then placed on large-format cards, which are divided into two groups.<br/><br/>There are 20 &ldquo;easier&rdquo; positions, the cards with green backs, and 20 &ldquo;less easy&rdquo;, purple ones, so that all children, in different age groups, can experiment and play.<br/><br/>On each card the name of the asana is written in Sanskrit, the ancient language of India, but don't be scared ... it's just to learn something more, because in the 10 pages of the book with the detailed explanation of all 40 positions you will find the Italian translation of the name of the asana. For each asana the inspiration is also described, the detail of how it must be performed and, very nice, what you learn by practicing it.<br/>Many different games can be played with the contents of this box.<br/><br/>In addition to those that you can invent yourself, 5 are described below, which aim to entertain children (and adults) in many different ways, stimulating creativity (game 1: &quot;Invent your story), memory ( game 2: &quot;Remember the sequence&quot; and game 4: &quot;Make the quartet&quot;) and learning the names of the asanas (game 3: &quot;Guess the name&quot;), developing with everyone the improvement of the practice (game 5: &quot;Overcome the teacher&quot;).<br/><br/>If playing with children under the age of 6, it is recommended that an adult play the role of the moderator, or teacher. From 6-7 years onwards, the role of the Master can be played, in turn, by the players themselves.<br/><br/>Even if a specific game mode is indicated, all 5 games can be played:<br/><br/>with a single deck of 20 face down cards and taking the top card of the deck from time to time, as in game 1<br/>with 5 piles (4 cards of each type) and throwing the fuchsia die to choose the card, as in game 2<br/>with 4 piles (5 cards of each color) and rolling the black die to choose the card, as in game 3<br/>throwing both dice and looking in the deck for the corresponding card, as in game 5<br/>Before starting to play it must be emphasized that the practice of Yoga must never hurt, and for this reason the positions must always be performed slowly. it is important to respect your limits and not forget that our bodies are not all the same: ease and difficulty vary greatly from one person to another, and an easy asana for one player could be difficult for another.<br/><br/>Contains: 49 cards, 2 dice, 1 gong and 1 book of 24 pages.<br/><br/>",

A fun adventure to be able to overcome many obstacles by managing two characters together.<br/>Simplicity reigns supreme with Dwarves and Giants. For all children who are approaching board games for the first time or for those who do not want to learn too many rules. Fast and immediate.<br/>We prepare the board in the center of the table and place our Dwarf and our Giant in the starting boxes. We make the Movement deck, the Help deck and the Unexpected deck available to everyone. We take 2 Talisman tokens each.<br/>We begin to advance on the board by drawing a Movement card and discarding it immediately. We will choose to move either our Dwarf or our Giant in the direction that interests us most, even backwards. Warning: the Dwarf cannot cross the Ravine and the Giant the Web unless they have Help cards that specify otherwise.<br/>The effects of the boxes:<br/>- Purple box (neutral) - nothing happens.<br/>- Weed, Swamp, River box - if you end the movement on one of them, you will need to draw an Unexpected card and immediately apply its effect.<br/>- Help Box - the relevant card is drawn and held without showing it to the other players.<br/>Help cards will serve us to attack others or to defend ourselves.<br/>If you draw the Witch card in the Movement deck, you can defend yourself by spending a Talisman. If there are none, the game for that player will be over.<br/>Spending a Talisman will also serve to bring one of our eliminated characters back into play.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who brings both characters to the exit or, if all are left with only one character, the single who reaches it first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hidden well beneath the great mountains, there exists a gloomy and gargantuan cavern inhabited by the dark civilizations of the world. Goblins, Dark Elves, and Dark Dwarves build their armies and thrive in the empty spaces between the stone. Your mine will dig deep and reach the fabled Underdark. Will you navigate the dangers of the Underdark and survive in the dark place beneath the mountain? Or will the dangerous creatures spell your doom. Play to find out, as your mine tells its story!<br/><br/>Underdark is an expansion to Dwarf Mine (the Dwarf Mine base game is required to play).<br/><br/>Like Dwarf Mine, Underdark is a game played by drawing a mine on graph paper. On your turn, you will first draw (dig) rooms, hallways, and ladders for your mine! Rooms will benefit your mine, and hallways and ladders let you reach other areas of your mountain.<br/><br/>After drawing, you will make two dice rolls - a treasure roll, and a combat roll. These rolls determine what treasure you find, and what creatures you may encounter in the mountain - after all, mining is dangerous business!<br/><br/>Each mine made has a story, and every story has a beginning, middle, and sadly, an end. Your game ends when your population reaches 0. By the end of the game, you&rsquo;ll have created rich and unique history for your mine &ndash; no two games are the same!<br/><br/>Players are getting VP during the game and trying to see how many VP they can get each time they play. Kind of like a high score.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You can even employ Private Maids that stick around to use their special powers each per turn! Some give you a bonus, or affect your opponents in a negative way. But beware, your opponents can make your maids sick or give them bad habits, affecting your maids in negative ways and decreasing your Victory Points!<br/><br/>In this new standalone expansion (can be played on its own or combined with previous Tanto Cuore games), the players are in a rush to complete dilapidated rooms in Twilight Manor, avoid the ghosts, and perform seances to help with their goals. However, the spirits are not always willing to play along, and they can at times go out of their way to mess up your strategy if they turn evil!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s now your job as the new owner of the manor to employ Workers to help you collect combinations of symbols in order to accomplish the task of Finishing a Room, while also Employing your Maids and Butlers to keep the Ghosts at bay with the assistance of Madam Damnable and her Seances.

        "description": "The Stock Car Racing Team Game is themed around American stock car auto racing that began in the late 1940's in the southeast U.S. that grew from a regional to a national auto racing sport.<br/><br/>The game requires 2 to 6 players, each player has six like colored race cars to choose from, Red, Yellow, Blue, White, Green and Orange.  Each race car has it's own unique number on the roof of the car.  For each team, the first digit on the roof will start with 1,2,3,4,5 and 6.  Each player navigates their six race cars by the roll of three dice.  Two white dotted dice that determined the number of spaces to move forward on the race track and one green six sided numbered die that determines which car is to be moved.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to move all six of like colored race cars around the race track and past the start/finish line but only after earning a predetermined number of race tire tokens for each teams six race cars.  This is accomplished by making green flag or yellow flag pit stops and avoiding engine failure or running out of fuel.<br/><br/>This is a game of attrition, the first player to successfully cross the start/finish line and remove all six of their race cars wins the race.  Their is also a point system for those that want to play multiple races and therefore there is incentive for players that do not win the race to finish 2nd, 3rd etc.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The War of the Roses was a 32-year conflict in the mid to late fifteenth century that had the rival houses of Lancaster and York fighting for control of the Plantagenet dynasty and control of the English throne. Starting with the First Battle of St. Albans when Richard of York captured Henry VI, the two houses fought for control of England until the controversial king, Richard III, was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485.<br/><br/>After his victory at Bosworth Field, Henry VII married Elizabeth of York. With this marriage the House of Lancaster and the House of York were combined, and the House of Tudor was born and gained control of England.<br/><br/>Warriors of England is a quick playing game covering the War of the Roses (1455-1487) and uses similar game mechanics as Multi-Man Publishing&rsquo;s Warriors of God game covering The Hundred Years War.<br/><br/>Each player controls Nobles from their respective house (Lancaster and York) and vies for control of lesser Nobles who may leave your cause during battle. Each Noble controls troops and participates in campaigns to gain control of areas that add to their victory points. Control of areas also allows nobles to raise more troops for the cause!<br/><br/>Battles can lead to the death of your nobles, exile to a foreign land (Scotland, France, and Burgundy) or even imprisonment in the Tower of London. If nobles die in battle, they may be replaced by their heirs who may continue to fight for your claim!<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>        Full color rulebook<br/>        22&rdquo;x34&rdquo; mapsheet<br/>        Two counter sheets (1&rdquo; counters)<br/>        Two Player Aid Cards<br/>        dice<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Wizards with ideas as to how society should function that are different than your own. The kind you'll need to Murder by Magic, in order to do all that saving of the world you fancy so proudly. However, they're trying to murder you, as well. Because, although you think they're the bad guys, they think you're the bad guy. Only one of you is right.<br/><br/>How To Play:<br/>Each wizard is given a number of cards from the white deck depending on the player count (7/6/5 for player counts 2/3/4) which are then placed face up in a line for all to see. These are each players' total health points. The player with the lowest total amount of health takes the first turn. For each turn, each player must make 3 moves. A move consists of either drawing one card from the black deck or playing one card from their hand.<br/><br/>Spell cards are played on top of any opponents health cards in order to deplete said opponent's health. When the value of the combination of attack spells meets or exceeds the value of health points listed on the card the opponent must place your attack cards on the discard pile and flip over their attacked health point card to show it has been depleted.<br/><br/>When played, each attack spell card counts as one move. The only exception is if you have 2 or more of the same type of spell. They can be played together and it will count as one move. Other cards may help you to heal, add additional health or provide an extra turn.<br/><br/>When a player's total health is completely depleted, they are dead and out of the game.

Can you help the intrepid Kelsey Franklin piece together one of the ocean's deepest mysteries?<br/><br/>The Lost Treasure of John Augur is a narrative puzzle game experience where players will collaboratively search through a trove of artefacts, treasures, official documents, diary entries, pirate maps, and other windblown scraps to seek out the lost treasure of pirate John Augur.<br/><br/>There is no traditional game board or pieces, no turn order or set roles. Instead players will unbox the mystery together, scouring for clues, searching for hidden messages, and ultimately following the treasure trail hidden within the contents.<br/><br/>Will you find the lost treasure or be doomed by the unfathomable powers beneath the waves?<br/><br/>",

To buy the pieces you have to bluff or buy wisely to get the most for your money. Watch out that you do not buy a counterfeit piece that doesn't fit in your artwork.<br/><br/>During the game, players construct a painting out of tiles, that are arranged in a 3x3 grid. Each turn, several of these tiles are revealed, and players bid on them using money cards. When a player wins a tile, they have to add it to their existing tiles in such a way that its edges matches the adjacent edges. If this cannot be done, the tile is considered counterfeit, and is not added to the painting, but kept aside.<br/><br/>Players now get new money cards depending on the value of the tile they gained during the bid, with tiles that are worth more points giving less money.<br/><br/>The game continues until someone completes their 3x3 painting. Then, players add together the point value of their tiles and subtract the point value of their counterfeit tiles. If only one player completed their painting, they get a bonus of two points.

Cards are played onto four shared building piles in numerical sequence from 1 to 12. On each turn, a player draws until they have five cards in their hand, and then plays cards from: their hand, a top card of their discard piles, or their stockpile, or they can use a coin in place of a card, or they can use a coin to take a card from their opponents stock pile or discard pile. Some cards require using coins to pay a toll. At the end of their turn, a player must discard onto one of their four personal discard piles. Strategy involves the organizing of cards into the discard piles and using your coins wisely, care in not setting up the next players for good plays, knowing when to play from which option, and especially the timing of playing a valuable &quot;Skip-Bo&quot; wildcard. Players still try and get rid of all the cards from their Stock Pile, but the coins can be used to help fill in a sequence of cards or even to buy a card from another player's Discard Pile or Stock Pile!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Mexican Revolution that began in 1910 with the overthrow of dictator Porfirio Diaz degenerated into civil war following the assassination of President Francisco Madero. By end of 1915 the forces of President Carranza were arrayed against a variety of leaders supporting either themselves or General Victoriano Huerta. Pancho Villa, commander of the Mexican Army del Norte, at first supported Carranza, but then went rogue after the US Government recognized Carranza&rsquo;s government. Historians still debate Villa&rsquo;s reasons, but in early March 1916 he decided to enter the US and raid the town of Columbus, New Mexico. Although the town was where the 13th Regiment US Cavalry was garrisoned, he knew most of the troopers were scattered along the border. Believing the town was only weakly guarded, his force of just under 500 men were to steal arms, provisions and horses while also wreaking as much havoc as possible. Such a raid he believed could galvanize the US government into a retaliatory strike that would drag Carranza&rsquo;s government into a war with the US it could not win, or a humiliating capitulation that would outrage the Mexican people. Either way, Villa reasoned, it would mean the downfall of Carranza.<br/><br/>Villa&rsquo;s Vengeance is an introductory level wargame simulation portraying the March 9, 1916 raid on Columbus, New Mexico. Players are cast in the roles of Villa&rsquo;s raiding force and the defending US regular and militia forces.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Full Ahead! miniatures wargame rules were devised to enable wargamers to refight the seemingly forgotten naval battles in the last years of the nineteenth and the early years of the twentieth century (1894-1905). During this period naval technology advanced at a rapid pace but tactically everything was still uncertain, heavy guns, light quick firers, the ram and torpedo all having their proponents, with nobody having the concrete evidence of a major action to confirm or refute their theories.<br/><br/>It is hoped that these rules have captured the spirit of the period they purport to represent without too much of its complexity. Indeed these rules were written with full scale fleet actions in mind with each player assigned the role of a commander in charge of anything from a squadron to an entire fleet. The rules are therefore designed to enable players to concentrate on tactics rather than book keeping and complicated time consuming gun v armour charts etc.<br/><br/>These rules were written with particular reference to the naval actions of the following wars:<br/><br/>Brazilian Civil War 1893-1894<br/>Sino-Japanese War 1894-1895<br/>Spanish-American War 1898<br/>Russo-Japanese War 1904-1905<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battles of Napoleon is an epic wargame series that simulates the most famous battles of Napoleon on a Tactical level sharing the same basic rules.<br/><br/>The series portrays the most important aspects of battles of the Napoleonic era with easy to learn and remember rules, intuitive mechanics and procedures. Players may focus on taking decisions and playing rather than consulting rules.<br/><br/>The system focusses on the &ldquo;cat-and-mouse game&rdquo; of coordination and timing of the various formations of the different arms without too much crunchy chrome.<br/><br/>Infantry was the predominant and most important element in every European army of the period. It usually formed between 60 and 90 per cent of an army in battle, and was both the cheapest and the most versatile type of troops. The foot soldiers had to endure most of the fighting and casualties. Depending on their task, they were either deployed in line (fire power), column (maneuver and assault) or square formation (protection against enemy cavalry).<br/><br/>Cavalry were screening the own army and provided the shock element on a Napoleonic battlefield. Due to their shock power they fixed enemy infantry and forced them to take shelter in square formation. If infantry failed to form square they were overrun. If infantry was fixed in semi-static squares they were very vulnerable to artillery fire.<br/> Artillery, the queen of the battlefield, was on the one hand having devastating effects on square and closely packed formations, on the other hand artillery alone was extremely vulnerable when getting charged by enemy units.<br/><br/>Generals are tasked with taking advantage of favorable terrain like the famous Duke of Wellington who mastered the reverse slope tactic.<br/><br/>By a simple game mechanic, players will never know the exact strength and power of an enemy unit. Units have a number of strength points that will gradually decrease while engaged with enemy units.<br/><br/>An innovative chit-based Command system, where players randomly draw activation chits determines which army may activate a formation, leads to highly interactive game play. Reaction follows action. We bring the chit-based Command system to a new level: In this games series, players decide which formation is activated when a chit is drawn. A formation may be activated several times per turn. But by each new activation it performs less effective.<br/><br/>During a game turn the players are under constant pressure to decide which formation to activate. By efficient timing of activation players are in the &ldquo;driver&rsquo;s seat&rdquo; to dictate the pace of a battle.<br/><br/>Formations are given orders at the beginning of a game turn and are therefore limited by the actions they can perform on the battlefield. The more &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; orders formations will receive, the more likely is the army will collapse due to fatigue. On the other hand, an army is more likely to gain the initiative on the battlefield by &ldquo;aggressive&rdquo; orders.<br/><br/>The scale of the series is appr. 150 meters per hex, infantry units are battalions, artillery is batteries and cavalry is represented as regiments.<br/><br/>Quatre Bras 1815, depicting the encounter at the Quatre Bras crossroads, is the second volume in this series. Special rules like the possibility to activate the French light cavalry brigade, the defense of special structures, the possible arrival of d'Erlon's I Corps add distinctive flavor of the battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "991 AD: Olaf the Dane came with his ships and army to the towns of east England. The Danes overran these places, one by one, until they arrived at Maldon. Here Ealdorman Byrhtnoth marched against the Danes with his army. The English held the ford between the island where the Danes had landed and Maldon on the mainland. The Danes asked permission to cross uncontested and fight on equal terms. For some reason, Byrhtnoth agreed. After great struggle, the Danes killed the ealdorman. The brave English fell in battle, the cowardly fled, and the Danes took possession of that place of slaughter.<br/><br/>Battle of Maldon is a two-player game commemorating this famous battle. Players take on the role of either the Danes or the English, and attempt to capture the enemy through maneuver and attack. All you need is a regular deck of cards to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In July 1758, the British army made a major push north against Fort Carillon, a.k.a. Fort Ticonderoga. This was part of a three-pronged campaign against New France, led by Major-General Abercromby.<br/><br/>With a massive army of 17,000 men supported by 44 pieces of artillery, the 3,500 French and Canadian defenders were facing overwhelming odds. Due to unforeseen events, the battle turned out to be a decisive victory for the French commander Montcalm and his forces.<br/><br/>1758 Fort Carillon - Abercromby's Fumble at Ticonderoga is a detailed simulation of the battle, starting from the British landing at day break of July 6th. Lead elements included Rogers Rangers.<br/><br/>Each artillery piece and key leader or engineer is individually represented in the game. Combat units are 100 men each. You can build or destroy bridges or earthworks. The game also includes small boats such as bateaux that can be carried over land and larger rafts for artillery. Optional rules include ships from the small French navy on Lake Champlain.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Foreign connections to the United States and Guatemala provide lucrative incentives in this luckless economic game where the most money at the end of the game wins. Business interests drive players in continual expansion. Loans are taken for intensive capital investment, with the game ending when one player has expended all their cubes. Family money provides an initial boost to these ventures.<br/><br/>Mexican Railways is a stand-alone game that uses the wood cubes, the money and the base rules of Iberian Railways. The game is for 3-5 players and lasts about an hour. The 'International Mexico' bonus is a new, very powerful addition to the game as are the international connections.<br/><br/>Mexican Railways is the fourth game using Winsome&rsquo;s Regional Railways System. The prior three games were Rhodesian Railways, Balkan Railways and Iberian Railways.

The aim is to capture cards of the good colour and avoid those of the bad.<br/><br/>Play<br/>The player at dealer's left leads to the first of 13 tricks. You must follow suit if you can, but may otherwise play any card. The trick is taken by the highest card played, regardless of suit. For this purpose cards rank from high to low AKQJ1098765432. Of equally high cards, the last played wins. Upon winning a trick, you take the current top card of the row (the one at the uncovered end), lay it face up before you, discard the trick face down to a wastepile, and lead to the next.<br/><br/>Score<br/>When all tricks have been played and row cards taken, you total the face value of all cards you have taken of the good colour and subtract the total face value of those of the bad colour. For this purpose Aces count 1 each, numerals 2 to 10 count at face value, Jack counts 11, Queen 12, and King 13. If your count is positive, you record it as your score; if negative, you score zero for that round. (Thus you never actually score a minus number.) Play up to any previously agreed target.<br/><br/>",

When it is the end of a player's turn and they have 10 or more points from a single faction in their play area, the round ends and that faction is scored as positive for all players- with the losing faction being scored as negative for everyone as well. Players tally their points and add (or subtract) them to victory points that persist between rounds, then begin a new round.

        "description": "Slumber Tower is a board game with hidden roles. Three groups of characters (Nightmares, Good Dreams, and Dreamers) confront each other. Each player secretly gets the role of a character from one of the groups. Your task is to figure out who is playing against your group and to wake up your opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>It's best to play in a group of five or more people. Then it's interesting to hide your personal motives, it's harder to guess what role you're playing and what you're aiming for. You take a character card and read your goals. If you meet them by the end of the game, you'll beat your opponents and win.<br/><br/>But the others can not only guess who is hiding under the mask of their favorite friends, but also check them: for this purpose cards of Insight are useful. They can be obtained after a die roll (if an open eye appears on the die). Each player rolls the die at the beginning of his turn. The Insight has some suggestion written on it, which you give to the person you choose to check. For example, it says that if the card is given to the Dreamer, he loses his sleep strength. If you give it to a player who is actually a Dreamer, he silently, without showing the card to anyone, drops his sleep token to a lower level. The rest of us don't know who he is, and you've already figured it out - yes, he's a tricky Dreamer.<br/><br/>There are a lot of interesting things in the game, such as walking around dream locations, helping another player fall asleep more deeply, and attacking characters. Yes, yes, the most important value here is a sound sleep. That's why the characters try to wake each other up. A successful sleep attack is minus the sleep strength level.<br/><br/>Don't let the game make you think of peaceful pictures. The battles in it are fierce. That's why it likes both those who have long played board games, and those who love beautiful things, but are ready to dive into the intricate rules. After the first game it will be easy to play, but the first place will come to bluff each other, surprise attacks and real teamwork.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>&laquo;Крепость сна&raquo; &mdash; это настольная игра со скрытыми ролями. Три группы персонажей (Кошмары, Добрые сны и Сновидцы) противостоят друг другу. Каждый игрок тайно от других получает роль персонажа одной из групп. Ваша задача &mdash; понять, кто играет против вашей группы, и разбудить соперников.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players must use their cunning and wit to outsmart their opponents in order to claim the ultimate prize: the one &amp; only carrot. Will you swap with your opponents and risk losing your only chance at victory? Or will you hold onto your card and hope it's the carrot? Be careful, one false move and you'll be left holding the short end of the stick! With endless laughter and endless possibilities, Carrot is sure to be a hit at your next game night.<br/><br/>In the 2 player game, you shuffle together 1 carrot and 1 stick. Each player gets one card facedown. The first player looks at their card, and may make any statement they wish (or remain silent). The second player may now ask the first player any questions or say anything else they'd like (the first player may respond however they'd like, including remaining silent). Then the second player chooses to either swap cards with the first player or keep their card. Afterwards, both players reveal their cards. The player with the carrot wins! If you play again, you swap roles and redeal cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It combines elements of dodgeball and disc golf and can be played anywhere with up to eleven people. One player plays as &quot;the mountain&quot;, everyone else is &quot;the party&quot;, and the card is &quot;the ring&quot;. The party's goal is to throw or fling the ring at the mountain while the mountain's goal is to survive ten turns without getting hit. Sounds easy? Adventurers beware! The power of the ring corrupts and can hinder your ability to throw! Depending on how it lands, players may have to throw with their weak hand or with their eyes closed.<br/><br/>Fly, You Fools! cleverly packs an entire epic saga into a single-card game. It will have players of all ages laughing, yelling, and crying as they desperately journey throughout the entire house in pursuit of the cursed mountain while it crawls, ducks, and leaps to evade them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The player who best handles the characteristics set by the player in turn wins the round.<br/><br/>The game was developed in conjunction with a scientific article in which the statistical values associated with each of the parameters of the cards were analyzed, so the values in each of them correspond to the results of the study.<br/><br/>Introduction of the associated article:<br/>In Latin America, the use of wildlife for different purposes is ancestral; In the last decades, the use of subsistence, that of local sale, sportive and commercial hunting stands out. The latter, related to the potential and the value or interest that exists in the species that is the object of the same. From the perspective of the agricultural sector, it seeks to meet demands for current anthropic uses such as food, skins, pets, scientific research or conservation, based on the sustainable management of wild populations.<br/><br/>To guarantee the sustainable use and management of wildlife, it is necessary to establish parameters and management criteria that are generated from scientific, cultural and socioeconomic knowledge of the species that we believe have some type of productive potential. Currently one of the challenges facing the agricultural sector is the development of innovative proposals that are consistent with the social, environmental and economic needs of the country. The assessment of the potential of wild species in Colombia is of vital importance to face these challenges.<br/><br/>In this document an approximation to the conceptual definition of zootechnical potential of a wild species is made and an evaluation of this potential is made for 48 species of wild fauna (native and exotic) that have been traditionally used in Colombia. The results are also part of a didactic strategy based on the evaluation of the zootechnical potential of wild fauna species, as a proposal for pedagogical innovation (cards attached to this booklet).<br/><br/>",

The drop initiative offers players a way to respond to their opponent&rsquo;s initial placement and really change up the game before all the pegs have been placed.

In the game, the United States, Russia, China, and the European Union compete over the control of the agenda and ultimately over victory points in the dimensions of economic, political, cultural, and security power projection. Order &amp; Opportunity combines card-driven, asymmetric game play to produce a topical and thematic historical game on a global scale. The game offers a distinctive and captivating play experience at every one of its player counts.<br/><br/>Order &amp; Opportunity begins in the early 2000s and covers the next twenty years of global, multidimensional power competition. In that setting, the game aims at creating a thematic experience of the period as players are faced with historical and familiar crises, challenges, and opportunities as they emerge from game play.<br/><br/>The winner is the power with the most victory points at the game end, or if playing with two or three players, the game is won or lost by democratic or authoritarian blocs of powers.<br/> The game can be played in constellations of two, three, or four players or solitaire using a dedicated, easy-to-use solo play system. None of these player counts is an afterthought; they have been part of the game&rsquo;s development from the very beginning.<br/> Scoring uses a two-step, Agenda and Victory Points based system. Gaining Agenda Points represents short-term control of political and media attention. However, Agenda Points count towards your true, tangible legacy only at the game end when one type of Agenda Points will be converted into VPs. Players may also choose to spend valuable cards and actions during the game to convert Agenda Points into VPs as they go, one at a time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players must start new railroads, they may expand existing railroads and they are able to trade stocks in the railroads.<br/><br/>There are 6 colors of wooden locomotives, each color representing a railroad. Players are dealt random hands of 5-10 (depending on number of players) locomotives, which are essentially a stock portfolio; the rest of each color are placed in a pool. On your turn, you can start a railroad or increase the value of a single railroad by placing 1-5 locomotives from the remaining pool of that company or you can trade one locomotive in your portfolio for one or two locomotives from the remaining pool in a railroad.<br/><br/>The game board is a map of Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar and Andorra, with cities worth anywhere from 1-4 points. Connecting to a city adds to a company's value. The game provides a bonus for crossing national borders. The game holds 3-6 players for about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The game ends when 5 railroads are devoid of cubes or when a railroad has built into Lisboa. Players' scores are determined by the value of each railroad at the end of the game, multiplied by the number of stocks the player has for that railroad.<br/><br/>Madrid Connection uses the components found in Queen Games&rsquo; Paris Connection game. The Madrid Connection game comes with 2 11x17 maps of Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar &amp; Andorra that require trimming and the rules necessary to play Madrid Connection. You must own Paris Connection to play this game. It is possible to play Madrid Connection using the original Winsome SNCF game, but it is not convenient.<br/><br/>",

But strange: on one side a snake rattles and on the other not. A card is awarded for each correct guess, increasing players' chances of ending up with the most winning rattlesnakes!<br/><br/>Six colorful snakes in the form of rattlesnake cans go onto the starting space at Skunk Skip. One of the two color dice thrown is chosen by the player and determines which rattlesnake gets to move forward. But before you touch the snake, you guess whether it is rattling or not - then it is shaken horizontally and everyone listens, spellbound! If the tip is correct, you receive a rattlesnake card as a reward. The player then turns the can over and moves it one space further. Any snake that used to rattle will not do so the next time - and vice versa. If you remember well when the fastest rattlesnake reaches the goal, you have the best chance of winning snakes among your cards!<br/>With professional version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imperial Eagles returns GMT&rsquo;s Down in Flames World War II air combat card game system to the Pacific. Volume VI in the series is a stand-alone game in which you can recreate many of the air battles of the first two years of the war between the Japanese and the Western Allies. 65 different aircraft models (19 never before represented in DiF) are depicted with full-color cards, all rated according to the latest research.<br/> As in Wild Blue Yonder, each side uses its own functionally-identical Action card deck to complete Missions lasting multiple turns. Fighters are normally played as Elements of two aircraft. The Leader of each Element has its own hand of cards, played both offensively during your turn and defensively when attacked by an enemy. The second aircraft is a Wingman, supporting the Leader in its attacks and defending the Leader when the Element is engaged. Unlike Leaders, Wingmen draw and play a few cards only when needed for attacking or defending&mdash;you&rsquo;re never sure how effective they will be.<br/><br/>The simplest games are Dogfights in which two to eight players each control one or two fighter Elements in fast-paced air-to-air action. Besides classic matchups such as F4F-4 Wildcats vs. A6M2 Zeroes or P-40E Warhawks vs. Ki-43-I Hayabusas, in Imperial Eagles you can explore the capabilities of lesser-known types including the Seversky P-35A, the Curtiss-Wright CW-21B, the Nakajima Ki-27, and the Mitsubishi F1M2. Mid-war aircraft such as the P-38F Lightning, the F4U-1 Corsair, the F6F-3 Hellcat, and the Ki-61-Ib Hien also return to the series.<br/> Campaigns offer more depth as you play three or more historically-based missions in which escorted bombers face interceptors and anti-aircraft defenses in trying to destroy enemy targets such as ground forces, airfields, and ships. Dive bombers such as the SBD-3 Dauntless (and its USAAF version the A-24 Banshee) and the D3A1 &ldquo;Val,&rdquo; medium bombers like the B-25C-5 Mitchell and the G4M1 &ldquo;Betty,&rdquo; and heavy bombers such as the B-17D Flying Fortress and the B-24D Liberator feature prominently in these missions. Even reconnaissance aircraft such as the F-5A Lightning, the PBY-5A Catalina, and the large but fragile H6K4 &ldquo;Mavis&rdquo; are given their due. Five previously-published land campaigns (including the small &ldquo;Marshall Islands Raid&rdquo; which serves as an abbreviated introduction to campaign mission mechanics) have all been updated to current standards as in WBY.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A.V.G. &ndash; The Flying Tigers is a book-based solitaire (or up to three player) air war game that recalls when a ragtag group of American pilots volunteered to fly for China against the Japanese. Recruited from the reserve officer ranks of the Navy, Marines, and Army, one hundred pilots signed contracts to fight. Of those, 99 went to Burma and China. Working together under Claire Lee Chennault, together they gave the nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek an &ldquo;instant air force&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Equipped with the fast and well-armored Curtiss P-40B Tomahawk, the pilots of the American Volunteer Group (A.V.G.) held the line against a numerically superior, better-trained cadre of elite Japanese pilots, including a number of aces, who flew aircraft that were far more maneuverable.<br/><br/>Soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the A.V.G. began its combat operations. It wasn&rsquo;t long before they scored their first success. On 20 December 1941, the pilots of the A.V.G. intercepted a Japanese bombing raid flying to bomb the western Chinese city of Kunming. Of the ten Japanese light bombers that were dispatched that day, the A.V.G. claimed three. A fourth bomber crashed on the way back to its base in occupied French Indochina. On Christmas Day, they flew again, this time downing 24 Japanese bombers and fighters.<br/><br/>It wasn&rsquo;t long before TIME Magazine covered the story of the Flying Tigers, celebrating their victories against Japan. By April 1942, just five months after the Flying Tigers combat debut, Hollywood was already filming a movie about the outfit, starring John Wayne. Their fight boosted home front morale and inspired thousands to join the US Army&rsquo;s expanding air force. In six and a half months, the Flying Tigers, as the A.V.G. came to be known, downed 297 Japanese aircraft at a loss of just 14 of their own.<br/><br/>In this game, you take on the role of the Operations Officer in charge of managing the A.V.G., its pilots, aircraft, fuel stocks, spare parts, and airfields. You will face the Japanese as they attack relentlessly, hoping to decimate your forces and bring the Chinese leadership in Chongqing to surrender to Japan&rsquo;s rule. Hanging in the balance are hundreds of thousands of Japanese soldiers who are engaged in the war in China. If China were to capitulate, the bulk of those soldiers would be available to fight in New Guinea and Australia &ndash; or perhaps continue to advance to the west and attack India.<br/><br/>In the game, A.V.G. - The Flying Tigers, The future of the War in the Pacific hangs by a thread. Your assets are three squadrons of Curtiss P-40B fighter planes and the pilots of the Flying Tigers in your command. You must apply them well to defend China, take the fight to the Japanese, and achieve victory.<br/><br/>The game utilizes the roots of the same proven narrative-style system of the top-selling game, MAG-23 Guadalcanal. At the center of gameplay is your War Diary, your aircraft complement, and your pilot roster. A Chinese village-based early warning network will provide reports of incoming Japanese raids. As well, you will fly morning reconnaissance missions to identify targets on the many Japanese airfields, and then return to strafe them later in the day. Your forces will assist the British and Australian squadrons in the defense of Rangoon in Burma as well as fly to protect the Burma Road and the aerial lifeline of C-47 transport planes flying &ldquo;The Hump&rdquo; from India to China to bring in supplies, spare parts, fuel, ammunition, and equipment.<br/><br/>The Japanese will not be an easy opponent. On almost every mission, you will be outnumbered by their fighters, the Type 97 and Type 98, and face bombing runs from light and medium bombers. The Japanese will strafe your airfields, advance with their ground forces to take Burma and ultimately attempt a crossing into western China at the Salween Gorge.<br/><br/>A.V.G. &ndash; The Flying Tigers is a fast-playing solitaire air war game that is in the narrative-style. It is highly engaging and fun to play &ndash; and it is easy to learn. Each of the missions can be completed in less than thirty minutes. Utilizing the MAG-23 System, the game is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor a realistic depiction of the air war. It is an entertaining and educational air war game that allows you to experience and learn about the Second World War and its impact on China.<br/><br/>A.V.G. &ndash; The Flying Tigers is for experienced and novice war gamers alike. Though dice play a role, the outcomes of your missions and the campaign depends on you. The story of your time in China is as you write it. Will your pilots succeed? How many of your men will become aces? How many will be shot down? Will the Japanese defeat China? The outcome of the war in China is in your hands.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You can also attack other players and steal their stuff, or try to steal their hideaway.

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board).<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, for every viable area with one or more empty points, place a stone of your color on one of those points.<br/><br/>A viable area is a viable point along with all other such points one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent viable points. A viable point is a point that is empty or occupied by a friendly stone.<br/><br/>When the board is full, the player with fewer stones on the board wins.

Players must create a sequence of matching rats in a line within the 4 x 4 grid either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The first player to line up their rats takes the cheese. Each successful sequence earns a point and ends the round, the first player or team to reach three points wins the game.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>This game is marketed as Tic-Tac-Toe taken to the next level. While it is inspired by Tic-Tac-Toe, there are several key changes, including up to 3 players (or teams of 2 each) rather than just 2 gamers facing off. And spaces are not always owned by one player for the duration of the game, as other players can take over a space or co-exist in a space. With the need to get 4 in a row on a 4 x 4 grid, the game is still (but much less) susceptible to the &quot;gridlock&quot; of Tic-Tac-Toe that leads to draws among skilled players.<br/><br/>Can be played by 2 or 3 players, or with partner teams can be played by 4 or 6 players; not with 5 or more than 6 players.<br/><br/>",

Finally, you have the chance - and in colour. The winner is the person who is the most skilful at throwing cakes with different coloured icings and can stack the most matching icings next to each other.<br/><br/>Dorty jsou vrženy is a party game where age, knowledge or experience doesn't matter. But being skilful in throwing cards in different fashion might come in handy. And so a child can play with grandma or a bunch of adults - they all have similar chances.<br/><br/>Choose a card, pick one icing you like the most and throw the card on the table. If you connect the chosen icing on multiple cards, you score points! But beware, your scoring card dictates how to throw cards. With your eyes closed? Toss it like a disc? Or slam it to the table?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If too many animals are on a statue, they all fall down and have to climb up anew.<br/><br/>In Dschungelgedr&auml;ngel, players each have four statue cards in front of them. In their hands, they hold cards with different numbers of the four animals: elephants, tigers, monkeys, and parrots. The goal is to stack nine animals of a kind on top of the respective statues. On their turn, players can either play any number of cards of the same animal type on a statue, or they can play an action card that messes with other players' plans. If at any time a player has more than nine animals of a kind on a given statue, they all fall down and the statue is empty again.<br/><br/>The first player to fill three statues triggers the game end; at the end of that round, the player with the most filled statues wins.<br/><br/>",

Game play is about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Here's how it works: deal 5 pond cards to each player face down, then lay 6 more face up in the center of the table to form the pond. Each round, a player draws an action card and reads it out loud, setting off a frenzy of activity as players rush to complete the action within the nail-biting 10-second time limit. Beware, though - if you can't complete the action in time, you'll have to draw a penalty card!<br/><br/>As the rounds progress, the game only gets more intense with unexpected actions that can turn the game on its head at any moment.  At the end of 10 Action Rounds, all players score their remaining hand with the Score Sheet. Player with the most points wins! With 10 exciting action rounds, Pond Poker is the perfect game to add some chaotic fun back to your game night.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Balloon Goes Up! is a series which simulates hypothetical armored warfare in Western Europe, the Middle East and Asia from the mid 1980&rsquo;s to the present day, all using a consistent core set of rules coupled with a situation-specific playbook that allows for a variety of situations to be portrayed. The first game in the series, Spearhead, represents a summer 1986 conflict between elements of the Soviet and East German armies and United States, West German, and French armies. The game emphasizes how long-range detection and firepower technologies dramatically increased the depth of the theater of operations in modem warfare. This &ldquo;Deep Engagement&rdquo; waged far behind the front lines can determine the outcome of a campaign even before the opposing ground forces truly come to grips. Players must learn how to fight and win the Deep Engagement to achieve overall victory, taking into account the different ways the forces of the two sides were prepared to fight.<br/><br/>Spearhead scenarios range from smaller battle scenarios that deal with specific situations, locations, and forces, and the larger campaign style scenarios that portray the wider battle between Warsaw Pact and NATO forces. Battle scenarios depict Warsaw Pact drives into the province of Hesse, with objectives of Kassel, the Fulda Gap, Frankfurt, and ultimately the Rhine River.<br/><br/>The game provides players with accurate accurate orders of battle for the participants down to battalion level (based on 1986 force levels)&mdash;the US V Corps, West German III Korps, French 1st Army, Soviet 8th Guards and 1st Guards Tank Armies, and East German 3rd Army. Spearhead is based on Mark Herman&rsquo;s Flashpoint: Golan system, which has been updated and refined. The game uses a chit-pull activation system, with divisions being the primary formations. Game scale is 4km per hex, turns are 1 day (12-hour activation impulses).<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map sheets that combine to form a 34&rdquo; x 44&rdquo; map<br/>Five counter sheets containing 1170 double-sided 9/16&rdquo; counters<br/>Twelve 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; Player Aid Cards<br/>One 10-sided die<br/>One Rules Booklet<br/>One Playbook<br/><br/>Players: <br/>2 but the game is well-suited to team play<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

After placing the card, the player reveals the date on it. If the card was placed correctly with the date in chronological order with all other cards on the table, the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, he wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A major updating of the original Worthington Games 2009 classic by Daniel Berger. In the update you will now get larger blocks, an updated map with new regions/forts, cards and rules which now include solitaire rules.<br/><br/>Caesar's Gallic War II is a two-player Strategic level block board-wargame that covers Julius Caesar's conquest of Gaul from 58 to 51 BC. One person plays the side of the Romans, while the other plays the side of the Germans, with both players vying for control of the various Gallic tribes.<br/><br/>The game uses blocks and area movement. Players use cards to collect allies, move units and attack or play events. Certain leaders are represented in the game, including Julius Caesar, Vercingetorix and Ariovistus.<br/><br/>As the Germans you will start with fewer and weaker units, but you you'll have an easier time recruiting other tribes to your side. Eventually Vercingetorix will appear to help you. Will you confront the Romans directly? Or will you play defensively, and rely on raiding tactics and political maneuvering?<br/><br/>As the Romans you start with six legions, with four more on the way. Your units are stronger and faster. But you'll have a more difficult time recruiting tribes onto your side, and you'll not only have to worry about rebellions, but watch your supplies as well.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A skirmish wargame of 17th century Puritans facing the reality of their superstitions...<br/><br/>Matchlocks &amp; Witchcraft takes historical accounts of American fears of witches and plays out a &quot;what if&quot; situation. What if a witch had actually kidnapped a Puritan child, how would an encounter between Puritans and a coven of Witches play out at the edge of the New England wilderness.<br/><br/>Using your own 28mm miniatures, a low model count, and a 3'x3' play area you can resolve this encounter over the course of 2 pre-written scenarios. In the first, you and your the older members of your family take chase into the woods in pursuit of a presumed witch that has kidnapped your newborn child. The outcome of this scenario will inform the starting numbers of the second scenario. Back at the farmstead, the remaining goodwives and children take shelter as an armed band of Puritans (and a reverend) from the nearby settlement have come to eradicate the devil's threat spawning from the Wood to save their righteous flock.<br/><br/>An asymmetrical mechanic allowing Witches the use of witchcraft tokens are deployed around the board, they are able to utilize these portals to vanish and reappear, simmulating phantom movement. Puritans have the opportunity to &quot;investigate&quot; these signs of witchcraft and remove them from play preventing this advantage. Once the tokens are gone the witches are stuck in whatever state they find themselves (permanently becoming a rabbit is a possiblility...) Meanwhile defenseless settlers are at risk of possession, influence, or death so ensure your matchlock-toting Puritans prevent the loss of their own.<br/><br/>Terrain rules are based on the Puritan's views on community and farming versus the untamed wilds of the woodlands. Witches gain advantage in the woods while the Puritans gain advantage on their cropfields and in their buildings. Trees are to be individually based in order to better recreate the disorder and densities of New England frontier lands.<br/><br/>But beware of the devil's ambush-like deployment in the form of the billy-goat, Black Bill...<br/><br/>",

The cards are individually illustrated with the astronauts represented in a whimsical fashion (as the astronauts are also arts and crafts enthusiasts).  There is also a set of 10 wild cards and a set of 10 cards with 2 symbols each.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a hand of three cards.  On your turn, you draw a card from the deck or discard pile and either play a card to a group or discard a card.  The first card of a group cannot be a wild or dual symbol card. Afterwards, card symbols must match.  Players may not have more than three active groups, and a group may have no more than five astronauts.  Five card groups are immediately set aside for later scoring.  A player may otherwise forgo their turn in order to set aside an incomplete group.  Once the deck is empty, players get one last turn and the game ends.<br/><br/>The winner is the person with the highest score.  All groups are scored, both in play and out of play.  Single card groups score nothing.  2-4 card groups score 2-4 points respectively.  A five card &quot;astronaut group&quot; scores 10 points.<br/><br/>",

The challenges are totally random, and the choice of line-up (and who to sit out) can determine the final outcome.<br/><br/>The losing team will make their way to the Outcast Tribunal where one Castaway will be voted out of the game.<br/><br/>Not so fast! Tribunal Twist cards and personal advantages are real, and when played will induce a crazy tribunal experience.<br/><br/>Once down to 10 castaways the merge is on the horizon, bringing with it a shift in the game. At this stage, players now need to look out for themselves. And be confronted with the big question - stay true to your alliance or backstab and blindside?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This delay allowed the 9th Cameronians to occupy Grainville and the 7th Seaforth Highlanders to advance to the hamlet of le Valtru in effort to secure the right flank of the now named &ldquo;Scottish Corridor&rdquo;. Before the Seaforths could reach le Valtru, they were hit by Kampfgr&uuml;ppe Weidinger of 2.SS-Panzerdivision Das Reich.<br/><br/>Game Length: 5&frac12; Turns, Board: p, Estimated Playing Time: 3 hours 21 minutes<br/><br/>Q26 &ndash; Holzthum Hold Out, 16 December 1944: For the opening phase of Unternehmen Herbstnebel (Operation Autumn Mist), Oberst Heinz Kokott&rsquo;s 26.Volksgrenadierdivision had one of the toughest tasks in that it had to clear the roads west of Our River for the panzers of the 2. and the 116.Panzer Divisionen. Crossing the Our in rubber boats at 03:00 hours and infiltrating their way past the American outposts, Oberstleutnant Kaufmann&rsquo;s F&uuml;silier Regiment 39 had reached Holzthum at 06:00 hours before anyone in the US 28th Infantry Division sector was even aware an attack was in progress.<br/><br/>Game Length: 5&frac12; Turns, Board: 12, Estimated Playing Time: 2 hours 28 minutes<br/><br/>Q27 &ndash; Stand at Sterlin's Castle, 8 December 1943: By 0600 hours, the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade had crossed the Moro River and established a bridgehead; supported by engineers and armour, the Canadians then launched attacks on San Leonardo. The Germans retreated and San Leonardo was at last secured, but counterattacks directed at the fragile bridgehead held by the hard-pressed Canadians were the order of the day.<br/><br/>Game Length: 5&frac12; Turns, Board: 9, Estimated Playing Time: 2 hours 4 minutes<br/><br/>Q28 &ndash; Going in Light, 9 June 1944: The immediate objective for the newly landed US 2nd Infantry Division was the village of Tr&eacute;vi&egrave;res, located just south of the Aure River. The plan of attack was for the 38th Infantry Regiment to strike directly at Tr&eacute;vi&egrave;res from the north and west, while the 9th Infantry Regiment would outflank Tr&eacute;vi&egrave;res by seizing Rubercy to the southeast - thus isolating the German position. It was no accident the Germans had chosen the tiny farm of Haute Hameau to make a stand against the approaching 9th Infantry. The old Norman farm with its stone wall courtyard formed an ideal defensive position, commanding the neighbouring country lanes running south in the direction of Rubercy.<br/><br/>Game Length: 5&frac12; Turns, Board: 43, Estimated Playing Time: 2 hours 48 minutes<br/><br/>Q29 &ndash; Como Ridge, 22 July 1945: In late 1944, the Australian Army had assumed responsibility for Allied operations on Bougainville, replacing US troops who were subsequently redeployed to the Philippines. Following the failed landing by the Australians at Porton Plantation, the commander of the Australian II Corps, Lieutenant-General Stanley Savige, decided to focus the main effort of the Australian campaign upon driving south towards the Japanese garrison at Buin, where the bulk of the Japanese forces were holding out.<br/><br/>Game Length: 5&frac12;, Board: 36, Estimated Playing Time: 3 hours 7 minutes<br/><br/>Q30 &ndash; The Tombe Diversion, 1 July 1943: The initial plan for the capture of Viru Harbour called for a diversionary attack by Lieutenant Brown&rsquo;s platoon on the small village of Tombe located on the east side of the harbour while the main body, under Lieutenant-Colonel Currin, would then attack the village of Tetemara on the west side of the harbour.<br/><br/>Game Length: 5&frac12; Turns, Board: o, Estimated Playing Time: 2 hours 24 minutes<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Indiana Jones and his female partner team up to explore a dangerous pyramid deep in the jungle rumored to contain a powerful, magic jewel from an ancient civilization. They will need to use their wits, gear, and a bit of luck to find the jewel and escape with their lives!<br/><br/>This game is either for 2-4 players competing against each other or 4-8 players competing as 2-player teams (with one player as Indy and the other as the Heroine). Each team moves, fights, and explores as one, with the Indy and Heroine players taking turns playing Explore cards to move their player pawn through the pyramid's corridors and rooms on the game map. Each Heroine provides either a bonus or a penalty to movement or combat (presumably, some are adept and helpful partners, like Marion Ravenwood, and some are actively working against Indy, like Elsa Schneider). Indy can land on another team's pawn to fight that other team and force them to trade Heroines. In a team game, that means that the Heroine players have to trade positions and now have different partners.<br/><br/>Each team's ability to move and fight is based on the Indy character's power level, a value between 3 and 6 representing Indy's health. Power may be lost due to damage from a trap or losing a fight and may be gained by finding medicine throughout the pyramid. If Indy's power level falls below 3, the team loses all their equipment and reset their pawn back to the start of the current floor they are on.<br/><br/>The players explore rooms in the pyramid, discovering traps and monsters to fight. Combat is handled by rolling one six-sided die and adding the result to Indy's current power level plus any other bonus or penalty. If the total exceeds the monster's power, the player wins and may take the equipment listed on the monster card (medicine, key to open a locked door, whip or pistol to aid in combat, or a mine car to move faster). The treasure room that is every player's goal is found on the 3rd floor of the pyramid. The first player team to reach this room and win a fight against a monster with a power level of 11 takes the jewel and escapes the pyramid as victor.<br/><br/>",

Far from lamenting, the emperor is determined to continue the fight at any price. Tensions are at their height because in addition to the military struggle, Heraclius' health and war efforts make the question of his succession more important than ever. Empress Martina is his second wife and the mother of nine of his eleven children. Two siblings will only complicate the succession and thereby compromise the resistance against the Arabs.<br/>But despite early Arab victories, Syria is not yet subdued and casualties from fighting and epidemics are high on both sides. Each side stands to lose if they are not careful. While Byzantine armies rally in Asia Minor and Egypt, Arab troops are bogged down in sieges of cities and ports across Syria.<br/>Will the Byzantines be able to regroup and reverse the situation with a military coup. Will the Arabs be able to parry the attack and complete the conquest of the Levant?<br/>This game sees two armies confronting each other as they seek to reorganize their forces. The Byzantine player must retake Syria and, at the same time, avoid the loss of Egypt and Asia Minor while managing a succession crisis.<br/>The Arab player must secure the Syrian terminus of the trade route to Mecca but also seize the Egyptian breadbasket and perhaps even Constantinople.<br/><br/>Units: 1 counter= from a few hundred to 2000 men<br/>Fleets: 1 counter= circa 100 ships<br/>Map: around 50km per hex<br/>Turn: One year<br/>Difficulty level: 6/9<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You must determine what type of units to attack, with what, and what weapons to do so or to defend yourself.

The shepherd&rsquo;s horn echoed through the vast oak grove in the past, calling the community&rsquo;s flock. After a day of grazing in the mountains, the goats would return to the village where they spent the night in communal goat pens, now preserved to bear witness to memories of the past. There are no longer wolves in the forest, but the biodiversity is varied and, at night, the village is visited by deer or wild boar. At the same time, the existing flora provides bees with nutritious food to produce high-quality honey.<br/>It&rsquo;s a beautiful experience to walk through the village streets, observe the architecture of the now-restored schist houses, and try to spot the traditional Maia flowers hanging from the doors in spring.<br/>To protect themselves from fires, the villagers replaced eucalyptus trees with cork oak trees. Under their shade, the goat herds work meticulously as they graze to help prevent fires.<br/>In this game, you experience the dynamic of a lively village, which you are invited to visit on foot or by bike on the mountain biking trails. Players take turns by playing cards with bees, oaks, or boars to collect goats to make collection sets that match the objectives.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But if someone does think of an answer before the timer runs out, that person wins the letter and also steals one letter from the person that called Katootsie!<br/>Other rules: Q, X and Z can appear anywhere in the word (not just at the beginning), and it's shown on the card for clarity.<br/>If there is a tie, ONLY the people that tied pull a 2nd letter and compete for that, and the winner takes both letters. <br/>Proper nouns are generally allowed unless otherwise indicated.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Időfut&aacute;r (&quot;Timerunner&quot;) is a young adult radio play that had gone through many adaptations in Hungary. Novel, stage play and board game had been created from it, so it craved for a card game adaptation. A competition was hosted in 2019 to design a card game related to Időfut&aacute;r, so my colleague Gergely and I submitted our entries: his solution won the special award, mine won first prize.<br/><br/>A company of friends find a seemingly useless, worn-out, old object. The &ldquo;compass&rdquo; &ndash; as it will be revealed later &ndash; leads its user to a hidden treasure. Our story does not continue with treasure hunt but a desperate escape, as mysterious, dark figures in suits appear and start a wild hunt for the tool of fortune.<br/><br/>The Időfut&aacute;r card game is an asymmetrical game for 2-6 players. Asymmetrical means &ndash; in this case &ndash; that a player handles the chaser suited enemies, while each of the other players play the role of a seventh grade student, who are the protagonists of our story. One against all. The adults aim to lure the children into a trap and get their hands on the compass. The latter ones, however, have to outmaneuver their chasers by dropping fake clues and creating diversions.<br/>The game keeps up a slight tension throughout the chase for both parties. While the students have limited communication (as the opponent hears everything), trapmaking doesn&rsquo;t always end up the same way, so sometimes we give away the position of the compass with our desperate fleeing. The player controlling the &lsquo;suited ones&rsquo; cannot sit back either, as time is working against them, and it is easy to run out of time if the students play their tricks strategically.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's 44 BCE, the pinnacle of the Roman Republic. At the end of Julius Caesar's civil war, he is left holding enormous power. He has the love of many, but for others, there is only fear. This fear leads Caesar's friends and allies to question his intentions. They're stoking a fire of conspiracy, a conspiracy that will end on the Ides of March, with 23 wounds, a republic in ruin, and the birth of an Empire.<br/><br/>In a game of 23 Knives, you take on the role of a Roman citizen with one of three allegiances: a loyalist to Caesar, a liberator of Rome, or an opportunist biding their time. Throughout the game, you travel through Rome, manipulating other citizens and swaying them to your cause.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, if 23 or more knives are in the Curia, Caesar is dead and the liberator most committed to killing Caesar wins. With fewer than 23 knives, the loyalist most dedicated to saving Caesar wins. Opportunists are those who linger, waiting to shift the fate of Caesar at the last moment, and if they do, they win as a team.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One Page REV: Guns in the Summer Wood is a solo roll and write American Revolution wargame. Players act as a colonial militia in upstate New York during the height of summer 1777. Six 6-sided dice are needed to play the game. The militia starts at one end of a map, with terrain generated randomly by dice rolls and drawn onto the map.<br/><br/>As the militia enters each hex, rolls to determine enemy units are made and combat follows. Different types of weapons (rifles, pistols, etc.) are affected by terrain and weather. Victory points are assigned to the player after defeating British units in combat, and British victory points are gained when the militia takes damage. Combat is resolved through dice rolls with the number of rolls depending upon the player's weapons, stamina and morale. Rolls exceeding a certain number count as hits, and the number of hits determines the attack's result.<br/><br/>If the militia accumulates sufficient victory points, it wins immediately. Otherwise the militia continues to an objective hex and if the militia has more victory points than the British, the player wins. Recordkeeping for the game is made on the map page and each game is played on a new page. The book contains a printer-friendly game page as well that can be copied and printed. The player could also use tokens and counters from other games to keep track of the game's progress.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to bring a fresh, highly-thematic, mid-heavy gamers&rsquo; game to your table, with a familiar setting of organizing great spectacles in the Colosseum. This time the game will take place in the specific era of Emperor Titus, who celebrated the inauguration of the Colosseum in 80 AD with a series of games and spectacles that lasted for 100 days, often referred to as &ldquo;The Games of Titus.&rdquo; These games were a lavish display of entertainment and were intended to demonstrate the wealth, power, and generosity of the emperor. They showcased a diverse array of entertainment and were among the most significant and memorable events in the Colosseum's history.<br/><br/>As a master impresario, you will have the chance to carefully orchestrate all possible means that you have, to organize the most epic and glorious grand spectacles of the Colosseum. Your moment in the sun has come...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is played over multiple rounds where players will draft dice from a common dice pool, and will use those dice as workers to place them on the tiles of the Great Harbor to play the corresponding actions. In order to place a die on a certain slot, the die must match the color with the slot of the tile. The die power (ranging from 1 to 6) will determine the strength of your action on that tile. Once someone places a die on a slot, that slot is taken and no other dice may be placed there until the end of the round.<br/><br/>The actions that can be played include: gaining resources that are important for shipbuilding, scheduling workers to work on building the ships, increasing your colony capacity to dock ships, sending your ships to patrol the Mediterranean and be on the lookout for pirates, hire special workers and diplomats and more.<br/><br/>The game ends is triggered when a player constructs a certain amount of ships in their fleet, after which all players will take equal amount of turns to end the game. Victory points from the constructed ships, pirates, resources and objectives are then calculated and the player with the most points is the winner of the game and proclaimed the most powerful governor of the Mediterranean!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each card represents every combination of 3 properties: rank (1, 2, 3, or 4), symbol (spade, heart, club, or diamond), and colour (red, yellow, green, blue, black, and white).<br/><br/>The game includes rules for the following games:<br/><br/><br/>     Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on: A trick-taking game for 2-7 players. Players bid the number of card points they must win in tricks with a possible partner. The highest bidder gets to exchange cards with the talon, pick the trump colour, and play with a potential partner.<br/><br/><br/>When playing a card to a trick, a player must follow both colour and symbol; if unable, follow symbol; if unable, follow color; and if unable, may play any card. Highest ranked trump card wins, otherwise highest ranked card that followed the led card's symbol, color, or both wins regardless of how well the card followed the led card. If there's a tie, then the card that followed the led card the best wins the trick (following both is the best, then symbol, then colour). Otherwise, the first card played wins.<br/><br/><br/>     Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on Crois&eacute;: Like Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on, except it's a 4-player, fixed-partnership game. Players include their intended trump colour in their bids and there's no talon.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Triplettes: A rummy game for 2-7 players. Players meld their cards by playing triplets, which are 3 cards where 2 out of 3 of their properties are all the same. Players can exchange one card from a played triplet with a card from their hand provided that there's still a valid triplet after the exchange.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Patience du Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on. The player deals 20 cards face up and looks for 4 cards whose 3 properties are all different.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Poker Cam&eacute;l&eacute;on: Describes new combinations to use to play any poker variant. Each combination consists of only 4 cards; players break ties by replacing the a card in their combination with a fifth card from their hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Partisans: A 4-player, fixed-partnership trick-taking game where the player who played the trick-winning card doesn't necessarily take the trick. There are only three colours in the deck, one for each partnership and a neutral one. Players must follow symbol, otherwise play any card.

        "description": "Boloa is a connection game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white. There is a sufficient supply of stones and pawns in each of the players' colors.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA party is a pawn along with all pawns one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent pawns. Note a party can include pawns of both colors.<br/><br/>A party is said to be smothered if no pawn in it is orthogonally adjacent to an empty point.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of these actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Place a pawn of your color on an empty point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Place a stone of your color on an empty point or on a point occupied by a pawn of either color. If the point is occupied by a pawn, move said pawn to an orthogonally adjacent point that is either empty or occupied by another pawn. The latter pawn is removed from the board. <br/><br/><br/>Next, replace all pawns in every smothered party with stones of the same color as the majority of pawns in that party. If a smothered party contains the same number of pawns of each color, replace them with stones of your opponent's color.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, for any two diagonally adjacent stones of your color there must be another stone of your color adjacent to both.<br/><br/>You win if there is a chain of orthogonally connected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, the second player will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to figure out which wire is the special defuse wire. Players take turns reviewing the clues that flash on the device and then having a go at cutting a wire.<br/><br/>A variant of the game turns Cut The Wire up a notch by switching from Classic mode to Timed mode. While playing in timed mode, each player has only 15 seconds to take their turn. If a player doesn&rsquo;t make a move in time, the device will explode and the player will be eliminated.

        "description": "U-BOAT CAPTAIN, Advanced Edition is a solitaire, tactical-operational level game covering individual German World War 2 U-Boat patrols and combat encounters, 1939-1942.<br/><br/>This edition (44 pages) comes with full rules, optional and advanced rules, eight U-Boat Displays, map, logsheet, 37 counters, and Reference Cards, along with with several historical scenarios and campaign games (of various lengths), extensive examples of play, historically rated U-Boat &quot;aces&quot;, and Designer's Notes.   <br/>The game has the feel of a miniatures rule set, but with boardgame format.  Utilize  various historical German U-Boat Types (Type VIIA, VIIB, VIIC, IXA, IXB, IXC, IIB, and IID), each rated for fuel capacity and consumption, number of torpedoes carried, deck gun characteristics, and durability/survivability.  <br/>Conduct monthly partrols to various locations (North Atlantic, Norway, the Arctic, Spain, West Africa, etc.) from 1939 through 1942 and try and achieve the most tonnage sunk you can, without being sunk yourself.  In each patrol, you wiill sail to your area of operation... <br/>conduct daily patrols/searches...<br/>if you have an encounter, decide when/if to attack (watch out for escorts)... <br/>if you attack, perform the attack sequence and launch torpedoes, or use your deck gun. <br/>When fuel starts to run low, or your boat has accumulated too much damage, you can sail back to port for refit and rest, before beginning your next patrol.  Sink at least 100,000 tons of allied shipping in your career and earn for yourself the coveted Knight's Cross.<br/><br/>This Minden Battlegame book (Volume 11) emphasizes high playability combined with authentic historicity to produce a game that plays quickly but retains a strong historical and authentic narrative. As such, U-Boat Captain aims to be your &quot;go to&quot; game for highly playable WW2 submarine action covering the Battle of the Atlantic. The game system often reflects the &quot;risk versus reward&quot; nature of the theater, as it places you in the role of a U-Boat commander, working with your crew to employ good tactics in an effort to sink allied shipping, while avoiding being sunk yourself.<br/><br/>This Advanced Edition retains the game system as published in Panzerschreck #19, and is fully compatible with it, but it adds new U-Boat types and additional optional rules, providing players with a comprehensive game that covers the war years from 1939 through 1942, the pivotal period of the Battle of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Can you be a successful U-Boat Captain?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to run the most successful turtle dating company, helping to romance turtles and sweep them right out of their shells. But you&rsquo;re not the only one vying for their attention; you might find yourself at odds with a rival company as you attempt to woo these reptiles. You better make sure you have just the right gifts to make the best impression. If that doesn&rsquo;t work, you could always donate the gifts and write off the expenses. After all, it&rsquo;s not just about the love; it&rsquo;s also about the money.<br/><br/>Shell Company - Don&rsquo;t Write Me Off is the first in a series of games Born at PAX&reg;. What does &ldquo;Born at PAX&rdquo; mean? We at Lynnvander Studios teamed up with the PAX team to run a panel called Design a Board Game Live. Shell Company - Don&rsquo;t Write Me Off was conceived by the crowd at PAX East 2022. They came up with the combination of turtle dating sim and tax evasion, and we refined their ideas into the board game you&rsquo;re holding now!<br/><br/>Shell Company is an auction-style bidding game with a touch of bluffing where players will need to manage their finances in order to acquire gifts. These gifts can either be used to romance potential clients, or they can be donated and used as a tax write-off. Both of these things are important because players are scored based on their weaker area.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guarding the Land: The Battle for Fort Griswold is a 2-player postcard wargame that covers the British assault on Ft. Griswold on September 6th, 1781 in Connecticut.  Benedict Arnold (a Limey who became a Yank and then turned Limey again) was in overall command of British forces and this was his last combat action of the war. He was on the west side of the river busily sacking the town. A British detachment landed on the east side of the river to tackle the American defenders in Ft. Griswold. Historically, the Americans were quickly routed and there were claims of a massacre by the British. Several poems were written later to commemorate the event.<br/><br/>This game requires a deck of regular playing cards and a six-sided die (d6) to play.<br/><br/>",

The Athenian expedition to Sicily was one of the great campaigns of antiquity: a grand adventure to remote shores, featuring a massive fleet and army, that was heavily financed, and benefited from the complete commitment of its citizenry. The goal was the subjugation of all Sicily in order to secure another source of grain. It was simultaneously bold and foolish, and it ended in disaster. But it nearly succeeded.<br/><br/>For the first time, Epipolae brings Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s Levy &amp; Campaign Series to the Ancient World, portraying 5th-century BCE Greek military operations with a focus on logistics and maneuver. Players will raise and equip their armies and navies, build alliances through diplomacy, and ravage, siege, and battle their way to victory.<br/><br/>Historically, the Athenians were initially led by three leaders: Nicias, Alcibiades, and Lamachus. Nicias planned to circumnavigate around Sicily, settling a dispute on behalf of an ally, then parading the majestic and renowned Athenian fleet in a show of strength on the return voyage home to Greece. Alcibiades aimed to travel around Sicily conducting diplomacy, building a coalition of city-states, bringing the entire island into Athen&rsquo;s imperial alliance known as the Delian League. Lamachus was inclined to immediately besiege and capture Syracuse, the strongest city in Sicily, before they could react and adequately prepare.<br/><br/>",

Maps are printed on high quality poster stock front and back.<br/><br/>Chicago Speakeasy (3 to 5 players recommended), map design by Ashley Miller<br/><br/>The Windy City. Speakeasies and bootleggers in the Roaring &lsquo;20s.  Your stomping grounds are the famous haunts of the likes of Al Capone and other Chicago gangsters. This ain&rsquo;t gonna be easy. You will need to build the best underground network to deliver the &lsquo;goods&rsquo; and &lsquo;handle&rsquo; the Feds to come out on top.   <br/>This map is based on 1920s era Chicago speakeasies and the battle with agents from the Bureau of Prohibition to keep them running. Black cubes represent the Bureau agents and may only be delivered to the Bureau of Prohibition. Goods cannot be delivered to Cities containing black cubes. Bribes must be paid for delivering goods through Cities containing black cubes. The special action &lsquo;Bump Off an Agent&rsquo; can be used to remove a black cube from the map.<br/><br/>Rush Belt 2112 (3-6 players recommended) , map design by Kevin McCurdy<br/><br/>The year is 2112. Everything has changed. Sea levels have risen. Some say a comet fell from the sky. Followed by tidal waves. Those that survived have built and sheltered in massive dome structures. Finally, the first signs of life above ground are reappearing. Your goal is to explore the abandoned Cities, collect resources, and bring them back to the domes. <br/>This map is based in the near future in the heart of the USA. Domes start with demands for specific colors of cubes providing +1 income. When the demands are met, the domes become a colored City with +1 income for deliveries to the dome. Players must build out from Domes and explore the land afresh after the great disaster and bring back the high demand goods to succeed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From 1943 to the end of World War Two, both the American Office of Strategic Services and the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) materially assisted the anti-Fascist, anti-Nazi Partisan movement in Italy. Teams of agents were inserted behind the Axis lines by submarine or parachute to make contact with the Partisan groups and brigades.<br/><br/>An example of this is Operation Canuck, an SOE mission undertaken near Turin in 1945. Captain Robert &ldquo;Buck&rdquo; MacDonald of Nova Scotia, seconded from the Royal Canadian Dragoons to the 2nd British Special Air Service Regiment, arrived with his team in the area of Alba, a large town about 30 km from Turin, in January 1945. They set up their main base in the village of Castino and began to work with local Partisan leaders to train and arm fighters and arrange air drops of supplies and weapons. The climax of the operation was on 26 April 1945 when their combined forces liberated Alba and forced the occupiers to surrender, several days before Allied troops arrived in the area.<br/><br/>Operation CANUCK is a short game that portrays the activities of this mission in an abstract way. The game is intended for solitaire play. During the game the single player (the Partisan) will draw from a deck of ordinary playing cards. The Partisan will deliberately select from the red cards drawn to execute operations representing the efforts of their forces and draw randomly from the black cards to show the Fascist, German and collaborator (collectively, &ldquo;Axis&rdquo;) counter-actions.<br/><br/>This is a free print-and-play game. Besides the material downloaded, players need 6 dice and a deck of ordinary playing cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A good witch arrives and presents Dorothy with a pair blue sapphire slippers. The good witch directs Dorothy to the Emerald City, where the Wizrd of Oz can help her return home. Join Dorothy as she makes new friends and goes on strange adventures!<br/><br/>青い靴とオズの魔術師 (&quot;The Blue Slippers and the Wizard of Oz&quot;) includes 32 cards, 16 black and 16 blue. The cards are numbered, but OR cards offer a choice of numbers. This anthology includes rules for three games, each one being the designer's take on combining other popular games. Certain cards also have special effects that change from game to game.<br/><br/>In Shoes (Old Maid x Werewolf, 2-6 players), a player only keeps 2 cards in their hand. Players take turns drawing from other players' hands in an attempt to form pairs. If a player can't make a pair with the three cards in their hand, they must discard one card to the discard pile. Optional rules include special effects for the cards, including making a player immediately lose if they play or discard the 0 or Oz card.<br/><br/>In Liar (Cheat (BS) x Dobon, 2-5 players), players place a card or cards face-down and declare the number, which must be equal to or higher than the previous card. Players may play a card face-up, but they must draw 2 cards as a penalty. If a player accuses a player of lying and are correct, the previous player must take their cards back and draw a card. If the accuser is wrong, they must draw instead. Optional rules include special effects for different cards, and you may include a rule allowing a player go out if they can add, subtract, multiply, or divide all the number sin their hand to equal the previous declared number.<br/><br/>Quartet (Poker x Color Matching, 2-4 players) is a bluffing game where players place cards in their own tableau. Players hold only two cards in their hand at a time, and the goal is to have four cards in a row with the same color. Players may play cards face-down, but not if they did so on their previous turn. Optional rules add more opportunities to reach the goal and block the other players.<br/><br/>",

There&lsquo;s a bustling crowd, with people from all corners of the known world trading and haggling over exotic spices, foods, and other treasures. But this idyllic scene is deceiving, for doom is already awakening, as the next lunar eclipse is imminent. Far out in the Maelstrom, the Hydra rises from its deep slumber. Four necks stretch out, countless heads raise, hungrily targeting Arizont. The city walls, once proud and solid, tremble under the looming threat as the beast charges relentlessly.<br/><br/>But this time, the story shall take a new turn. The Guild Council has sent out a call for aid in all directions, promising rewards of princely stature. Brave heroes have heeded this call. However, wealth and honor will be bestowed only upon those who can earn the city&lsquo;s admiration through courage and determination against the Hydra.<br/><br/>Thus, you too have found your way to Arizont. Your hearts burn with resolve to protect the city and return with pockets full of gold.<br/><br/>Together, you face off against the many-headed Hydra. But in this epic battle, each of you not only strives for the city&lsquo;s welfare, but also for the sole glory awarded to the triumphant victor in the end. Each of you will choose from available actions, block crucial cards with Action tokens, and formulate tactics - be it in combat against the Hydra, constructing defensive Barricades, or advancing into optimal attack positions. Yet, the Hydra retaliates, drawing insurmountable power from remaining action cards and the darkening moon.<br/><br/>The city&lsquo;s fate is in your hands. By standing united, you&lsquo;ll be hailed as true heroes. But only the best among you will go down in the city&lsquo;s history as an epic hero, weighed in gold. Are you this much-sung hero? Will you stand shoulder to shoulder, only to stab your comrade in the back when it counts? Beware, for they too are waiting for that moment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Solitaire TacOps is a campaign system that simulates the battlefield space where operational decisions meet tactical realities. For Ortona, you start with four infantry battalions, one armored regiment, an artillery battery, and an engineer company. These are represented on counters ranging from platoons to squads, with tank groups and artillery guns. Players will make operational decisions such as when and where to engage the enemy, which forces to use, and the type of support to provide them with. The scenarios are then played on hex maps that use a megahex activation system to manage the opposition.<br/><br/>An innovative dice system handles both player and opposition actions, providing a wide range of outcomes with fast resolution. This allows you to keep your focus on the map action and the narrative that emerges from play. The scenarios, which last from 30 to 90 minutes, will pull you in as you attempt to achieve objectives with the fewest losses. Each scenario can be played solitaire, with cooperative setups also available for some of the larger ones.<br/><br/>While the scenarios can be played as one-offs, the TacOps system comes alive over the course of the full campaign. The outcome from one scenario will determine which one is played next, all leading to the final engagement in the streets of Ortona, where the Canadian 1st Division will find the well-prepared German defenses of the Fallschirmj&auml;ger Division. Destroyed buildings, rubble piles, mines, snipers, and other traps will challenge the tactical and operational skills players will need to survive &ldquo;bloody December&rdquo; in Ortona.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>    Three double-sided 11&quot; x 17&quot; Maps<br/>    One Dashboard Display<br/>    Two Countersheets of counters and markers<br/>    Dice<br/>    12 Scenario Cards<br/>    One Campaign Tracking Pad<br/>    One Rulebook with Historical Notes<br/>    One Learn to Play Booklet<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Open fire at her!'&hellip; But the name of the enemy ship was of course the Graf Spee.&rdquo;<br/>&ndash; Lieutenant-Commander Richard Jennings, HMS Exeter's gunnery officer during the Battle of the River Plate<br/><br/>Heroic quotes are overrated, focussing too much on the individual or on the big picture. I sometimes feel the same about naval wargames. They are either so sweepingly huge that the tactical battles aren't as fun, or they are so granular that five minutes of combat takes an hour to simulate. <br/>There's The Effing Scheer is my attempt to create an exciting game that doesn't devour your time. <br/>You have half a dozen or less models per side. <br/>Terrain isn't really a worry. <br/>You just need a tape measure, a ruler and some 12-sided dice. Plus this ruleset.<br/><br/><br/>     Realistic accuracy and damage (though luck is always a reliably unreliable factor).<br/>     Small battles won't last an hour of your time. Even large engagements should be finished in under a few hours.<br/>     Historical design decisions are built into the rule mechanics, e.g. the rate of fire of 6&quot; shells over 8&quot; shells means they hit smaller targets more easily, but won't pack as much of a punch against cruisers.<br/>     Launching torpedoes, firing, critical hits, changing formation and more are all simplified to speed up play time. Your subordinates are professionals after all.<br/>     Critical damage such as loss of power, damaged fire control, fires and magazine explosions are all possible (but not encouraged, unless on your opponent's ships).<br/>     Advanced rules cover collisions, night battles, Long Lance torpedoes and more. <br/>     Six starter scenarios set across the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Pacific.<br/>     Open architecture. How I designed these rules is shown in the Appendix if you fancy constructing scenarios of your own for the miniatures in your collection.<br/><br/><br/>Overall, if you want a game which isn't going to take up all of your time, give realistic-ish results and allow you to roll some dice with friends as you refight the early naval engagements of World War 2, look no further.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The village elders have predicted a severe winter, and so the villagers have agreed to work together to ensure that the village has all of the necessities. In a spirit of healthy competition, the villagers have decided to compete to see who can be the most helpful. However, Rabbit, the constant trickster, has decided that he does not want to work. Instead, he has decided to confuse everyone else so that he can take all of the resources for himself.<br/><br/>Winter Rabbit is set in the world of traditional Cherokee animal stories, where each player takes on the role of one of the animal characters. In this semi-cooperative game, players cooperate to provide everything the village needs for winter while also competing to see who can contribute the most.<br/><br/>Winter Rabbit features a unique hidden worker placement system. Villagers are drawn randomly from a bag. The active player knows whose villager they have drawn and can choose where to place it, though this information is hidden from other players. Resources are only generated when enough villagers are present. When resources are produced, every player gets one, but those with villagers present gain additional resources.<br/><br/>Rabbit villagers do not produce resources. When one of these appears in a resource location, resources are instead diverted to the Rabbit Burrow. In later turns, players can steal these resources back.<br/><br/>Players can spend resources to build their personal engine through village cards. They can also spend resources on stories that affect the game for all players, or complete tasks that score points, progress the game, and provide a benefit to another player.<br/><br/>Players are encouraged to manage resources carefully. Storage is limited, and overproducing can result in difficulty producing resources in future turns.<br/><br/>The game ends after a variable number of rounds, depending on player count. If players have collectively produced enough supplies for the village to survive Winter, then the player with the highest score wins. If Winter arrives before the necessary supplies are produced, then players share a collective loss.<br/><br/>Winter Rabbit attempts to create a counterpoint to common colonial game themes by focusing on indigenous values and concepts. Winter Rabbit won second prize in the 2021 Zenobia Awards.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The enemy monster plays cards automatically based on die rolls and a specified system. Win enough single-card tricks, and you defeat the enemy...then you have to fight the next monster with the cards remaining in your hand.<br/><br/>If you run out of cards before defeating all eight monsters, you die, at which point all of the cards return to your hand, all of the monsters respawn, and you return to the beginning of the book.<br/><br/>However, by defeating monsters you earn money, and you can use that money to purchase card effects, ideally allowing you to defeat monsters with fewer cards. Effects apply only to cards in hand, so if you've played strong cards already, you might have to wait until your next life to apply magic to them.<br/><br/>Monsters have different abilities, not just more life to defeat, so you need to develop tactics to defeat them, possibly by taking detours in the book dungeon to earn money through side quests. In the end, you must defeat eight enemies to win.<br/><br/>",

Only players who are well positioned can capture the most gold coins and sail away. Courage, tactics and a willingness to take risks are required, but players who risk too much on the dock and fall into the water will go away empty handed. The player who captures the most gold coins wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>42 playing cards (barrel cards and bridge cards), 24 gold coins, 4 wooden discs, 1 game manual.<br/><br/>",

Historically, memorabilia (such as t-shirts and posters) was purchased for a favorite band. The memorabilia added value to the collector's collection. In MoM, players can acquire memorabilia and attach it to a collection. The memorabilia enhances the collections value (or length). In order to attach memorabilia, like icons (decade, live, picture disc) needs to be arranged so that the icons are adjacent between albums. The more albums and memorabilia the longer the collection. Unlike the base game, the basic collections only require the player to match bands and rewards players for long dedicated collections. MoM is compatible with Top Shelf, Publisher Expansion, and the Clearance Bin.<br/><br/>",

Your tools are wands, pentacles, swords, and cups: the cards of the Minor Arcana, which allow you to control the four elements of nature. Four Major Arcana cards are dealt in a diamond pattern so that the Minor Arcana cards can be placed adjacent to them on each side. The player tries to subjugate one or more of these cards by surrounding them with a Minor Arcana card of each suit, the sum of which also exceeds the value of the Major Arcana card. The player can use the Magician card to activate special powers, including the power to change the suit of a card to a wild suit. When cards are subjugated, both the Major Arcana and the surrounding Minor Arcana cards are discarded. Some Major Arcana cards have addition requirements for subjugating them, and others offer rewards after being subjugated. There are also expansion cards which include even more requirements and rewards for greater variability. If the player can subjugate all 21 Major Arcana before the Minor Arcana deck runs out, they win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Match Trace is a Print and Play paper and pencil &quot;arcade&quot; game that simulates sailboat racing.<br/>Players take on the roles of skippers, each controlling a sailboat on a course represented on paper.<br/>The game requires strategic planning, an element of chance, and tactical decision-making.<br/>The core mechanic involves three dice, which are passed between players.<br/>These dice determine the movement of the sailboats, with one die dictating forward (up or down) movement and the others controlling lateral movement, based on odd and even values.<br/>Players must judiciously use their &quot;knots&quot; to reroll dice and thus influence their course, adding a layer of strategy to each move.<br/>Interaction between players is a key aspect of Match Trace, mirroring the competitive nature of real-life match racing.<br/>Players can strategically impede their opponent's progress by &quot;covering their wind,&quot; a move that requires careful positioning and foresight.<br/>Match Trace offers various modes of play, including single races, best-of-three series, and timed challenges.<br/><br/>",

At first, the spider disliked the human, unable to see the value in someone who lacked the courage to leave. But when the door vanished, it realized the human's true sorrow. The spider and its friends decided to work together to somehow get the human outside.<br/><br/>Every time the human moves, they leave trash behind. The spider diligently eats this trash, keeping the room clean. The consumed trash becomes nourishment, which the spider uses to spin the only pathway for the human to leave &ndash; a thread. It continues this every day, hoping for the day when its wish for the human to go outside will come true.<br/><br/>Unaware of the spider's earnest love, the human breaks the thread path the spider has spun. The game's system involves 'Route Construction + Destruction and Regeneration', where the spider spins threads that the human breaks. The system presents a harsh choice between strategic benefits for progressing in the game, or flavor benefits to enrich the human's life outside, through the 'Amida Spider System'. This system conveys a strong message to you. Do you want to win the game, or do you want to see the human start a new life?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scandinavian Big Box includes Copenhagen and Helsinki in their Deluxe Edition including two expansions each!<br/><br/>The Danish city of Copenhagen is traversed by canals and harbors, and part of it &mdash; &quot;Nyhavn&quot; (New Harbor) &mdash; is famous for the colorful gabled houses along the water.<br/><br/>In Copenhagen, players design new fa&ccedil;ades for these houses so that they fit seamlessly into this beautiful harbor setting. On a turn, a player may choose to take two adjacent cards from the display (they may never hold more than 7 cards), or use cards to buy facade tiles in various shapes and colors. Any tile may be purchased, but you get a discount if you place a tile touching another one of the same color. Building over certain spaces or completing designated rows grants the players new abilities to make their job easier. Finishing a row or column will award the player points (doubled if it is all windows), and the game is a race to 12 points.<br/><br/>The famous Senate Square in the center of the Finnish capital is surrounded by government buildings, the university, the cathedral and the Sederholm House. The players ́ task is to design pavilions across the square to protect pedestrians in the rain. Helsinki is based on the design of Copenhagen by the same design team, but with some added complexity.<br/><br/>The center board depicts the Senate Square with 8 spaces (two per side) and 8 cards, with each card connected to two spaces. The player on their turn advances their pawn 1-3 spaces, then must choose to take cards or build a pavilion. Each space is connected to two face up cards, and the player may choose to draw these into their hand (making sure to respect the 7 card hand limit, a key challenge in the game). The cards are in one of 5 colors and show a shape of size 2 to 5. To build a pavilion, the player plays a card showing the piece they want to play, and then must play an additional number of cards of the same color to match the size of the piece. Finally, the piece must be &quot;slid&quot; onto their game board (which also represents the Senate Square) from the side of the Square their pawn is on on the main board. Covering certain spaces earns a coat of arms, which may be spent to use one of the 15 one-time special actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It won&rsquo;t be easy due to persistent enemy aircraft and escorts continuously hunting your U-boat, but the German people are depending on you. Don&rsquo;t let the Fatherland down!<br/><br/>The game includes the following components:<br/><br/>     1 Tables Book (12 pages)<br/>     1 Tables Book Cover Page<br/>     1 Game Mat (A4 / 8.5 x 11)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Two D10, one D12, and one D20 dice are required to play.<br/>     5 minute game setup and breakdown times.<br/>     A medium size table is recommended for game setup.<br/>     Total play time to complete a full campaign takes approximately 4-6 hours, with a typical patrol averaging 30 minutes.<br/>     Adjustable starting difficulty based on player's skill level.<br/><br/><br/>With most of the rules integrated into the tables, there is practically no learning curve or rules memorization. And with water depth rules, compressed air rules, oxygen rules, numerous crew skills, weather effects, random events, and a multitude of table modifiers, Iron Coffins: US East Coast Expansion offers memorable experiences and high replay value.

Trick your opponents, grab the Treasure&hellip; and get out alive!<br/><br/>-Build together:<br/>The core mechanic consists in building the map by placing or twisting square Tiles. Every board piece can be manipulated in order to create new paths, spawn loot and resources, or lock up and slow down opponents. A unique and ever-changing scenario will come to life by collaborating with other players (or just messing up with their agenda).<br/><br/>-Grab that Loot:<br/>Every player has a simple objective: get filthy rich and escape. Wealth can be accumulated by pillaging around or collecting combos of matching Tiles (that can be traded for Rooms), but most of all... you can just steal from other players. Robberies are settled with dice and allow to grab any Token from the opponent's inventory.<br/><br/>-Choose your Rogue:<br/>Each playable character can drastically change your approach to the raid, thanks to their unique skills and wacky personality. But there's always room for customization: scavenge for Objects and Potions in order to cheat fate or unlock a variety of bonus effects.<br/><br/>-Escape in time:<br/>When someone manages to collect a Treasure Token and take it out of the Dungeon, the endgame triggers. The entire map will crumble to the ground after just a turn, burying everyone still inside.

Players arrange the cards in the shape of a triangle and each turn will rescue one of the cards from the triangle which represents the mountain. Each card features a skier in one of five colors, one of six trees, and one of three tools. The unused cards each game are used for the scoring area which affects both players.<br/><br/>In this game of Alpine rescue dogs, players will have to cleverly select a card each turn that helps their chances of winning or keeps their opponent from scoring. Additionally, the turn order changes depending on the time value of the card selected. Sometimes a player will want the higher time value as it has a color skier or tool they need, but doing so opens them up to going second on the following round if their opponent takes a lower time value. As each card is rescued from the mountain, the selection of cards shrinks. Taking certain cards opens up other cards which may help an opponent or it may hinder their path. Each choice of card presents a path down the mountain.<br/><br/>But which of the mountain rescue dogs will be the winner? Will it be the rookie, Beethoven and his slobbery jaws or will it be Barry, the veteran who has lead the team over many winters?<br/><br/>Safe and Hound is played over 3 rounds and presents over 800 different scoring combinations! Players will find plenty of fun in this small card game that packs a lot of strategy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Well-trained and organized, the KPA moves with a purpose.<br/><br/>The army of the Republic of Korea (ROK) on the other hand, lacks heavy weapons and tanks. The US has deliberately refused tanks and heavy artillery to the ROK to keep it from invading the North. Furthermore, the ROK army is poorly trained and disorganized. US forces in the region are limited to the eviscerated 24th infantry division. Like its ROK counterparts, the 24th is under-equipped, with obsolete weapons.<br/><br/>The KPA drives south, grinding over ROK forces and US forces alike. Within days, Seoul falls to the onslaught.<br/><br/>The Truman administration is unprepared for the invasion. The US secretary of state, Dean Acheson, fails to include South Korea in the Asian Defense Perimeter, and this emboldens the communists.<br/><br/>The US has no defense policy to protect South Korea. However, the administration views Japan as being a critical ally in Eastern Asia. Ceding South Korea puts Japan in danger, and among other considerations, Truman finds himself with no choice but to intervene.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The whims of chance devour the weak and unlucky until all that remains are the barest fragments of history in Dice Bloodline.<br/><br/>Dice Bloodline is a one-player dice game of creating a multi-generation family tree. You begin with a lone ancestor, quickly looking to preserve a legacy across over a hundred years of history through marriage, childbirth, and avoiding calamities like&hellip;well&hellip;like the plague. You are at the whim of the dice, but you are not helpless in directing your future. Each turn allows you to choose how the dice score from a table of twelve options (familiar to anyone who has played a &ldquo;Yacht-family&rdquo; dice game). With this, you select the shape into which your family tree will branch.<br/><br/>This is a &ldquo;Make-as-You-Play&rdquo; game, which means that the game starts with no more than a sheet of paper, a pencil, and some dice. The rules provide all the guidance you need for adding new members to your family tree through marriage and childbirth, which makes every game of Dice Bloodline an evolving, unique experience. You may even find opportunities to grow new trees from leaves of ones you created previously, leading to a complex web of ancestry and interlocking families over vast stretches of time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

All scenarios have undergone some modification, be it to their order of battle, boards, or victory conditions, similar to what was done with Volume 1.<br/><br/>WaR 9 - SAMR&Eacute;E,, BELGIUM, 20 December 1944: The 116.Panzerdivision was ordered to retrace its footsteps and head northwest through Houffalize towards La Roche and Sam&eacute;e instead. The 7th Armored Division&rsquo;s main supply depot had been moved to just outside Sam&eacute;e and the only other defenders around Dochamps and Sam&eacute;e at this time were engineers of the 51st Engineer Combat Battalion. (Estimated playing time: 6 hrs 24 mins)<br/><br/>WaR 10 - WARDIN, BELGIUM, 20 December 1944: As Bastogne defenses were being rapidly reinforced, Company I, 3rd Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment started entering Wardin from the northwest, unseen in the morning mist. Elements of Panzer Lehr&rsquo;s Aufkl&auml;rungsabteilung moved in from the northeast at the same time and the two groups inevitably collided. (Estimated playing time: 5 hrs 27 mins)<br/><br/>WaR 11 - GREVILS-BR&Eacute;SIL, LUXEMBOURG, 23 December 1944: Called out of OKW Reserve on 22 December, the F&uuml;hrer Grenadier Brigade would try to fill the vacuum between the 5.Fallschirmj&auml;gersivison and the 352.Volksgrenadierdivision. Kahler put one company of Fusiliers apiece into Eschdorf and Heiderscheid and sent two south with a platoon of Panthers to Grevils-Br&eacute;sil, hoping to establish contact with the leading regiment of the 352.Volksgrenadierdivision.

Rochefort was in fact well defended by the Americans of the 3rd Battalion, 335th Infantry Regiment. (Estimated playing time: 4 hrs 33 mins)<br/><br/>WaR 14 - VERDENNE, BELGIUM, 24 December 1944: The La Roche Bridge had to be repaired by the division&rsquo;s engineers; so, after withdrawing from Hotton, it was not until 23 December that the westward advance of the 116.Panzerdivison resumed. The intention of the commander of the 116.Panzerdivison, Generalmajor von Waldenburg, was to cut the Hotton-Marche road, capture Marche, and advance toward Ciney, securing the right flank of 2.Panzerdivision.

By midnight saw von B&ouml;hm&lsquo;s men at the hamlet of Foy-Notre-Dame with only 6 kilometres to their goal. (Estimated playing time: 16 hrs 32 mins)<br/><br/>WaR 16 - VILLERS-LA-BONNE-EAU, BELGIUM, 30 December 1944: The attack on Villers-la-Bonne-Eau began at 04:45 hours on 30 December with the Fallschirmj&auml;gerregiment 14 leading companies, closely followed by the mounted SS-Panzergrenadiers and Panzerj&auml;ger IVs of Kampfgr&uuml;ppe Hansen, 1.SS-Panzerdivision Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler.

Our Ardennes/Bulge survivor (barely) 9th Armored Division gets payback! :-) ? :-/<br/><br/>15 German pieces, including fleeing refugees and military units (including the platoon of a &quot;top secret&quot; SAM (surface-to-air-missile) weapon) as well as the engineer company trying to destroy the Bridge after enough military units and refugees get across<br/>... despite maddening chain-of-command and technical demolition difficulties and delays.<br/><br/>Refugees in the way clogging the road/approaches, and fleeing German military units safely across the Bridge may suddenly up and desert and disappear! instead of helping to hold the northern end (as the remnant of an elite parachute battalion did!, historically).<br/><br/>Sudden death ... of the Bridge ... can end the game.  Or if we get across, depleted German panzer divisions (including local commander Fritz Bayerlein's Panzer Lehr) can try to push the Allies back - maybe even to get back to the northern end of the bridge to try to blow it again.<br/><br/>Included are my Pressed Attack and Desperate/No Retreat! rules, and in its very first (solitaire) playtest game, our 27th Armored Infantry Battalion's attack 2:1 attack across the Bridge ended in only a Disruption of the German engineer/Pioneer company, enabling it to then (at 1:2 odds) blow the Bridge (in our faces) at the start of the next turn.<br/><br/>The fleeing German units west of the Rhine are hidden even to the German player - CHAOS! - although he gets to peek at 2 of them every turn after the first.  Disrupted German military units stay so and stay visible, unless they are not re-Disrupted in the next US combat phase.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",
