        "description": "Go with the Floe is a two-player abstract chase game. The seal player wants to isolate the seals beyond the reach of the pursuing polar bears. The polar bear player wins if both seals are caught, otherwise the seal player wins.<br/><br/>Components<br/>    Modified 8 x 8 board with 52 ice spaces<br/>    2 black seal tokens and 2 white polar bear tokens.<br/>    50 hole-in-the-ice ring markers<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Starting with the Black player, players take turns moving one of their tokens. A player may pass a turn only if he or she has no legal move.<br/>Either player tokens can:<br/>    1) Move one or two empty spaces in any one direction, like a range-restricted chess queen, or<br/>    2) Move by jumping over one ring marker in any direction into an empty space, as in checkers but without capturing or multiple jumps.<br/><br/>Captures<br/>Only White may capture an opponent&rsquo;s token and this can only be done from an adjacent space, like a chess king. On capturing both the white and black tokens are removed from play leaving the capture space empty.<br/><br/>After moving or capturing, the moving player places a hole-in-the-ice ring marker on the moving token&rsquo;s starting space and any empty space passed over.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>The game ends when one of the following occurs:<br/>    * The White player captures both Black tokens. White wins.<br/>    * The Black player has one token isolated and which cannot be captured. Black wins.<br/>    * Both players pass on consecutive turns. Black wins.<br/><br/>",

Now the epic planetary engagements of the New Era, The Final War, or the Frontier Wars are under your control, allowing you to command battalions of lift infantry, drop troops, and grav armor. These rules are fully compatible with Traveler, and so also allow miniatures resolution of role-playing adventures.<br/><br/>Combat in the 58th century is fast-moving, and so is Striker II. Based on the award-winning Command Decision miniature rules, Striker II allows rapid play which replicates the rapid tempo and quick reactions of advanced technology warfare. These straight-forward rules allow players to concentrate on the mental dilemmas of tactics and command, not the interpretation of complicated rules mechanics.<br/><br/>Striker II is more than just rules, it is also an extensive source of military hardware and organizations-from the jeeps and tracked vehicles of Wilds units to the speeders and gray tanks of a Reformation Coalition Marine Brigade. Striker II also includes tables of organization and equipment listings for some of the most important military units from Traveller's long history: Zhondai Lift Infantry Battalions and Commando Groupments, Imperial Marine Task Forces, Imperial Guard Regiments, and the legendary 4518th Lift Infantry Regiment- &quot;The Duke of Regina's Own Huscarls.&quot;<br/><br/>Striker II provides the full science fiction combat experience with rules on orbital bombardment, drop troops, anti-missle fire control, planetary environment, and orbital superiority.

At the same time, each move is a tactical decision, so it can also interest older players.<br/><br/>It is a race game in which the goal is to collect point markers along the way.<br/><br/>The movement of the pawns depends on the card played. Each player has four cards in hand and on his turn he plays one card and advances the pawn to the next space with the card's picture.<br/><br/>Depending on the situation and on the card used, the player can advance faster or slower. As the markers towards the end of the way worth more points, the player would like to advance fast. But in doing so, he can waste the opportunity to earn some important points along the way.<br/><br/>",

Golem features a unique shared-piece mechanic in which the players bid for control of the golem's movement, trying to harvest charms and foist curses upon their opponents. Along the way, players may gain control of powerful artifacts, such as the Amulet of Loki, that can change the game in an instant. With its modular board, Golem is never the same game twice. Golem features the haunting artwork of Niklas Brandt.<br/><br/>In the game, each turn consists of the following phases: <br/><br/>     allocation<br/>     orientation<br/>     movement<br/>     harvesting<br/>     regeneration<br/><br/><br/>Players have 20 units to allocate per turn (to orientation, movement, harvesting, and regeneration). Points are earned for harvesting charms. Play continues until one player reaches 30 points.<br/><br/>",

Similarity in game play to apples to apples and other games<br/><br/>DETAILED GAMEPLAY<br/><br/><br/>     Everyone has 7 red assumption cards in hand. Assumptions cards have red backs, and simple text on the front. Some are ridiculous, some are serious.<br/>     Player A draws a black character card from the pile without looking, revealing it to everyone else. Closing your eyes works. Holding it to your forehead works. So does holding it out in front of you.<br/>     Everyone else plays a red assumption card from their hand about the revealed character by putting it face-down. Players draw a new assumption card from the red pile so everyone's hands contain 7 cards.<br/>     Player A, with the character card still a mystery, flips the played  assumptions cards one at a time, reading them aloud (and inherently drawing their own assumptions about the character they haven't seen yet). Then, FINNNALLLLY, they get to flip their character card. Lol.<br/>     Player A picks the assumption they think best fits the character. The person who played the chosen assumption is the winner, and keeps the character card, collecting it as a point earned.<br/>     That's it! Rotate Player A and repeat. The game ends when X points are reached, or Y time has passed (you make up these numbers), or everyone hates each other. Preferably, before this last one happens. Enjoy!<br/><br/><br/>",

These constraints can be a requirement (i.e. you must use the letter &quot;E&quot; or you must have six letters in the word) or a ban (i.e. you can't use verbs or you can't have a word with 4 or less letters).<br/><br/>Then you must find a word that corresponds to at least 4 constraints, then trigger the timer to give the other players 30 seconds more to find a better word than yours. Pondering if you should find a 5(or 6)-constraint word or go fast with a 4-constraint word to get the fastest-player bonus but risk losing it all to a better word is the core mechanic of the game.<br/><br/>",

Years of seething hostility between the North and South boiled over as the Southern States saw Lincoln&rsquo;s election as a direct threat to their rights, and the nation fell apart as a new Confederacy was formed in the South. The Confederacy, striving to assert its independence, opened fire on the Northern troops occupying Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbour on April 12th 1861. Determined to preserve the Union, Northern troops headed south and on to Richmond! Over the next four terrible long years American armies tramped across American fields and burnt American farms as Americans killed Americans in a war the likes of which the nation had never seen before. The epic battles fought during the American Civil War proved beyond all doubt that war can be &lsquo;all hell&rsquo;.<br/><br/>This supplement for Black Powder describes the history, armies, key leaders, doctrine and tactics of the American Civil War, and includes a comprehensive set of army lists and optional rules for recreating the battles of that war in miniature.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The story<br/><br/>Athena is known for being the goddess of war, but she was also the goddess of peace, the protector and the guardian of the city. She didn&rsquo;t like battles, and on the contrary, she was delighted when she was able to stop a fight. This is why she asked to the gods of the four elements: Poseidon, god of seas and waters, Gaia, goddess of earth, Aether, god of air, and Hephaestus, god of fire ; to build a prestigious city-state: EPHYRAN! Each deity would be represented by its element and the aim would be to bring all the mythological creatures representative of the elements to live together! The deities got quickly down to work: a Blue Lagoon for the sea creatures, a Sacred Land for the earth creatures, a Forbidden Forest for the flying creatures and a Fire Mountain for the fire creatures&hellip;<br/><br/>It seems Athena couldn&rsquo;t meet the challenge and today, the city-state has totally disappeared. Totally? It is heard that the present-day town of Corinth is a vestige of the city-state and that is was actually built on EPHYRAN ruins&hellip;<br/><br/>The proof is that the city symbol is nothing but a winged stallion: Pegasus!<br/><br/>Game overview<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of one of the gods and has to build the city-state of Ephyran as prestigious as possible. The city-state must be composed of the 4 gods&rsquo; territories (each territory being divided into 4 areas): Poseidon&rsquo;s lagoon (blue), Hephaestus&rsquo;s mountain (red), Aeolus&rsquo;s forest (green) and Gaia&rsquo;s lands (brown).<br/>To get the highest prestige, you will have to vary the mythological creatures that will live in your city, and add magical tokens offered by the gods. You can also try to get some of the areas which already come with these tokens...<br/><br/>A game round<br/><br/>On each round, the players can choose between one of the following actions:<br/>Add a Territory to their city (if possible) displaying them according to the territory type next to its god (only one copy of each territory is allowed in a city!).<br/>Play a Support card. <br/>Change a (non-covered) territory of their city by discarding it and replacing it immediately by another one.<br/>Discard a card.<br/>To end their round, the players take a new card on the top of the pile or of the discard pile.<br/><br/>End of the game<br/><br/>The game ends when the pile is empty (without taking into account the discard) or when a player puts the 16th card of his city-state.<br/>Then the turn ends so that the players play the same number of cards, then it&rsquo;s time to count the prestige points.<br/><br/>",

If a Gladiator fought well he could appeal for mercy in the hope that his performance had earned him a reprieve.<br/><br/>NOT SO IN THE WORLD OF TALOMIR.<br/><br/>Talomir, the fantasy world of Warrior Heroes and Rally Round the King, offers no such luxury. Gladiatorial combat thrives in Talomir but it&rsquo;s strictly on the job training. There are no Gladiator schools or benevolent Patrons that will provide you the chance to learn your craft. Instead you learn on the battlefield or in some cases the back alleys of the decadent cities of Tropilium or Demeskeen, home of the largest arenas. But more than likely you&rsquo;ll just die in some rat infested arena in a backwater town.<br/><br/>Ah, but if you succeed Fame and Fortune await.<br/><br/>Red Sand Black Moon uses mechanics similar to those found in Red Sand Blue Sky, the immensely popular game of Ancient Roman Gladiators. But Red Sand Black Moon takes it a step farther.<br/><br/>It allows you to fight gladiator matches with any fantasy figure you may already have!<br/><br/>Red Sand Black Moon has over twenty fantasy races with sixty plus characteristics or Signatures that allows you to create your own unique gladiator. Want to play a Troll? Yep. Demon? Got it. Dashing Knight? You bet!<br/><br/>Like all Two Hour Wargames games Red Sand Black Moon can be played solo or same side against the game mechanics as well as head to head against your friends<br/><br/>Red Sand Black Moon includes:<br/><br/>    20+ pre-generated opponents in paper counter form.<br/>    A campaign system to track the progress of your gladiators.<br/>    An arena to fight your matches.<br/>    And as much detail as you want to use.<br/><br/><br/>Red Sand Black Moon - THE fantasy gladiator game!<br/><br/>Gameplay comments:<br/>Player (or players) generates their character in a way similar to RPGs but lighter. Then the character is pitted against randomly generated opponents (or gladiators generated by other players) on an arena divided into several zones. The closer to the heart of the arena, the better for the fighter.<br/><br/>All fights are fought to death of one opponent. In addition to standard attacks, some creatures are capable of special attacks like biting, spitting or tail attacks. Initiative is determined randomly and models react to their opponent's actions, so it's not a typical IGOUGO game.<br/><br/>For those who are familiar with Two Hour Wargames, this game is more detailed, as it aims at much lower number of miniatures than their other games.<br/><br/>Campaign rules allow to follow your gladiator on their journey to the heart of the empire, where most powerful enemies and greatest glory awaits.<br/><br/>",

Players will also gain access to dynamic powers through flux cards, allowing them to use their fallen warriors to fuel more powerful attacks. Players will gain victory by showing they&rsquo;re the most powerful set of hedrons in the whole sector through dominating areas of space and destroying your opponent&rsquo;s hedrons.<br/><br/>Throughout gameplay, players are faced with balancing their current options and opportunities with the need to gain resources and maintain a strong board presence.

To that end you decide to compete in the annual MUB evaluations. You are each given a target bedroom and all the devilish tools at your disposal to keep your sleepy victim awake all night. The MUB who earns the most points after eight hourly rounds of mayhem and mischief will get a promotion, the other MUB... well, they&rsquo;ll get what&rsquo;s coming to them...<br/><br/>Setup: <br/>Shuffle the deck of cards and deal 16 cards to each player. The remaining two cards will form a discard pile. That&rsquo;s it.<br/><br/>Game Phases: <br/>There are 3 phases to each round: <br/>1. Play   2. Discard   3. Pass.<br/><br/>1. Play:<br/>During this phase each player will play one card from their hand face down, then reveal at the same time and place it in their &lsquo;bedroom&rsquo;. On the first turn, players will place the card down in front of them. On consecutive turns each additional card will be placed adjacent to one already played. Cards will form a rectangle of 8 cards by the game&rsquo;s end. It does not matter which end of the card line the adjacent card is played to.<br/><br/>Each bedroom has 4 sides and 4 corners. Top and bottom sides of the bedroom are opposite each other. Left and right sides of the bedroom are also opposite each other. Cards may never be moved in a bedroom unless the special action on a card allows it.<br/><br/>After playing a card each player must use the special action of that card, if applicable.<br/><br/>2. Discard:<br/>Players now each discard from their hand face down to the discard pile.<br/><br/>3. Pass:<br/>Players now pass their remaining hand of cards to the other player.<br/><br/>Game End and Scoring:<br/>After each player has placed their eighth card in their bedroom, and discarded the final card from their hand to the discard pile, the cards are scored.<br/><br/>The top of each card shows its point value (as well as a small black number which shows how many of those types of card are in the deck).<br/><br/>Many of the cards have special actions which give scoring bonuses depending upon position and/or number of cards. The player with the highest score is the winner. If players are tied, the player who sleeps the longest the next night is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Poison Bottles is a card game with many classical elements entwined. Each player has a 3x3 grid of facedown cards in front of them, for which they will try to secretly change as the game progresses in hopes to achieve the lowest score possible.<br/><br/>There are five distinct phases in the game, starting with trick taking, where a high card of the first played suit will win. If a poison bottle is played in the trick, the rules are reversed and the low card wins.<br/><br/>In the next two phases, peeking and swapping, every player is allowed to look at any one card on any players board, followed by the losers of the trick swapping one card from their board with a card from their hand.  A marker is then placed on one card of each players board to protect it from being attacked.<br/><br/>The attacking phase follows, where the winner of the trick then takes a card from an opponents board, and swaps it with one from his hand, leaving the card face up for the rest of the game.  This is repeated for each opponent.<br/><br/>The final phase is the drawing phase, where players draw back up to a five card hand. These phases are repeated until a player cannot draw a card, upon which the game ends immediately. Players then reveal their boards and count up their points, however, if a player manages to get three of the same number card in a row or column, that row is eliminated and now worth 0 points. Similarly, if a player manages to get a row or column of three poison bottles, that row or column becomes worth -30 points. Poison bottles played in the trick taking phase are worth -3 points to that player at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are elements of hearts, nines, and memory in the game, with a focus on bluffing and heavy player interaction.<br/><br/>",

Each round, a player rolls all the elemental dice for Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon, or a useful but dangerous Bunsen Burner. The rolling player chooses their element first, leaving the rest of the table to scratch their heads to fit the remainder within their lab notes.<br/><br/>Elements now in hand, the players choose where to keep their elements. They can notate in the research field or trash them for some added benefits, later. Combine elements based on the real rules of chemistry! Double and triple bonds are worth more, but you can only bond with elements near each other and as they&rsquo;re written.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t worry if you&rsquo;re not sure about what bonds work where. There are handy-dandy notecards outlining real, actual chemicals you can make! Manage to make the chemical on the card? You get a bonus!<br/><br/>Lab fires burn a slot within your lab notes, but maybe that will work out for you, who knows! <br/>The game ends when the first person fills up their sheet.

These riches are represented in the game by shiny gold counters which look very much like wide, flat gold bars. Only gold returned to one's port counts for victory.<br/><br/>The sailing ship's hulls are printed on cardboard sheets, to be punched out and folded into shape. Three wooden dowel masts are inserted through punched-out, printed paper sails and then through the decks of the ships.<br/><br/>The board is a blank diagonal grid of 32 square ocean spaces with the four players' home ports in the corners. The 29 Sea Square tiles are shuffled and 32 of them placed face down on the spaces. There are four each of Island, Reef, Ship and Monster tiles plus the Cipangu tile, a Fog tile, and a Storm tile. All others are open sea.<br/><br/>There are four Encounter Decks, cards from which are drawn when a ship discovers Islands, Reefs, Ships, and Monsters. The monsters are the only fantasy element of the game. Their artwork is drawn in the style of the &quot;Here There Be Monsters&quot; of the old mapmakers. Each deck has cards with good or bad results: gold bars, extra sailors, repairs, attacks by monsters or pirates, grounding on reefs, being attacked or helped by island natives, etc.<br/><br/>Each ship starts with three sailors and three masts. The markers for the sailors are actually the familiar plastic push-pins available in any dollar store, without the pin. Both sailors and masts serve as 'hit-point' indicators: any ship that loses all masts or all sailors is sunk. Movement range is determined by current no. of masts to a maximum of 3 spaces.<br/><br/>There is a wind direction spinner which is a 'top' made up of an octagonal direction card with a wood dowel through the center. This is spun to determine which direction a player's ship cannot sail that turn.<br/><br/>Players move around the board, turning over the sea tiles and trying to accumulate gold and survive the various events that can damage their ship. When the one Cipangu tile is discovered, players can get 3 gold bars each turn they stay there.<br/><br/>Players can also 'Turn Pirate' by attacking another player's ship or port. 1d6's are rolled and compared, low roller in each round loses one sailor, ties cause both ships to lose a mast. Ships that lose all sailors are plundered of their gold and sunk. Ships that lose all masts just sink.<br/>  Combat against ports is handled the same way except ports have no masts. Players can leave extra sailors in port as defense forces. Sunk ships are replaced, and damaged ships repaired, by paying one gold bar and continuing with a new/fixed 3-mast, 3-sailor ship from your port.<br/><br/>Once the last Sea Tile is turned over, the game ends and Gold Bars are counted up to determine a victor.<br/><br/>",

The basic game is a regimental simulation of the conduct of the war, using primarily infantry forces in historical dispositions. The advanced game, Gran Chaco, covers specific military innovations and strategic considerations individually, allowing players insights onto the variable effects these innovations can have on military operations.<br/> This game includes a map representing the Chaco Desert. Each hexagon represents ten miles or 16 kilometers of actual terrain. Two sets of die-cut counters (380 total): grey for Bolivian, green for Paraguayan. One fourteen page rule booklet and three charts: Paraguayan Brigade/Division/Corps Composition Chart, Bolivian Division/Corps/Composition Chart, Optional Unit Appearance Chart/ Combat Results Table.<br/><br/>The game was published by Game Designers's Workshop in 1973.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mythica: Fate of Heroes  is a hybrid adventure game incorporating elements of economic, tactical, RPG, and cooperative games.  Players take control of a single character (many drawn from the Mythica movie series from Utah-based Arrowstorm Entertainment) and endeavor to acquire Legacy points while building up their personal strength for the inevitable showdown with the big baddie of whatever plot you choose to play (the core game includes three plots). Players must work together to defeat the Nemesis in order to have an opportunity to tally individual Legacy and declare a winner.<br/><br/>The focus of this game's development was to provide an experience familiar to tabletop RPG players yet accessible to conventional board gamers. The world and plots draw heavily from the Mythica movie universe, but familiarity with that universe is not required to enjoy or master the game. A time-keeping mechanic makes the game progressively more difficult and rewards or punishes characters for how aggressively they choose to manage world events rather than build their personal strength. Ultimately the game is a balancing act between selfless v. selfish choices and cooperative v. competitive strategies.<br/><br/>There are optional advanced rules for more challenging and sophisticated game behaviors and rules for single or double play as well. At least two expansion packs are planned for more plot lines and additions to all play decks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Calculate the difference between the higher class and the inferior, divide by two the result (rounding up toward the inferior value) and take this number as a column shift from the higher value toward the inferior value (see the example below, for a clearer explanation). Now, roll 2 6-sided die on the &quot;Tries Table&quot; to see how many tries that team has scored in the match. Then, check the &quot;conversion percentage&quot; of that team and roll a percentage dice (ie. two 10-sided dice, reading one of them as &quot;tens&quot;) for each try scored: if the roll is inside the percentage value, the try is succesfully converted (add two points to team's score); otherwise, conversion kick is failed. Then, check the &quot;Three points&quot; value of the team to see how many penalty kicks/drops have been scored during the match. Roll 1 10-sided die on the correct column of the &quot;3-points Table&quot;, multiply by 3 the number obtained and add that result to the points scored by that team to reach its total for the match. Repeat this procedure for the opposing team and you will get the final result of the match.<br/><br/>A separate expansion set contains data for all the World Cup and the Tri Nations tournaments<br/><br/>",

The card effects are played out and then the player replenishes their hand back up to 7 cards from either the draw pile or the top card of the discards. Card effects include stealing cards from other players, wiping out other players hands, looking at other players hands, blocking another players effect card.<br/><br/>The game moves around the players until one of them spells the word KRAKEN with the letter cards and shouts KRAKEN. Any player that has 5 letters of the word KRAKEN must shout AHOY or forfeit their hand and start with a fresh hand.<br/><br/>",

Up until this point in the Vietnam &ldquo;Conflict&rdquo; the NLF, soon to become known as the Viet Cong in the US, had waged a war of insurgency in South Vietnam. On January 2nd, 1963 the 7th ARVN infantry division dispatched elements of its 11th Regiment to support two Civil Guard battalions to take out a radio transmitter the NLF were operating in the hamlet of Ap Bac. This time, however, the Viet Cong chose to stand and fight. As the day wore on and the fighting escalated the ARVN were compelled to send in armor and airborne forces, as well as committing air support in a fight that decidedly went against them. It was the first stand-up fight for both sides&rsquo; forces, and one that did not bode well for those of South Vietnam. Perhaps you can do as well or better?<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of playing cards to activate their units and resolve combats. Play is very interactive, easy to learn and competitive. Although designed for two players, What Went Wrong can easily be played solitaire.<br/><br/>",

Most Events usually add Omen Tokens - Doom, Fear or Greed to the Event or to neighboring cards.<br/><br/>When Encountering Foes - At each Realm, if a Foe or Foes is encountered, draw one Conflict card. This card is used for all Foes in the Realm and will give each Foe a base value for the encounter as well as a Special Action which overrides other rule texts. Next, roll 7 dice, placing them in numerical order from low to high and adding their specified values to the base value for that Foe. This will be the Foe&rsquo;s Encounter Value.<br/><br/>You may now play Action Cards, Allies and Wards from your hand with some restrictions. Once you have played your combination of cards, roll the dice as shown on your Action cards, and on any Ally or Ward cards, adding together the total for your Encounter Value. Your Encounter Value must be higher than the Foe value to succeed in the Encounter.<br/><br/>When Encountering Allies - When encountering an Ally you may only use your Action and Ward cards in the Encounter. Similar rules apply to calculating the Ally Encounter Value and your Encounter value as they did for encountering a Foe. You do not draw a Conflict card when encountering Allies.<br/><br/>3. Resolution: After all encounters are resolved the Realm is considered &ldquo;Cleared&rdquo; if no Foes remain there. This Realm will never have new Foes, Omen tokens or Events placed on it. If a future Event has you placing Omen tokens, skip this Realm. Any Events on this Realm will remain here however as well any current Omen tokens. You may only remove these Omen tokens as your success in the game allows. Turn the Realm 90 degrees in the ring to signal it is cleared. You may move through this Realm during the 1. Explore phase if you so choose.<br/><br/>4. Quest End: The game ends after you have cleared all Nine Realms and defeated all Foes. Valh&ouml;ll, where you began your quest, never needs to be cleared.<br/><br/>If you ever have 2 or fewer Action cards remaining in your hand and discard pile combined OR there are currently more than 18 Omen tokens on the Realms and/or Foes, your quest ends and you have lost.<br/><br/>If you have defeated all Foes and have 3 or more Action cards in your hand and discard pile combined, you have won and may calculate your victory points based on certain conditions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Central Pacific Campaign&quot; is a solitaire, strategic-level wargame of the struggle for control of the Central Pacific during World War II. The solitaire player is commanding the US forces and the system controls the Japanese forces. The player wins by accomplishing historic campaign milestones ahead of what was done historically, thereby opening the way for an earlier invasion of Okinawa or Formosa. Most ground units represent divisions, brigades or regiments. Aircraft units represent two groups or regiments (six to eight squadrons), and are each identified by the primary type of aircraft in those units. Ship units represent one fleet aircraft carrier, divisions of two light or escort carriers, two battleships, four cruisers, squadrons of six to eight destroyers and one light cruiser. The map is drawn to emphasize the strategically critical zones and islands in the Central Pacific. Each grid box on the map is 300 miles from side to side. Each turn represents one month.<br/><br/>",

A day is split into two phases: activity phase and trade phase. During the activity phase, your members invite another member to help you gain products and raise your publicity. You need products to sell for money, but you also need publicity which is counted as number of trades allowed in the trade phase.<br/><br/>During the trade phase, you sell your products for money and buy equipment for effects or reputation. A player with highest publicity makes a trade first, and may even make multiple trades in a row if that player's publicity is far ahead of anyone else. There is limited demand for products, so players with low publicity might miss chances to sell.<br/><br/>All ten members have their own special abilities which improve their activities and trades. However, members sometimes belong to two players at a time, in which case only one player may use that member. Player order is important in various ways.<br/><br/>",

Each hex represents 875 yards, and each of the two days has four to six turns (depending on morale and exhaustion) with a separating night turn in between. Units of maneuver are mostly multi-step divisions for both sides. The French are on the strategic offensive, but there&rsquo;s plenty of opportunity for both players to attack. In fact, the Austrians can win a sudden death victory by capturing the French crossing area over the Danube. The game uses an alternating action sequence that keeps both players fully and tensely involved all throughout every turn. A full match can be set up, banged out, and put away by two experienced players in about three hours.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

With Game Winning Drive, you&rsquo;ll be able to &ldquo;see&rdquo; teams grind it out on the ground, or throw all over the field for scores. The defensive side of the football is not neglected in Game Winning Drive, as you&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; great defenses in action, and directly impact the game.<br/><br/>As in real football, special teams play and turnovers have an impact in Game Winning Drive Football. You&rsquo;ll &ldquo;see&rdquo; the impact of a short field for the opposing team after an interception or fumble. The dangerous Kick Returner&rsquo;s and Punt Returner&rsquo;s are a factor in Game Winning Drive. No other quick-play game covers all of the elements of football like Game Winning Drive.<br/><br/>While other quick-play games give you a final result, Game Winning Drive tells the &ldquo;story&rdquo; of the game. You&rsquo;ll know precisely why a team wins or loses a contest. Also, unlike other quick playing games, Game Winning Drive adds many strategy elements to add to the realism and excitement of the game.<br/><br/>Do you go for it on 4th down? Do you go for the 2 point conversion for the win, or kick the PAT for a tie? Do you try for an onside kick, or hope that your defense can shut down the offense for one final drive? With Game Winning Drive, the decisions are yours. There isn&rsquo;t another quick-playing football game in the market that allows your coaching decisions to impact the game.<br/><br/>While your decisions may impact the game, your players on the field will ultimately determine the success of your team over the course of a season. Game Winning Drive Football factors each team&rsquo;s offensive and defensive strengths and weaknesses. Each team is rated for scoring, Rushing, Passing, Kicking, Punting, Fumbles and Interceptions on the offensive side. On the defensive side of the ball, each team is rated for Overall Defense, Rushing Defense, Passing Defense, Fumble recoveries, and Interceptions.<br/><br/>",

Players must build a deck in order to have the resources to buy scoring cards but when the game ends only cards in hand will score, so any resource generating but non-scoring cards become garbage in the later half of the game. The winner will be the player who un-builds as well as they build.<br/><br/>The game is set in a mythic fay town, Moonflight, which comes about with the waxing of the hunter's moon and fades with its setting. Players take the part of one of the mysterious Jacks, the rulers of Moonflight, and must be the most powerful of their kind when they walk away at night's end.<br/><br/>Game play is based around the &quot;turn&quot;. When the market place is exhausted all cards spin to a second version, activating card trashing rather than resource gaining abilities. The game ends when one player attempts to draw a card and cannot, at which point players score exactly which cards are in their hands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Once a third suit is played to a trick, the highest ranked card wins the trick.  The fourth suit, which has the highest ranks, can only win in tricks with three or more suits.<br/><br/>The players bid at the start of a hand how many tricks they will win in which they play rock, paper, or scissors, with tricks won in the fourth suit being wild. For each suit, if a player hits their bid, they earn one point per trick.  However, if a player does not hit their bid exactly, they lose 1 point for each trick they were off. Zero trick bids are also possible.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after a certain number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Explosions, missile exchanges, down and dirty hand-to-hand combat, and lethal firefights are the trademarks of this high-action and easy-to-learn game.&quot;<br/><br/>A relatively simple rules set for playing a game of anime-style robot combat, they are complete enough to include a limited points-based construction system plus rules for continuing campaigns.  The system uses primarily d6's plus a d10.  Movement rules include support for &quot;mode changing&quot; (from walking robot mode to hover mode to jet flight mode), and support three-dimension movement, using &quot;Battlepoles&quot;<br/><br/>138+ pages (probably another dozen pages at the end of the book are unnumbered, containing unit design templates and reference pages).  Artwork is all black-and-white, with mostly hand-drawn art, but includes quite a few photographs of models being used.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "UeStop! is an exciting competitive word game for 2-6 player, where players test their knowledge and their reflex, struggling to be the first one to find the correct word with the correct letter.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns and in each turn there is a card with one of the four possible colors (green, yellow, red, blue), also showing 4 categories on four edges of the card and 4 different letters in the middle of the card. These 4 letters are presented in colored bubbles, matching the colors of the cards.<br/><br/>After all the players have read the categories and are ready, another card is opened and then, the players will try to be the first one to put their hand over the card and say one word with the starting letter indicated on the colored bubble of the second card that matches the color of the first card.<br/><br/>If the player answers correctly, she gains the card as a reward worth one point. Another turn starts and the game continues until any player gets 5 points.<br/><br/>This is the basic to play UeStop!, but the game also contains 3 new game modes that will challenge the players with new rules and adding strategy to the gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player can do three kinds of actions with the cards in hand:<br/><br/><br/>    Enhance their factions.<br/>    Place guard cards (face down, one card for a faction).<br/>    Attack (to different spots).<br/><br/><br/>If he succeeds with an attack, the opponent receives damage; if damage reaches a certain amount, that faction's &quot;gate&quot; perishes. When a player's two gates are demolished, the game ends and that player loses.<br/><br/>The core box of the GATE contains eight sets of factions, some of which are connected with worlds of other games, such as the DOME. More faction packs will be released after the core set.<br/><br/>",

Requires only the base game of Descent Journeys in the Dark to play.<br/><br/>This is a double-overlord race game between two players, or two teams of players. Each side takes a turn being overlord over the opposing side, trying to do their best to make sure their heroes reach the inner guildhall sanctum first.<br/><br/><br/>    2 : The Dark Grove<br/><br/><br/>This is a standard scenario, like all others. This quest uses the outdoor map tiles, therefore the base game of Descent Journeys in the Dark and Road to Legend are required.<br/><br/><br/>    3 : A Knight's Tale<br/><br/><br/>This quest involves two teams of heroes attempting to outdo one another by taking the most gold and treasure from the Ice Wyrm's lair. This quest requires both Descent Journeys in the Dark and Tomb of Ice to play.<br/><br/>Two teams of two players each, form up as a Knight and a Squire. The Overlord can kill the squire of each team multiple times, but if ever the Knight goes down, it's game over. It's a race to stay alive and bank more treasure than your opposing team.<br/><br/>Runewars Scenario :<br/><br/><br/>    1 : Battle of the Ru Steppes<br/><br/><br/>This is a preset Runewars map for 4 players following normal play rules involving Dragon Rune conquest.<br/><br/>",

Each players embody one of the seasons and try to spread his territory the biggest he can, but the entire concept of the game is based on the succession of seasons, in this game you have to accept that your territory will be taken by the season that follow you and you'll do the same to the season that precede you. So your territories are always changing. The deal about this game is to calculate when you have to spread wide and when you have to spread wise.<br/><br/>Game take place over 12 years (12 turns), by using limited action points players place pawn on the board to expand their season on this particular territory (island). They can also spread from existing controlled island to expand more their territory, but they can grow only on the season that preceed them (eg. winter spread on fall). Each player also have a mega-bonus that they will use over the game. It's important to calculate when it's the moment to use a lot of APs and when it's important to stay low profile. Players score at the beginning of each year, their score egal the number of island they control.<br/><br/>It's a fast poetic semi-competitve strategy game.<br/><br/>",

Any unit can perform various roles &ndash; explorer, worker, priest, scientist, soldier &ndash; at different times during the game, and the modular game board further contributes to the game&rsquo;s flexibility. Moreover, Oikodomos can be played with any number of players for which components are available: one, two, six, or even twelve if necessary. (Playing time depends on the number of players, however: for experienced players approximately 90 minutes per player; for new players a bit more.)<br/><br/>As in any civilization game, players start with a small tribe (represented by a single unit), build their first city, and start developing technology. More cities are built, and the land around those cities are cultivated to feed the growing population. With population growth, however, dissent rises, and leaving that unchecked results in revolt.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players should balance growth, development, and the 'happiness' of their citizens. Losing that balance may turn out disastrous later. Too much focus on technological development, for example, may hamper population growth, or leave insufficient means to counter growing dissent; while too much focus on economic growth may hurt scientific progress.<br/><br/>",

First, each player is dealt an equal number of Money Cards, of which there are four denominations. Then a deck of Item Cards is placed in the middle of the table, within everyone's reach. Points Tokens, Priority Tokens and the Dealer Token are placed near the Item Deck as well.<br/><br/>Each round consists of four Phases:<br/><br/>1. Evaluation Phase<br/>A number of Item Cards equal to the number of players are turned over. During this phase players assess the value of the cards relative to how it can earn points for their personal set of Item Cards, called the Cabinet.<br/><br/>2. Auction Phase (auction mechanic)<br/>During the Auction Phase, players will use their Money Cards to make bids to acquire one Item Card for their Cabinet. However, in this style of auction, players don't declare a bid on a specific Item Card, rather they bid to win the highest 'Priority' among their competitors. Priority is the order in which each player chooses an Item Card in the next Phase. This means that a player cannot be entirely certain what card their opponents are trying to obtain.<br/><br/>Starting with the Dealer of that round, each player takes a turn to either bid or pass. If they bid, then they will place an amount of money greater than the last player's bid on the table.<br/><br/>If the player instead chooses to pass, they may not participate for the rest of that round's auction.<br/><br/>Passing is actually what determines Priority for the round: the first player to pass in the Auction Phase will be the last player to choose an Item Card during the Curation Phase. The second player to pass will be the second last to choose a card, and so forth. Priority tokens help keep track of this order.<br/><br/>When all of the players but one have passed, the Round will transition to the Curation Phase.<br/><br/>3. Curation (Tile Mechanic)<br/>In the Curation Phase, each player will choose one of the Item Cards in order of Priority, as determined in the Auction Phase. When all of the players have chosen a card, they will add it to their Cabinet by placing it on either the leftmost or rightmost end of the series (in the case of the first round, they will simply place the card in front of them). Item Cards are never placed above, below other cards in the Cabinet. Furthermore, once placed in the set, cards may not be moved or rearranged in any way.<br/><br/>In order to earn points, a newly placed Item Card must share one or more Category icons with its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category between adjoining cards, one point is earned.<br/><br/>4. Appraisal Phase<br/>In the Appraisal Phase, players will count the number of categories shared between the newly added Item Card and its adjacent neighbour(s). For every shared Category, a point is earned; the player will then take an appropriate number of Point Tokens and place them between the two cards to track score.<br/><br/>After the Appraisal Phase has ended a new round begins (unless it was the seventh round, see below). The player that won the highest Priority in the last round becomes the Dealer for the new round (and receives the Dealer Token).<br/><br/>After the seventh round the game ends, and players add up all of the Point Tokens in their Cabinet. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Luring the English across the bridge, Wallace and Moray strike hard when only half the English had crossed. Three scenarios explore the historical situation.<br/><br/>His greatest defeat; Falkirk, 22 July 1298, once again pits Wallace, now the Guardian of Scotland, against the English, led by Edward I (Longshenks) himself. Falkirk would be a great English victory but at the cost of much blood...and would herald the age of the long bow in English history.<br/><br/>Based on the Baron's War system, Wallace's War focuses on the command and weaponry of the medieval battlefield.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from the Designer:)Wallace's War is the second game in the medieval game series (the other is Barons' War) and this time focuses on William Wallace and his two major battles, Stirling Bridge and Falkirk. The system has been cleaned up considerably by Frank Hastege (who did yeoman's work on the rules). The goal of the series is to create a platform on which to re-create the medieval battlefield. The system is meant to reflect the problems that leaders of the time had. One special focus is the control one has on the battlefield. Once the battle started the leader had the problem of how to change his initial plan if things started to go poorly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A great game to get the party started. Riotous fun designed to bring out your competitive side. Try to guess correctly, the word or common phrase of your team mate in this manic quick fire game. Game contents include word cards and an electronic timer. Don't get caught in possession!<br/>Preperation for the game:<br/><br/>     Split into two teams.<br/>     Decide how many points a team needs to score to win the game. We recommend 8.<br/>     Choose which coloured side of the cards you will play for your game.<br/>     Shuffle the deck of cards and place down in the centre of the table.<br/><br/><br/>Playing the game:<br/><br/>     One player is nominated from each team to be the describing player for the first round, the remaining players on the team are the guessing players.<br/>     Once you have selected your describing and guessing players a member of either team can activate the timer.<br/>     Once the timer is activated the timer ticks for an undisclosed amount of time.During this time the describing player of Team One collects a card from the top of the card pile. Each card features 10 items of phrases. The describing player selects any one of the ten and describes their selection to the guessing members on their team. The description can only be made by voice , no gestures are allowed. The describing player must not use any part of the word or phrase to help their description. The guessing players do their best to answer as quickly as possible.<br/>     On correctly guessing the item or phrase the card is passed to Team Two's describing player who then selects a different item or phrase from the same list of ten. They then proceed to describe the selected item to their guessing players. Again, on a correct guess the card is passed back to Team One's Describing player, who picks a new item or phrase. This process continues with both teams attempting to describe and guess correctly as quickly as possible so they may return the card to the opposing team.<br/>     During this time the timer continues to tick until eventually a buzzer sounds marking the end of the round. Whichever team is left holding the card is the loser!<br/><br/><br/>Tips and points to remember:<br/><br/>     You cannot predict when the buzzer will sound because this changes each time you play a round.<br/>     Once a team have guessed an item or phrase correctly the card is deemed to be in play with the other team. Unnecessary delays in handing over the card or taking the card are not allowed. Persistent offenders should be penalised by losing a point.<br/>     Teams must pay attention so as not to repeat the description of an item or phrase already featured in that round. Repeating words only wastes time for your team!<br/><br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>     The losing team in a round fails to score, however, the winning team scores 1 point.<br/>     Should the teams manage to guess all ten items and phrases on the card correctly before the buzzer sounds both teams score 1 point.<br/>     For round two change your describing and guessing players.<br/><br/><br/>Winning the game:<br/>The first team to the agreed number of points is the winner!<br/><br/>Good Luck!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Conspiracy is a card game released in spring 2023, on Kickstarter and was chosen Project We Love by KS. It is a fun, fast-paced tableau-builder for those who wanna try what it's like to be a conspiracy theory believer.<br/><br/>Chose your core conspiracy (card) and build your unique theory around it by winning news (cards) and explaining how those fit your theory. (Don't worry explanation is optional and you can skip it by playing the game in Flat Earther variant.) Each conspiracy card gives a special ability to its believer. Use it wisely to become more influential than your rivals and their childish tales.<br/><br/>In Conspiracy, each player acts simultaneously during the two rounds of a turn. There are three types of action they can choose from: action card drawing, playing an action card, and flipping a news card. Action cards give you some useful abilities and influence among the believers. The most influential wins the actual news (card) at the end of the turn. By your clairvoyance ability, you can flip your news cards to see the hidden message between the lines and get a useful bonus.<br/><br/>A player wins and the game ends when any player reaches the given number of followers and is able to keep them until the end of the turn.<br/><br/>Conspiracy offers a cooperative and a solo mode as well where you can work together (or alone) to uncover the shadow government before it's too late. Merge your conspiracy cards to the ultimate great grandfathers of all conspiracy theories and play action cards side by side against the shadow government cards to win the actual news (card), protect your theory and your hands.<br/><br/>In cooperative mode, the game ends when the players reach the given number of followers and keep them until the end of the turn or when the shadow government deck is depleted.<br/><br/>The core mechanics of the game are: hand management, flipping a card, bid, tableau building, variable player powers, and narrative building.<br/><br/>",

Each player is responsible for building their lineage and defending their family members from rival families.<br/><br/>This is done through a family tree style playing field. Players begin the game with a Noble House Card that shows both a Lord and Lady. From there, players use Court Drama Cards to arrange marriages and have children and thereby grow their family tree. Each character can play two Court Drama Cards on their turn to maintain and develop their own family tree, or attack their rivals.<br/><br/>In addition to helping characters wed and have children, some Court Drama Cards also let players make others illegitimate or infertile, preventing them from winning the throne. Likewise, other Court Drama Cards allow players to remove these negative effects and to restore themselves to their former glory.<br/><br/>In order to win the throne, a noble family must produce at least one great-grandson that is of age and neither illegitimate nor infertile.<br/><br/>",

You will live the story from their perspective, whether as a cunning master of subterfuge, a fierce military leader, a greedy merchant, a philosopher advocating for progress, an aristocrat with a penchant for the occult, or a vicious lord tied to criminal activities.<br/><br/>Develop your character with exclusive personal abilities. Each character comes with Duchies or Marks under their direct control, and a deck of secret personal objectives and branching narrative paths that will define your story and future goals&mdash;which may intertwine with the destiny of the entire kingdom.<br/><br/>Shape the political identity of the Realm through the new ideology system. The policies you enact will alter the balance between six opposing political ideologies: Tradition against Progress, Force against Diplomacy and Order against Liberty. These also represent the moral values and agenda of your character: each one has a founding ideology they always root for, and other secondary interests whose importance varies from game to game, changing alliances at the table.<br/><br/>But that&rsquo;s not all. The new keyword system allows the game to keep track of your personal choices: an unexpected act of forgiveness could secure you the eternal gratitude of the people, but a radical resolution could tarnish your reputation forever. Make your decisions wisely: the consequences of your choices will come back to reward or haunt your character later in the campaign.<br/><br/>Watch the map of the kingdom evolve as a result of your decisions! The events that unfold will change the world forever and unlock new game rules altering the flow of the campaign. Defend your interests when a Dilemma card directly involves the territories placed under your control, and construct buildings to gain new abilities and sources of revenue.<br/><br/>Manage the resources of your lands and trade with other players to achieve your goals: increase your political power, collect materials to improve your buildings, support the Queen&rsquo;s Army in the war in the south, and provide for the needs of your people to avoid discontent, unrest, and revolts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So they slapped some Penny Arcade graphics on it (yes, from the webcomic) and you have a special die.<br/><br/>Interestingly, though, it's not just another die. It introduces a few new concepts. One is Hammer, which hits a target die multiple times. Another interesting aspect is that it's actually two dice! You see, in Diceland, most dice get damaged one side at a time, from side 8 to side 1. The Penny Arcade die, however, has two side 4s, side 3s, 2, and 1 - essentially, it's like two 4-sided Diceland dice stuck together. There are also ways to shift from one 'track' to another, changing the abilities of the die. Interesting.<br/><br/>List of Diceland sets and armies<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game extends the narrative begun in NATO, Nukes &amp; Nazis: The War in France &amp; Russia to the other main theater of operations of this war: East Asia. It can be played alone or combined with the play of the two-map scenario in the parent game. Either way, it will provide a complete theater-commander experience.<br/><br/>The system is based around the central idea that large First World armies (as well as those from elsewhere that have been trained and equipped to try to perform like First World armies) almost always begin major wars seemingly well prepared. Unfortunately for those in their front-line units, both the training and equipment usually only make them ready for the previous war, not the one they're about to fight. Beyond that, the initial period of such wars is characterized by only a partially abandoned peacetime psychology among the officers and enlisted. That is, no one as yet appreciates what it means operatively to be in an all-out war. All that comes together to give overall performance high-risk, volatile and fragile qualities: no one as yet really knows what's actually possible or wise to try to accomplish. Seemingly powerful units therefore easily become &quot;disrupted&quot; -&acirc;&euro;&ldquo; especially as gauged in relation to similar units' performances later, after everyone's been thoroughly schooled in the art of war as it exists in the present.<br/><br/>Each turn of play in NNN3 equals a week of real time. Each hexagon on both maps represents 75 miles (121.5 km) from side to opposite side. The game is designed for two-player play, but solitaire play can be easily 'fudged.' Playing time (when played separately from NNN2) is about four hours.<br/><br/>Projected contents:<br/>One 22x34&quot; map/playing surface<br/>One and one half sheets of 5/8&quot; die-cut mounted counters/playing pieces<br/>One Rules Book<br/>Charts &amp; Tables<br/>Dice<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>",

The version of this ruleset was developed in 1976 and is basically an early draft of the WSIM ruleset but played with miniatures.<br/><br/>&quot;In 1981 a second printing was published by Battleline called Ship of the Line by Juggernaut.   The cover changed by the contents are identical to the 1976 printing of the original ruleset.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;As the title of these rules suggests, the game's primary interest lies in the recreation of fleet actions involving squadrons of Ship o' the Line. Although plenty of rules are included to cover the smaller vessels, and some very interesting single-ship duels can be fought using these rules, they are primarily designed to allow players to command squadrons of three to six ships each.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;As many people reading these rules may be aware, several years ago the designer of these rules published a board game on this same topic (Wooden Ships &amp; Iron Men). The board game was developed as a simplified version of the Ship o' the Line miniature rules . . . This miniature version has since been further expanded, up-dated, modified and developed into the format you see here, which we at Battleline feel is the most complete set of rules available anywhere for tactical sailing ship actions.&quot;<br/><br/>",

You will get to know the instruments of the orchestra, learn the names of famous composers and experience the sound of their music.<br/><br/>Maestro Ensemble is the simple variant of the game Maestro Symphony. The players must walk around a circle of 60 minutes. That means they need to collect 60 minutes playing time of tracks and ' play '.<br/><br/>Every turn one gets the chance to tackle a piece of music, a tool to buy or a kanskaart. The turn can also be used to ' perform a piece of music. To do so, you need to have the right music instruments.<br/><br/>On the map of the music piece which instruments are required and what the playing time of the piece is. Knocking out the map also provides money and/or a change cart, which offers opportunities to buy new instruments.<br/><br/>Musical instruments that you don't own, you can rent another player, who earns money again. At each played music piece you go forward one or two sizes on the staff. First at the end, the Maestro!<br/><br/>The chance cards bring tension in the game. They provide unexpected with it-or setbacks. You can also disturb other players. Each player possesses also a Maestro card. This you can bet once for an extra turn. Convenient to just before the end of the game a fellow player to pass through.<br/><br/>To play this game, you don't need knowledge of classical music. You just learn a lot of knowledge. The players are introduced to various instruments in all sorts of compositions. They learn names of composers and music pieces. By a QR-code on the piece of music-map, you can listen to the track directly on your smartphone or tablet. Because the money is running in 'notes' is that a playful way to learn.<br/><br/>For the version Sympony, you have to earn points. Now it's nog only the time that counts. You need also collect differtent intstruments, soloists and make extra money. Also you get three job tickets to collect extra points. You need to play stategic, like Agricola and Rail Baron. The player with the most points will be the Maestro.<br/><br/>",

The 18 hour day begins with a roll of the dice . . .<br/><br/>2 players, 3d6 and 20 markers per player :: the player with the most VP at game end wins!<br/><br/>Setup: Decide who is Player 1 and Player 2. Each player takes 20 markers in one color. Next, lay the cards out in a line between players, in order from (1)-(6), creating the game store. One of the players places a marker on the 17 space on the (6) card. Player 1 begins.<br/><br/>Play: Players take turns rolling/re-rolling 3d6 up to three times, keeping any dice they wish during each roll (you may re-roll previously kept dice except for any 6s). Once the 3 dice rolls are done, the player can apply any die or set of dice to match various options on the game store cards. Players will place markers of their color on the cards over the smaller dice and cube icons. Each die rolled has a different meaning in the game.<br/><br/>Game End: Total each player&rsquo;s VP. The player with the most VP wins.

The word derives from Ancient Greek literally meaning &quot;city of the dead&quot;.<br/><br/>You will need a set of double six dominoes.<br/><br/>Object - Lowest score at endgame.<br/><br/>Play - Start by shuffling face down the set of double six dominoes. Leave them in a pile face down between the 2 players, from this point on this will be known as the necropolis.<br/><br/>Next decide who goes first, then play alternates.<br/><br/>On your first turn draw a tile from the necropolis and place the tile face up in front of you, this area will be known as the grave site. Your opponent now does the same.<br/><br/>From this point on, on your turn, you may do one of the following actions.<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from the necropolis and place it adjacent to an existing tile at your grave site or<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from the necropolis but keep its value hidden from your opponent by placing it face down in front of you, but behind your grave site (This area behind your grave site will be known as the mastabas) or<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from your mastabas and place it adjacent to an existing tile at your grave site or<br/><br/>- Draw a tile from the necropolis or from the mastabas and start a new grave site, the old grave site is now considered abandoned and must not be played to for the rest of the game or<br/><br/>- Exchange a tile from your mastabas with the necropolis.<br/><br/>Now this ends your turn.<br/><br/>Tile Placement - The top number on a domino is known as its rank and the bottom number is known as its suit. You must match either the rank or suit to an existing domino in an active grave site.<br/><br/>When placing a tile to your grave site, the tile being placed must be placed touching an existing tile along its long edges on either side of the existing tile.<br/><br/>Scoring - The game ends when the necropolis is empty or when players are unable to add tiles to their gravesite. Players then count the pips on their remaining dominoes in their  mastabas and add +1 points to their totals for the number of grave sites they started.<br/><br/>The player having the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players simultaneously select one card from their hand of seven cards. The player with the winning card advances the soccer ball on the play field, with the ball moving back and forth until one player scores. After a duel, each player draws back up to seven cards.<br/><br/>This game is a reimplementation of Reiner Knizia's other soccer-themed card-game, Tor, with many important differences:<br/><br/><br/>     Instead of 13 cards (values 1-13), both players have 15 cards (with numerous differences from the original game). These include one &quot;Tor&quot; (goalkeeper) card that blocks movement of the ball, one &quot;0&quot; card that beats a &quot;7&quot;, and 12 cards with the values 2-7 (two of each). The &quot;5&quot; card has a special power: when they are played, the lower card wins.<br/>     In the original, players had all their cards in hand. In this version they only have 7 cards in-hand and refill their hand back to 7 once their turn is over.<br/>     If two equal cards are played, the ball is not moved, but the given duel is not resolved yet. Both players choose another card until one player wins and then the ball moves in the winning direction as many fields as the number of cards played by the player.<br/><br/><br/>",

To be able to use it, they decide to launder it together through 5 businesses. The best idea turns messy when each one secretly decides to dupe the other and keep the load of it for themselves. Who will outwit whom and walk away with a cartload of clean money? Play to find out. Play the others to win.<br/><br/>On their turn a player offers a card from their hand to another player and tells them limited information about the card. The other player then decides whether to accept or decline. Some cards are bad and others are good. If the player accepts they will then add the card to their face-up cards for end game scoring. Of they decline, the player who offered the card will place it in their face-up area.<br/><br/>The player who gains the most points from their cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Try on the role of detective! Find out who was the only true winner of the race. To know all the details, you'll have to discuss the story with all the animals in the game. After the game you are going to answer a few questions and find out what really happened. Play as a team, discuss the story, and get to the bottom of it!<br/><br/>This is a cooperative detective board game for the whole family. You will literally piece together the event (connect several cards to get the full picture) and attempt to get it right. After the game you are going to answer a few questions and find out what really happened. Play as a team, discuss the story, and get to the bottom of it!<br/><br/>The players lay cards in a 3x4 grid out on the table. New cards must be connected to the starting cards like a jigsaw puzzle so that in the end there's a complete picture on the table. The game begins with 2 starting cards placed in the center of the table. Then there is a deck with all the other cards. Players need to lay out the 4 top cards next to the deck pics down.<br/><br/>On their turns, they need to pick 2 out of 5 cards (1 top from the deck and 4 next to it). Look at them and decide, whether the info on the cards is useful or not. If it is useful, they connect these to the starting ones. If not, discarded. Then it's the nest turn, and so on.<br/>Players need to discuss the cards to decide<br/><br/>When the story has come to an end, there should be a complete picture of cards. Players need to discuss the plot to decide on the cards to lay out or discard. After that players should answer 6 questions about the event. Who did that, why, etc. Check their answers with the finishing cards. The team wins when they managed to answer all 6 questions correctly AND laid out the cards with the correct details in the puzzle.<br/><br/>",

You can collect points by making skilful manoeuvres, but your points can also be influenced by the elements. You have to be attentive to make sure you don't have any &quot;stowaways&quot; on board, because the coastguard can thwart your plans. You also have to make sure you have enough provisions. If you can overcome the challenges and get as many passengers as possible to their destination ports then you will be - with a bit of luck - the winner.<br/><br/>Each player is given a ship which he moves around from port to port on the wooden game board. During the game, players draw port cards showing a destination and its value. The players then can load passengers and bring them to these destinations. They have to make sure to have enough provision for all their passengers. The goal is to reach one of two objectives: either a general objective (40 VP), or a personal objective (chosen from a personal objective card when having reached at least 20 VP).<br/><br/>Each game round is divided into two phases: an action phase and a movement phase. During the action phase, the starting player rolls two dice and then chooses to take<br/>A) the two actions associated with the dice results rolled or<br/>B) take one action not associated with a dice result.<br/>All the other player then take one single action: if the starting player chooses A) they have to choose B) and vice versa.<br/><br/>Possible actions are: take a port card, take a passenger/provisions card, load passenger(s), load provisions, take and execute an event card, lose 1 VP and choose any action.<br/><br/>During the movement phase, the active player can move his/her ship up to the number of spaces corresponding to the sum of his two dice. The other players can then move the higher of the two numbers rolled. When arriving in a destination port, players can unload passengers to gather victory points.<br/><br/>",

Owzat Games now has the rights for this game.<br/><br/>In ' Full Time', we attempt to reflect the overall nature (pattern) of the game, while still limiting playing time to about 30 minutes per match. We still do not reproduce every pass and tackle, but the action which unfolds on the stadium card is a compressed version of the whole game, including those intriguing midfield battles, the constant probing at a tight knit defence and the sudden and decisive counter attack that produces a goal against the run of play. We have also devised a system that makes player identification quick, clean and painless and have incorporated Ebb and Flow where the initiative passes from one team to the other throughout the match. Added to that we have ensured that tactical formation changes really do turn things around, although Initiative is automatically handed back to your opponents as the price of reorganisation, have stolen some of the better ideas from &lsquo;Soccer Replay&rsquo; and &lsquo;Final Score&rsquo; (We&rsquo;re entitled!) including the use of Fast Action Cards and have ensured that previously published Extension Sets for those games can be easily converted to use with &lsquo;Full Time&rsquo;<br/><br/>",

Players vie to become the power behind the throne, predicting who is next in line to become ruler of Europa and manipulating the court to make those predictions come true.<br/><br/>At the start of Heir to Europa, players predict how many coteries they'll win to their side. Each turn, you play one card from your hand, representing your soliciting help from a political ally. If that ally has a special ability and their faction is still loyal, you may activate that special ability as well. Each time a faction comes into play, its loyalty lowers by one. You must decide when it's best to play a lower value card to use an ability while you still can.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Peaks of the Caucasus&quot; &mdash; available in World at War #61, the Summer 2018 issue &mdash; simulates the German offensive in the southern Soviet Union in 1942 and the ensuing Soviet Counteroffensive. The German objective was initially the Caucasus oilfields, but the campaign turned into a struggle for the city of Stalingrad on the Volga. The game uses a variant of the &quot;Boots system&quot; to model higher echelon command-control and logistics, and their impact on the theater of operations. The map is divided into two sectors: Stalingrad and the Caucasus. Various Command markers will activate a player's forces on one or the other (and sometimes both) Fronts. Effectively, the player is in command of theater forces and must operate within historically based high command interference in operations.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one month of operations. Each hex is about 100 kilometers across. Most ground units represent two to six divisions. The game scenarios start in July after the first phase of the German Fall Blau (Plan Blue) offensive, which commenced on 28 June 1942, at the point where Army Group South was divided into Army Groups A and B.<br/><br/>",

In the first half of the twentieth century, world chess champion Jose Raul Capablanca (1888-1942) apparently improved on Bird's variant by rearranging the order of the major pieces. This variant became known as Capablanca Chess. And finally, in 1998, Ed Trice, founder of the Gothic Chess Federation, researched a setup which made a final improvement to Capablanca's arrangement, much as Capa had done for Bird.<br/><br/>",

What is unusual about Letter is that the letter tiles are different sizes: 1&times;1, 1&times;2, 1&times;3, 2&times;1, 2&times;2, 2&times;3, 3&times;2, and 3&times;3 (because orientation matters).  Words are identified by chaining along orthogonally adjacent sides of the letters.  As a result, the board can quickly come to look like quite a jumbled mess of letters with varied sizes, but this provides opportunities for lateral thinking in playing that next tile.  Each play initiates a Boggle-style word search, but with deference to the active player.<br/><br/>Debuted in Essen 2008.<br/><br/>",

Unable to withstand their assault, you lost most of your people during the siege; just before the fall of the city, you managed to gather a group of survivors and flee to the Path of the Past. You must now lead what remains of your people safely to Res, the place where your ancestors came from, while simultaneously preserving the Arival, the Soul of the People.<br/><br/>As the Keeper of the Ari people, you must choose a path that allows at least one of your clans to safely reach Res. You build your path as you go by chaining cards, which represent locations you pass in your flight and show which directions you can move to at each step. The cards and how you connect them determine which obstacles, dangers or opportunities you face on your path, and allow you to move on the map and hopefully trace a route from the siege ruins to the place where Res is supposed to be. Different ways may bring advantages or disadvantages, and you must react to what you encounter in a balancing act between saving your people and the Arival.<br/><br/>Scouting ahead gives you some control over where you may go next, and resting allows you to replenish your food reserves or perform rites to strengthen the Arival. But you must be quick, because the enemy Wolfhounds hunt you from behind: if they ever reach you, some of your people must sacrifice themselves to act as baits and lead the hunters away. And if you run out of cards and get lost, the Wolfhounds are sure to find you...<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Arival is a print-and-play game that uses 40 cards and a player's mat/mini-board; the player must supply 10 euro-cubes or similar objects to be used as markers.<br/><br/>Arival was an entry in the 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>",

Each die shows a word or phrase on it's face and the player must use the words to tell a story using the dice in front of her, in order: &quot;Did I tell you about...&quot; . During the story, other players can throw an &quot;interrupt&quot; die and read the result aloud. The active player has to adapt her story to the interruption: &quot;No, that's a lie!&quot;<br/><br/>Once all dice have been used up, the player throws a six sided die that gives her her score. Other players decide if she is allowed to throw another die to get a better score.

Then the player has to choose in secret which part of his opponents body he will hit.  First he chooses from two cards (left and right) and then from three cards (head, torso, legs), giving him a place and a height to hit.  His opponent may try to defend and also chooses these cards.  Then they both reveal their cards.  If they both played the same cards, nothing happens, if their is no card corresponding then the opponent gets full damage.  When one card corresponds he gets 'half' damage.  He puts this on his damage board (left side head, right side head, left side torso, right side torso, left leg, right leg), On each is a score track when the score track reaches the maximum the fight is lost.

        "description": "Poke is a two-player multi-genre card game invented by Sid Sackson and discussed in his book A Gamut of Games. It combines strong elements of Poker with trick-taking games, and adds scoring reminiscent of Bridge.<br/><br/>Like bridge, score is kept on a pad split down the centre both across and down; points &quot;above the line&quot; count for the final total, whereas points &quot;below the line&quot; are intermediate. The game is also played until a rubber, or best of three games, is completed.<br/><br/>A hand of Poke is played in two phases; in the first phase, players draw cards to better their Poker hand, and in the second phase the players proceed to take &quot;tricks&quot; with their hand. Points from the first phase go above the line; points from the second go below the line, with some exceptions. Once a player has twenty points below the line (which may take more than one deal), the game is over, bonus points are added, and the points above the line are tallied to determine the winner of that particular game.<br/><br/>Play is as follows:<br/>    * The dealer passes out five cards to himself and his opponent.<br/>    * The opponent may elect to stand pat, or not take any more cards. They may also discard from one to three of the cards in their hand and draw replacements. This doubles their hand; during the trick-taking phase, their opponent will now receive two points per trick won instead of one. After doubling, they may elect to stand pat, or discard from one to three cards again and draw replacements. This is a redouble, and their opponent will now receive four points per trick. They must stand pat at this point.<br/>    * The dealer acts similarly, except for the fact that they get one &quot;free&quot; discard-and-redraw; they may also double and redouble afterwards, for a total of three possible discards-and-redraws.<br/><br/>This ends the first phase. Next comes the trick-taking phase.<br/><br/>* The non-dealer leads by playing one or more cards from their hand. If more than one card is played, they must be of the same rank; in other words, only singles, pairs, three-of-a-kinds, and four-of-a-kinds are allowed as a single play. Their opponent must beat the cards on the table. If it is a singleton, a card of higher rank will suffice; if it is a pair or greater, the opponent must play the same number of cards, and can only beat if their own cards are all the same rank and of higher value. If they do not have a pair or higher, they can simply toss off other cards, which will not beat what is on the table. If the cards played have the same value, the leader wins them.<br/>    * Note that suit is irrelevant at this stage; there are no trumps, and one does not have to follow suit to beat.<br/>    * Players keep their own cards, turning them face-up if they won the trick or face-down if they did not.<br/>    * The winner of the last trick leads for the next one, following the rules above.<br/><br/>After all five cards have been played in tricks, points below the line are determined. Each player gets one point below the line for every trick they take if their opponent did not double or redouble; they get two points for every trick if their opponent doubled but did not redouble, and four points for every trick if their opponent redoubled.<br/><br/>If a player took all five cards in tricks, they have performed a sweep, and receive a bonus of 250 points above the line.<br/><br/>Next, both player's hands are considered as Poker hands. The player with the highest Poker hand received points above the line as follows:<br/><br/>* Pair: 50 points<br/>    * Two Pair: 100 points<br/>    * Three of a Kind: 200 points<br/>    * Straight: 300 points<br/>    * Flush: 400 points<br/>    * Full House: 500 points<br/>    * Four of a Kind: 600 points<br/>    * Straight Flush: 750 points<br/>    * Royal Flush: 1000 points<br/><br/>Deal then passes, and a new hand is dealt. However, if either player reached 20 points below the line, that game is over, unless there is a tie in the number of points below the line, in which case a tiebreaker hand is played. Once a clear winner has been determined, that player gets a bonus of 100 points above the line, and all points below the line are canceled.<br/><br/>When a player has won their second game, they receive the 100 point bonus mentioned above, plus 750 points above the line if their opponent did not win a game in the rubber, or 500 points above the line if their opponent won one. At this stage, the points above the line are tallied, and the person with the most points above the line wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with pieces at a corner of the board, and the object is to move all one's pieces to thee other player's starting position before the oponent does the same. No captures are made but pieces can jump as in draughts.<br/><br/>How this fundamentally differs from similar games is the rectangular, rather than triangular, grid of the board and/or being a strictly two player game.<br/><br/>Its history is described in this file on BGG.<br/><br/>",

They may also use their &quot;stats&quot; to play War cards to attack opposing Crews, destroy opposing Crews' Empires, or steal their opponents' Rackets for themselves. Also, they may attack enemy Crews directly using Dice attacks, forcing wiser, wealthier Crews to defend themselves with strategic use of their own resources such as Wiseguy Modifiers and Retaliation cards. As the game progresses, Rat cards are added to the deck, a threat to every Crew on the table.<br/><br/>The goal of Mafioso is to be the Crew with the most valuable Empire on the table at the end of the game, for only the crew with the most lucrative Empire will be chosen by Big Sal to remain a part of the Gouldini Crime Family, and the rest will be &quot;fed to the fishes&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The family game Quatro Flash is one of these.<br/><br/>The game rules are pretty simple, and the objective of &quot;four in a row&quot; sounds very familiar. There are actually a great many two-player games based on this principle. As a family game, though, this idea is amazingly new, suspenseful, and witty.<br/><br/>Players proceed in turn. Each player places a disk of their color on the board. The object of the game is to arrange four of your disks in an uninterrupted row, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally. They can be lined up on the same level, stacked on top of one another, or staggered as a stair-cased row.<br/><br/>You need to follow the course of the game very attentively if you are to spot early enough a player's potential chances of winning and try to prevent this with one of your pieces.<br/><br/>The temptation is great to disclose a player's possible chances and urge the other players to intervene, but this is not allowed. Creative conversation, however, cannot be prohibited completely.<br/><br/>",

Both games use area movement and the same combat/game system. CHE is the introductory game in the system and Cuban Revolution builds upon the basic concepts used in CHE adding in Air, Naval, and Artillery units as well as more advanced game concepts.<br/><br/>CUBAN REVOLUTION: Beginning in February, 1958 Castro began the first Guerrilla offensive by coming out of the Sierra Maesta Mountains and attacking the Bastiano troops in the plains. The Bastiano army counter-attacked in June of 1958, driving the Guerrillas back into the mountains. When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the Guerrillas in their mountain strongholds, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the Guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano Western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Fulgencia Batista fled in January of 1959, the Guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was officially free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.<br/><br/>CHE: In March, 1967 the situation in Bolivia was chaotic and the country was ripe for the exportation of &quot;The Cuban Revolution&quot;.  Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara was sent to Bolivia to begin a revolution which ultimately failed due to the intervention of the CIA and US Green Berets who trained three elite Bolivian ranger battalions who captured &quot;Che&quot; Guevara and later executed him thus ending the Communist threat in Bolivia.<br/><br/>",

In the village players gain basic weapons (tokens), magical spells (cards), and enchanted weapons (cards). Players may also petition the king for increased abilities or to commission new weapons to be made.  They may also serve in the king's army to gain influence, gather raw materials, sell materials at market, visit the healer, or hire the sorcerer to create magical items.  All the while a dark prince roams the village causing havoc for the players.  There are twelve creatures infesting the catacombs that can be fought for treasure, enchanted items, or victory points depending on the level in which they reside.  Players use items to manipulate dice in combat.<br/>Each player must move each turn and two players cannot occupy the same space.  The creatures in the catacombs get increasingly difficult as a player moves to lower levels.  The winner of the game is player to gain the most victory points.  The game is played in 60 to 90 minutes and is for 3 to 5 players 12 years and older.<br/><br/>Kickstarter: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628734072/other-world-0?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/628734072/other-world-0...</a><br/><br/>",

Every Pilgrim has to look for two item cards shown in his Character card. The item cards are kept in the creature dwellings. In order to gain these cards the Pilgrim has to pay life tokens to the keepers. <br/>In the meantime the Santa Compa&ntilde;a player, secretly, will use its cards to threaten the other players, steal their life tokens and finally convert them to its allies.

In the game, you control the French forces and must try to defeat the invading English forces in the Battle of Agincourt, which was fought on October 25, 1415. Your forces are represented by cubes and strength dice. You must move your cubes along a simple point-to-point map, but your movement will be hindered ever step of the way by English arrow fire. Your goal is to move two of your cubes into the English line, which will disrupt it and allow you to capture Henry V.<br/><br/>The game uses a CDG system similar to games like We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage (albeit on a much smaller scale). Each turn you will play a card from your hand using it either for its action points or as an event which can aid your play. As you perform actions, such as movement and combat, you will draw special event cards that present new challenges.<br/><br/>The game is played using a total of 9 cards and a handful of cubes and dice. One card contains the map for the game and the other eight cards contain the game's events. Each event card has three separate events on it 1.) Player Event 2.) Movement Event and 3.) Combat Event. You will only need to look at the relevant event for the current phase of the game.<br/><br/>Each turn is played out in a series of phases.<br/>1. Card Play Phase<br/>2. English Archer Phase<br/>3. Combat Phase<br/>4. Victory or Loss Check Phase<br/><br/>Despite the small number of components and short playing time, the game presents a challenging experience and interesting historical narrative for this famous battle.

In the show, she doesn't hesitate to put others before herself. Accordingly, in The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary Lori plays best as a support player, with her selfless attitude reflected in her Survivor Cards and the frequency with which she doles out Ability Tokens. Her character ability &quot;Voice of Reason&quot; allows a player with one of her ability tokens to spend it to reveal a card in their hand to the rest of the group during the Approach Planning phase. This allows for greater group coordination and can result in the Leader making a better approach choice for the group.<br/><br/>Lori's ability tokens can prevent situations in which the leader role keeps getting passed after each turn due to defiant card choices by the rest of the group. Lori makes an excellent addition to any group and can be a clutch player when avoiding stress becomes critical during a scenario<br/><br/>",

These dice are used to complete Goals that are played to the middle of the table.  Different goals require different combinations of dice.  If a player fails to complete a Goal, they can bank points on that Goal for future use, but those points are available to anyone who attemps to compete that Goal.<br/><br/>Each player also maintains a hand of cards.  In addition to Goals, there are other cards that allow players to take, swap, and borrow dice and to re-roll failed attempts to complete a Goal.<br/><br/>RYB makes an excellent children's game because encourages lots of addition, subtraction, and comparison of quantities while keeping the focus of the game away from the math itself.<br/><br/>",

However, since each time cattle doubles, it is better to wait until it grows. But, yet again, you may not step on a ranch for a long time later; so, you may loose cattle if number will reach maximum. Also, you may steal other players&rsquo; cattle by stepping on their ranches. If you do so, you will have to reach town without being captured by the player you stole cattle from. Players, if their cattle is stolen, can chase thieves not only through ordinary routes, but also through cutaways, however if he will use them, he could lose ability to step on his ranches and take cattle to town for sell. If thief is captured, he must give cattle to owner and pay fine. Each robbed ranch is automatically sold to bank and could be bought again. If player steps on casino, he/she could play for money. Player could then bid money and roll die. If it rolls 1, 3 or 5, player looses money. If it rolls 2, 4 or 6 he takes his money back and also the same amount of money from bank. The game automatically ends after 60 minutes; so, it has to be played with clock or chronometer.<br/><br/>This game was released by Azar in Lithuania and could be unknown elsewhere. However, it is in Wild West style so uses English board and ranch names.<br/><br/>",

The only human characters in the game are the Wizards themselves and the greatest warriors; ordinary mortals stay out of the way when dragons battle with demons and giants. The Wizards attempt to rally neutral beings to their cause, and to hamper their opponent's efforts by moving the very terrain itself. The landscape is enchanted, and its mountains and forests are subject to powerful spells. With these spells, the magic portals called Gates, and his own forces, each Wizard hopes to give his rivals their death blows. The winner is the last Wizard left in the land.<br/><br/>Published in Fantasy Gamer #5.<br/><br/>",

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>The Case of the Wirst Case Scenario<br/><br/>A murder mystery party game for 10<br/>That magnate of the publishing world, Mr. William Rudolph Wirst, President &amp; CEO of Wirst Publishing, has invited you to attend a very special celebratory dinner to be held at the Hi-8 Hotel, Midtown Manhattan, New York. After dinner, Mr. Wirst will unveil the latest title soon-to-be published by his company: It was the Wirst of Times, It was the Best of Times. The manuscript, of course, is Mr. Wirst's own memoirs, and he promises to regale everyone with excerpts - information that some might even consider, well . . . shall we say . . . scandalous? Incriminating? Surely it will be a night to live on in the memories of all who live through it . . .<br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/>P. Leigh Jerreyes is an RN by trade, and new to the world of writing. She is a budding author who has written her first book of poems entitled, &quot;Bedpans and Betadine.&quot; She's brought her manuscript with her, hoping to convince Mr. Wirst to publish it. After all, her creative writing teacher told her she was raw with talent and wide-eyed with wonder. Leigh herself modestly dismisses such praise, saying &quot;I only want to pursue one of my greatest dreams in life.&quot; She wears her nurse's uniform wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Lilla &quot;Li&quot; Belle S. Lander is a media darling whose articles have been published in every major newspaper across the country. Flashy and charismatic, Li is an award-winning journalist whose written words spark controversy and terror in even the most sedate circles. She is also hoping to sell her first book-length Washington expose': The Hussies in the House. Li often wears business suits or professional clothing.<br/><br/>Allyssa T. Fairre is easily the most successful tabloid writer in the country. Her work of tracking down Elvis-impersonating extra-terrestrials has brought her a great deal of notoriety. Suave, elegant and chic, she is known to turn up anywhere around the globe in pursuit of a story. Never married, she claims to be in search of the &quot;right rich man for a husband.&quot; Yet she rarely lacks handsome male escorts, and often wears rather revealing attire.<br/><br/>Starr Cross is the epitome of the &quot;femme fatale&quot; romance writer and her books have long topped the romance charts. Her latest titles, The Letches of Lidgefield County and Lust Knows No Bounds, have sold well over twelve million copies worldwide. Yet hers is a rags to riches story: Starr worked as a cocktail waitress before selling her first book. Her rise to the top was the equivalent of a bungi jump in reverse. In the publishing industry she is considered to be a hot property, frequently sought after by other houses and literary agencies. Starr prefers clothes with ribbons and ruffles.<br/><br/>Lowe Z. Ajante is a used car salesman turned literary agent who is sure his hard work will pay off soon. He believes in good old American free enterprise, waving his stars and stripes in the faces of pouting pessimists. He knows his attempts to constantly upgrade his stable of authors will eventually bring him fame and fortune. Lowe is a flamboyant dresser who believes polyester double-knit has taken a bad rap, and is sure it will make a comeback any day now.<br/><br/>Murray &quot;Mur&quot; DerMisteree is an internationally famous writer of mystery novels, second only to Agatha Christie. Though some say he has far surpassed the Queen of Crime, as he is critically acclaimed for the realism of his work. &quot;Makes you feel like you're right there committing the crime,&quot; says the L.A. Whines. Personally, Mr. DerMisteree has been described as a brooding intellectual, a genius in his genre. He frequently wears his hunting clothes.<br/><br/>Pickford &quot;Pick&quot; E. Publichere is a new publisher who has recently released a number of trendy titles, including - The Mother-in-Law Excuse Book: A Guide to Avoiding Holiday Hassles and Other Traumas. He has been described by Kiss Up Now magazine as a calculating, competitive entrepreneur, sure to make it big. His closest colleagues call him &quot;Pick,&quot; while the thousands of writers who receive his rejection letters each year refer to him by different names. Pick always wears business suits.<br/><br/>Ray Gene Bull is an award-winning sportswriter who enjoys traveling to remote parts of the world in search of little-known sporting events. Thus he is known in professional circles as the &quot;Mr. National Geographic&quot; of the sports world. Physically fit and ruggedly handsome, Ray is a former quarterback for Poedunck University. He is as popular with members of the opposite sex as he is with his readers. Ray prefers clothes that display sports logos.<br/><br/>Portia &quot;Por&quot; Rytere is a literary novelist whose mixed metaphors are often only understood by MENSA members, and whose analogies are so deep that one must reread her books many times to grasp the hidden meaning. Her latest seven-hundred page novel, And Then They Died, is a fictitious rendition of the mating rituals of tsetse flies, and like her other books, is published by Wirst Publishing. Por is the past president of Superior Novelists of Balderdash, or SNOB, and the ex-wife of Richard Rytere. Elegant eveningwear usually comprises her wardrobe.<br/><br/>Richard &quot;Rich&quot; Rytere is sometimes called the King of Commercialism, having capitalized on the &quot;quick read.&quot; One of Wirst Publishing's hottest authors, Rich's books have yet to miss the bestsellers lists. His latest novel, Life, Love, and Rain Falling Silently on the Mountaintop, is bound to be his greatest work yet. But fame and fortune have not changed Rich - he's still the same fun-loving guy from Philly, who prefers hot dogs to filet mignon. He owns a wide collection of flashy ties.<br/><br/>Ever wonder what it would be like to be a famous author? Here's your chance to play one for the evening! Why don't you try on fame and fortune and see what it feels like?<br/><br/>This mystery is probably the easiest ten-person mystery game to put on. Since the setting is modern day, the costumes are usually something a person finds in their closet.<br/><br/>So have fun, and while you're at it, sign a few autographs for your adoring fans!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maneuver: The scheming game of getting it all together!<br/><br/>This game was recommended by GAMES way back in 1979. Two to four players each choose a set of colored marbles which are placed on the board and then shaken up with an opaque lid on top. The board is configured unevenly so that it forms a diagonal grid where the marbles can nestle. There's a great deal of luck involved since marbles may land favorably for some players and not others.<br/><br/>The object is simply to move your marbles one spot at a time in any diagonal direction to arrange your twelve marbles into lines of three or more, while blocking your opponents in the process.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maltese uses tiles in an original rummy-type game in which completing sets can enable players to force tiles out of their opponent's hands.<br/><br/>Tiles come in 5 colors, and each tile has an inset in any of those same 5 colors.  Half of the insets will match the tile's exterior, half won't.  So, for example, of the 16 green tiles, 8 have green insets, 2 have orange, 2 have white, 2 have read, and 2 have blue.<br/><br/>All players can see the external color of a tile, but only the owner sees its inset - and the inset color is what really counts.<br/><br/>Additionally, each player has a tile holder (&quot;shield&quot;) which holds the tiles in 5 rows.  When playing into this section of the shield, all the tiles in a row must be a single color (inset), and each row must be a different color.  So you'll have one row that is all-white, one that is all-red, etc, but you can choose which is which.  Furthermore, each row contains a different # of tiles, from 1-5.  The goal is to completely fill in this section of your shield: a total of 5 matched rows with a total of 15 tiles.<br/><br/>A typical turn involves choosing a tile randomly, placing it into your hand, and then moving one tile from your hand into the central, scoring, part of the shield.  There are two key moves that occur.  One is when you complete a row.  At this point, you announce ALL UNFINISHED ROWS OF THAT SAME INSET COLOR GO BACK TO THE ARMORY (Draw pile).  This is where both the varying # of tiles, and the limited information are crucial.  You could, for example, play a single green tile in your &quot;#1&quot; row - and complete it.  If an opponent is working on a larger green row that is incomplete, he may have to discard as many as 4 green tiles.  You know that half of the green exterior tiles are green - so you only have limited information as to which of your opponents' rows might be green, or if they are even working on any green rows.<br/><br/>The second attack move occurs when you complete a row that is entirely &quot;matched&quot; (Insert color matches exterior color).  You can even do this by replacing unmatched tiles with matched tiles in rows you've already completed.  You then announce ALL FINISHED BUT UNMATCHED ROWS OF THAT SAME ROW NUMBER ARE BACK TO THE ARMORY.  In this case, if you complete a matched #3 row, all opponents who have completed unmatched #3 rows must toss all of these three tiles back into the draw pile.<br/><br/>Game ends when the first player completes all 5 rows with 5 different colors - matched or not.<br/><br/>",

In each of the hideouts a scoring marker (a small cardboard gun inserted into a random scoring base which varies in points from 1,000 to 5,000 points) is placed face down so that none of the players know the values beforehand.<br/><br/>Each player (up to four) is given a set of 30 tiles on which is printed a 'chain' (or in game terms... a police cordon).  Tiles must be placed on the grid so that the 'chain' is continued.  Certain squares on the board provide an additional turn.<br/><br/>When the 'chain' forms a closed loop and encloses one or more 'mobster hideouts', the player who closed the loop takes the scoring markers for all of the hideouts inside the loop.  Placement within the loop is now forbidden and any tiles that exist within the loop are returned to their owner.<br/><br/>When all 24 hideouts have been surrounded, the player who encircled the last hideout gets 1,000 bonus points.  Players add up the values of all the mobsters that they captured and the one with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Card list a weapon and a number of points for that weapon. e.g.- '1000 Screaming Peasants Waving Pitchforks' is worth 1 point, '30 Germ Warfare Bombs' is worth 25 points, '5 Nuclear missile Submarines' is worth 100 points.<br/><br/>A game consists of a number of rounds until only one player remains.  Each player gets one turn during each round.  On a turn each player declares: &quot;I propose we disarm... (a weapon) worth... (x points)&quot; and places one card face down on the table.  Each other player does the same.  The smallest card a player may declare must be worth 25 points, so getting rid of those 1 point Ceremonial sabers can be tricky.<br/><br/>A turn of 'Weapons Inspections' follows.  Each player may then call for an inspection of another players card.  First, he shows that he had disarmed the proper number of points, then turns over the card of one other player.  If it is the proper card, he gets to return it to his hand.  If it isn't the proper card, one card at random is drawn and placed face down with the first.<br/><br/>If no one calls for a weapons inspection, a die is rolled for a random 'spot-check'.<br/><br/>All cards played in a turn are discarded.<br/><br/>At the end of a round (once each player has had a turn disarming weapons), a 'Crisis' card is flipped.  The card can be &quot;NO CRISIS&quot; or can list the names of two of the players who must then resolve a 'crisis' between each other.  Players resolve a crisis but tallying the number of points in their hands and, depending on the difference in points, resolve the conflict.  A player is out of the game if he is beaten by more than 150 points.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the discard pile is shuffled and each player gains two cards.<br/><br/>Play continues until only one player is left.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The most challenging game of strategy ever created!&quot; sayeth the box...proof that truth in advertising laws weren't quite so stringent in the early 70's.<br/><br/>Espionage is an advanced &quot;roll and move&quot; game similar to the Project KGB games from the same time period.  Each player tryies to be the first to move their four spies from Mission Control to the waiting helicopters in the Abandoned Airfield.  Along the way there are various pitfalls to slow the players down and &quot;cloak and dagger&quot; spaces which require drawing a card and doing what it says.  Movement is handled by rolling the two dice and either moving one spy the sum of the two dice or two spies the amount shown on one die (i.e., a roll of &quot;2&quot; &amp; &quot;3&quot; means you can move one spy 5 spaces or one spy 2 spaces and a different spy 3 spaces).  Landing on an enemy spy sends that spy back to the nearest &quot;safe&quot; area, so the game is cut-throat to be sure.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the board, at the Guerrilla Camp, players draw a letter card for each spy that they want to pass through to the airfield.  The requirement is that the player be able to spell out a word with their letter cards in order to win the game (four letter cards - one for each spy).  If a player doesn't like the letter they drew, they can return it to the deck and wait until their next turn to draw another.<br/><br/>",

Now the Trade Wars begin.<br/><br/>Trade Wars the board game is a microcosm of the real Trade Wars raging outside, driving global economic conflict home.<br/><br/>The Trade Wars board simulates the globe, and is divided into four geographic regions that a player may control. Players move through the regions of the board purchasing corporations, forming Trusts and Cartels, and collecting license fees from opponents. Players risk making unsound investments, paying license fees to other players, and encounter trade and tariff barriers. Players seek to create transnational corporate empires and either buy-out other players or run them out of existence. Each region has its own currency and players must deal with rising and falling currency exchange rates. Market Force cards randomly effect the game. Players may buy and sell corporations to other players or the bank.<br/><br/>This game has a player pre-determined length of play with variable playing options. Also of note, this game comes complete with player aids and a Teacher&amp;#039;s Guide for classroom play.<br/><br/>",

It is classified as a knowledge game instead of a triva game because the information in the game is based on the information that SCUBA divers need to know in order to safely participate in the sport.<br/><br/>The object of the game is for the player to complete three of the four possible dives (reef, wreck, deep or night). Each player starts on the &quot;surface&quot;. The player is then asked a question from a box of cards (similar to the question cards used in the game Trivial Pursuit). If the player answers correctly they descend to the next depth level. If they miss the question they move sideways towards the ABORT column. If the player ever lands in the ABORT column they must end the dive, return to the surface and start over again.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches the maximum depth for the dive the next question they answer takes them back to the surface. They are then given a &quot;certification card&quot; for that dive and may start another dive. The first player to be &quot;certified&quot; in three of the four dives is the winner.<br/><br/>",

If you move your beginner piece onto one of the 5 fish pieces, you can take a photograph. There is a pile of cards for each of the 5 fish pieces. A good shot is worth more than a blurry shot. You can take more than one picture of the same fish over different turns, but only get to count the best shot for each of the 5 pieces for determining your score.<br/><br/>There is usually barely enough time to take pictures of all 5 pieces if you just take one shot of each, but sometimes there's not even that much time. It is usually easier to try to take a 2nd or 3rd picture of the same piece, but of course you then won't have time to get pictures of all 5 types of pieces.<br/><br/>The fourth in Grapac Japan's series of games under the label &quot;Aeronaut&quot;.

The Rules Booklet has 2 Sections with the 2nd part providing the Set-up for Play of up to 3 Scenarios, the Rules for Solitaire Play, and plenty of Charts &amp; Tables which SHOULD be copied or cut apart for use during the game. There is even a Reduced copy of the Game map if players should feel the need for using one.The cardboard Game Counters are Dark PINK with BLACK &amp; WHITE print for the Soviets, and Light GRAY, GRAY, Light PURPLE, and BLACK with WHITE &amp; BLACK print for the Germans using mostly NATO style symbols &amp; a few silhouettes for Type designations with some Informational markers also provided. The Errata sheet has some misprinted Counters information, Tiger Battalions Breakdown &amp; Jammed Rules, Set-up clarifications, and the Terrain Effects on Combat table.<br/><br/>The 3 Scenarios are: (1)Operation:WINTER TEMPEST-an Historical depiction with up to 6 Variants; (2)Manstein's WISH:the Early Attack; &amp; (3)The Maximum Effort. The SCALE of the Game is given as (4)-Miles across for each HEX, each TURN equals (1)-Day, and Units are Battalion to Divisional level with Headquarters for Division to Army level. The Sequence of Play is as follows: 1.Mutual Supply Determination Phase plus possible Mud Conditions die-roll; 2.German AIR Phase; 3.German Movement; 4.German Combat; 5.German 2nd Movement; 6.German Special(Mech) Combat; 7.Soviet Artillery Barrage Phase; 8.Soviet Movement; 9.Soviet Combat; 10.Soviet Special(Mech) Combat; 11.Mutual Disruption Removal Phase; 12.New Turn-Move the Marker 1 box to begin again. NOTE:There is NO Soviet 2nd Movement-ONLY the German MECH-types are allowed this. Reinforcements will enter PLAY during their respective Player's initial(1st) Movement Phase.<br/><br/>There are SPECIAL Rules for: Headquarters-Tracing Supply &amp; providing Artillery Support(2-Hex Range); Supply CONVOY(Germans ONLY); Troop QUALITY; AIR Points-Ground Support(Both) or Stalingrad Supply(Germans ONLY); Weather; Combined ARMS attacks; Engineer, Machine Gun, &amp; Anti-Tank units; Combat shrifts; Operation:THUNDERCLAP-the Breakout; &amp; the Surrounded German 6th ARMY.<br/><br/>The SOLITAIRE game has provisions for a Player to see how well they perform as EITHER side during a game. GERMANS:There are Objectives set up for the NON-Player side centered around the 3 PANZER Divisions involved and when some are accomplished or moved to, then NEW ones are determined that they'll have to achieve and this process continues throughout the game. The entrapped 6th ARMY has it's OWN Breakout Decision Table as well. <br/>SOVIETS:The various Soviet CORPS/Armies have differing Objectives according to their COMPOSITION and the GERMAN's Units near them which produces a Modifier which is then applied to the SOVIET die-roll on the Objective Table. This can result in the subject CORPS/ARMY adopting an Elastic-Defense, Fighting-Defense, Hold-at-ALL-Costs, Advance-to-Contact, Limited-Assault, or All-out-Assault which are further explained in the RULES Booklet in greater detail.<br/><br/>THIS is one of the more professionally produced Games by Perry Moore, et al, and takes an unusual tact in that the Units have Movement Designations using LETTERs instead of NUMBERs for them. These are H-horse drawn~[6]-Movement Points, L-Leg powered(Infantry)~[4]-M.P.s, T-Track equipped~[9]-M.P.s, &amp; W-Wheel based~[10]-M.P.s. Units will also have a Troop QUALITY letter with E=Elite, D=Depleted and NO letter=LINE. This can affect COMBAT &amp; RETREATS, which result in Disruption for Depleted Units although Elite &amp; Line Units are not so affected. The SOLITAIRE Rules have been extensively detailed to allow Players to experience the game system and formulate some strategem which they can apply in some future game against a worthy opponent.<br/><br/>",

In an attempt to dissuade Japanese youth from criminal acts, the government enacts the &quot;Battle Royale Act&quot;. A class of students is randomly selected to partake in the Battle Royale Survival Program. Students are given a bag of supplies with a weapon and sent out on an island with a remote detonated bomb around their neck. The game begins. Only one student will survive. It's kill or be killed. If there are no deaths in a 60 minute window, a bomb collar is randomly detonated. Areas of the island are randomly designated &quot;dangerous&quot; and all collars within that area detonate. In 3 days a single winner will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>This is a game based on that premise. It comes with 12 student cards, 20 battle cards, 9 location cards, 3 dangerous area cards, 16 event cards and 1 paper game mat.<br/><br/>",

Of these, the best is Null-and-Void.<br/><br/>The components include a small roll-up vinyl board with 16 circular spaces forming a 4x4 grid; eight yellow plastic discs and eight green plastic discs, and the box and rules.  Half of each color of the discs have a single arrow on them, and half have a double arrow.<br/><br/>Avoid -- The object is to play the last piece. Played pieces point orthogonally or diagonally to another space. Single arrows point to spaces one spaces away and double arrows point to spaces two spaces away. After the first piece is played subsequent plays must be to a space which does not have a piece on the board pointing to it.<br/><br/>Null-and-Void -- Start by filling your half of the board with your pieces, alternating single and double arrows so that each type is diagonally adjacent to like pieces and orthogonally adjacent to the opposite type.  Remove one of your opponent's pieces from the game, and she does the same to you.  Take turns moving a piece into an adjacent void, pointing the arrow at an opponent's piece.  Double arrows point to pieces two spaces away.  Pieces may point orthogonally or diagonally.  Flip the piece pointed at: it's out of the game for this round.

All possible 3x3 grid patterns are represented, with the number of tiles for each pattern being the number of distinct rotational positions it has.  Each tile has patterns on both sides, with each being the inverse coloring of the other.<br/><br/>A number of different ways to play are provided.  There is a solitaire puzzle in which you try to fit a given number of pieces together so that the color patterns on the edges always match.  There is a two-player game using the provided 16x16 board in which each player takes a color and tries to create a continuous path of that color across the board.  A number of variants are provided for this game. Finally, there is a multi-player game (no upper limit on players is specified, but six seemed reasonable) in which players are trying to get rid of tiles by playing them to a common 3x3 array.  Unplayable tiles must be used to form a personal 3x3 array.  All the games use the same edge-matching rule as the puzzle.<br/><br/>",

Differentiation between troop equipment is scant (armored/unarmored), abandoned in favor of troop classifications. Somewhat controversially, the rules include mechanisms for indirect fire.

Play is paragraph based, with each player making their own choices about what they want their character to do.<br/><br/>In Blood Valley, one player takes on the role of the evil Archveult, a great, demon-like being.  Every year in the Spring, the Archveult selects a prisoner to be set loose, as quarry, in the circle of stones.  With only a few hours lead, the quarry is to try to find his/her way out of the valley, evading the Archveult who is led by his Hell Hounds, and who has laid traps for the quarry throughout the land.  The Archveult also has his son, the Demiveult, his assassin Ka-riim the Hashishin and Kritos Bloodheart, the Captain of the Guard to help him hunt.  The quarry player has his choice of three characters to play, the Priest, the Barbarian or the Thief.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a fairly basic biography/trivia game.  Included are 200 photos of celebrities: movie stars, musicians, sports heroes, and political and military figures.  Each card has multiple questions on the back about the pictured person.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to identify the person in the picture and then answer questions about that person. The questions asked are determined by a roll of two 6-sided dice. Rewards and penalties are also determined by the number on the dice roll. For example, if the player roles a 7, they answer Question 7 on the card, and receive 10 points if correct PLUS any bonuses indicated next to Question 7. Every time a player fails to answer a question, the opportunity to do so moves to the next player and the value for the correct answer goes up 5 points.<br/><br/>The &quot;Quizmaster&quot; role is first determined by a roll of the dice. This person queries each player in turn, and notes their score on the scorecard. Once all players have been quizzed, the Quizzmaster role then rotates clockwise.<br/><br/>The accompanying 94-page booklet contains additional biographical information about each celebrity.<br/><br/>",

You need know nothing about the drugs or the law or anything else, just like in Monopoly.  You can choose to either get patents on your drugs or not.  You need never develop any drug, but instead can simply sell related drugs to those that others have already developed.  You can make up to $192Million in a single turn, and someone can be $500Million ahead and still lose.  <br/>Each turn you roll to get money from $1-3Million.  You choose to develop a drug or not.

        "description": "Bir Buyuk Turk Saldiri (The Great Turk Attack) covers the climatic end of the Asia Minor War that began in 1919. By 1922, the British, French and Italians had long abandoned the Greek Army's occupation of some 400 km in Turkey. Originally planned to recover the spoils of WW1 when Turkey surrendered, the Allied powers had promised Greece a part of Turkey, which the Greeks claimed was part of &quot;Greater Greece&quot;. The Greeks by the Summer of 1921, had advanced to within 30 km of Ankara, there the critical battle of the Sakarya River ended the advance. The failure of the battle now turned public opinion at home and amongst troops in Turkey against the war. From 1921 to 1922, the Greek Asia Minor Army held a 400 km front line. The Greeks were hoping and desperately looking for a honorable way out of the mess that the British had got them in. Greece was going broke because of the war and depended on England to provide monetary loans. Greek morale wavered.<br/><br/>The Turks under Mustapha Kemal (Ataturk) were about to give a good reason for the Greeks to leave.<br/><br/>The game is operational, 2 miles a hex, battalions and regiments. In all, 280 counters and 11x17 inch color map. Units have two combat strengths and there are two movement phases. Reserves are important. Supply is critical. Units include infantry, cavalry, artillery, aircraft and HQ's. Each turn is 12 hrs. There are two games, the campaign from August 26 to 31st and &quot;The Pocket&quot;, where five Greek divisions are trapped from August 29-31. The game is not complex and can be completed in two hours.<br/><br/>Related game:<br/>Bloodbath at the Sakarya, August, 1921<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is an early Spanish attempt of a &quot;wargame&quot;, based on the battle at the Metauro 207 BC, where Hasdrubal lost against  Gaius Claudius Nero. The game comes with a booklet about the historical battle, and an album with glue-in images from the film Hannibal (Edgar G. Ulmer, 1959).<br/>It has very simple rules: the units can move one to three spaces and battles are resolved by simple dice rolls, modified by strength of the units (elephant!, cavalry) and area bonus. Units have something like a zone of control.<br/>The aim is to kill the opponent's leader or to capture the opponents &quot;flag-space&quot;.<br/>What makes this game really interesting are the beautiful hand-painted miniatures. In the original version by Rojas y Malaret, the figures were made of plastic and hand painted. In the German version everything is the same (rules, board, box), but the figures are made of Elastolin, a material invented by the Hausser company a few years earlier and used for toys (they are also hand-painted). Hausser used its own miniatures (diferent and a bit smaller (=4 cm) than the Spanish ones), but the elephant comes from the Rojas y Malaret game &quot;Carthago&quot; (Hausser had no elephant in its catalogue). That's why the elephant miniature in the Hausser version is a bit different in scale and material from the other units (and equal to the original Spanish one).<br/>The Rojas y Malaret version was published in Spain in 1961, and the German version by Hausser in 1963 but it was republished for years.<br/><br/>",

It provides gamers with a system focused on the tactical employment of units from Brigade down to company level.<br/><br/>Elan aims to capture the feel of combat during the period, and will satisfy players who approach their games with an appreciation for the actual tactics used by the Generals of the period. Use of combined arms, effective command and keeping a reserve up your sleeve are the keys to success.<br/><br/>The rules are also perfect for tournament games allowing for objectives, quick results and good reflection of a player's ability as opposed to just sheer luck.<br/><br/>For play purposes a Tactical Turn represents about 20 minutes, and with the Grand Tactical aspects included, a Turn represents about 1 hour. All measurements are in millimeters representing 1 meter per millimeter. The rules are written with measurements for 25mm scale figures, but 15mm is equally suitable by modifying distances.<br/><br/>Includes reference charts.<br/><br/>",

In the second round, only the pattern-giver may talk. In the third round, only the pattern-builder may talk.

There are 132 counters in six colors, representing regiments, brigades, and fleets.<br/><br/>Turns are bi-monthly.

        "description": "Bench Coach Baseball is a game which keeps track of a pitcher's pitch count. Each batter is rated for his swinging at the first pitch, going ahead of the count, falling behind, or hitting with two strikes.  Rules are simple and game is based on 1-200 chances to hit or make an out.  Results are generated from three dice:  a green 20-sided die, and a blue and red six-sided die. A pitcher who consistently fall behind the count will tire more quickly and get hit harder than a pitcher who remains ahead of the hitters. Pitchers are also rated on their ability to hold runners. There is also rules for hit and out location, and sacrifice bunts. Game includes a pitch-count sheet, rules, stadium factors and individual players with their own player cards, like APBA and Strat-o-Matic. The cards for this game are not as aesthetically pleasing as the Strat-O cards or the newer APBA baseball cards:  just cardstock with heavy black numbers and letters.<br/><br/>The main distributor for Adam Games is Taylor Marketing.<br/><br/>",

The two sides are Persians and Greeks, although &quot;Pyxis&quot; is not the name of an actual Greek leader (it's a small pottery box).<br/><br/>Each side has identical armies of 20 units - 10 infantry, 2 each of archers, cavalry, elephants, and phalanxes, a royal guard, and a king.  These are deployed on a 12x12 board, along with terrain tiles representing forests and hills (so the board will be different each time).<br/><br/>On a turn a player can move 5 infantry units and 1 each of the other types.  Units that move into enemy units cause combat to occur.  Combat is strictly deterministic - the strength differential determines whether the attacker or defender retreats or is eliminated.  Units have different strengths which further vary by terrain, phalanxes do better against mounted units, and archers can support other units.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to kill the enemy king or move your king off the enemy side of the board.<br/><br/>",

You can make do with scratch paper, your dice and a calculator or any other method of representing the battle you wish to use from miniatures to just keeping the whole idea in your head.<br/><br/>Feast of Crows, by necessity, abstracts the nature of role-playing combat further than it already is. While some heroes, magicians and warriors alike, or some monsters, tamed or bargained into helping an army can make an impact, it is usually as leaders of the rank and file and not as individuals that they will make their mark.<br/><br/>Feast of Crows requires little more preparation than a normal game or a normal set of character sheets and battles involving thousands of troops can be resolved just as quickly, if not more quickly, than normal party-level combat encounters while retaining the heroic, magical feel placed in gamer&rsquo;s imaginations by The Lord of the Rings or other fantasy works.<br/><br/>Feast of Crows is a feast, not only for the scavengers of the battlefield but also for the gamer seeking a good solution to resolving large scale battles as part of their epic campaigns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Middle East has seen almost continuous warfare from the Israeli declaration of independence in 1948 to the present day. There have been four major campaigns, of which those of 1967 and 1973 - the so-called 'Six Days' and 'Yom Kippur' Wars - are of particular interest to wargamers as they involved the largest tank battles since World War 2. Israeli Centurions, Pattons and M-60s vie for battlefield supremacy with Arab T-54s and T-62s, and the arena has become a testing ground for new weapon systems and tactical doctrines while retaining an overall similarity to the armoured conflict of World War 2 which forms the subject matter of earlier books in this series.<br/><br/>This book begins with an introduction to the subject, a short chapter on the origins of the Arab-Israeli conflict, and a detailed description, with maps, of the 1967 and 1973 campaigns. There are two detailed chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured fighting vehicles and their characteristics, anti-tank missiles, conventional artillery, infantry weapons, tactical missiles, minefields and helicopters. There are also chapters on Arab and Israeli armoured organisation and tactics, and two specially commissioned sections on the war in the air by Mike Spick, author of Air Battles in Miniature. Finally, there are detailed playing rules, an appendix listing model suppliers, a technical glossary and an index, making this the ideal book for the increasing numbers of wargamers interested in this fascinating arena.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Devil at the Helm is a set of miniatures rules for naval warfare in the ironclad and pre-dreadnought eras.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;The years between 1850 and 1906 saw immense changes in naval warfare.<br/><br/>&quot;From lines of stately three-deckers, the great powers' fleets changed to a multitude of armoured warships, each unit of which represented a pinnacle of design and engineering skill. Forces became a hotch-potch of individual ships, differing widely in their abilities and deficiencies, as the older ships mixed with the new. Specialized missions and hostile environments sometimes necessitated vessels of novel and awkward design, such as the river craft of the American Civil War. With these new ships came new and terrifying weapons, destroying forever the world of Nelson and Hornblower.<br/><br/>&quot;However, two factors bound this era of change into a single period: the predominance of steam propulsion and the control of gunnery by individual gunners.<br/><br/>&quot;It is upon these two factors that this set of rules has been based, enabling players to experience the changes &quot;first hand&quot; as a continuous process rather than examining each conflict in the period as an event unrelated to any other, and to appreciate as a whole the era of naval warfare before the Dreadnought.&quot;<br/><br/>These rules offer some interesting mechanics to take into account the vast changes in naval warfare that occurred during the period they cover. Rules exist for maneuvering ships under sail, under steam power, and under a combination of both sail and steam.<br/><br/>Gunnery includes muzzle-loading smooth bore cannon, muzzle-loading rifled cannon, early breech-loading cannon, and modern naval ordnance. The gunnery also includes rules to cover the different effects of the rounds that could be fired, such as solid round shot, solid armor-piercing (AP) shot, later AP shell, and common shell.<br/><br/>Ships' armor values are calculated using tables in the rules that cover such things as the kind of metal (solid iron, laminated iron, mild steel, Harveyized steel, Krupp steel, etc.) and, for earlier ironclads, the type and thickness of the wood backing the iron armor.<br/><br/>For an aficionado of the era, the rules can be very interesting because of the details of ship design and armament that are addressed.<br/><br/>However, there is something about the wide scope of the rules that creates problems. For example, to determine where a shot hits, players roll on a table that lists the various parts of a ship. But the parts listed don't apply to all ships within the period. Things like &quot;secondary turrets&quot; don't exist on an ironclad ram. Inapplicable hits are simply assigned to one of two areas, but this tends to skew the hit allocation.<br/><br/>There are very few ready-to-go ship stats included in the rules. Players are expected to create ships stats to use in the game based on the guidelines in the rules for designing these using data from external sources, such as &quot;Jane's Fighting Ships,&quot; &quot;Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships,&quot; and others.<br/><br/>Players will also need to supply the templates used to determine the turning radii of the model ships. The ones included in the rules are hand drawn and not really suitable for play.<br/><br/>One the whole, The Devil at the Helm has a lot of good ideas and is a strong basis for a good set of naval wargame rules for this period. But they leave a lot of rough edges for the players to smooth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game has been described as &quot;glorified War,&quot; but that description is almost entirely misleading.  Advanced Tactics uses one standard deck of cards for each player. The players battle over pairs of cards face up on the table, and draw three cards that are used to augment the strength of one or more of the pairs of cards in play. Clubs count as negative points, and diamonds require another card to be drawn for that column. The object of the game is not to simply win more cards, but to win &quot;point cards&quot;. Point cards start with the Aces, then move to Kings when all of the Aces are claimed, and so on. Play is continued until all points are claimed through a pre-agreed goal (for example, if playing to Queens, then the game will end when all Aces, Kings, and Queens are claimed). The player with the most point cards wins. This makes for interesting longer-term strategy as well as the obvious short-term strategy of winning the current cards on the table.<br/><br/>Complete rules for this game are in the July 2007 issue of Knucklebones magazine. Several rules variants are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TAUNTON DEANE DILEMMA is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed by local YMCAs in the UK to generate funds for their activities. The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case the town of Taunton, Somerset in the West of England near the border with Wales. The YMCA's founder George Williams was born in Somerset and founded the Taunton branch in 1855.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>- After a set time.<br/>- When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Horsemen of Buzkashi is a card game for 2-4 adventurous horsemen which simulates the national pastime of Afghanistan.<br/><br/>Teams of horsemen try to gain control of the Boz, traditionally a decapitated sheep or goat, and carry the Boz around a flagpole set away from the center of activity, and then bring the Boz back to a set circle or goal area on the field called the Hallal. A successfully deposited Boz within the Hallal scores a point for that team.<br/><br/>Objective: Score the most points by dropping the Boz into the Hallal after two halves of play. If at the end of the second half, there is a tie for most points, then a freeforall period is played with everyone (even those who did not have the most points), with the first player to score declared the winner of the game. Otherwise, the team with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Components: 40 action cards; 24 combo cards; 120 rider cards (5 chapandaz and 25 pakir for each of the four teams - Turkmen, Mongol, Tajik and Nuristani horsemen); one six-sided die; a Boz marker; and a Flagpole marker.<br/><br/>Each rider has individual statistics for strength, speed, tactics, and boz skill. Further, each team is designed to have a different flavor; the Turkmen tend to be the fastest riders, the Mongols the strongest, the Nuristani the best tacticians, and the Tajik are pretty well-rounded.<br/><br/>This game was an entry in the 2005 Buzkashi Game Design Contest held here on BoardGameGeek.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paradise Cab is an update of the game 'A Short Bus To Paradise' which used a standard deck and was part of 'Chief Herman's Next Big Thing'.<br/><br/>The game concerns filling your cabs up with tourists arriving from the a nearby cruise ship.  You compete with the other players who also have their own cabs.<br/><br/>Points are scored by loading a cab with a single color of passengers and successfulling leaving the loading dock (other players may have an opportunity to steal your passengers before you leave, since you may only leave when your cab is full).  However, the number of points scored is determined at the end of the game, when the most rare color of passenger is worth more points than the most common.<br/><br/>Your hand consists of cabs which you may play onto the loading dock.  The loading dock consists of everyones yet-to-leave cabs and any tourists waiting for a ride (either standing outside, or waiting inside a cab).<br/><br/>Whenever passengers are loaded into a cab, at the end of the turn new passengers are added.  The same color passengers always stand in a group outside together and may not be broken up later.<br/><br/>Passengers may be loaded into a cab if the entire group can fit within the remaining space inside the cab.  Additionally, when one is loading a group from the dock of a particular color, one can choose to also steal a group from a waiting unfull cab provided all passengers can fit within your cab.<br/><br/>Once a cab is full it immediately leaves.  If a group grows larger than 8 (the size of the largest cab) it is discarded (i.e. leaves on a bus).<br/><br/>",

Apparently the game is a tie-in to a roleplaying game, and a related series of boardgames (though it's not clear if the board games were published).<br/><br/>Components include a map and small cut-out counters and range/distance gauge all on glossy cardstock. The rules, mecha stats are on the back along with a postcard. (If you mail the postcard, you will lose half the board.) The board has no grid or hexes, so the game has a miniatures flavor. Rules are very short and simple with turn order being determined each phase by rolling and adding a mental stat. Mechs move and fight with ranged weapons, until losing all their hit points.<br/><br/>",

The Starting player can draw 2 cards.<br/><br/>Then he must roll all 5 dice and move forward with every single film company with exact one dice.<br/><br/>When a film company lands on a yello field a film is produced and starting with the player left from the starting player everyone could play cards from the same type of film and jokers. The player with the highest value on his cards gets the most points, the second... Nothing New ;)<br/><br/>Then anybody who played cards on this movie must discard one card and take back the others.<br/><br/>When all but one film company completed the first round on the board the last film company is discarded for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>On the point-track on the board are some special fields like<br/>Random Events (Event Cards), Bonus Points or Loose some points, so sometimes it could be better, to produce a bad film.<br/><br/>Game ends, if at least one player reaches the last field of the point-track. The Player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In order to achieve this, Pavilion Cricket consists of three separate games:<br/><br/>1. Domestic Cricket<br/>      This game covers domestic tour and one-day matches in England, Australia and the West Indies. A typical county match takes approx. 15 min. to play.<br/><br/>2. One-Day Cricket<br/>      This game covers One-day Internationals and Domestic finals. More detailed than number 1., a typical game takes approx. 60 min. to play.<br/><br/>3. Test match Cricket<br/>      This game provides a ball-by-ball simulation of a full five-day test match. As the most detailed of the three games, each day's play takes approx. 90 min. to play.<br/><br/>By using a combination of the three games, a full season or tour may be played on an ongoing basis.<br/><br/>The Teams Book provided details full squads of players for a broad range of teams; falling into three categories: Domestic, Current International (early 1990's, but later Team Books are available), and Modern Greats. The inclusion of the Modern Greats teams allows many previously unresolved debates to be tested. For example, how would the awesome South African side of 1970 perform against some of the great West Indian sides of the 1980's?<br/><br/>",

The same dashboard is used to track fuel usage, tire wear and brake wear.  Players also have a small hand of five cards that provide certain benefits when played.  Unlike the other two games, Checkered Flag simulates stock car racing.<br/><br/>Given that speeds are more constant in stock car racing, there are only three speed choices; 60, 120 and 180 miles per hour.  At the beginning of the race and after a pit stop, cars start off at 60.  In the two turns, the maximum speed is 120.  The turns drive the primary choices available, as some lanes provide a shorter path than others.  The choice lanes have a cost in fuel usage or tire wear.  The first car to complete three laps wins the race.<br/><br/>",

Once a player has a certificate, he draws and keeps (or discards) Loading cards until he has the exact amount of cargo required.<br/><br/>Once fully loaded, a player enters the second phase of the game -- sailing. A player under sail chooses a sail state (full, 3/4, 1/2, storm), then draws a card and checks the resulting combination on their sailing wheel. There is a Total Loss card which, if followed by a second draw indicating bad weather or other calamity, can damage the player's ship or force him out of the game entirely.<br/><br/>The first player to arrive safely in London is the winner.<br/><br/>No copyright date is given, but a London game collector asserts the vintage for this game to be of the early 1930s. The subject matter is consistent with this estimate, in light of the Great Grain Race of 1932, and the box style (i.e., small label fixed to larger cover) fits that of the 1930s.<br/><br/>",

If one occupies two of the adjoining cells, it is possible to attack (by a risk-like 1-1 die comparison) a token belonging to another player:  a successful attack replaces the token; an unsuccessful attack permits the defender to play an extra token using the two die rolls used during the attack.

The story line is open ended so that new plots can be added and old ones can change. New cards, tokens, and board layouts can be downloaded, and printed to be used with the game, keeping the players interested, waiting to see what comes next. The Machine isn't just a machine. It is for the players to find out what it is and what it does.<br/><br/>The first phase of the board game is to control it before it destroys everything. If you can accomplish that, then there is a chance to see what secrets it has....if you live. If you have any questions or would like to make a suggestion for a card or have an idea for The Machine, please contact me using the contact button. This game is supposed to be open, anything can happen, so if your ideas are well liked, they will be added to the game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Breakout From the Crimea covers General Wrangel's Russian White Army offensive from their trapped environs of the Crimea. Wrangel and his 25,000 men were evacuated from Novorisisk in March 1920, later reforming and re-supplied by the British. The Red 13th army was responsible for Wrangel's containment, as well as the Communist's attempt to break through to Sevastopol. In April, both sides tried in vain to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>Wrangel's forces were not numerically as strong as the 13th Army, but their morale, as well as skillful use of tanks and aircraft, returned the balance of power to their favor. By May 1920, Wrangel had up to 20 operational tanks and an equal number of DH9A bombers. Their tankers and pilots trained since March, and learned well the lessons taught by their British advisors in combined arms tactics.<br/><br/>During the battle, both sides fought tenaciously, but it was the use of tanks and aircraft that tipped the scales. The DH9A bombers faced little Red air opposition and ﬂew constant missions over the front. The tanks were massed into a hammering force for a breakthrough. All of these lessons were ignored by Wrangel's former superior, General Denikin, a year earlier. To supplement the attack, Wrangel also had several divisions land along the Black Sea coast, which was weakly held by the Communists. By June 12th, the Communist 13th Army lost 8,000 men and was ﬂeeing to the protection of the Dniepr River. Wrangel, lost nearly the same amount and exploiting the White victory was not easy. The Reds counter-attacked a few days later and brieﬂy retook Melitopol. Eventually, the<br/><br/>Whites recaptured the city and the lines became static, with neither side having the strength to overcome the other.<br/><br/>Components <br/>(High Flying dice edition):<br/><br/>    Four 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sections<br/>    Two sheets of 280 playing pieces<br/>    One Players' Aid Sheet<br/>    One, 12 page rule book<br/><br/><br/>(Firefight edition):<br/><br/>    one 11 x 17 map<br/>    280 DTP counters<br/><br/><br/>",

Periodically the outcome will be &quot;xx tape xx&quot; which means to activate the audio cassette tape included and listen to the &quot;play by play action&quot;.

During the course of the battle the Persian Prince Cyrus died which ended his revolt against his brother King Artaxerxes.  The famous retreat of the ten thousand Greek auxiliaries (which fought for Cyrus) was the result. The Greeks were led by the Athenian General Xenophon. This Greek army had to fight its way back to Greece through the hostile Persian Empire (from Mesopotamia and across Asia Minor). The Greek city of Sparta renewed the war against Persia in 399-394 BC.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player to get a complete set of cubes and cylinders, in each of the six colors, off the board and onto their twelve &quot;Home Spots&quot;.<br/><br/>This is a classic 2-Player, Abstract Strategy Game where each player is trying to be the first to get a complete set of rainbow colored cubes and cylinders past the square marked with a &quot;star&quot; and off onto their side of the board.<br/><br/>Each game is new and exciting because every game starts with an empty board and players take turns placing one piece at a time anywhere they want on the board except for the two &quot;Home Squares&quot; that have a &quot;star&quot; on them near each end of the board. It doesn't matter if they place a cube or a cylinder or even which color it is because no one player &quot;owns&quot; any piece until it is safely off of the board and onto one of their &quot;home spots&quot; on their side of the board.<br/><br/>Movement rules are pretty short and simple with the key fact being that if there are two pieces of a particular color and shape on the board, those pieces can move either once or twice and once they are<br/>down to one piece, they can only move once. The other main rule is that you MUST get your cube of a color off the board before you get the matching cylinder off the board.<br/><br/>The ability to jump other pieces and move either type of piece, the fact that no one &quot;owns&quot; pieces until they remove them from the board makes for a depth of strategy seen in very few games.<br/><br/>When you add the fact that there is no set starting position for the playing pieces, you will soon see that this game is almost &quot;Bottomless&quot; which gives it the ability to be studied and played for years, if not decades before anyone will ever figure out if there is an optimal setup<br/><br/>",

To obtain these points one looks at the end of each part what one recovered in his folds (folds makes during the part).<br/><br/>If the Black book of the Illusions is recovered, 12 points are marked. If one recovers more books than his adversary, one marks 9 points to have constituted the largest library. Are also marked points if the couple of his people is recovered, to have the largest population, if places are invested!<br/><br/>To make folds (even raised that in Scopa or Escoba), it is enough to pose a chart of its play on one or two charts of the same value on the table of play. For example one 8 of my play can take a chart 8 on the table of play some is the color. Or, one 8 of my play can take a chart of 6 and one of 2 on the table (6+2=8).<br/><br/>When all the charts in hand were played, each camp counts the points contained in the folds carried out, and then one sets out again for another game...<br/><br/>",

Zurich Airport has been branded as &quot;Unique Airport&quot; and this game is duly published by &quot;Verlag Unique&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board which represents sections of the airport departures area from check-in through to the fuselage of the plane itself. Each player has eight &quot;people&quot; and has to shepherd them through from the check-in desk, via a transit desk and a boarding desk. Each player has three action points each turn and four different actions are available. Actions include, besides moving a piece onwards, trading cards in for victory points. Victory points can be earned in various ways including visiting shops and the restaurant.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player embarks all eight pieces on the plane. The winner is the player with most victory points at this time.<br/><br/>The game is described in the Spielbox review as reminiscent of the Malefiz game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a set of rules and tools that allow games to be played with HearthSong's &quot;Pattern Blocks&quot; (PB) (not included). A set of PB consists of 250 flat wooden pieces in geometric shapes: hex, square, parallelogram, triangle, diamond, trapezoid.  The shapes are all the same scale and based on a fundamental angle of 30 degrees - like a super Tangram set.<br/><br/>The supporting bits include a protractor, a very nice spinner for selecting one of the PB shapes, three d6 (one 'regular', one with the six PB piece colors, and one with angles in 30 degree increments), Tangram and 'mandala' cue cards, and four sturdy game boards.  This equipment (and a PB set) lets you play the five games described in the rules.  The games are a mix of non-competitive pattern-making games, and races to be first to make specific shapes or patterns.  All are well thought out to teach basic geometric principles and/or excite the imagination (as if geometry wasn't exciting enough).<br/><br/>The pieces are well-made and are totally conducive to creating new games, the spinner and dice especially.  The skills being taught by the five supplied games are grade school level, but as games I think one or two of these could challenge many adults.  I'm tempted to order a PB set just to try some of them - and of course make beautiful designs in my spare time.  Building blocks of any kind are good clean fun.<br/><br/>",

There are five &quot;power spaces&quot; in the center of the board which the players are trying to occupy.  The remainder are either card spaces (of three different colors), go-again spaces (you get a second move if you land there) or free spaces.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of markers, and a single pawn which they can move around the board.  This is done by rolling a die and moving it that number of contiguous spaces.  When you land on a colored space, you collect a card of that color.  A set of three different colored cards are required to place markers on the power spaces.  Card sets are also used to attack other player's markers and capture them.<br/><br/>The winner is the one to occupy the five &quot;power spaces&quot; or to eliminate the other players in the game.<br/><br/>",

Face-down cards are inactive nodes and face-up cards are active nodes.<br/><br/>Play during a game is simultaneous; you and your opponent go through the same phases in a turn at the same time.  You  start your turn by gaining 1 power (plus any additional from active cards in your Juggernaut).  You use power to:<br/><br/>     Activate cards that require Power,<br/>     Increase the effectiveness of an attack or defense,<br/>     Maintain cards you want to keep<br/><br/><br/>After you gain power, you roll your Commander to see which card in your Juggernaut's matrix activates.  If you do not have an active card by the end of your command phase (this can happen if your Commander tries to activate a damaged sector, a neutralized card, or a card token), put an alert token on your deck. This means that your enemy&rsquo;s ground forces are approaching. Remove all alert tokens when you activate a damaged sector. If you have three or more alert tokens on your deck at the end of a round, enemy troops have infiltrated your juggernaut and taken control. You lose and your opponent wins.<br/><br/>Next, you and your opponent reveal your active cards and resolve them.  Once cards resolve, you discard them, draw cards to replace them, then play cards from your hand to fill in the ones that you discarded.<br/><br/>The mechanics are such that large Juggernauts with many-sided Commanders (d 12, d 20) have lots of &quot;hit points&quot;, but are easy to hit with attacks, difficult to get reliable results from, and vulnerable to accumulating alert tokens.  Small Juggernauts with few-sided Commanders (d4, d6) are difficult to hit and produce very predictable results, but have very few &quot;hit points&quot;.<br/><br/>Juggernauts is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 License.

        "description": "VERSUS TCG is based on the SNK vs Capcom - Card Fighters' Clash video game (for Neo Geo Pocket Color). A two player fighting game with 50 card decks and 5 card hand size. Each player gets 3000 HP, and you lose if you have 0 life.<br/><br/>The full release version uses the same artwork from the video game for most of its cards. This consists of SNK and Capcom character cards, as well as Action cards. There are also some additional SP rarity cards which have new artwork, although some reuse art from other games. There were no further expansions after this set (there are no cards based on Card Fighters' Clash 2).<br/><br/>There is also a &quot;Beta&quot; version which was sold prior and uses exclusively character artwork from different games. These are generally easier to find and has led to confusion over the years as to this game's relation to Card Fighters' Clash.<br/><br/>Although the rules are similar to Card Fighters' Clash and some cards are exactly the same, there are a number of differences, such as character cards which subtract SP to play, cards with different abilities, and a new &quot;star&quot; card ability (in addition to the circle, square, and triangle types from the video game).<br/><br/>",

In the beginning every player gets a number of tactical cards. Movement is decided by the dice and influenced by the cards. In the mountains the number rolled by the dice is divided by two. Cyclists can also encounter a flat tire (caused by rolling two 1's with the dice), if this happens to the team leader, he can be helped by a teammate if necessary.

        "description": "From the Three Monkey Games website:www.monkeypoker1.com<br/><br/>Once again, the geniuses at Three Monkey Games have turned a classic game on its ear and came up with something BRAND NEW! Introducing MonkeyWinks! The popular indoor game that is easy to learn for kids, and formidable enough to appeal to adults wanting a special challenge.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, MonkeyWinks is a game played with sets of small, thin discs (called winks) lying on a special felt mat. Players use a larger disc (called a squidger) to pop a smaller disc into flight by pressing down on one side of the smaller disc. The basic goal of an informal game (easily playable by young children) is to cause the smaller discs to land inside a pot or cup. The formal game has a more robust set of rules, goals, and strategies suitable to serious competition for adults and older children.<br/><br/>MonkeyWinks is interactive fun for all players, pros and beginners alike. However, MonkeyWinks is a lot more than just a flipping disc game. For example, the included &quot;Go Bananas&quot;&trade; cards incorporate random events and player changes inspired by everyday kids games. <br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.monkeypoker1.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.monkeypoker1.com</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gulf War is a Malaysian board game from 1990, using as its theme the then ongoing war in the Persian gulf. Its game mechanism is borrowed from An Qi (literally dark chess, because pieces are covered at the start and so unknown to the players: it is a game played using Xiangqi pieces). Each side has a number of pieces ranking from President down to Hostages or Civilians, and also Bombs, Fighter Planes and Oil-fields. Like An Qi (and for that matter games like LuZhanJunQi and Stratego), the pieces have a ranked order and higher ranked pieces eliminate lower ranked ones. Pieces start face-down and are randomly distributed in alternate colors on the 6X6 square grid that is the game board. Players take turn to expose pieces and once exposed, pieces may be moved one space orthogonally. Enemy pieces are eliminated by a higher or equal ranked piece moving on to them. There are special rules for specific pieces - the Assassin may eliminate the President, Bombs neutralize (i.e. both pieces get eliminated) all other pieces, capturing an Oil-field/Hostages/Civilians piece allows substitution of your own piece for a previously eliminated piece, etc. The Fighter Plane has the capture of the Pao (Cannon) in An Qi - just like in Xiangqi, it jumps over another piece to land on a distal piece and capture it. <br/>The game is won by the player who is able to capture both the opposing President and Vice-president.<br/><br/>The game has interesting details - one player takes the Iraqi side and the other is the Allied side. The President, Vice-president and Ally pieces are different and have pictures appropriate to the side (Saddam, Bush, Gaddfi and Thatcher all feature). Another difference is that the Iraqis have a Civilians piece but the Allied forces has a Hostages piece instead (in the game, they are equivalent). The board comes with two sides - one side has yellow and blue circles to show where the pieces go. The other has the same 6X6 grid superimposed on a background map showing the Persian gulf.<br/><br/>",

There's no fixed limit on the number of players, but one to four is a reasonable range.<br/><br/>Components include:<br/>7-page rulebook<br/>Hospital Map<br/>31 counters<br/>106 markers<br/>Game Display<br/>Two Doctor/Nurse Displays<br/>Patient Display<br/>Sequence of Play<br/>One six-sided die is required for play.<br/><br/>The Print-n-Play PDF can be found at:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=492\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wargamedownloads.com/item.php?item=492</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Burke's Law game by Transogram from 1963. Based on the hit ABC show starring Gene Barry.<br/><br/>The board shows the outline of two large houses - a country house and a city house. Inside each house are squares that are the possible rooms where the murder could have occurred.<br/><br/>There are three possible murder weapons - gun, knife or poison, and four tokens for each type.<br/><br/>There are 12 murder victims tokens - male or female under blankets that were each one of six different colors. The feet sticking out from under the blanket indicate the gender - small feet in little black heels for the females; large black dress shoes for the males.<br/><br/>There were 12 murderer tokens - people of different dress and hair colors - 6 possible clothing colors, 6 possible hair colors, two genders.<br/><br/>There were 7 types of cards with 6 in each - hair color, clothing color, gender, murder weapon, victim gender, victim blanket color, and location (country or city).<br/><br/>As players take turns, the murder rooms will gradually become populated with murders, victims and weapons - one of each in each room, and the players hands will gradually get one of each card type. The goal is to get the cards in your hand to exactly match one of the murder rooms. The first person to do so wins.<br/><br/>When you roll the number for a card type you *already* have in your hand, you get to pick up all the cards of that type still in the pile, look at all of them, and exchange any one of them for the one in your hand, if you want to do so.<br/><br/>",

        "description": " <br/>Corregidor  is a simulation of the two battles fought for Corregidor and the fortefied islands at the entrance to Manila Bay during World War II.  The first battles began with the bombing of the island in ealry 1942 and ended in May of that year with it's surrender.<br/> After General Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines, Corregidor once again became a target of invasion, both to avenge the loss three years before and to clear the mouth of Manila Bay to Allied shipping.<br/> Corregidor: Fall of a Fortress 1942/1945, includes two games. The first game recreates the Japanese bombardment and invasion in 1942 and the second simulates the American airborne invasion and reconquest in 1945.<br/><br/><br/>EXTENDED GAME DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>CORREGIDOR is played in successive game turns composed of alternate player turns during which the phasing player maneuvers his units and resolves combat in sequence. Turns consist of the Administrative Phases (reinforcement arrival, disruption removal, Fired marker removal), the Air Attack Phase (which includes airborne assault), first Player Turn (AA fire, bombardment, invasion, ground movement, and combat), and then the second Player Turn.<br/><br/>Some detail features of the game are tracking Japanese landing craft losses, American communications disruption, U.S. air and naval support points, unit disruption levels, and which artillery units have fired.<br/><br/>The six hexes adjacent to an undisrupted land unit constitute that unit&rsquo;s Zone of Control. Disrupted land units DO NOT have ZOCs, and therefore judicious use of support to disrupt enemy units allows the attacker to infiltrate through weak positions and to launch flanking attacks against defending units. This is critical because defending units are doubled and sometimes tripled by the rugged and the unique features on the maps, such as rough terrain, cliffs, elevation changes, tunnels, towns, and coast defense artillery emplacements.<br/><br/>In the 1942 scenarios, there is a cat-and-mouse game which develops between the Japanese artillery and air units versus the American artillery and anti-aircraft defenses. Aircraft need to designate the altitude at which they conduct bombing &ndash; the lower the attack level the more accurate the bombing, but also the more accurate the AA fire. Similarly, artillery which fires is more vulnerable to counter-battery fire and so making a bombardment attack must be weighed against the possibility of return fire.<br/><br/>In 1945, in addition to banzai options, the Japanese have the option to make suicide demolitions, which destroy the attacking unit but also damage adjacent units. There is a mechanism to occasionally compel such attacks, which not only forces some historicity but it also models the uncoordinated local Japanese command structure in 1945.<br/><br/>Some optional rules included:<br/><br/>Spike Rule - U.S. Batteries must be spiked when Japanese units come within two hexes to prevent them from being captured in usable condition. They may not be voluntarily destroyed until after a Japanese unit has landed on their island. Flip the battery over after the following U.S. Bombardment Phase. The unit may then move and fight normally.<br/><br/>Restored Batteries - Roll one die on the turn of the American invasion in 1945 for the surviving former U.S. batteries:<br/> 1 &ndash; Battery may fire normally.<br/> 2 &ndash; Battery sabotaged by POWs, gun crew fights as infantry.<br/>3-6 &ndash; Battery was never manned; remove from map.<br/><br/>Additional U.S. Batteries - Three 240mm howitzer batteries which were to be installed in 1922 actually arrive. One battery is deployed anywhere on Fort Frank, one on Fort Hughes, and one on Fort Mills (Corregidor).<br/><br/>Philippine Division Transferred - The 31st, 45th, and 57th Regiments are transferred to Corregidor prior to the fall of Bataan. Add them to the available U.S. forces in Scenario 11.1. Due to the effects of fighting on Bataan, plus short rations and disease, these units are deployed at reduced strength. As an additional option, they may be deployed at full strength to simulate these units being in better condition historically.<br/><br/>Itagaki Rule - Japanese defense commander Capt. Itagaki did not believe an airborne assault could be made on Corregidor. He was killed on Topside during the initial paradrop, while waiting to observe the amphibious assault for which he had prepared. Additionally, his central communications station was overrun very quickly by the paratroops. In this rule, he is killed and no Japanese unit may move until the first night turn.<br/><br/>U.S. Roving Batteries - During the campaign for Bataan and Corregidor, the U.S. created a number of &ldquo;roving batteries&rdquo; of 155mm guns by removing them from their emplacements and mounting them such that they could be moved about Corregidor.<br/><br/>U.S. Searchlights - The U.S. had several searchlight batteries on the Fortified Islands. This option forces the Japanese to actually expend the effort to destroy them and if they are not, they provide some advantage to the U.S. Player.<br/><br/>If a Japanese invasion or evacuation is occurring in a night turn and there is an active U.S. searchlight unit on the map, the U.S. Player receives a +2 die modifier (cumulative with any other DRMs) when firing on Japanese units in water hexes.<br/><br/>If a Japanese air bombardment is conducted at night, U.S. Anti-aircraft fire receives an additional +1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply; Japanese Bombardment rolls receive an additional -1 modifier to any other DRMs which apply.<br/><br/>Battery Way - Battery Way did not have a crew and was not operational until April 28. The U.S. might have activated this battery sooner. Roll at the beginning of the 0300 daily turn. The battery is active at full strength on a roll of 2 or 12. The battery becomes active automatically on Turn 65 if not activated sooner.<br/><br/><br/>Game scale<br/>Unit size: Generally artillery batteries and infantry platoons, with some company- and section-size units. Some individual naval units are depicted; air units are generally three aircraft per step.<br/><br/>Game turn: Movement and combat on the Fortified Islands maps is in three-hour turns in 1942, and two-hour daylight turns in 1945, with night turns representing five hours each. There are also daily turns to keep track of reinforcements as well as to frame the complete campaigns. By mutual agreement, players may skip any daily or hourly turn in which neither player plans to execute any movement, combat, or bombardment.<br/><br/>Hex scale: The scale of the Fortified Islands map is roughly 250 yards per hex; the scale of the Bataan map is roughly 1.25 miles per hex.<br/><br/>",

The game shows central and eastern Ukraine at 32 kilometers/20 miles per hex and 7-8 days per turn, and the armies involved at about 2,000 combat troops per unit, with additional logistical bases, armored trains, river gunboats, and arms stockpiles.<br/><br/>The design has been trimmed to focus on two key campaigns. *Fall of the Directory* shows the three-sided conflict at the end of 1918 and the first few months of 1919, where the Bolsheviks overthrew the Directory. *Revolt Against the Volunteer Army* shows the decisive campaigns in the last few months of 1919 and the beginning of 1920. *The Road to Freedom?* and *The Bolshevik Advance* present shorter parts of *Revolt.* *The Road to Freedom?* shows the Makhnovist campaign toward their home ground and into the Volunteer Army's rear areas, and the renewed uprising. *The Bolshevik Advance* shows the Volunteer Army retreating onto the map, and the Red Army chasing after them, with all sides scrambling to control key areas.<br/><br/>These scenarios represent campaigns which could have changed the course of the Ukrainian Civil War. In *Fall of the Directory,* the Directory could have defeated the Bolsheviks and quite possibly have retained independence. In *Revolt Against the Volunteer Army,* the Makhnovists could have won a stronger position and quite possibly have gained autonomy.<br/><br/>Note: The early drafts used larger hexes, larger units, and a smaller map than the current design. The design notes sometimes refer to &quot;Revolt Against the Volunteer Army&quot; as &quot;Makhno's Return.&quot;<br/><br/>",

There are two ways to capture the opponents soldiers, by custodian and by intervention. Custodian capturing is accomplished by ending one of your soldiers movement next to an opponent's while having one of your own on the opposite side as well. To capture by intervention you move one of your soldiers directly between two opposing soldiers and then capture both soldiers on each side. The edge of the board can be used to complete any line of three, capturing an opponent piece near the edge by either custodian or intervention.  The game is played until one opponent has no legal moves, which he then loses. A player also loses if he is reduced to two or less soldiers.<br/><br/>Hosted for online play by SuperDuperGames.ORG, where it is known as &quot;Mak-Yek&quot;.<br/><br/>",

They strive for simplicity while providing a feeling for the nature of battle during this time.<br/><br/>The rules are tuned to enable simulation of smaller scale actions rather than the large-scale battles that are more commonly the focus of miniatures rules but were more infrequent than the types of actions (raids, ambushes, assaults and patrols) these rules are suitable for.<br/><br/>Given this scale of focus, the rules are designed for play with 25mm figures but may be easily re-scaled for 15mm.  Rather than offer army lists as such, these rules instead provide lists of characteristics of various unit types (e.g., gendarmes, landsknechts, various nationalities of shot and pike) by period:  Tudor Wars, Italian Wars, Thirty Years War, English Civil Wars, and Louis XIV.  Along with these lists, there is a system for generating armies based on unit cost.  A representative scenario is provided for each of the five periods of the lists.<br/><br/>",

You roll the dice as many times as you want to earn 100 points, but rolling a piggy ends your turn and rolling two piggies takes away all the points accumulated up to that point in the game (at which point everyone else goes &quot;oink oink&quot; to show how greedy you were). The player then has to ante another chip into the pot.<br/><br/>Whoever gets to 100 points gets all the chips in the pot and is the winner for that round.<br/><br/>(Note that despite the involvement of Peter Marshall and the use of &quot;Celebrity&quot; in the title, Celebrity Piggy was never actually a game show.)<br/><br/>",

The game set was sold as a Battle Stadium plastic arena with two Power Winder launchers and two Spinja characters enclosed within the clam-shell designed arena. More characters, launchers, and an oversized playing arena were also made available separately. The objective of the game is to load your chosen character into the ratcheting launcher and each player would launch their top into the arena at the same time. The tops would ricochet off of each other until only one remained spinning or within the arena and that player was declared the winner.The tops are not customizable and are not associated with any other licensed properties.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scrimmage was invented by Chuck Eskridge, and David Williams.  It is a football game in which one side controls the offense and the other controls the defense. Movement is accomplished by dice rolls, with slower players have lower maximum movement capability. Each side has pieces (players) of varying strength and speed.  Any player can tackle any other player, but only players of equal or greater strength can block opposing players.  The offense sets up, and then the defense, with a twist: the defense does not know whether the offense is running a passing play or a running play. (The choice is disclosed after the play starts.) If it is a passing play, the pass can be thrown to a designated grid but only after the play has had time to develop.  If a play breaks down, the offensive player draws a card to determine whether he can recover.<br/><br/>The passing mechanism works wonderfully: the offense places two men downfield in one of several grids, and secretly chooses a card identifying the grid to which the pass will be made. Each team then moves players (including the potential receivers) with the roll of the dice. When the pass is made, the offense chooses which square in the grid the pass will go to. The choice of squares determines how easy it is for the receiver and the defensive back(s) to get to the square to which the pass is made: if the receiver gets to the square and the back does not, the pass is complete.  If the back gets to the square and the receiver does not, the pass is intercepted.  If both get to the square, the pass is incomplete.<br/><br/>The running game and the pass rush depend on the the success of the blockers and the defensive line.  There is luck in the dice rolls, of course, but the luck evens out over the course of the game and a good play can survive a little bad luck.  Card drawing can also be important. Sometimes tacklers reach the ball carrier but fail to make the tackle, or make the tackle and force a fumble, which can be recovered by either the offense of defense.<br/><br/>This is one of the few games non-simulation football games (i.e., not strat-o-matic football or its cousins) that really feels like you are playing football.  You choose your play in advance, and, like real football, sometimes it works as planned, sometimes it fails, and sometimes you have to improvise during the course of the play.<br/><br/>Only about 800 copies of the game were sold, primarily in game stores in the South.  Two versions were created, the original version and a second version that included an optional &quot;monster man&quot; with good speed and power.<br/><br/>This game is not to be confused with the SPI game of the same name-- and almost the same year.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BSO FOOTBALL<br/>THE HISTORY OF PRO FOOTBALL<br/><br/>For fans of Tabletop Sports games, and Football, here is one of, if not THE, best solitaire play football card/board game ever. BSO FOOTBALL provides its players with remarkable statistical accuracy in almost every category, in the most accessible, playable form in the game industry. There&rsquo;s no trying to outguess yourself on offense or defense. You just call the play and roll the dice (which you provide). Player Cards, one for every offensive player on the team, the Defensive Ratings on the Team Charts, and the Results Tables do the rest.<br/><br/>Check the sample Player Cards, above, to see how players are rated.<br/><br/>The Team Charts provide the ratings/information for Defense, Interceptions, Clutch Play,  Fumbles, Penalties, and the full range of Returns and Kicking details. They also have Extra Information on Special and Unusual plays that team used. The Charts include Rushing, Pass Completion, Pass Gain and Return, Out-of-Bounds, Medium and Long Gains, Kickoff (including Onside Kicks), Punting (including Blocked Kicks), and a full range of Penalties.<br/><br/>The Game Clock is also extremely accurate, with each quarter using 180 &ldquo;points&rdquo;, each point equal to 5 seconds. A normal play would use 8 points, but an incomplete pass or Time Out only 1.<br/><br/>The first edition of BSO FOOTBALL brings you one of the greatest seasons in the History of Football, 1958, with the famous overtime Championship game between the Colts and the Giants. In the East the Giants and the Cleveland Browns, led by the great Jim Brown, had to use a playoff game to determine the winner, and the Steelers, led by the veteran Bobby Layne, were not that far behind. In the West, the Colts beat out both the Bears and Rams by one game.<br/><br/>Some of Pro Football&rsquo;s greats are present:  Ollie Matson, Norm Van Brocklin, Johnny Unitas, Jon Arnett, Y. A. Tittle, and the first glimpses of Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, and Paul Hornung, all playing for one of the worst Green Bay teams ever (1-10-1)! And wait&rsquo;ll you see the average yards per pass catch!  Steeler rookie, Jimmy Orr, led the league with 27.6, with many others not far behind.<br/><br/>For gamers who like to play entire seasons and revel in great statistical accuracy, BSO FOOTBALL is unbeatable. And, if you wish, there are special rules for face-to-face play, which use extended play calling (although, to be up front, that is not the game&rsquo;s strong point).<br/><br/>player cards:  150<br/>team cards&rdquo;  12<br/>others:  Charts, Schedules, Rules<br/>cost:  $14 US; $15 Canada; $17 Pacific<br/><br/>",

The subject matter abstractly &amp; comically (for 1939, that is!) portrays the blackout period in England during the German bombing raids of early World War two.<br/>The pack of cards consist of five suits (Silhouettes, Fashions, Search-Lights, Views, &amp; Lights)and are numbered from two to twelve (minus the numbers six and nine)for the purpose of scoring. Additionally there five Black Out cards that provide the blocking element of the game and are valued at one point.<br/>Play consists of each player in turn playing a card from hand to table, face up, from the hand dealt (six cards for up to three players and five cards for four or five players). Each player builds a personal collection by adding either an identical number or suit to the card previously played. If a player is unable to do so, a card must be taken into the hand from the stock of cards not dealt. There is a blocking element of play by the use of Black Out cards which may be placed on an opponents pile in order to stop cards from being played on that pile and forces the player to play cards on other players piles. <br/>The first player to play all cards ends the round and each players played cards are scored. The game is played up to 200 points.<br/><br/>",

Three groups of scenarios (Gulfs and Straits, Coastal Seas, Open Ocean) depict likely places of conflict and participants. Silhouette type counters cover the major combatants of over a dozen nations. Back printing has been used to conceal a unit&rsquo;s identity and attack values. Surface effect ships and semi-submerged platforms depict future naval trends. Ranged attacks, air detection zones, NTDS, and<br/>optional rules covering weather in all the world&rsquo;s oceans and systems reliability allow players to realistically simulate modern naval combat.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The designer noted: &quot;This one was supposed to be the simple game of the three for that year. It was, and was perhaps too simple. With only air and surface elements represented, it was a clean and fast game of modern naval combat, but not the full story. It was fast and violent though, and sold out quickly. We redid the concept (much more to my satisfaction) some years later with Battle Stations.&quot;<br/><br/>Raketny Kreyser is the rarest of the Simulation Canada board games; only 550 were printed.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 12 minutes<br/>Hex: 1 nautical mile / 1.8 kilometers<br/>Units: Individual ships or three aircraft<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 18&quot; featureless blue mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (255 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12-page Raketny Kreyser rules booklet (5.5&quot;x8.5&quot;)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Who is the Salvan&egrave;l?<br/>The Salvan&egrave;l is a goblin that frequently appears in the legends of Trentino, in northern Italy. Until not many decades ago, in every valley you could find someone who said they had seen the Salvan&egrave;l, even though actually encountering him was extremely unlikely.<br/>They described him as a small man, boyish-looking, and always with some red feature on him: a hat, clothes or hair.<br/><br/>This time the Salvan&egrave;l, running to and fro, has left his magical tracks everywhere. Anyone who treads on them by mistake is bound to get lost - and after much wandering, finds himself back where he started. Now you are lost in the wood too!<br/>To get back home you must make three good moves to reconstruct a path that will take you out of the wood. But the goblin will also help you, if you meet him!<br/><br/>At the beginning of every turn, the guide picks a colored card. This card has two effects:<br/>1-The Salvan&egrave;l immediately moves toward the border indicated by the card, and if he meets a player... He immediately gains an extra turn!<br/>2-The player indicated by the card plays his turn... And if he meets the Salvan&egrave;l... He plays again!<br/><br/>In every turn, players can use one of these moves:<br/>1-Spin:choose a tile and rotate it in any direction you like<br/>2-Puff of Wind: move one or more tiles of a horizontal or vertical line<br/>3-Jump: move your token from the tile where it is to another one next to it.<br/><br/>The first player who jumps out of any tile on the side of his colour wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players get paid for delivering freight. The object of the game is to be the first player to pay for his or her truck, that is, to reach $40,000.00.<br/><br/>Players select from a hand of load sheets, which indicate i) where a player picks up a load, ii) where that load is to be delivered, iii) the fee for delivering the load, and iv) the bonus fee if the load is delivered within a certain number of days. A day is a player's turn. The roll of a die determines how far a player may travel on his turn. A player's truck may carry up to two loads at one time.<br/><br/>The key to the game is in the efficient use of the load sheets. For example, do you take just one load across country and go for that big bonus, or do you double up on the loads, which will slow you down and probably cost you a bonus, but will give you an extra payday? You also try to minimize the travel time in which the truck is empty by arranging for the next pick up to be near the just-reached destination.<br/><br/>",

Here you fight the undead with your skill.<br/><br/>Up to four players explore the crypt of count Gramwuml in search for treasure. Behind every door there's fear: Go to the arena and fight. Playing a cryptrunner, thief, fighter or magician, you try to beat the other players. But even when there's no other player, Gruftmeister Adventure can be played as a solo-adventure.<br/><br/>Players start at the skeleton of count Gramwuml. From there they explore the crypt room by room, adding new floor tiles. Use actions to explore the crypt, open doors, fight undead or cast spells. Once you encounter a closed door or a coffin, you go to the arena and fight with your skills. A real challenge for both younger and older players. Finally no more orgies of throwing dice.<br/><br/>Gruftmeister Adventure is a totally new game, you don't need an older version of Gruftmeister. Everything needed for the adventure is included: 18 floor-tiles for all-new adventures every time, 140 cards for monsters, treasures, doors, spells, more than 100 wooden pieces, the fighting arena with all the parts for thrilling duels.&quot;<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Gruftmeister<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;This simple card and dice miniature game is based off of the very original Dungeons and Dragons, back in the days of Chainmail and the Classic Dungeons and Dragons boxed set. If the game rules seem a bit simple and occasionally clumsy, they are supposed to be. That was the charm of the &lsquo;Proto-D&amp;D&rsquo; fantasy miniature wargaming.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;This game can be played with 1 to 3 players. For solo play, this is a simple solitaire adventure system for &lsquo;proto-D&amp;D&rsquo; fantasy miniature battles. For two to three players, it becomes a competition to survive (be warned that multiplayer games can get very lengthy; it&rsquo;s best to take this game in sessions like you would a modern D&amp;D adventure, breaking between dungeon levels.)&rdquo;<br/><br/>Each dungeon level uses a different deck of cards composed of the types of monsters found on that level of the dungeon. On each turn the player draws the top card from the deck for the dungeon level his character is on and fights the monster. If the player&rsquo;s character is killed, the player is out of the game. If the monster is defeated, the player receives gold and experience points. A certain number of experience points is required to advance to the lower dungeon levels.<br/><br/>",

That card is called, of course, a &quot;Weapon of M*A*S Destruction&quot; (we warned you).<br/><br/>That is a very powerful card, so before you are allowed to play it, you must announce it.  If opponent has a Search card, he gets to search some of your cards to try to find it and remove it.  The search card is called, of course, a &quot;Search for Weapon of M*A*S Destruction&quot; card. Cute.<br/><br/>The search mechanics are interesting.  Players play to win battles and gain Respect Points.  When you find Weapons of M*A*S Destruction, you might gain respect (depending on which search card you have).  When you don't find Weapons of M*A*S Destruction (depending on the card) you could &quot;lose all your Respect.&quot;  (ok, no more puns).<br/><br/>Players take turns attacking, choosing between 3 types of attacks.  Each  card has a &quot;weak spot&quot; on it.  During one phase of the game players try to name the weak spot of opponent's M*A*S -- If they do it is destroyed.  (These &quot;shots&quot; at opponent's cards are called &quot;long shots&quot;).   Battles are usually &quot;2 on 2&quot; with extra &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;search&quot; cards.  Cards are awarded to each player based on rules, mostly &quot;who won the attack?&quot;<br/><br/>There is a Draw Phase, a &quot;Deploy &amp; Destroy phase&quot; a &quot;Long Shot&quot; Phase, and an<br/>&quot;Attack&quot; Phase.  After the Draw Phase, each of the 3 remaing phases provides <br/>interesting and different types of action.

        "description": "The object of Fumbly Pegs is to get one of the colored pegs in the middle of the group each round so that at the end of all rounds you will have the most points. This is accomplished by obtaining a set of 4 or 6 matching colored cards (depending on the size of the group either one or two decks will be used) as they travel around the circle in a clockwise movement. Each deck contains 10 sets of 4 matching colored cards, one wild card, and one black card.<br/><br/>The center of the table contains one less peg than the number of players. Once anyone in the circle has a set they can grab a peg &ndash; after that it&rsquo;s a free-for-all to get one of the colored pegs before they&rsquo;re gone whether you have a set or not. Each peg is worth a different point value and one player will be left empty-handed each round, so you&rsquo;ve gotta be fast to get one! Each player earns points depending on the color of the peg they grabbed. The player without a peg earns no points. Players who have unused wild cards or black cards in their hand at the end of the round lose points. At the end of all rounds the score pad will be full and whichever player has the most points is victorious!<br/><br/>More information about Fumbly Pegs can be found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.fumblypegs.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.fumblypegs.com</a><br/><br/>",

The first card of the first round is the common start point, the other 5 are the stations each teams must connect in the order of their choice. Each team's last station is its next starting point, and the original start is the common end point of the last round.<br/>Each team starts with a credit which is needed to buy the transport- black for rails, red for streets, blue for waterways and green for air transport. Prices are rolled for before each round. Also, each round has an accident field that is secretly determined beforehand and often requires re-building a section of the route. Rails, roads and waterways must follow the lines printed on the board, while air transport always takes the shortest possible route.<br/>Teams compete to complete the route first (to get a bonus) and as effectively (=cheaply) as possible. The team with most cash at the end of round 3 wins.<br/><br/>",

Also, each player have some money at his disposal.<br/><br/>The cards are divided, being the numbers used to determine coordinates (black are the lines and red the columns)on the grid and the figures to represent buying power of the players.<br/><br/>In his turn, a player plays two cards corresponding to a coordinate in the grid. If that square is empty, he take possession of it, if that square belongs to another player, he must pay a rent to that player, and after that, has a chance to buy that square with his figures cards. If the square is him own, he mortgage that square. If a square is mortgaged twice, that player loses its possession.<br/><br/>Game ends when a player can not pay a rent.

        "description": "Anomalies of Love is a game about love and relationships. The game starts when players meet their special someone. As they get to know each other better they can focus on the 8 things that their relationship can rely on, the things that hold the couple together &ndash; matching sense of humour, mutual outdoor hobbies, mutual intellectual hobbies, similar values, mutual dreams for the future, memories the couple have together, matching music taste and of course sex. The more they find in common in each other the more points they get.<br/><br/>The game proceeds by players placing tiles on the board. Both the tiles and game board have symbols for these 8 things that relationships can consist of and players try to match the symbols on tiles to those in game board.<br/><br/>However every tile also holds an evil promise. A chance for mistrust, a black heart that represents all the bad things in relationships. As player's tiles approach one another these black hearts become both something that jepardise your own relationship, but those of others too. If two black hearts are placed next to one another, then the one that was there first gets turned 45 degrees. If it can't do that or gets disconnected from the structure the tile is removed and relationship just lost some of its charm. In other words the way you place those black hearts at the beginning of the game can matter a lot. You need to build your relationship to withstand the bad times &ndash; make it into something so strong that even when shaked, it won't break.<br/><br/>There is also Agenda -cards that can alter the strategy each players has. In the end the player who has the most perfect love life will win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Footsteps of the Prophet is a game about the early succession to Khalifa, each player vying for control of Islam in the years after Muhammad's death.  it is a game of conflict, diplomacy, treachery and a little bit of luck, for two to six players who have anywhere between fifteen minutes to an hour to kill, depending on how many players there are and how cutthroat they are about their strategy.  Someone must take on the role of Khalifa, leading the faith. Can you unite the squabbling clans, pummel the Persians, beat back the Byzantines and unite the Arabian Peninsula?<br/><br/>More importantly, can you do it in spite of the other players?<br/><br/>Since only six of the first twelve Khalifa died of natural causes, there are frequent openings for the position. Based on historical events and people, winning takes strategy, diplomacy, and an occasional bit of treachery. The game is notable in that it has both English and Arabic-native versions, making it one of very few US games designed expressely for an Arabic-speaking audience.<br/><br/>The game includes 120 cards, quick-start rules, full rule book with historical details on the people, places and events of the time (632 CE), reference map and player aid sheet.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, in initiative order (roll 1d10) creatures move (a distance determined by species), attack one another (opposed d10 rolls adding attack &amp; defence per species), suffer the consequences (damage reduces characteristics), attempt to spot other creatures (sensory acuity by species) and test for panic if attacked or hurt (panic rating, again, by species, less aggressive species panic more easily. Rules on ambushes, charges and some very simple terrain effects are included, as are rules for time-travelling human intervention - either 'cave men' or modern hunters.<br/><br/>51 species of ancient creatures are detailed (all of which are available in 10mm scale metal miniatures from the publisher), along with variously armed humans and their vehicles (with ranged combat rules). A number of possible scenario suggestions is included. The rules are simple by figures gaming standards, but fairly complete as a combat game. Graphics are very basic, and the rulebook is 24 pages of A4 stapled with a clear plastic cover.<br/><br/>UPDATE: as of the end of 2020, the latest version, while seeming to have the same rules, presentation, and physical format, has a MASSIVELY expanded list of creatures, close to 600 of them! These now cover everything from the Cambrian (admittedly with only one entry!) to the Tertiary. Accordingly, page count has increased to 44.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "平安 (Heian) is a short two-player game set in Heian era Japan (9th to 12th centuries). Some of the characteristics of that era that are somehow worked into the design of the game are the hunger for wood that had to be brought in from farther and farther to the new capital; the struggles with the Emishi in the north-east; and the troubles of financing both.<br/><br/>In the game, player build cities, parts of the capital Heian, and fight with the Emishi who occupy the north-east. Cities need wood to be built and that wood needs to be brought in from previously built cities. Cities also produce wood, and in some cases also metals. Forests can be cut to produce building timber only once, however. In fact, some areas that were known for their good timber before the Heian era, only produced firewood and charcoal at the end of the period. Hence, during the game, Japan slowly gets deforested and urbanized and resources are getting increasingly scarce. The player that managed to build and transport most efficiently and that built the most cities and the most (and best) buildings in the capital wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is intended to replicate the feel of space combat as it appears on the new Battlestar Galactica show that airs weekly on the SciFi channel.<br/><br/>To play the game you will need:<br/>- Miniatures or counters to represent the spaceships<br/>- Miniatures or counters to represent missiles and torpedoes (a lot of them!)<br/>- Several each of six sided, eight sided, ten sided, and twelve sided dice (d6,d8,d10,d12)<br/>Note: In some places you will be required to roll one or more d9&rsquo;s. To roll a d9, roll a d10 normally, but treat the 10 as a zero.<br/>- Printouts of the ship combat record for each ship participating in the battle<br/>- A battle mat marked in hexes large enough to accommodate your ship models/counters.<br/><br/>The game is designed to be simple to learn and fast paced, yet still provide an engaging tactical experience that will provide countless hours of fun.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to destroy your enemy&rsquo;s fleet. The cylons accomplish that by hanging back with their carriers and sending wave after wave of missiles and fighters at the colonial fleet, possibly accompanied by Cylon battleships, trying to overwhelm the Colonial defenses.<br/><br/>Conversely, the colonials want to get in as close as possible to the cylon base carriers so that they can pound them into so much scrap with their powerful rail guns.<br/>You may also wish to create scenarios with other objectives as well, perhaps based on sequences from the show, such as the battle at Ragnar Station, or simply scenarios you dream up yourself.<br/><br/>",

Gustav Vasa rules in Sweden while Christian III is about to ascend the throne of Denmark under the looming clouds of a civil war.<br/><br/>In Crowns of the North, you play as a noble family through 320 years of Scandinavian history in a game of power struggle and development. The players use resources (produced by provinces) and silver to purchase new provinces, develop Scandinavia by enacting new laws and precipitating historical events, and build famous historical buildings. Over the course of the game, the players may also become the patron of famous historical characters such as Ludvig Holberg, Carl von Linne, and Tycho Brahe. But the threat of war is ever present: Russia, Poland/Prussia and the German Principalities all have their sights on Scandinavia and both Sweden-Finland and Denmark-Norway have ambitions of making the Baltic their personal domain.<br/><br/>Will Sweden rise to power on the back of the Thirty Years war? Will Karl XII create a greater Swedish empire or die of a musket ball through the temple at some obscure Norwegian fortress? Can the Russian bear be stopped, or will Finland once again fall to the Tsar of Russia? Which nation will rule the North?

George C. Marshall considered a Japanese attempt to damage or destroy the Panama Canal to be the likely opening move of a war in the Pacific, making the sea lanes around Tierra del Fuego vital to the Allied war effort.<br/><br/>Strait of Magellan is a supplement for the Second World War at Sea series. There are ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have taken place in these waters, but ultimately did not.

        "description": "Gameplay is the same as the original Monopoly except:<br/>1.You have either one or two branches instead of houses and motels.<br/>2.Any three businesses in a row improves rent by 3x even if improved with a branch.<br/><br/>Origin:<br/>David A. Colbert is a board game designer and puzzle and game manufacturer. An advertising executive, he came up with the idea of marketing a real estate trading game called Hometown Monopoly in which the properties on the board that are purchased and rented would be actual businesses in the hometown of the person purchasing the game. He produced his first game in 1980 for the city of Oshkosh, Wisconsin. He and a good friend, Arnold Miller of La Crescent, Minnesota held the copyrights and trademarks for the Hometown Monopoly series of boardgames through their holding company, Milco, Inc. Colbert incorporated Citigames of America, Inc. in 1982, and with that company and Hometown Productions, both Milco licensees,  went on to produce localized monopoly games for over 500 cities and towns in the United States and Canada. In 1985, Colbert developed Hometown Trivia and began to market that series of board games through Colbert Productions and Butler Games, Ltd. In 1986, Colbert marketed Puzzlement, a localized jigsaw puzzle that was sold only in Oshkosh and is a rare find today.<br/>   In 1988, Colbert sold the Trademark rights to the name Hometown Monopoly to Parker Brothers, Inc., producer of the famous MONOPOLY board game, licensing back from them the right to continue to produce his games in the cities and towns where he had developed versions of that game. In 1996, Colbert produced his last Hometown Monopoly game, fittingly an updated version of his original Oshkosh Monopoly.<br/>   Also in 1996, Colbert shifted his publishing focus from board games to magazines, building a second successful business with The Apartment Directory and The Builders Guide, both magazines serving the Fox Valley region of Wisconsin.<br/>   Colbert's Hometown Monopoly games for Baltimore and Washington DC led to his involvement with the nation-wide unification event, Hands Across America, which earned him an invitation to President Ronald Reagan's Second Inaugural Ball.<br/>    Today, David A. Colbert is retired and lives in West Palm Beach,<br/><br/>",

Scale of the game is 25m per hex, and is scalable to any size hex players want based on the models or chits used.<br/><br/>This rule set provides levels of detail that are missing from most typical miniatures games, as the focus is on individual units rather than squads of units.  Some rule details include movement allowances for ground and space combat, piloting skills and costs, build costs, multiple weapons and affects, firing arcs, fields of vision, damage tracking, etc.<br/><br/>The game can easily be played on a typical hex grid with chits or minis, or scaled up to play with models of any size.  Existing sets like Heroscape terrain work well for miniature scale models.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trimok is a new board game for two, developed from the old Japanese game jan-ken-pon (scissors paper rock).<br/>The idea of the game<br/><br/>Two players (White and Black) play against each others and they try to capture all opponent's pieces with their own pieces. There are three kinds of pieces: scissors, paper and rock. The capture-rules for White are as follows: white scissors take black paper, white paper take black rock and white rock take black scissors. Correspondingly the capture-rules for Black: black scissors take white paper, black paper take white rock and black rock take white scissors.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the game each player has four pieces of each kind, i.e. 12 pieces in all. The board is divided into 6 by 6 squares and the pieces are set according to figure 1. The game is over, when other player wins the game or the players agree on a draw. The player wins the game, when he/she captures the other player's last piece or when the other player cannot move any piece.<br/><br/>The moves<br/>Each player, in turns, moves one piece. The White player starts the game. Every piece can be moved in the same way: one square at a time in any direction on the board, i.e. forwards, backwards, to the sides and also diagonally forwards and backwards. If a piece does not capture another piece within a move, it can be moved only to an empty square.<br/><br/>In the game is one special move, called return-move: When a piece has made it to the opponent's side to the last row, it can be moved back on some of the next turns, to its own side's first row, to the same column's or adjacent column's empty square. (There is at most three possible squares for a return-move.) When making a return-move, the piece can be exchanged for a piece that is not currently on the board. Making the return-move the piece can not capture other pieces. Examples of possible moves and return-moves are presented in figure 2.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:<br/><br/>Card Cricket was the result of 2 1/1 years' painstaking research into the statistical records of cricket matches going back several years. But it had its lighter side, too. It involved many pleasant days spent watching actual matches - recording every single detail of the games so that Card Cricket would be as authentic as possible.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>i) Two packs of cards as follows: <br/>a) Bowling pack (110 cards)<br/>b) Batting pack (108 cards)<br/>ii) A scoring pad which resembles an ordinary cricket score book<br/>iii) A special die - 5 faces showing out and 1 face showing 'not out'.<br/>iv) A chart showing by means of asterisks which batting shots can be played against the various types of balls that can be bowled<br/>v) A loose scoring sheet which serves as an example of how to score with instructions printed on the back.<br/><br/>This is a mechanically simple cricket simulation game. You are expected to 'know' cricket (but why else would you be playing it?), and thus how to arrange and score matches, etc. Each player plays one team (obviously if more than two people are playing the game, they can take the part of different players in the cricket match).<br/><br/>The mechanism is one of hand management. The bowler picks 6 random cards for the balls in the over, which he can play in any order. The batsman has a number of batting cards which varies according to which number he is batting at. The bowler plays a card (a ball) and the batsman plays a card against that ball. If the batting card is a valid stoke for that ball (a cover drive for a half volley outside off stump, a sweep to a googly, etc), then the outcome is as printed on the batting card sometimes runs, but often just fielded. If the batting card is not a valid stroke for the ball bowled, then the batsman is likely to be out (there are appeals and not outs using the die). If he is not out, the batsman replenishes his hand, and the next ball is bowled.<br/><br/>",

The storyteller now weaves a story, arranging the cards in whatever order helps tell the best story.<br/><br/>After the story has been told, the other players rate it from zero to five. The storyteller function then passes to the next player, with each storyteller drawing new Aliases and Activites and telling stories for a predetermined number of rounds.

Tune in <br/>next Time Their Ideas) is a card game for 2-5 players for an hour or so, where players are the managers of new soap operas during a trial period: the player whose show draws the highest audience (as determined by what events occur on their soap opera and which characters each involves) will go on to the main season!  Just like real soap operas, the twists and turns of the plots in the game can be unbelievable, outlandish, tragic or funny.<br/><br/>There are two main decks in the game: Events and Characters. Every Event lists what types of characters can be involved and have a point value. Every Character has a sex, a sexual orientation, a point value, and a typecast (a special rule that applies to that character). The strategy lies in developing your soap opera to allow more exciting events as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Soaps is not a spoof on any particular show: it mocks all TV drama. No specific knowledge is required.<br/><br/>The game is quite simple: an 8-year-old could PLAY it, but a parent might not be pleased if the child's show were to feature adultery, homosexuality, murder, etc.<br/><br/>",

The &quot;Holder&quot; holds the ends of the brick firmly, using two hands, so that its center is exposed. Face the &quot;Chopper&quot; and place the brick about chest high, holding it away from your body. This is the &quot;Ready&quot; position. As the &quot;Chopper&quot;, face the &quot;Holder&quot; and place your chopping hand lightly over the exposed brick to aim. Then lift your hand to touch your ear. IMPORTANT - If you are RIGHT handed, use your LEFT hand - and if you are LEFT handed, use your RIGHT hand for the chopping hand.<br/>TO PLAY: 1) The &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; to begin the contest. After announcing &quot;Ready&quot;, the &quot;Holder&quot; may fake, pull the brick aside, or do anything to try to fool his opponent, the &quot;Chopper&quot;, into committing himself. He must always return the brick to the &quot;Ready&quot; position to give the &quot;Chopper&quot; a chance to strike again. After each point is made the &quot;Holder&quot; must announce &quot;Ready&quot; before a new strike can be made. 2) The &quot;Chopper&quot; MUST KEEP HIS HAND AGAINST HIS EAR UNTIL he is READY TO CHOP. He can fake - but must always keep his hand touching the ear during the fake. Once he has started a chop, taking his hand from his ear, he must CONTINUE the chop and try to hit the brick.<br/>TO SCORE: The &quot;CHOPPER&quot; scores one point if he strikes the brick. The &quot;HOLDER&quot; scores one point if the &quot;Chopper&quot; misses the brick.<br/>After every 5 tries the players change places. The first one to score 11 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

If you have no cards that match the rank or element (suit) of the top card of the discard pile, you can't play a card and have to draw one instead. Special cards like Skip, Draw, Exchange, Reverse, and Dragons will change gameplay regularly making for an exciting new spin on the classic.<br/><br/>Cards are printed with both English and Kanji, making for a learning experience while you play, a pronounciation guide is included in the rulebook as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "VEX - Exciting Game of Strategy<br/><br/>Each player (2 or 4 may play) attempts to line up 5 pieces of the same color, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.<br/><br/>RULES OF PLAY:<br/><br/>1. Each player selects a group of like-colored pieces and gathers his pieces to his position.<br/><br/>2. The group picks a Starter who begins the hand by placing one of his pieces near the center of a table or a flat playing area.  After the first hand, the winner of each hand may be the Starter for the next hand. Action then continues around the playing area to the Starter's left, with each player placing one of his pieces on the playing area.<br/><br/>3. EACH PIECE THAT IS PLACED ON THE TABLE OR PLAYING AREA MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE COMPLETE SIDE TOUCHING ONE COMPLETE SIDE OF AT LEAST ONE OTHER PIECE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN PLAYED!<br/><br/>4. A player may place a piece next to any other piece, thus blocking the other players' attempts to win.<br/><br/>5. Players may warn each other that someone is about to win, but the game is especially exciting if the players agree not to warn each other.<br/><br/>6. The first person to win 5 hands wins the game.  If the group wishes, a time limit may be set, and the player who wins the most hands in that time wins the game.<br/><br/>7. If all the pieces are played, but no one has won, the winner is the one who has the most groups of 4 pieces, or the hand may be replayed.<br/><br/>",

(The champion is the popular bishop/knight compound, but obviously with a hexagonal definition.)<br/>     Each player has ten pawns to protect the nine power pieces from wall to wall.<br/>     It features an angular, but familiar redesign of the pieces, each of which bears a hexagonal base.<br/><br/><br/>The game is designed to be portable, with a roll-up board, a drawstring bag for each player's pieces, and a courier tube of a case for the whole thing.<br/><br/>",

(Ties count for nobody.) A player winning two tricks wins the round and gets a point. The first one to achieve 5 points is the winner. At certain points players can &quot;put&quot;, then opponents can give up or &quot;see&quot; - if opponents choose the latter, then the winner of that round instantly wins the whole game.<br/><br/>The 19th century version of the game allows players to resign a hand, giving a point to their opponent. It could also be played four-handed, between two pairs of partners.<br/><br/>Some sources allow three players. In his Penguin Book of Card Games, David Parlett speculates that if all three players win one trick then nothing is scored, and that if one player puts, both of the opponents agree whether to concede or play out.<br/><br/>",

Roberts Award: Best Historical or Scenario Magazine Article, By Mr. Frank Watson<br/><br/><br/><br/>(from the introduction:)Enter Rommel is a scenario suitable for use with Western Desert of &quot;War in the Desert.&quot; Players may use either the original Western Desert rules or the later &quot;War in the Desert&quot; rules ... several additional rules and rule variations are included. Use of the special scenario rules is mandatory, while you may use the additional option rules as you see fit. However, be warned that the scenario was developed and play-balanced using all the additional rules.<br/><br/>Optionally, Enter Rommel can be used as an alternate starting point for a complete Western Desert or &quot;War in the Desert&quot; campaign game. For this reason, the Allied Order of Battle includes units in Gibraltar and Iraq. Disregard the setup of these units unless starting a campaign game.<br/><br/>The Situation. March 24, 1941: Rommel has just arrived in Africa and taken over command of the Axis forces there. Although ordered to stand on the defensive, he discovers that the British give ground easily to his probing attacks. Soon his &quot;raid&quot; becomes a full-blown offensive.<br/><br/>",

The idea is to absorb the opponents pieces into your own by surrounding them with at least 1 more piece value (so a 2 piece stack would be absorbed if surrounded by 2, 2 piece stacks, or a 3<br/>piece stack and a 1 piece stack). When you absorb the pieces, you turn them over to your color and add them to the capturing stacks. The first person to reduce their opponent to 3 pieces or less wins.

        "description": "Also known as &quot;Er Qi Shi&quot; or &quot;2-7-10&quot; is a traditional Chinese card game, closely related to Majiang and the Rummy family of games.  It can be found in Guang Xi province of southern China, particularly to the city of Guilin (from which it derives one of its names), as well as in Sichuan province (specifically Leshan where a particularly ornate style of writing for the numerals is used) and in the city of Chongqing.  It is rare, but not unheard of, to see it played outside of these environs.<br/><br/>It is traditionally played by 4 people, three players and one dealer. Cards are divided into two suits - informal and formal characters numbered from 1-10 and one &quot;Phoenix&quot; or joker card. There are 4 duplicates of each, with the 2's, 7's and 10's of both suits picked out in red (which are worth extra points when scoring).  Play proceeds in a manner similar to Majiang, with players attempting to create a variety of different &quot;melds&quot; or special hands, with the winner's score being calcualted on the strength of his or her hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mastermind Ultimate Cribbage (also called &quot;Masters Cribbage&quot;) is a card game stemming from the classic Cribbage, with some additional cards. It is played with a standard deck of cards,along with six new types: Super Fives, Zero Card, Super Ace, Wild, Super Card, and the Master Card. In addition it uses a cribbage board which is a signature piece of equipment with holes and pegs for scoring.<br/><br/>Players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib. One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib. The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences. Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board. This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards. Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board. The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points. Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.<br/><br/>2-players and teams of two play a full length game to 181 points. 3 individuals end play until 141 points. 4 individual players play to a standard cribbage length game of 121 points.<br/><br/>The six special cards are the crux of the game.<br/><br/>The Zero Card: When someone plays a card for a 15 or 31 during pegging, play the Zero-Card next to collect an additional 2 points for the 15 or 31. You must play the Zero-Card if you can played in a run or double run with zero, ace, and two.<br/><br/>The Super Ace: A Super-Ace pairs every ace. You can use a Super-Ace as a high ace for a run of queen, king and Super-Ace for both counting and pegging. The Super-Ace can be played as 1 or 11 during pegging. The value of the Super-Ace is 1 <u>and[/] 11 during counting (as though you had one of each card). The holder can also use as 1 and 11 with fours to total 15 points during counting the hand total.<br/><br/>Special Fives: Extra fives in play allows the high hand to go from 29 to 45 with 5 fives. The total points of  five 5&rsquo;s is 20. The 15 combinations are 20 and five pairs is another 20 making a total of 40 points.<br/><br/>Wild Cards: During pegging play you must use the Wild Card at the same face value as the point counting portion of the hand. Play a Wild Card as a seven during pegging, you must count it as a seven when you total your hand<br/><br/>The Super Wild: The Super-Wild is a Wild Card with one extra feature. It can be played during pegging as one face value and counted at another. You can play a Super-Wild as a seven during pegging and use it as a five during counting. If you play it as a 10 value you must specify it as a 10 or other face card value.<br/><br/>The Master: The Master is like a Super-Wild played as a separate face value during pegging and counting. The Master allows the extra option to play it after calling &lsquo;go&rsquo;.<br/><br/>",

If no one interrupts a countdown, the counter announces the word and scores as many points as the number of letters in the word; if she goofed, giving a non-word or a word that doesn't contain the consonants, everyone else scores that many points.<br/><br/>If a player thinks that no word can be created with the letters rolled, she announces, &quot;Impossible!&quot;, then counts down from ten, scoring three points if no one interrupts with a shorter word count.<br/><br/>The first player to score 36 points wins.<br/><br/>A six-sided vowel die is included that allows younger players to compete with older ones.

        "description": "User summary -<br/><br/>Nature trail is a turn based game. Each player rolls 1 die and moves around the board landing on (spotting) various animals that you might find in the English countryside. Once spotted the player gets a card depicting the animal, which they collect and at the end add up to give a final score. There is a 100 point bonus for the 1st person to finish. There are also red arrows that if landed on give either a penalty ranging from -5 to -15 or a bonus of +5 to +15. The player picks one of these card from the stack and they may contain bonus plants &amp; animals or a penalty for littering, leaving gates open or other contraventions of the 'countryside code'.<br/><br/>This game came with no printed box - just a plain white card sleeve. Inside is a plastic tray, 1 board, set of rules, x1 6 sided die, 4 player counters (coloured tidily winks), x30 penalty and bonus cards for landing on red arrows, 24 animal cards, 1 100 point wining bonus card, and black card tiles to cover animals that have been spotted by players on the board.<br/><br/>History - I believe it was bought from the RSPB shop (The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) UK, which is based a few miles from where I lived when I was younger. It seem it may have been a short test run of games - or only sold direct by the RSPB -<br/><br/>The game has stayed at my parents and is played a lot by grandchildren and adults when we get together. The game works well, with a slight imbalance in the second half of the board, or if you use the bonus points card - that lead people to race round the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Boojum is a set collection card game, using auction and deck building mechanics. It uses two decks of Decktet cards, plus some tokens to keep score. Groups of cards are auctioned, with players bidding using other cards from their hand. The winning bid for each group gets incremented by a card, and then auctioned in the next round. Sets to be collected are typical rummy/poker-like sets: straights, sets, flushes, etc., plus a few sets peculiar (in at least two senses of the word) to the Decktet. A sister game to Snark which uses the same mechanics, but with a Rainbow Deck.<br/><br/>",

As you watch them assemble, you recall the previous Victories were gained through intelligence and a keen sense of strategy.  Explore every option, then choose your course of action - but, remember, your opponent will be doing the same...<br/><br/>Tactics must be used which recognize the strengths and weaknesses of your opponent's battle forces, as well as your own.  Slow-moving ground forces can successfully defend key sectors of the Battle Grid, while swift-moving ground forces race through alley-ways to the attack.  But always be aware of the power of the air forces and the Ranger which, when skillfully positioned, can be devastating.<br/><br/>Now, it is time to clear your mind so that you can imagine the impossible.  Be prepared to change course in a heartbeat, yet always keep the ultimate goal firmly in mind.  You are ready.<br/><br/>Play:  Players execute one option per turn and alternate turns until victory is attained.  The battle forces consist of the army under the command of a player.  Siege occurs when you can attack your opponent's commander on your next turn.  Victory is attained when your opponent cannot excape siege.  Opening setup is similar in look to a chess game, and each individual type of fighter is able to move in a different way.  The fighters include both ground and flying forces.<br/><br/>Ground forces can be positioned by movement, or in certain cases through spinning, or through BOTH spinning and movement.  Flying forces can fly in the flight zone established by the ground forces (portals).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Like many of the great interstellar conflict games of our time, the story centers around a war where one empire emerges victorious. The game of Commonwealth, however, immerses players into a universe where that war has already happened. In a galaxy not so far away from our own, the victor of this old war has endured for centuries after the last of their adversaries were completely extinguished. After some time though, the very heart of their species began to rot with the knowledge of their forefathers and the annihilation they had wreaked upon their galaxy. In penance, the children of the last race searched the stars endlessly for some form of redemption and reprieve from their ageless guilt. And the day soon came when they found it. In the form of a small galaxy outside their own, they discovered several infant races untouched by hyperspace travel, and untouched by war. The Ancients came to our galaxy and swore they would protect its inhabitants from the same fate that befell their own. And so they introduced peace and order to the Milky Way, for only the Commonwealth could unite all the galaxy's races and prevent them from descending into the endless abyss of battle. If you remember, this is not a story about a great war. This is a story determining how the next age of our galaxy will unfold. Will you protect the Commonwealth and quell all rebellion, or will you dissent and usher in the next age of empire dominance?<br/><br/>Welcome to the Commonwealth universe where three to six players clash economically, politically, militarily, and even covertly in an epic conflict that rides upon the ground-breaking game mechanic of simultaneous turns. By choosing one of twelve unique alien races, you will create customizable fleets, explore the galaxy coordinate by coordinate, acquire powerful technologies, and launch secret covert attacks that even your enemies (or friends) can't originate. For the more politically inclined players, the in-game government provides a dynamic experience that will test your mettle as you try orchestrate a series of legislative masterstrokes to cripple or empower the Commonwealth.<br/><br/>All this to provide a real-time simulation of interstellar civilization and warfare at its finest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary:<br/><br/>Gameplay: A shogi variant that adds dice-driven combat, modified by using effect cards (only one card--selected at the beginning of the game). Figures are pewter. Collect figures (power levels from 1 to 5) to construct your 5-combatant team (using two of six colors). More powerful characters can only be summoned if a certain number of colors are on the table.<br/><br/>Theme: Uses characters from Dragon Ball Kai, pitting one team of combatants against another. The same character can be found across multiple colors, roughly corresponding to allegiances found in the manga (comics). For example, Goku is found in both a low power level and a high power level (super), but even characters without supers are represented.<br/><br/>Goal: There are two variants, basic and advanced. In the basic, simply having characters breakthrough (reach the opponent's starting line) completes the game. In the advanced, there are three win conditions, including having the majority of your characters occupying the Dragon Ball area in the middle of the playing field.<br/><br/>Components: There are preconstructed starters (currently 3 available), and booster singles (currently 2 available). Starters include 5 figures (using two colors), a die, a double-sided effect card, a rule sheet, and a play mat (paper). The third starter play mat sports different coloring and English. Singles include a figure and a tip sheet showing how all the figures from the set might be used.<br/><br/>",

You may even come across polar bears, boars or the mysterious and deadly Smoke Monster.<br/>As well as being uniquely structured to encompass the events of 6 seasons of LOST, this game is very heavy on theme and detail.<br/>The sheer depth of the game, and the large number of Encounter cards, ensures that even after several plays there will still be more surprises left for you.<br/>So step aboard Flight 815 and be prepared to begin the ultimate LOST experience...<br/><br/>A summary of play<br/>You will start the game rolling a die and moving around the outer track of the Island Game Board, visiting locations such as the Barracks, the Cockpit section, the Black Rock and the Hatch. When rolling the &lsquo;Eye&rsquo; symbol you do not move and should instead draw one of your Flash-backwards card (later in the game Flash-forwards and Flash-sideways cards are used). Your &lsquo;Flash&rsquo; cards usually instruct you to increase or decrease your Skill points or gain Fate points.<br/><br/>When you visit certain locations, and have encounters, the marker on the story track will be steadily advanced. When the story track reaches certain points, changes will be made to the game; for example the Encounter Deck being used may change to another one, or certain Friends counters may become de-activated.<br/>The story track will also instruct you and the other players to move to one of the separate game boards or a different game track on the main board.<br/><br/>As you progress through the various stages of the game, the Encounter decks will continually change so that you meet people and find items from the different seasons of the LOST saga. Also your chosen character&rsquo;s skill points will gradually improve making future challenges easier, and you will gain all important Fate points.<br/><br/>You will receive Mystery Counters as rewards. Each of the various mysteries depicted (for example Jacob, the Numbers) is made up of a set of 5 cards. If you can collect a complete set, they can be traded in for additional Fate points.<br/><br/>Eventually the action will move to the centre track on the game board where one of the players will be chosen to succeed Jacob. The end game will then commence. Along with the other players you must defeat the Man in Black and play the Desmond card at the Light Source space in order to save the island and win the game. Whichever player has the most Fate points at this point is declared the winner, but should your fail and allow the Man in Black to survive, all players lose the game.<br/><br/>LOST &lsquo;The End&rsquo; is a Print and Play board game from MM Games, for 2 to 4 players, due for release in November 2010.<br/>It takes on average between 2 to 3 hours to complete a game.<br/><br/>This game is non-profit making and is a fan-made project intended for the entertainment of fans of the the TV series LOST.

Finnish infantry assaults the board 10 and 42 villages attempting to capture buildings against infantry, guns and tanks.<br/><br/>FE 64 The Iron Ring is Closed, August 1941: This is a very meaty scenario. 44 German squads, OBA, halftracks and assault guns attack on boards 40, 49, 42, 24, 22 and 23. The Russians defend with 42 squads and several guns. The victory conditions are interesting with each side attempting to control the riverbank.<br/><br/>FE 65 Straight to the Front, September 1941: This scenario offers some good replay value. The Germans attack across boards 19 and 11 attempting to capture some buildings. The Germans get SS infantry and some AFV. The Russians start with some infantry and receive random tank support. A medium sized scenario should be popular.<br/><br/>FE 66 Tedium, October 1941: This is a classic slogging match across boards 19 and 44. Dug-In Russian troops try to stop a combined arms German force. The Germans have infantry, tanks and halftracks against the Russians with infantry, fortifications and Guns.<br/><br/>FE 67 A Cold Day in Hell, December 1941: The Finns and the Russians go at it in this small infantry only action. The action takes place in winter conditions on boards 8 and 42. This should make for good tourney action.<br/><br/>FE 68 Beast of Prey, March 1942: A real and true slugfest in the woods. Once again dug-in Russian defenders on boards 32 and 36 try to hold Germans from exiting the board. The Russians get infantry, fortifications and Guns while the Germans get SS infantry and some Stugs.<br/><br/>FE 69 Tiger Woods, August 1942: Yes! Another scenario with Tiger in its title!!! If that is not enough to get you excited then this scenario's OB should do it. The Germans get 4 Tigers up against a couple of Russian T-43's and a AA Truck. Each side gets a good number of infantry. This action takes place on boards 36 and 42.<br/><br/>FE 70 Worker's Settlement No. 8, September 1942: This cool infantry only scenario (well the Germans get one INF gun) takes place on board 33 and 4. This scenario has a cool twist for entry conditions with the Russians entering anywhere on 3 board edges. A cool twist in the VC makes for some uncertainty on where to attack. Sure to be a favorite for the tourney crowd.<br/><br/>FE 71 Cold Steel Rain, January 1943: This is another meaty scenario that should offer some good replay value given the variable VC. The Germans get infantry and some AT Guns and defend on boards 33 and 48 against attacking Russian infantry, OBA and some T-60 tanks. .<br/><br/>FE 72 Manos a la Manos, February 1943: The Spanish Blue Division makes its debut in this action on boards 13 and 18. The Spanish infantry with an AT Gun and some variable additional forces must defend some terrain against a lot of Russian infantry, tanks and Flamethrower tanks. The Russians got the numbers but do they have the time to capture the victory terrain?!<br/><br/>FE 73 Polar Star, February 1943: Another meaty old-fashioned scenario, this time on boards 17, 19 and 18. The Germans get 24 squads, fortifications, Stugs and some AT Guns and must hold off a swarm of 32 Russian squads, Assault guns and tanks from exiting and capturing some buildings. Lots of options in this one fore each side.<br/><br/>FE 74 Fruitless Fighting, March 1943: The classic capture the village type scenario on boards 12 and 17. This scenario features 20 Russian squads supported by tanks and assault guns attacking the village against an outpost of SS infantry and some fortifications. The Germans receive reinforcements in the form of infantry and 4 Tiger tanks.<br/><br/>FE 75 Porech'e Push, August 1943: My favorite of the scenarios in this pack. The Russians fight out of a bridgehead against a strong German force to capture the hills overlooking their bridgehead. Really get the flavor of the historic action in this one. The Russians get a bunch of infantry and an assortment of AFV against German infantry, guns and additional forces that they select from an available force pool. This scenario is set on boards 3, 8 and 49.<br/><br/>FE 76 The Battle of Krasnogvadeisk, January 1944: This is another one of those big scenarios that capture the flavor of east front action. Set on boards 18, 49 and 22 this is a meaty scenario with 26 Russian squads and 5 AFV attacking to capture some buildings against 21 squads, 4 tanks and some fortifications.<br/><br/>FE 77 Stalin's Revenge, June 1944: Another Finnish versus Russian scenario setup on boards 5 and 32. This is a smallish scenario featuring 9 Finnish squads and a couple of AT Guns against 15 Russian squads and 3 AFV. This is a brutal one for the Finnish as they attempt to stop the Russians from capturing some buildings.<br/><br/>",

During the first tournament there is one battle, in the second tournament two battles and so on. In total there are 1+2+3+4=10 battles from which players are trying to gather as many points as possible.<br/><br/>The gameplay is based around knight cards and battle cards. The battle cards give 1-2 pieces of information, for example heraldic animal and color. They're also worth points. The knight cards each have some info that corresponds to a number of battle cards. During a battle a battle card is first turned face up. Players can then participate in the battle with any knight cards that have any matching information to the battle card. These are played by a blind bidding mechanism. There are also some force cards that add to the total power of your knight cards. The player that plays the highest total power of knight cards wins the battle and claims the battle card. Only after the end of the tournament the players get to replenish their hands with new cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hungarian card game played with a traditional Hungarian deck of cards (standard deck without the cards 2-6, which uses German suits). At first players bid for being the starting player.<br/><br/>From wikipedia (edited) :<br/><br/>Lorum consists of 8 or 6 different individual games or contracts each with its own aim and rules. Each game is played four times making a total of 32/24 games in a session. The winner of a trick leads to the next. Suit must be followed; if that is not possible, any card may be discarded. The trick is taken by the highest card of the led suit and there are no trumps.<br/><br/>The composition of the eight/six contracts varies, but always comprises the following four deals:<br/><br/>No Hearts. In No Hearts, also called Reds, the aim is to avoid winning Hearts or &quot;reds&quot;. A red may not be led to the first trick unless forehand only has reds. Players may not discard a red to the first trick unless they only have reds. In the succeeding tricks, reds may be discarded if a player has no card of the led suit. Each red card taken in tricks scores 1 point.<br/>Obers. The aim is in Obers to avoid capturing Obers. Each Ober is worth 2 points. An Ober may not be led to the first trick, nor may an Ober be laid to it unless the player only has an Ober in the led suit (i.e. the Ober is a singleton). In the remaining tricks, Obers may be discarded at any stage if a player cannot follow suit.<br/>No Tricks. In No Tricks, also just Tricks, the aim is to avoid taking any tricks. Each trick is worth a point.<br/>Lorum. This contract is, like the last deal in most compendium games, a Domino-type contract. Forehand leads any card to the table. The next player in turn must play either a card of the same rank in another suit or lay off the next highest card of the same suit next to the first card. An Ace follows a Seven. If a player is unable to play a card, he misses a turn. Players may not miss a turn if they are able to play. Every turn missed costs one point. As soon as the first player goes out by laying off his last card, the remaining players score a point for each card still held in the hand. Alternatively the deal can continue until each player in succession goes out. In this variation, the second player to go out scores 1 point per card, the third player, 2 points per card and the last player, 3 points per card.<br/><br/>In addition, one or more (typically two or four) of the following contracts are usually inserted between the third deal above (No Tricks) and the final deal (Lorum).[6]<br/><br/>First and Last Trick. In First and Last (Erster und letzter Stich) the aim is to avoid taking the first and last tricks; each of which counts as 4 (variation: 5) points. Short variant: Only two cards are dealt to each player, the stock being given to the next dealer. The first player to lead plays one of his two cards. The winner of the trick then leads to the 'last' trick. Suit must be followed if possible. Each trick scores 4 (or 5) points.<br/>Fifth Trick. In Fifth Trick (F&uuml;nfter Stich) players must avoid taking the fifth trick, after which the deal is ended. It scores 8 points.<br/>Seventh Trick. As Fifth Trick except players avoid taking the seventh trick.<br/>Red King. The aim in Red King, also called Red King-less, is to avoid capturing the 'red king' (the King of Hearts). It scores: 16 points when captured in the first trick, 8 points in the second to seventh tricks, 32 points in the last trick and 64 points if announced before playing the last trick.<br/>Hairy Ape. As Red King, but players hold their cards facing their opponents; then play cards at random. If two or more are of the same suit, the highest wins otherwise each card 'takes' itself. The player who take the red King scores 8 points.<br/>Train (Vonat). Using the Ace-Ten scoring system, card points are added cumulatively as they are played. The first to exceed 25 wins 1 point, 50 wins 2 points, 75 wins 3 points and 100 wins 4 points.<br/>Quart(el) or Kvart. In Quartel, to the first card played, the 3 next higher cards of the same suit must be added in sequence by whoever has them until and unless no-one has the next higher card. Players do not need to play in clockwise order. The trick is won by the player who placed the last card in the sequence and he then leads to the next trick. If an eligible player has a highest card of its suit at that stage of the game in his hand (usually an Ace, but also a Seven if the Eight of the same suit has already been played), he can put it away as &quot;high&quot;. The game ends when the first player goes out by discarding his last card. This may not necessarily be the current player. The cards remaining in the other players' hands score 1 point each.<br/>All Bad (Mindenrossz). A combination of several contracts e.g. No Tricks, No Hearts, No Obers and No Red King.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ScatterLand is a game of strategy and deduction for 2-4 players.  It takes roughly 30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>The basic idea is that players are exploring an archipelago in search of islands. The game board consists of a 9&times;9 array of 81 squares, further divided into nine 3&times;3 boxes. There are 18 islands total, but these islands aren&rsquo;t distributed randomly; instead, they are arranged so that two islands occupy each 3&times;3 box, each row, and each column.  What's more, these islands are initially hidden from view.<br/><br/>Players claim one square per turn.  A player either places an island of her color in the region (if there's an island there) or a boat of her color in the region (if there isn't).  Players are trying first to discover and then to connect together as many islands as they can:  the more islands they connect together, the more points they receive at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players use logic to determine where the islands are likely to be, but logic alone is not enough:  players must also think tactically and strategically in order both to foster their own growth and limit the growth of their opponents.<br/><br/>ScatterLand takes no more than five minutes to learn (or to teach), but its gameplay is surprisingly deep.  There are a lot of things to try to balance when deciding where to play:  do you want to claim a new island as your own or try to connect two of your islands together?  Do you want to try to consolidate your own position or be the first to explore a given area? Do you want to focus on expanding your chains or trying to cut off your opponents?<br/><br/>Two versions of the game are included:  the basic version (described above) and the advanced version (which limits the number of exclusive islands any one player can claim).<br/><br/>ScatterLand can be found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://boardgameforge.wordpress.com/scatterland/</a> -- just click the links toward the bottom of the page for both the rules and 20 additional boards.<br/><br/>",
