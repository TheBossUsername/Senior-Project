The Protectorate Starfighter Expansion Pack brings this aggressive ship to X-Wing as one of the most potent &ndash; and most deceptively simple &ndash; vessels in the Scum and Villainy fleet with three attack and three agility. Although the ship has no shields, its pilots favor aggressive approaches, meeting their foes in deadly head-on charges. In addition to its pre-painted miniature, the expansion contains six ship cards and two upgrades.<br/><br/>",

What unifies it is a general counterculture vibe &ndash; the sense that they are pioneers and iconoclasts. But this independent spirit paved the way for the rise of Los Muertos.&quot;<br/>&ndash;Expos&eacute; on The Underway: Part IV &ndash; Days of the Muertos<br/><br/>The Underway, the fourth Data Pack in the SanSan Cycle for Android: Netrunner, explores the meat space, culture, and residents of the megacity SanSan. The cradle of high-end tech, home to beautiful beaches, and the host of the World Expo, SanSan is also still recovering from &quot;The Big One&quot;, the cataclysmic earthquake that opened up the San Andreas fault and redefined America's western coast. However, this event that was disastrous for many was an opportunity for others, some of whom quickly moved their homes and businesses into the new space that was created.<br/><br/>Accordingly, the sixty new cards in The Underway (three copies each of twenty different cards) explore this new space and its motley assembly of different architectural styles, ethnicities, and cultural influences. They also explore the pervasive influence of Los Muertos, a street gang whose members are identified by their bioluminescent tattoos and who deal in illegal tech as much as they deal in flesh and drugs. Through the introduction of new resources, illicit hardware, and clever programs, the gang&rsquo;s criminal influence pervades every aspect of this Data Pack, starting with a new Criminal Runner identity, then reaching outward as other Runner factions are supplied with the sort of tech you don't normally find in America, and finally rippling into every aspect of every card as Corps are forced to deal with the gang&rsquo;s members in one way or another.<br/><br/>",

In this ultimate showdown, the Dragon is controlled by a special set of Dragon Turn cards that will trigger special attacks and movements from the Frost Dragon.

In the Gloom card game, you make your eccentric family of misfits suffer the greatest tragedies possible before helping them pass on to the well-deserved respite of death. Just mix the 55 transparent cards in this set together with your copy of Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, and Untimely Deaths.<br/><br/>Unquiet Dead also introduces Stories, Undead, and Timing Symbols. The families of Gloom have many skeletons in their closets. In Unquiet Dead, the spooks come out to play. Mad scientists can Reanimate Relatives or Invent Invisibility. Vampires and shape shifters can Terrorize the Townsfolk and Go Mad in the Moonlight. Will you Give Up the Ghost, or will you hold onto it?<br/><br/>STORIES: These cards give your families even more to fight over. Whoever claims a story gains a special benefit ... but how long can you keep it?<br/><br/>UNDEAD: There are seven special Modifiers that allow a Character to become a supernatural creature -- a vampire, mummy, ghost, ghoul, wereduck, invisible person, or haunted portrait. These Undead Characters are both living and dead; you can still play Modifiers and Events on them, but they also count toward your Family Value and toward ending the game.<br/><br/>TIMING SYMBOLS: Card effects in Unquiet Dead have symbols to let you know whether a card has an Instant effect that occurs when the card is played from your hand; an Ongoing effect that lasts until it is covered by another card; or a Persistent effect that can last as long as the Character is still alive ... or Undead.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pagan: Beyond the Palisades is the first expansion for Pagan: Fate of Roanoke.<br/><br/>Pagan is an asymmetrical card game for two players taking on the roles of Witch or Witch hunter. The Witch tries to carry out a ritual of renaturation before being exposed and eliminated by the Witch hunter. Nine villagers are under suspicion and only the Witch player knows who the real Witch is. Each turn, the players use their action pawns on active villagers to draw cards, play cards, gain influence and manage the Gloom. Moreover, the Witch can brew powerful potions, improve their familiar and cast enchantments and charms, while the Witch hunter enlists allies, claim strategic locations, and ruthlessly investigates the villagers.<br/><br/>Beyond the Palisades introduces two new mechanics to Pagan: Gloom and Cleanse.<br/>Gloom is a new resource that benefits the Witch player as long as it is in play. It symbolizes the Witch's symbiotic<br/>relationship with the lands. Gloom enters the game through the play of Gloom-cards and can be reduced or increased<br/>during a game. Some cards can even break the natural limits of the Gloom on the cards.<br/>With sufficient effort and focus, it is possible to cleanse the Gloom encroaching on the village. Cleansing a card is done<br/>by removing every last bit of Gloom. Once a card is cleansed it is discarded.<br/><br/>Content<br/>The game features 4 scenarios, 9 all new villagers, 30 Gloom tokens and 2 full pre-made decks for each player (50 cards each).<br/><br/>",

The judge turns over a RED apple card from the top of the stack. Players choose the GREEN apple card from their hand that they think is most like the word on the RED apple card. The judge then selects the GREEN apple card that he or she thinks is best, and awards the RED apple card to the person who played the selected GREEN apple card.<br/><br/>Crab Apples Variation - For a tart twist, choose and judge red apple cards that are least like, or the opposite of, the word on the green apple card. For example, you might choose Charging Rhinos when the word Dainty is played.<br/><br/>Baked Apples Variation - For a more leisurely and thoughful game, allow everyone, except the judge, to play a red apple card in each round. You may wish to set a time limit for each round to prevent a player from taking too much time.<br/><br/>This expansion was discontinued when it was included with the core game for the Apples to Apples Party Box Edition.<br/><br/>Part of the Apples to Apples Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tyrant is a tactical simulation of combat between the armies of Carthage and Syracuse, from 480-276 B.C.<br/><br/>Long before Hannibal Barca led the armed forces of Carthage into a titanic struggle with Rome, Carthage had vied for centuries with the Greek city-state of Syracuse for supremacy in the Western Meditteranean. Tyrant includes twelve of the most decisive battles in the recurring wars that pitted Carthage against the Greeks of Syracuse. The armies of Syracuse were similar to the contemporary hoplite armies of the mainland Greek city-states, but with better cavalry and a strong mercenary corps of both Greek and Western barbarian units. Carthage relied on North African tribal levies augmented with barbarian mercenaries from all over the Western Mediterranean. In Sicily, Carthaginian armies were usually supported by allied and mercenary Greek units.<br/><br/>Although Syracuse was generally more successful in open field battles, Carthage had superior wealth, political stability, and naval power. The continued warfare remained balanced over time, yielding no decisive advantage to either side. The more than two centuries long struggle never came to a definite conclusion as &quot;new kid on the block&quot; Rome would emerge in the First Punic War to steal the prize.<br/><br/>Battles:<br/><br/>    Himera, 480BC<br/>    Second Himera, 409BC<br/>    Akragas, 406BC<br/>    Gela, 405BC<br/>    Cabala, 377BC<br/>    Cronium, 376BC<br/>    Crimissos River, 341BC<br/>    Abolus River, 338BC<br/>    Mount Ecnomious, 311BC<br/>    White Tunis, 310BC<br/>    Tunis, 307BC<br/>    Lilybaeum, 276BC<br/><br/><br/>To play Tyrant, you will need the game Great Battles of Alexander, Deluxe Edition for maps, basic rules, and some counters. Tyrant can also be played with the Simple Great Battles of History Rules.<br/><br/>(from GMT website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

The Black Death is approaching, and during the next few years, large parts of the population of Europe and Northern Africa will be killed by the plague.<br/><br/>In Rattus, the players settle in the various regions of Europe and Northern Africa, while the plague spreads through all these regions. The players gain help from the various professions of the middle ages. Some of these, like peasants and bakers, help the players grow their populations. Some, like the monks and nuns, use wisdom and faith to avoid the plague, while the warfare conducted by the knights and soldiers spreads the plague to new areas. However, the plague does not make any distinction. When the rats arrive, no one can feel safe. Finally, the plague withdraws and the game ends. Only then will it be clear who was able to keep their population alive &mdash; and win the game!<br/><br/>Rattus: Big Box includes not only several previous released expansions and promos, but also previous unpublished materials, modules, and bonus cards. More specifically, this renewed edition of the Rattus line contains all materials of the base game and the Pied Piper, Africanus, and Academicus expansions. Additional new content is included, and players can add the new &quot;Guilds &amp; Inns&quot; and &quot;Bonus&quot; modules to create even more variety and challenge.<br/><br/>This edition also contains popular bonus cards like The Judge, The Jester, and Boccaccio, as well as all 27 level upgrade tiles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In many instances these conventions pit the players in a tournament setting.  Invariably the question arises of how to implement and run such a tournament.  In an effort to formalize these endeavors the CC: Tournament Battle Pack was created to provide a core set of tested scenarios and rules for use in the running of a Combat Commander Tournament.<br/><br/>CC Tournament Battle Pack&ndash;Leader of Men features twelve scenarios (ten previously available online and two new) printed on cardstock, two new maps, four page tournament guidelines booklet, and tournament record card template printed on cardstock.<br/><br/>Each scenario is designed specifically for tournament play with situations and scenario special rules crafted to test a player&rsquo;s skill and Combat Commander knowledge.  The twelve scenarios cover actions from 1939 to 1944 with each of the combatants in the Combat Commander Series represented in at least one scenario.  The Tournament Guidelines Booklet contains the preferred rules the designer uses to implement and run tournaments at the World Boardgaming Championships and the PrezCon Game Convention.  These guidelines are an out of the box solution for any potential tournament host but are also easily adapted to suit any style of tournament play.<br/><br/>The scenarios included in CC Tournament Battle Pack&ndash;Leader of Men are:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Hill 133&rdquo;, German vs Russian, 1943, Map 24; <br/>&ldquo;Blitzkreig Unleashed&rdquo;, German vs Polish, September 1939, Map 12; <br/>&ldquo;A Midnight Clear&rdquo;, German vs US, December 1944, Map 3;<br/>&ldquo;The Bridge Too Far&rdquo;, German vs British, September 1944, Map 17;<br/>&ldquo;On the Road to Victory&rdquo;, British vs Italian, July 1943, Map 10;<br/>&ldquo;One Steppe Beyond&rdquo;, German vs Russian, March 1943, Map 8; <br/>&ldquo;Signals in the Snow&rdquo;, Finnish vs Russian, November 1939, Map 20;<br/>&ldquo;Codes in the Sunrise&rdquo;, German vs British, June 1940, Map 4;<br/>&ldquo;Operation Mercury&rdquo;, German vs British, May 1941;<br/>&ldquo;Barbarossa Unleashed&rdquo;, German vs Russian, June 1941;<br/>&ldquo;Red Sector A&rdquo;, German vs US, 1944, New Map #73;<br/>&ldquo;La Villa Strangiato&rdquo;, US vs Italian, 1944. New Map #72;<br/><br/><br/>NOTE: CC Tournament Battle Pack&ndash;Leader of Men is not a complete game and requires ownership of Combat Commander: Europe and Combat Commander: Mediterranean to play.<br/><br/>",

The fact that the heroes were getting no military support in this fight, and that no alarms had been set off by Chokepoint&rsquo;s entirely unstealthy arrival was not immediately concerning to them, but the Southwest Sentinels began to realize things were not quite what they had assumed.<br/><br/>They fled through the military installation, narrowly dodging the attacks from Chokepoint. As they entered the lower levels, Chokepoint tore through a wall before them, and then was incapacitated by a blast of power. The wall she had just destroyed housed a secret room the heroes had never seen before. In that room were four large glowing crystals, each radiating a different spectrum of energy.<br/><br/>Behind them, Chokepoint groaned and began struggling to her feet. She would be back at full power in no time - the heroes had a choice to make. And they choose survival.<br/><br/>Now, Doctor Medico, Mainstay, The Idealist, and Writhe harness the power of Oblivion Shards and fight against the end of all things. They hold back the Void when no one else can.<br/><br/>Sentinels of the Multiverse: Void Guard is a box set of four hero characters, complete with their own hero character cards and decks.<br/><br/>",

Mercenaries are optional Units (not Monsters) that may each be included separately at the beginning of any game.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>To include a Mercenary, simply place the miniature of standee and corresponding Mercenary card in a central area that all players can see and reach at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>As a Free Action on your turn, using either Gold or an Orb, you may hire a Mercenary. The hired Mercenary is placed directly into your Ready Area and is available for use. If you paid Gold to hire the Mercenary, it will be yours until the end of your next Regroup action. If you hired the Mercenary using an Orb, it is yours for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The Exclusive Minotaur Miniature!<br/><br/>The Minotaur Miniature is a new mercenary class for Dwellings of Eldervale that comes in its own tuckbox - separate from any version of Dwellings of Eldervale. Included in the tuck box is the 50mm Minotaur miniature, standee, and corresponding game card.<br/><br/>The Minotaur<br/>Charging into battle for your side, the Minotaur is a tough fighter. The Charge ability allows the Minotaur to Rush into adjacent Realms like Monsters. This ability is optional and is triggered whenever any opponent places in a Realm adjacent to the Minotaur.

BANG! 10th Anniversary is packaged in a metal box and includes all the BANG! playing cards, plus a selection of popular characters &ndash; the &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, if you will &ndash; from all the released expansions of BANG!. In addition, the game will feature deluxe components such as wooden bullets and maxi-sized player boards. To top it all off, this edition will include three previously unpublished characters and a brand new player board!<br/><br/>&quot;The Outlaws hunt the Sheriff. The Sheriff hunts the Outlaws. The Renegade plots secretly, ready to take one side or the other. Bullets fly. Who among the gunmen is a Deputy, ready to sacrifice himself for the Sheriff? And who is a merciless Outlaw, willing to kill him? If you want to find out, just draw (your cards)!&quot; (From back of box)<br/><br/>This card game recreates an old-fashioned spaghetti western shoot-out, with each player randomly receiving a Character card to determine special abilities, and a secret Role card to determine their goal.<br/><br/>Four different Roles are available, each with a unique victory condition:<br/>Sheriff - Kill all Outlaws and the Renegade<br/>Deputy - Protect the Sheriff and kill any Outlaws<br/>Outlaw - Kill the Sheriff<br/>Renegade - Be the last person standing<br/>A player's Role is kept secret, except for the Sheriff. Character cards are placed face-up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.<br/><br/>There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun. The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot. Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter - it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!<br/><br/>Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.<br/><br/>",

She constantly ached, fought against daily migraines, and her mind was scattered - focusing on this time and reality grew more difficult with each passing day. Worst of all, the dark version of herself which had &quot;hitched a ride&quot; on her jaunt through time fed off her pain.<br/><br/>All it took was the right amount of stress. In battle against the dreaded GloomWeaver, The Visionary wrapped herself in a telekinetic cocoon in order to avoid a swarm of arcane cultists, but when she did so, her fellow heroes heard a muffled scream from within the glowing purple energy barrier. It shattered with a burst of green energy, throwing cultists about like rag dolls. A pale, maniacally grinning Vanessa Long strode forth, waving a dismissive gesture at GloomWeaver, which banished him from this realm entirely.<br/><br/>&quot;Hello, dearies,&quot; Visionary cooed. &quot;Let's go save the Multiverse . . . &quot;<br/><br/>This Visionary felt different . . . darker. However, she still knew all the heroes, and she had helped against the villain. When questioned, she insisted that she was fine. In fact, she felt better than ever before! So, Dark Visionary fights alongside the Sentinels of the Multiverse . . . for now . . .<br/><br/>",

A missile strike from an unknown origin preceded the Aftershock&mdash;which is what the aftermath came to be known as. Almost half the city was wiped out by the missile, those that survived emerged from the destruction to be greeted by VANDAL fumes; a chemical-based mutagen that had various effects on its subjects.<br/><br/>The government has been massively destabilized due to the Kingdom&rsquo;s nefarious activities, and the survivors of Ransom City are left to fend for themselves in their hostile new home. Criminals re-emerged to claim dominance over the remaining resources, while the pharmaceutical giant Parasol Incorporated publicly announced their intention to lead cleanup efforts in Ransom City.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the corporation's interests seem skewed, and since their arrival many things have gotten worse. Including the arrival of strange mutated lab experiments and what could only be described as monsters straight out of horror movies&hellip;<br/><br/>Aftershock is a deluxe expansion for the Street Masters board game, adding four new fighter decks, four new stage decks, two new enemy decks, new loot cards, and much more! Expanding on the modular nature of Street Masters, Aftershock includes two new ways to customize your play experience: missions and showdowns.<br/><br/>The mission deck is included to speed up multiplayer games by adding additional ways to support your fellow fighters. Mission cards allow fighters to gain powerful mission tokens, that can in turn be used to assist your fellow fighters during their turn.<br/><br/>Showdowns are a new type of story deck that can be used in any story mode game, adding a villainous character working in the shadows against the fighters. Each showdown deck introduces a unique story for the associated enemy deck, as well as upgrade cards that will truly test the fighters! Players can also choose to include these enemy upgrade cards in their arcade games to increase difficulty and customize their games even further.<br/><br/>Additionally, Aftershock comes packed in a massive storage box that is designed to hold all existing Street Masters decks and tokens, as well as room for future content.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The game pits you against Queen Ann in an epic battle to score the most veneration points over 5 epochs.<br/><br/>First, her Majesty will ruthlessly target the bewitched King (The<br/>Behemoth) in effort to diminish your fame. After the King is dead (or by the dawn of third epoch), she will mount her black horse to pursue your band of rebels with a vengeance.<br/><br/>The Queen plays the game with unlimited resources and no movement restrictions. Any actual resources she acquires along the way count as veneration points!<br/><br/>Can you thwart her quest for the King&rsquo;s demise, while securing your own prestige? By the Sword of Leinad, you shall prevail!<br/><br/>Development Notes:<br/><br/>The elegantly crafted automa deck features an A.I. player that cleverly reacts to game conditions as well as keeping you guessing with unpredictable maneuvering.<br/><br/>Rounds are played just like the base game with alternating turns, round by round until each epoch is triggered.

The fate of all Middle-earth&hellip; Mountain of Fire is the sixth and final The Lord of the Rings Saga Expansion for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game!<br/><br/>Three epic scenarios grant you the opportunity to adventure alongside Aragorn and Frodo Baggins as they march to the Black Gate, carry the One Ring into the heart of Mordor, and climb the final steps to the fires of Mount Doom. These scenarios are inspired directly by The Return of the King, and their apocalyptic, world-altering stakes are reflected by the introduction of the dire keyword, which raises the threat elimination level to &quot;99,&quot; and by rules that allow you play the final two scenarios simultaneously in Epic Multiplayer Mode, either in standalone play or as the climactic finale to your The Lord of the Rings Saga Campaign!<br/><br/>And it's not just the scenarios that are bigger and more fantastic than ever. Mountain of Fire is loaded with new heroes, allies, events, and attachments that truly convey the awesome resolve of those noble and daring Men, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits that stood at the end against the forces of Mordor.<br/><br/>",

But watch out, any patients left in the city who have not been tended to, neglect in value and the player(s) who picked up the healthiest patients that round gain fatality tokens, if the worst happens to the patients! This expansion also includes a helicopter miniature (used to pickup patients from anywhere in the city grid for whoever is the first player that round) in the kickstarter edition.<br/><br/>The Maternity Expansion<br/>This expansion includes normal sized pink mother dice and smaller pink baby dice! This expansion also increases interaction by making players compete for objective cards set by the &quot;city&quot; to ensure a good amount of mother and baby dice are discharged (with often other colour combinations) by the end of the game. This also includes a new spatial element to the game in which mothers only neglect when untreated and in a ward with other dice. Players also roll the birthing die to see whether they receive single or twin babies!<br/><br/>The Improvements expansion<br/>This expansion allows for almost unlimited customisation! Players will be given a free to visit worker placement board where they can pick up room improvements specific to a colour of their choice. This expansion vastly increases the crunchiness of the game and is for players who have played the original game &quot;wanting more&quot;.<br/><br/>Note: The Kickstarter edition of Community Care included components for a 5th player and may be found here: Dice Hospital: Community Care (Kickstarter Edition).<br/><br/>",

Light side players can take hope from the arrival of several iconic new units, including a new Rebel Alliance version of Han Solo!<br/><br/>At the end of &quot;The Hoth Cycle&quot;, the siege on Echo Base and the cycle's focus on the Hoth trait come to a dramatic close. Will this Force Pack see the end of the Rebel Alliance and its allies? Or will Luke, Leia, Han, and the light side's other key champions escape from the frozen planet to plan their next strike and keep the fires of freedom lit?<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 64-68.<br/><br/>",

As ruler of the region, Prince Escalus has formed a council to help mediate the conflict and bring lasting peace to Verona.<br/><br/>In V&eacute;rone, which includes both the Council of Verona base game and the Poison expansion, players take on the role of influential citizens of Verona and act to use their influence to either add characters to the council or cast them into exile. Through thoughtful hand management of their cards and clever placement of influence tokens, players gain victory points based upon the agendas of the characters at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins!<br/><br/>The Poison expansion adds two new tokens per player to the base game: poison tokens and antidote tokens. Influence Cards that end the game with more poison than antidote tokens on them are removed from the play area, which may affect scoring agendas.<br/><br/>We've all heard the story of Romeo and Juliet &ndash; now is your chance to steer the story and determine who will rule Verona once and for all!<br/><br/>",

If they can overcome them and successfully return from special quests, they may become the towns&rsquo; saviors, and the free towns will once again be able to rebuild.<br/><br/>The Curse of the Cataclysm adventure variant replaces some elements of the Rise of the Dragon Lords adventure found in the base Runebound game, creating an entirely new game experience!<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Runebound: Second Edition<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "First introduced to the world as a huge starship designed for Epic games of X-Wing&trade;, the Raider-class corvette is the Empire's response to the need for a designated anti-fighter vessel. Its six dual heavy laser cannons are more accurate against snubfighters than the turbolaser batteries of its Star Destroyer cousins, and the disruptive effects of its ion cannon emplacements, along with the efficiency of its localized command, make it a powerful addition to small strike forces.<br/><br/>This potent anti-fighter starship enters Armada in the Imperial Raider Expansion Pack. The first small ship for the Imperial Navy, the Raider is a quick and nimble ship that excels at dealing with pesky starfighter squadrons, but it can just as easily dart across the battlefield to pour concentrated fire into the broadside of a Rebel cruiser. Whether you field your pre-painted miniature as a Raider I-class Corvette or Raider II-class Corvette, the Imperial Raider Expansion Pack offers you plenty of ways to customize it for battle with either squadrons or capital ships. Among its eight upgrade cards, you'll find Ordnance Experts, a new commander, Quad Laser Turrets, two unique titles, and more.<br/><br/>Of course, as always, the Imperial Raider Expansion Pack comes with a command dial, speed dial, and all the tokens you need to enter the fray.<br/><br/>",

Players will set up the game by placing these 5 boxes, plus the box bottom, onto the scroll in designated areas. This creates the environment that players will explore and battle across.<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Tactics, players will have a team of 4 unique heroes: a Fighter, a Wizard, a Rogue and a Beast. Each hero type, and each character within that type, offers unique advantages to movement, attacks, and/or support. Finding the synergy in your team is key to victory.<br/><br/>In competitive play, players will pit their teams against one another in effort to score the most victory points by the end of the game. Each turn, players will have 3 actions to assign across their team. They can move and/or attack with their heroes. Victory points are rewarded for area control, enemy heroes captured, and keeping your own heroes alive. Gaining complete control of one, or multiple, specific areas offers the most victory points in competitive play. Gaining control of said areas requires your heroes maintaining majority presence in these areas over the course of a few turns. This requires a careful balance of offense and defense. The control of these areas can easily shift from one player to another based on which player has the majority heroes present in the designated spaces. Once a set number of areas are captured, or one of the players has lost all of their heroes, the end game is triggered.<br/><br/>Tiny Epic Tactics offers a distinctly different experience for solo and cooperative play. In these modes, players will adventure across the map, fighting spawning enemies and exploring caves (printed on the interior of each of the boxes). The goal is to acquire treasures, that belongs to the enemy, from these caves while keeping your heroes alive. Once the end of the game is triggered, victory points are tallied based on how many treasures you took from the enemy and how many of your heroes you kept alive.<br/><br/>",

(Unlike the game board, worker actions are unencumbered by other players on the vineyard mat extension.)<br/><br/>Eighteen new &quot;arbor&quot; cards are also added to the game in their own deck, with these cards being drawn by using the &quot;draw a vine card&quot; action. These additions add value to the wine orders and can be used to improve worker morale.

Cows can be traded at the &ldquo;trade one for one&rdquo; space on the Tuscan extended game board. They can be traded for &pound;3, 1VP, two cards or a grape token. You can trade your cow away without making cheese. You are allowed a maximum of four cows.<br/><br/>The mat has three new structures:<br/><br/><br/>     Cheesemonger - may sell one cheese for 1VP on the &ldquo;sell one wine token&rdquo;<br/>     Affinatore - allows you to choose one type of cheese and either not age it (so it doesn&rsquo;t go rotten) or age it twice.<br/>     Formager - once per year, you may discard one cheese token when you fill a wine order to gain VP&rsquo;s up to the value of the cheese token. This can be up to 4 points, so as much as a wine order.<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Arboriculture and Formaggio were modules included in the original Kickstarter version of Tuscany that were eventually deemed &ldquo;non-essential&rdquo; for the compilation of Tuscany Essential.

The board is just 3&times;4 squares, so the game is rather short. As for how to play:<br/><br/><br/>     The tanuki moves one space orthogonally.<br/>     The kitsune moves one space diagonally.<br/>     The kodama is directly analogous to the pawn/soldier of Shōgi and can be promoted to a kodama samurai, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi (moving one space orthogonally or one space diagonally forward).<br/>     The koropokkuru is analogous to a king in Chess, except that he can win through promotion as long as it doesn't leave him in check.<br/>     Even on this 3&times;4 board, you are still able to drop in pieces that you captured from your opponent!<br/>     Unlike in Shōgi, you can drop a kodama for mate or have two kodama in a column.<br/><br/><br/>The expert version has a larger 5&times;6 game board with each player having eight pieces (3 kodama, 2 oni, 2 kirin and 1 koropokkuru).<br/><br/><br/>     The kirin moves equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.<br/>     The oni moves equivalent to the silver general in Shogi (moving one space diagonally or one space straight forward) and can be promoted to a super oni, equivalent to the gold general in Shogi.<br/><br/><br/>The game also adds more rules from the full Shōgi game, in particular:<br/><br/><br/>     You win only by capturing your opponent's koropokkuru, not by reaching the opposite side of the game board.<br/>     You can't have two of your own kodama in the same column/file.<br/>     You can't drop a kodama for mate.<br/><br/><br/>The Japan Shogi Association created the rules for this game in order for players to learn important concepts in Shōgi, such as how to handle the generals effectively, why pawn promotion is so important, and how to mate the opponent's king with successive piece drops.<br/><br/>",

Tolkien, The Hobbit<br/><br/>Escape from Mount Gram is the second Adventure Pack in the Angmar Awakened cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.<br/><br/>For centuries, the Goblins of Mount Gram have remained hidden within their dark stronghold. Their past attempts at invading Eriador are but distant memories. Still, they live in lands tainted by ancient evils, and evil lives within their hearts. Now, in Escape from Mount Gram, the Goblins of Mount Gram are once again up to trouble, and when they capture a host of Rangers and heroes, it's up to you and your heroes to lead a daring and dramatic prison break!<br/><br/>In addition to its wild, new scenario, Escape from Mount Gram introduces a new hero for the Lore sphere and three copies each of nine different player cards. These cards explore a variety of different themes, divided among the different spheres of influence. While Leadership players benefit from a pair of cards that encourage direct action against the Enemy, Tactics players gain a pair of Ent-focused cards, Spirit players gain a new side quest, and Lore players gain two cards that support a new mechanic based around manipulating the encounter deck and the victory display.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Volume IV in the Down in Flames card game series covers World War II in the Pacific from mid-1942 until early 1945, starting where Volume III (Zero!) left off.<br/><br/>Corsairs &amp; Hellcats is a DiF Gamette, including all of the major late war aircraft types developed by both sides (Zero! is required in order to play this gamette). Allied players can fly the game's namesakes, the F4U-1 Corsair and F6F Hellcat, as well as the British Firefly, the P47-N, and the P-61 Black Widow. Japanese players can counter with two models of late war Zero, the Ki-84 Frank, the N1K1 George, and the J2M Jack. New bomber types include the TBF Avenger, the B-29 Superfortress, and the Ki-49 Helen. There's even a new kind of bomber: the Attack Bomber, which can strafe and bomb. Two types are present in Corsair &amp; Hellcats: the B-25C-1 field modification and the solid nose B-25J, which carried a dozen (!) fixed forward-firing .50 caliber machine guns.<br/><br/>All of these aircraft (plus many of the ones in Zero!) are used in seven new campaigns. Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz are carrier campaigns like those pioneered in Zero!. Solomon Islands, Philippines 1944, and Okinawa use the land campaign structure familiar to players of the previous games in the series. The other two campaigns are quite different, though. Guadalcanal models the drawn out struggle for control of the airspace above that island. Players allocate available aircraft to two missions each week in an attempt to force a withdrawal by their opponent. The campaign also includes the option to play the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz campaigns as part of the battle, feeding the results of the carrier encounters back into the main campaign. B-29s in China is a solitaire campaign representing the beginning of the strategic bombing offensive against Japan. The player controls three Superfortresses and must balance their activities between training, carrying supplies, repairing damage, and conducting bombing missions.<br/><br/>In addition, Corsairs &amp; Hellcats includes new target types, skilled pilots, and ordnance. The game also has rules for Kamikazes, supply drops, submarines, and mine laying. There's even a new method of selecting skilled (and green) pilots and crews that reflects the changes in aircrew quality that both sides went through during the course of the war. Are you ready to relive history? Can you sweep the skies in the cockpit of your Corsair or Hellcat? Pilots, man your planes...<br/><br/>NOTE: In order to play Corsairs &amp; Hellcats you must have a copy of Zero!.<br/> Components Included:<br/><br/>    16-Page Rules Booklet<br/>    88 full-color, die-cut counters<br/>    124 full-color Playing Cards (2 60-card decks and 4 Full Throttle Cards)<br/>    1 double-sided 11&quot; x 17&quot; Resource Sheet/Player Aid Card<br/>    2 double-sided Campaign Log Sheets (5 of each = 10 total)<br/>    4 Campaign Cards(8.5&quot; x 11&quot;) (3 Double-sided, 1 Single) = 7 Campaigns Total  <br/>    3 Target Display Cards(8.5&quot; x 11&quot;) (3 double-sided = 6 displays total)<br/><br/><br/>Designed by Dan Verssen<br/>Developed by Mike Lemick<br/><br/>",

All times, really - Aata Wakarewarewa has taken up the mantle of guardian of all history, and he keeps it safe, in his home, in his head, and in his heart.<br/><br/>Every so often, a monster will get hungry enough to attempt to storm the ancient warden's abode, but even when this attracts dozens of other monsters, the outcome is always the same. The Hakas of old ring out strong and the giant man crushes those who threaten the stories of his friends throughout time.<br/><br/>Another being has entered this time, however. Another human. The monsters made quite the ruckus attempting to get to him. Aata fears for this new-comer, but also worries that leaving his home for long will result in the loss of the stories he holds dearest. Still, with the opening of these temporal rifts, there might be a chance for Aata to once again don the mantle of Haka and create better stories for some of his less fortunate allies.<br/><br/>",

You could just &quot;remember&quot; your level, but would you trust some other player who tried that? We didn't think so. In the end, most gamers use a good old 10-sided die. And now we've got the ultimate, creme de la creme of 10-sided dice - six of them, all different colors! - in the Munchkin Dice set!<br/><br/>These oversized (35.6mm), swirly-shiny 10-siders all have the victorious Super Munchkin's picture in place of the &quot;0&quot;. When you reach Level 10 and claim victory, everyone will see that YOU are the ultimate Munchkin<br/><br/>And new dice just cry out for a new random-results table. So here it is. You'll like it (heh, heh)...<br/><br/>And finally, there are 14 brand-new, never-before-seen Munchkin cards to make your character even more overpowered. Try adding &quot;Master&quot; to your Class, earning you extra Treasure! Or become a &quot;High&quot; or &quot;Dark&quot; member of your Race! Or if you lose a battle, you can play &quot;Rocks Fall, Everyone Dies&quot; (featuring guest art from Something Positive's Randy Milholland!) - Everyone else shares your pain and loses a level! And if you die, everyone dies!!&quot; There's more &ndash; of course &ndash; but you're going to have to roll the Munchkin Dice to get them!<br/><br/>",

When Korvash grasped the hilt of the old blade he found in the tomb, his mind was consumed with dark visions; promises of a world on fire, and of his enemies kneeling before him. Filled with a desire to make his dreams a reality, he submitted to the presence within the sword, becoming its willing servant. Korvash would go on to take over his tribe, and lead them in a bloody conquest of the Hillsglade. Korvash&rsquo;s confidence and power grew with every victory. But the visions never stopped, and Scornblade&rsquo;s hunger was never sated.<br/><br/>The life of Mariusz Demont has never been easy, despite being born into nobility. A member of the Moontouched, Mariusz showed no sign of lycanthropy, relegating him to a life of service to<br/>his older, more blessed brothers. Treated with contempt throughout his life, it was during an attack that left his father Angren dead that Mariusz&rsquo;s gift revealed itself. Exploding into a rage-filled beast, he slaughtered friend and foe alike, his years of torment blinding him to his bloodlust. Despised by his own people as a traitor, Mariusz counted none his ally as he continued his cursed existence.<br/><br/>As Kilgore&rsquo;s armies grew, so too did the strength of his enemies. Many enemies were crushed on the battlefield, but others needed a subtler touch. These enemies attract the attention of Rath, Kilgore&rsquo;s most trusted and lethal assassin. A subterran of incredible agility and ferocity, he is the deadliest weapon in Kilgore&rsquo;s arsenal, able to slip quietly into any location, and execute his target. Rath served Kilgore loyally for many years, reveling in the chaos and destruction he wrought.<br/><br/>",

At the Universe of Tomorrow expo, you'll find tens of thousands of brands on display, featuring everything from the trendiest new sportswear to the latest in cybernetics. Join us today for a peek at tomorrow. The future is now!<br/><br/>What do the world's largest and wealthiest megacorps have cooking in their R&amp;D departments? You don't need to run to find out. All their latest projects are on display at The Universe of Tomorrow, the sixth and final Data Pack in the SanSan Cycle for Android: Netrunner. Its sixty cards (three copies each of twenty different cards) transport you to the expo's plazas and pavilions, where all the major players are eager to unveil their latest innovations. While Haas-Bioroid shows off its newest cybernetics at the Cybernetics Court and NBN pitches new products in Franchise City, you'll find Jinteki showing off its work at the Genetics Pavilion and the Weyland Consortium garnering public support for its newest initiatives at the Worlds Plaza.<br/><br/>Still, you'll find others who aren't swayed by the expo's optimism and shiny veneer. These include the game's Runners, who approach the expo and its technologies in their own fashions. In The Universe of Tomorrow, the game's Anarchs push to wrest control of the expo away from those who created it while Shapers view it as a place of wonder and an opportunity to learn more about themselves. Meanwhile, the game's Criminals see the expo as yet another opportunity to turn a profit.<br/><br/>",

They sell shares of their own companies to generate more cash and they are able to buy shares of other players&rsquo; companies. Thus, they can also earn a portion of the other players&rsquo; successes.<br/><br/>If you own all Power Grid maps and the expansion New Power Plants, this expansion offers 222 new possibilities to play Power Grid and Power Grid deluxe.<br/><br/>The rules for this expansion are based on module 9 &quot;Shares&quot; of the game 504. As 504 is a modular game system, we are able to take that module and mix it with Power Grid. The results are three different options to play this expansion. For the main game, we focused on the first option of the shares module, so you will discover a lot of surprises. Both variants are a little bit closer to the well-known Power Grid experience; they are for gamers who want to experiment with the game system.<br/><br/>",

Those expansions come in this package with:<br/><br/>Plastic Atlas monument (120 mm height)<br/>    15 Golden Apple tokens<br/>    Plastic weight token<br/>    Double-sided board<br/><br/>This expansion will have 2 ways of usage: Atlas overload / The Garden of the Hesperides!<br/><br/>In Garden of Hesperides Atlas will be very unique &quot;monument&quot; - here are some highlights:<br/><br/>Starts game already fully build (miniature comes in 1 part)<br/>    Players can send up up to 6 soldiers to it (instead of priests) <br/>    Thanks to sacrificing soldiers you can collect Golden Apples<br/>    Golden Apples are your additional resource you will be exchange instantly during game for various bonuses, such us: Healing Hero wound, saving solider from death, adding army strength to battle and exchanging more Apples will grant more epic bonuses.  <br/>    Atlas can carry alternative side of the board with The Garden of the Hesperides.<br/><br/>You will be able to use model for both Atlas overload and The Garden of the Hesperides - so by adding this expansion you get 2 gameplay additions! <br/>The Garden of the Hesperides expansion:<br/><br/>It will create a lot of cool situation and excitment with additional resources that can be instantly used in very different situation.<br/><br/>In this expansion, you can choose to start with Atlas as a 4th monument. He comes into the game fully build.<br/><br/>Players using their normal action can send maximum of 1 hoplite from any region (this rules will be different for 2 players) under Atlas. They stay there until all 6 slots will be covered (building monuments have no effect on them). Once 6 slots are fully covered, all players sacrifice hoplites to Atlas and in return he steals Golden Apples from Garden of the Hesperides.<br/><br/>Each player will get as many Golden apple tokens as many hoplites he had under monument.<br/><br/>Golden apples can be &quot;consumed&quot; at any time of the game and will have various effects: From healing hero wounds, saving hoplite's, adding strength to battle to more powerful effects if you will choose to consume more then one apple. <br/>Reminder - Atlas Overload rules<br/><br/>This expansion will negate winning condition, that the game ends once any monuments gets fully build.<br/><br/>You will place Atlas miniature next to a Board with Atlas Overload board and place &quot;weight&quot; token on 0 on the track. Whenever a new temple / part of monument or monster will appear on the Board - you will be adding weight on Atlas shoulder.<br/><br/>Once weight token will reach 12, Atlas systems shut-down and his crisis procedures are starting. From now on at the end of every players turn, you will decrease the weight value by 1. Once it will reach 0 - Atlas systems shut down completely and world falls apart. All players loose the game.<br/><br/>But you can help Atlas carry his weight! You will put &quot;Aid to Atlas&quot; quest token in one of the regions. Players can delegate their heroes to help atlas - if they will, they are removing their hero out of the board for the rest of the game, but increase the weight track by the value of their strength (so &quot;add turns&quot;).<br/><br/>This expansion will change a little bit dynamics of the game and create a ticking &quot;clock&quot; that will count the time before the inevitable end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominious look.&quot;<br/>     &ndash;J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring<br/><br/>The scenario introduced in Across the Ettenmoors thrusts you squarely into the heart of the troll-fells, a stretch of land rumored to be riddled with Trolls. As your heroes travel deeper into this dangerous territory with the hordes of Mount Gram at their back, they know there's no path for them but forward. The hills rise, the rocky ground lies quiet under dark clouds and flashes of lightning, and your heroes press on. In this scenario, the oppressive silence is broken only intermittently by the heavy footfalls of towering, lumbering Trolls. To complete your journey through the Ettenmoors, you don't need to slay some fell rider or uncover the Dark Lord's hidden servants; you need only survive&hellip;<br/><br/>Fortunately, the sixty new cards in Across the Ettenmoors include more than its scenario; they also introduce a new Tactics hero, who lends versatility to your fellowship's defensive efforts, as well as three copies each of nine different player cards. These touch on several different themes simultaneously, and you'll find new Signals, Mounts, and Ents taking their place alongside new Valour effects and a Tactics side quest.<br/><br/>",

They were then helped by some BGGers in playtesting/tweaking them and the final results are here.<br/><br/>This Promo expansion was reserved to the Kickstarters supporters of the Black Box Edition, but it's not excluded that there will be wider print runs.<br/>The expansion was printed in two versions, one with Ed Carter's cartooney artwork and the other using Heiko G&uuml;nther's essential style.<br/><br/>One note on compatibility: The expansion cards created with the original artwork are 63 mm x 88 mm.  The 2007 printing of GtR I.V had cards that were 64.5 mm x 89.5 mm.  If you sleeve your cards or have a later printing (which is the most common edition of I.V), then the promo cards will work fine.

Located on the banks of the Great River and surrounded by a scorching desert, Dunestar is an oasis where all doors close at nightfall, only to be reopened at dawn for fear of the dangers that haunt the darkness.<br/><br/>For in Dunestar darkness is a literal source of the Blight, the endless material of tales as old as time itself that have led the inhabitants to surround the city with walls that can store the light of the sun during the day and keep it lit at night. From a distance and at any point in time, Dunestar appears like a mirage-like shimmering beacon, a symbol of hope as much as it is an easy-to-find target for the Blight.<br/><br/>Speaking of the Blight, it manifests itself more visibly in Dunestar than in Aegis through black tendrils that can spread to all things, living or not, and the surrounding sands are now the tomb of many a warrior who have chosen to brave their fear and take the fight to the darkness itself.<br/><br/>The Locations of Dunestar are fully compatible with those of Aegis: this means you can mix and match Locations from Sands of Dunestar with those present in the Guildmaster and Agent sets; of course you can also play a setup with only Dunestar Locations.<br/><br/>There are no new core game rules in the expansion but each Location and Advancement adds their own twists and new mechanics to Edge of Darkness.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These cards offer immediate points for certain achievements. You can gain a lot of points by meeting the criteria, but the catch is twofold: you can only score one of these cards per game&mdash;and you can no longer bury any cards thereafter! In order to signify this, the card is placed landscape orientation on top of your buried cards pile. Timing is key for playing these well: Too soon, you might not score very many points; too late, the card you most want might get taken and scored by an opponent.<br/><br/>",

Place the top card of the deck face up. When players explore, they may choose to explore the top-most grove card instead of a cave card, the difference being that no story is read and the player can see the possible rewards.<br/><br/>When a player successfully claims the grove card, the player uses their characters to explore, rolling for lanterns.  The player chooses which reward they will gain (and can afford with their lanterns), after rolling the dice.  Only one reward may be chosen.<br/><br/>The player also gains the grove card, placing it adjacent to one of their buildings in their village. The grove card gives bonus village points at the end of the game if adjacent to a building card with a symbol matching the icon on the arrow on the grove card. When playing with the Groves expansion, once a building or grove has been placed adjacent to another building or grove, that card cannot be moved or rearranged on a later turn.<br/><br/>",

Sometimes villains turn to heroes and heroes to villains, blurring the lines, but the dichotomy is always there.<br/><br/>To represent this opposition, we developed a whole new mode which pits one player against another, each of them controlling their forces through their own command board, giving a more &ldquo;skirmish&rdquo; feel to the game. This mode adds an activation pool with a recovery system (very much like the Reserve and Fatigue zones work), dictating the pace of the game by allowing the player to decide how many tiles they want to activate each turn.<br/><br/>This expansion includes an additional plastic command board, 20 activation disks, and 55 tiles to play the Hero&rsquo;s characters. It also adds 12 ally miniatures on the heroes&rsquo; side, boosting their forces to face the already numerous goons of the villain&rsquo;s side. Finally, the expansion comes with 8 dedicated scenarios and, of course, the rules to play the Versus mode.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is up to him to &ldquo;activate&rdquo; some of the features of the Map, and to make life difficult for the Allies. He plays like all the other players, rolling dice to gather resources, and spending those resources to recruit Specialists and find Items. The main difference is that the German does not move: instead, he uses his Courage to draw cards from the &quot;Decorations&quot; deck, which give him special one-time abilities.<br/><br/>This expansion also includes 2 Battle Maps (Exercise Fabius &amp; Omaha Beach II) and a few counters for the game.<br/><br/>",

If you reuse the monument, you get 12 coins and 16 victory points. If you pay 4 coins to build it, you'll get even more points and additional movement on a track or end game points.<br/><br/>The market tiles have 2 sides - a small side (6 yellow, 2 extra green) and a large side (18 yellow, 6 extra green). After you do your normal income, if you've met these requirements, add (or flip) the market tile to your marketplace. If a market tile is present, gain bonus coins (1 for the small, 2 for large) which may be added to your coin pool or placed below the market. Coins in the market will bump the corresponding track or contribute to end game points. Your marketplace is also worth 5 (small) or 15 (large) points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Here's an overview of each side:<br/><br/>&bull; The Crystal Canyons: Most of the rumors about the Crystal Canyons agree that when the Darkness broke, the crystals still in the earth either corrupted or became inert. That hasn't stopped survivors seeking out the place where the first arcane crystals were found, delving into the mines that once fueled the empire. This board makes full use of the rules for high and low ground. The majority of spaces are high ground, looking down at the low ground of the canyon below. Using this terrain to your advantage will be key if you hope to claim victory.<br/><br/>&bull; The Warlock's Tower: Few know the truth of the great warlock and the powerful spells he once wove. They say that the tower sank below the waves when he died long ago. Now it has risen once more &mdash; what could that mean?<br/><br/>When playing on this board, players need to be aware of the trickery that the warlock's magic allows. Dotted around the map are four portal spaces, each counting as adjacent to each other for the purposes of movement and area attacks. Stranger yet is the Tower, a single space at the center of the board that seems to be the epicenter of the powerful magic of the area. While no character can start the game here, it contains one of the four portal spaces on the map and gives characters here line of sight to every other space on the board, making it a tempting space for a ranged character to take position, but one that will certainly leave them vulnerable to attack.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When a Trap Chamber gets drawn, that player puts their adventurer immediately on that tile. Each one has a different effect:<br/><br/>Moving Platform (x1)- The chamber gets moved around the board clockwise (without changing the orientation) until it finds a new resting position connected to an empty doorway with that orientation. If none exists, that player has to wait until one shows up.<br/><br/>Invocation Chamber (x1)- Place all adventurers (including yourself) in the chamber and now must start exploring from there. After discovery, a player can roll 3 keys to use this effect at another time.<br/><br/>Cliff (x2)- The player cannot leave this chamber until they roll either 3 keys or 3 torches (depending on the tile). After this is done, the adventurer gets put on the brick area and can leave as normal. Fellow adventurers can enter the room, but can only contribute golden masks.<br/><br/>Slide Trap (x1)- The player cannot return via the slanted entrance and must leave through the other entrances.<br/><br/>Time Chambers: 8 Chambers with 2, 3, or 4 getting mixed into the draw pile. When drawn, you put the certain sand timer on the first time icon. Once that time runs out, it gets flipped over onto the next time icon. Either certain tasks must be fulfilled or actions can't be done during the duration of the sand timer.<br/><br/>Prohibition Chambers (x4)- Uses the green sand timer. Certain actions cannot be performed (activating gems, using golden masks, exploring new chambers, entering the starting chamber)<br/><br/>Sacrifice Chamber (x1)- Uses the blue timer. Each player must put one die  in the chamber. Now they have 1 minute to rush to that chamber and retrieve their die or else they lose it.<br/><br/>Torch Chamber (x1)- Uses the blue timer. Players have to go to the chamber and roll 7 torches or else 2 players lose 1 die.<br/><br/>Lava Chambers (x2)- Uses the blue timer. Players have to fulfill 3 tasks to avoid punishment. If not all 3 get completed before the minute is over, the punishment next to the task gets triggered (add 3/2/1 gems to the depot)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Arkham Asylum, violent and criminally insane villains are locked away from Gotham's citizens in specially constructed cells. But often, these villains break free and it becomes Batman's job to bring them back to the asylum before their darkest whims are realized.<br/><br/>And, as is often the case, the Joker seems to be missing. Chances are he can be found in Jokerland, an abandoned fun fair the Clown Prince of Crime converted into his own playground. Here, attractions are functional, but from a mad man's point of view, and they aren&rsquo;t really fun in any conventional sense.<br/><br/>This expansion includes two game boards: Arkham Asylum and Jokerland, coming with three scenarios each. Jokerland will include various attractions, shaped as double-sided overlays, which provide a lot of replayability, as the combination of attractions change with each scenario. These attractions offer unique atmospheres and terrain types that change the way you navigate the map. Of course, you can&rsquo;t imagine an expansion like this without thinking about the villains. This box is absolutely brimming with bad guys and you won&rsquo;t find a single hero among them. Within you will find a horrific faceless version of the Joker, as well as the Mad Hatter and his inseparable sidekicks, the Tweedle brothers.<br/><br/>-description from the Kickstarter page<br/><br/>",

Lead your troops with Edmure Tully, Brynden &quot;Blackfish&quot; Tully, or Marq Piper, and lay waste to your foes with Tully River Riders, Tully Longbowmen, and the Warriors of Wayfarer&rsquo;s Rest.<br/><br/>New keywords such as Riverborn and Indirect Fire will give you an edge when fighting near rivers or hindering terrain, representing House Tully&rsquo;s familiarity with fighting in the Riverlands.<br/><br/>In addition to these new forces, Lords of the River also comes with a rules and battle plan book, new terrain, and House Tully Gambit and Skirmish cards.

Charlie Kibler&rsquo;s groundbreaking design covered the battle for Stalingrad around the &ldquo;Krasny Barrikady&rdquo; (or Red Barricades) ordnance factory on two historically accurate maps. Red Barricades offered a new ASL experience, introducing the concept of Campaign Games (CGs), multi-scenario battles spread over several days, alongside traditional scenarios depicting discrete historical actions. Three CGs and seven standalone scenarios covered the epic struggle for the heart of Stalin&rsquo;s city. The CGs presented a special challenge, as players not only directed their forces in action, but also built and customized their orders of battle, agonizing over how best to spend their precious resources to achieve overall victory in a grueling campaign. Charlie now brings us RED OCTOBER. This follow-on HASL adds two new maps, expanding the playing area covered in Red Barricades to include the &ldquo;Krasny Oktyabr&rdquo; (or Red October) factory complex. RED OCTOBER features three CGs and seven scenarios. Honed under the playtest guidance of Gary Fortenberry, Red October has now been submitted to MMP.<br/><br/>The two modules are combined into one package: Red Factories. The source files for Red Barricades are no longer available, so Charlie will take this opportunity to paint all four maps in a consistent style to assure they match. This also allows us to update the original Red Barricades material, taking into account accumulated clarifications and errata. Over the years a great deal of follow-on material has been released for Red Barricades, including a fourth campaign game. We are consolidating this material to create an expanded version of Red Barricades as part of the new release.<br/><br/>",

The Tcho-Tchos are a human-based faction representing the physically advanced, but ethically repulsive Tcho-Tcho tribe with the ability to interfere with other players by worshipping their Great Old Ones! Your own Great Old One, Ubbo-Sathla, is a tool and slave, not an object of worship!<br/><br/>Unique among Cthulhu Wars factions, the Tcho-Tchos have access to three high priests. In addition to the standard power generation and pacing benefits granted by recruiting additional high priests, the Tcho-Tchos exploit this advantage through two spellbooks (Hierophants and Martydom) based around high priests. The other distinction of the Tcho-Tchos is the way they interact with other factions; the spellbooks Tablet of the Gods and Idolotry enable the Tcho-Tcho faction to leech off other players, and Soulless makes your cultists less attractive to capture.<br/><br/>The Tcho-Tchos are generally weak defensively at first, but enemies are typically reluctant to attack an Area containing your High Priests (due to Martyrdom). If they don&rsquo;t send in Great Old Ones, the riff-raff can often be handled with Proto-Shoggoths--particularly with the Terror spellbook. The Tcho-Tchos have a major power advantage in the early game, because you normally spend 0 Power on your Great Old One. This power can be used not only to capture or build Gates, but to place units in enemy Start Areas to harass them with Tablets of the Gods.<br/><br/>",

They&rsquo;re loose cannons with a light approach to their life, but don&rsquo;t let that fool you, they are persistent. Some may think - well, but that&rsquo;s all? The very moment people believe that they know everything there is to know about them, the most bizarre things happen... things that are unexplainable...<br/><br/>The main advantage of this army is its ability to turn off the fundamental board space during the Battle with the use of Sandstorm. Some Sand Runner Warriors have Features like Modules which helps them support each other during Battles. Additionally, the HQ is double-sided, which allows it to eliminate a single, slower threat before it attacks. Their disadvantage is their low starting initiative, and the fact that an unfortunate change of the HQ side may result in the inability to kill adjacent units during the Battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Subtle and deceptive, Sulka manipulated her people into a civil war that consumed them, profiting herself with their suffering. Her dark magics and powers over the mind left both sides of the war as putty in her scaled hands, and soon Sulka was poised to control what little remained. Beneath her rule, her people turned to foul, long forbidden magics, and conquered Khemara in short order. Her empire would rule for hundreds of years, and it would be long past Sulka&rsquo;s time that her people would learn that their success was built on the machinations of evil and greed.<br/><br/>Akhet, the Skylord of Khemara, ruled the nation of Khemara until its dying days. A proud and noble King, Akhet commanded the skies as the bravest warrior his people had ever known, ruling the largest dynasty in the history of Fabulosa. Akhet led the charge in any battle he was a part of, breaking the enemy with his tireless ferocity. Even when a dark and sorcerous force arose to lead their most hated foe to victory, the Skylord led the charge, determined to cast down this hidden evil and bring light to the darkest hour of his people.<br/><br/>Records of the Darkmoon Occupation of Yunkaya speak of the legendary gnome Kolel, and her fearsome mount To&rsquo;paque. Armed with her deadly blowpipe, her combination of skill, speed, and tactical knowledge was believed to have saved thousands of her people, despite the destruction of her jungle. Whilst she is regarded as the greatest hero in Yunkayan history, to the Moontouched she is the boogeyman; she who brought fear to the forests.<br/><br/>",

The game takes a lighthearted look at fairy tales, movies, and books that involve the forest and applies those story ideas to the Agricola universe. The expansion is expected to be released widely in German and English and was first released at Spiel 2010.<br/><br/>This expansion has 24 cards that will add a new dimension to your games of Agricola, and it is incorporated into the game in a similar fashion to the X-Deck. Shuffle the cards together at the start of the game to form the Forest Deck; whenever any player claims three or more wood in a single action&mdash;whether by taking the 3 Wood/4 Wood action space or by taking wood that's accumulated on other spaces&mdash;you draw a card from the deck and use it. Many of the cards in the expansion will have an immediate effect on the game, though there are some Minor Improvements, Occupations, and new Action Spaces that may be drawn as well. There may even be other surprises lurking amongst the cards&mdash;after all, nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition (nor Gisem&uuml;ck the dragon)!<br/><br/>From the box:  &quot;When farmers are done with their daily tasks and gather around the warmth of their hearth, stories are told of revenants and werewolves, unicorns, witches, faeries, and other creatures of the wood. And those who have to go into the forest the next day to fell some trees might remember some of the old stories... and shudder.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Expanding brings new settlers onto the game board, while development takes place on the game's discovery board, with players either buying new scientific discoveries &ndash; such as medicine or phalanxes &ndash; or building architectural wonders. Each discovery brings you new powers, such as an upgrade in military strength due to the phalanx, and each wonder earns you points.<br/><br/>Olympos: Oikoumene consists of new Discovery tiles (to be mixed with those of the base game with some being discarded before play), new Wonder tiles (ditto), and five objective tiles. Two of the five objectives are randomly chosen prior to the start of the game, and whichever player first meets the stated objective claims the appropriate tile, which is worth 3 VPs at game's end.<br/><br/>",

Designed to get you right into the action, these Packs consist of boards and scenarios that further expand the ASL game system without requiring new rules sections.<br/><br/>Board 42 depicts a small village crossroads: stone buildings, walls, hedges, and orchards are complimented by ponds, grainfields, and woods. <br/>Board 43 has the feel of a farm compound surrounded by large grain fields; the open terrain is sure to provide great fields of fire for your marauding armor.<br/><br/>Eight new scenarios were specifically designed for use with these new boards. The actions in these battles span the length of the war-from 1939 to 1945-and the length of Europe-from Poland to Sicily, from Russia to France. Also included in the package is a color-coded flow chart to help you through the somewhat complicated OBA section of Chapter C.<br/><br/>ASL Action Pack #1 is not a complete game. Ownership of ASL, Beyond Valor, Yanks, and The Last Hurrah is required. Additionally, one of the eight scenarios requires the Italians (Hollow Legions) and board 10 (Partisan), one requires the Japanese (Code of Bushido), and one requires board 38 (Gung Ho).<br/><br/>Scenario list:<br/><br/>    AP1 The Ring - Germany 20 April 1945 - Russians vs Germans<br/>    AP2 Storm of Steel - Russia 5 July 1943 - Russians vs Germans<br/>    AP3 A Breezeless Day - France 2 January 1945 - Americans vs Germans<br/>    AP4 L'Abbaye Blanche - France 7 August 1944 - Americans vs Germans<br/>    AP5 Invisible Foes - Philippines 5 May 1945 - Japanese vs Americans<br/>    AP6 Savannah Rain - Sicily 11 July 1943 - Americans vs Germans/Italians<br/>    AP7 Directive Number Three - Russia 27 June 1941 - Russians vs Germans <br/>    AP8 Bloody Harvest - Poland 7 September 1939 - Polish vs Germans<br/><br/><br/><br/>All scenarios are available on MMP website (see weblinks section).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Attacks and counterattacks were the order of the day, any day...<br/><br/>In the early winter months of 1943 the Soviets were driving deep into German lines. Their hope was to destroy the southern wing of the German army while it was still reeling from its defeat at Stalingrad. There were large gaps in the German lines and a quick advance here could turn the tide of the war. Time after time the Panzergrenadier Division Grossdeutschland was called upon to reinforce, fill and stabilize weak points, and to close the gaps before the onslaught of Soviet troops could pour through. Oftentimes they were outnumbered and arrived just in the nick of time. As the front stabilized they were called upon again to spearhead the German drives against the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies.<br/><br/>The Soviets made several coordinated attacks during these months, one including Operation Star (February 2-19). During this offensive the Soviets took Belgorod and Kharkov. On the German side Manstein initiated his &quot;Backhand Blow&quot; on February 20. These battles went on through March 5 and beyond. Kharkov was taken back by the Germans in March during this push. Further German advances set up the upcoming summer&rsquo;s battle for Kursk.<br/><br/>The areas around and cities of Belgorod and Kharkov were key points in many of the battles above. Both cities were major transportation hubs and control of the roads between them was critical to both the Soviets and the Germans. Advancing, reinforcements and supply was dependent upon whoever controlled these cities. By the end of February the Soviets were pushing the limits of their endurance and were very near the end of their supply lines. The Germans needed these same cities to stop the enemy advance, form a semblance of a solid line, and prepare for the inevitable counterattacks. Fierce battles raged on and on with many villages and hills along the path changing hands multiple times. Each side's positions for the summer of 1943 campaigns were now at stake.<br/><br/>In this expansion for Fighting Formations we feature the Grossdeutschland Division as it fought in 1943 and early 1944 around the Ukrainian city of Kharkov. In each scenario, one player will take command of elements of this elite German formation while the other assumes control of the opposing forces of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Fighting Formations: Grossdeutschland Division's Battle for Kharkov expands upon the original Fighting Formations game by taking the Grossdeutschland Division into 1943 and the winter of 1944. This expansion features ten new scenarios, many using new units for the German and Soviet sides, played on ten new maps.<br/><br/>The new Battle for Kharkov playbook includes the following:<br/><br/>&bull; 10 new scenarios, including many smaller and shorter engagements<br/>&bull; Updated order of battle for GD, encompassing units and hardware added in 1943<br/>&bull; Historical notes covering GD&rsquo;s fighting in the Ukraine<br/><br/>In addition to the new playbook, the game includes 3 large and 2 small back-printed game maps (10 maps total), and a half-sized counter sheet containing new pieces for both the German and Soviet arsenals. New units include:<br/><br/>&bull; The Soviet SU-76M &ldquo;Suka&rdquo; open-topped assault gun;<br/>&bull; SU-85 tank destroyer;<br/>&bull; T-34C;<br/>&bull; T-26b light tank;<br/>&bull; The German Mk VI Tiger I<br/>&bull; PzIII M;<br/>&bull; 7.5cm PaK 40 anti-tank gun;<br/>&bull; Low quality troops representing GD artillerymen forced to fight on the front lines<br/><br/>The new scenarios included in Battle for Kharkov are:<br/><br/>&bull; Cut Off&mdash;Units of the Grossdeutschland Regiment find themselves surrounded by advancing Soviet forces on the highway leading north to Belgorod on 11 February 1943.<br/><br/>&bull; Who&rsquo;s Who&mdash;On 4 November 1943 near Krasny Orlik, Major Frantz, the Assault Gun Battalion commander, became quite wary when he heard the sounds of combat to his north. This northern flank was to be held by 9th Panzer. However, nothing could be seen over the high rail line that divided their two sections of the front. Were they still there and holding the line? Major Frantz decided to investigate the situation for himself and crossed the rail line with another assault gun. As he watched German troops and guns stream by in retreat he found himself in the midst of a tall cornfield with Russian T-34s streaming by at a range of 20 yards. They were faster than he was, and were by him in an instant&hellip;.<br/><br/>&bull; Duel&mdash;General Koniev's 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in December of 1943, with the aim to break through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. Multiple attacks were launched and Soviet troops were pouring through. The Panzergrenadier Grossdeutschland Division was brought up to close the gaps and help create a continuous defensive line. There was a critically vulnerable point along the road to the east of the village of Anniska. Here II Battalion, Panzergrenadier Regiment GD was struggling to hold its position. They were reinforced by the anti-aircraft troops of GD's Army FlaK Battalion just in the nick of time.<br/><br/>&bull; Welcome to Kharkov&mdash;21 January 1943: Reports from the Soviet Voronezh Front were that they had broken through the Hungarian army's positions and were advancing into the Novy Oskol area northwest of Kharkov. The Oskol river was being breached and preparations were in progress for further attacks towards Belgorod and Kharkov. General Kazakov's 69th Army was to attack southeast taking Volchansk and then on into Kharkov. Before the city, however, lay Volokonovka, which would provide an opportunity to hit the German's defensive line and test their resolve. Were the German forces finally weakening?<br/><br/>&bull; Charge&mdash;9 March 1943: The 3rd Squadron of &ldquo;Battle Group Strachwitz,&rdquo; after taking fire from nearby Alexandrovka, was assigned the job of taking out the Soviet forces there. Rather than wait, they immediately charged down the slopes into the heavy defensive fire coming directly at them.<br/><br/>&bull; Can We Hold?&mdash;March 17 started out quietly, but it was not to stay that way. The II Battalion of the Grenadier Regiment was sent into Borisovka to free up other GD units for attacking elsewhere. The relieved units left mid-morning. In the late afternoon about a dozen Soviet tanks and infantry charged in from the northeast, broke through the outer line, and drove directly into the village.<br/><br/>&bull; Overrun&mdash;18 February 1943: Kharkov had just fallen to the Soviets and a realignment of the German defensive line was formed to its south. The Grossdeutschland Division's Fusilier Regiment was given the assignment of defending a section of road leading to the west out of Kharkov towards Ljubotin. Rybalko's Soviet 3rd Tank Army was trying to break through this new line southwest of the city. One of his attacks took place on the outskirts of the town of Korotich near a collective farm.<br/><br/>&bull; Just in Time&mdash;The Soviet Voronezh Front had three armies poised to attack towards Kharkov in early February &lsquo;43 as part of Operation Star. Their forces had taken the city of Belgorod as this progressed and they were continuing to push southward to achieve their goal. Delaying actions to slow the advance was all the Germans were capable of at this point in time. The Soviet 40th Army was now northeast of Kharkov and was trying to find a seam between SS Reich units and the Grossdeutschland Division defending outside of Veseloye. They were looking for easy openings in the German line that could be taken advantage of and thus move down the Belgorod-Kharkov highway and into Kharkov itself. Grossdeutschland's reinforced Fusilier Regiment was in the direct line of this advance....<br/><br/>&bull; A Change of Orders&mdash;The Soviets 2nd Ukrainian Front launched a major offensive in late December of 1943 in southern Russia. The attacks began in earnest on 5 January 1944 with the goal of breaking through the German lines in the Kirovograd area. These caused multiple gaps in the German lines. On the evening of January 7 Grossdeutschland units were close at hand and were called upon to help remedy the tenuous situation.<br/><br/>&bull; Tigers&mdash;In early March &lsquo;43 the momentum in the area around the city of Kharkov was turning towards the Germans. Manstein's counterattack was pushing the Soviets back and gaining ground on all sides. Gaps were developing between the Soviet 40th and 69th Armies. On March 4 Grossdeutschland Division received its first Tiger tank company. Three days later GD jumped off, attacking towards Bogodukhov to the northwest of Kharkov.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of Valeria: Card Kingdoms &ndash; Darksworn is to introduce co-operative play into the Valeria world through groups of related books called Sagas. These books will lead the players through a story that unfolds during the game and offers greater immersion into the Valeria setting. New rules and cards will be introduced in each book, some lasting only through the current book and some persisting through the unfolding Saga, somewhat like a &quot;legacy game&quot;.<br/><br/>Darksworn uses six book-decks to tell a story of wonder, sacrifice, and adventure as you explore the territory west of Valeria and encounter a darkness that cannot go unchecked. Each book presents you with a set of new rules and several tasks that must be completed by your gaming group in order to advance to the next book in the saga. Within each book you'll find special boons to assist you and powerful monsters to challenge you. Your team will have to strike a balance between building effective tableaus of citizens that will allow you to complete the tasks and defending the decreasing center stacks of citizens that are the health of your kingdom.<br/><br/>The play area for Darksworn is much the same as an ordinary game of Valeria: Card Kingdoms, but there are some notable changes. The story board sits above the monster row. This is where each book's story and challenges are presented, where new rules are displayed, and where citizens captured by monster attacks languish in a dark oubliette. Walls provide additional protection from the attacking monsters, but if they make it past the walls, your citizen stacks are going to suffer. At the bottom of the play area is the Blessings Board where your devotion to the radiance of Aquila can grant you special powers, free captured citizens, and even rebuild fallen walls. If any of the monsters make it through to the Blessings Board, however, all is lost.<br/><br/>",

When either of these players meets the conditions showing on a medal, they claim the medal and turn it face down, earning 4vp for this medal at game's end.<br/><br/>",

Do you build provinces, raise armies, and conquer barbarians or build ports and ships to gain trade goods? Explore the strategies of Greece, Phoenicia, and Rome as you erect monuments, fend off disasters, and strive to feed your people.<br/><br/>Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age gives players different ways to build their empires: the Trade and Naval strategies of the Phoenicians, the conquests of Alexander the Great, and the engineering prowess and gradual absorption of new provinces by the Roman Republic.<br/><br/>Some copies of the game include the Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age – The Mediterranean Expansion in the base game box. The only indication of this was a sticker on the shrink that read &quot;MED expansion&quot; (and those boxes are heavier).<br/><br/>The Mediterranean expansion adds overseas settlements to the mix via a central pegboard that all players share. Players race to reap the benefits of strategic colonies: Crete for fleets; Spain for mining; Carthage for wheat; Gaul for armies; while Syracuse, the home of Archimedes, and Alexandria provide vital innovations.<br/><br/>The Mediterranean expansion is now available separately from Eagle Games, or as part of a new edition of the game. When sold on its own, the expansion does not contain rules or the updated score pads that include expansion scoring.<br/><br/>",

Players must work together to defend their castle, in the center of the board, from monsters that attack out of the forest at the edges of the board. Players trade cards, hit and slay monsters, and plan strategies together to keep their castle towers intact. The players either win or lose together, but only the player with the most victory points is declared the Master Slayer. Players must balance the survival of the group with their own desire to win.<br/><br/>To celebrate the ten-year anniversary, Fireside Games is releasing the Castle Panic Big Box. This extra-large box will contain the original Castle Panic game as well as all three expansions; The Wizard&rsquo;s Tower, The Dark Titan, and Engines of War. For the first time ever, fans both new and old will be able to get the core game and all the expansions together in one box.<br/><br/>Castle Panic Big Box will also include seven promotional game cards and five promotional Tower tokens, one of which has never been available before 2019. Players will also find an updated, comprehensive rulebook that covers the rules for the base game and all three expansions. The insert for the box has a space for all the game pieces and provides a handy way to organize everything players need.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There, accompanied by a small army of Elves and the few remaining D&uacute;nedain, they have fought through the outer guard and their captain, earning passage into the darkened hallways that lie ahead of them, but those hallways are eerily quiet, cold, and lonely in comparison to the battle raging outside&hellip;<br/><br/>In the new scenario from The Dread Realm, your heroes must make their final push through the halls of Carn D&ucirc;m to prevent an ancient evil from returning to the world, but the halls that initially appear so cold and empty are full of terrible sorcery and other evils. The dead don't lie quiet in Angmar, and you'll need to battle past wraiths, witches, and possibly even those members of your fellowship who fall in battle only to be reanimated by the dark magic that pervades the fortress and its catacombs.<br/><br/>",

With new technologies and new weapons, agents launch a strike against the alien base on the dark side of the Moon with the help of genetically modified agents, facing new alien menaces and terrible creatures.<br/><br/>The scenarios included in the expansion develop the storyline begun with the campaign included in the Core Set.<br/><br/>New Features:<br/><br/>Operation Strikeback adds many new features and new mechanics to make Galaxy Defenders even more strategic, more epic, and more fun.<br/><br/>The six missions included create an epic adventure, and for the first time our heroes will face the highest-ranked invaders in the Alien Army&hellip; the Master Aliens!<br/><br/>These lethal opponents are represented in the game by purple-color cards and figures. The Alien card of a Master Alien is twice the size of a standard card. It&rsquo;s also printed on both sides, each with a different set of stats for the Alien. The Master Alien can flip its card from one side to the other during combat, making its behaviour dynamic and unpredictable.<br/><br/>A common feature of Master Aliens is their &ldquo;Archenemy&rdquo; power. They are able to tell at a glance who&rsquo;s the most dangerous Agent on the battlefield [called the Menacing Agent] and their behavior is influenced by his or her position, rather than that of the closest Agent.<br/><br/>Such opponents cannot be fought without the right equipment, and the GD Agency has created new &ldquo;toys&rdquo; for the agents, such as the extremely versatile Power Suits. It improves the Agent&rsquo;s movement&hellip; and also gives him the ability to fly, seize bleeding companions and bring them to safety, and unleash a huge amount of firepower upon the alien scum!<br/><br/>Agents will also be endowed with psionic powers. The amazing mind powers they can develop allow them to walk through time, cause lethal and critical hits, predict the future, and much more!<br/><br/>Last, but not least, Agents are no longer alone in this war. A new Non-Player Character [NPC] system allows intelligent non-player agents to fight side by side with the GD squad.<br/><br/>NPCs in Galaxy Defenders are represented by yellow-colored cards and figures, and are handled by an A.I. mechanic similar to the system used for the Aliens. Each NPC card describes the behavior, stats, abilities, and special tactics of that character, so each NPC will act differently on the battlefield.<br/><br/>A player will have the choice to activate an NPC before or after his agent, adding a whole new level of strategy. Human signals in a mission may indicate the appearance of an NPC, who can be added to any existing mission.<br/><br/>",

Everything was hidden in sacred arcs, named Relics, that couldn't be controlled by others.<br/><br/>In Hyperborea: Light &amp; Shadow, these powerful Relics provide enormous knowledge and powers and the Soul Cubes are now in the hands of the six factions: Will the destiny of humans be dominated by war, or will wisdom and prosperity prevail between the realms of Hyperborea?<br/><br/>",

Player, who buys one of them, may place the miniature in a dedicated place on the board to gain new, powerful benefits. The location it will be placed is crucial, so it's essential to plan it right!<br/><br/>Qilin, as a symbol of prosperity, allows gathering additional wood, gold, stones, or Meditation from a chosen Location. Qilin is like an extraordinary Clerk - it doesn't need any empty slot, and when it is removed from the board, you may place a regular Clerk in its place for free.<br/>     <br/>     Yinglong, a mighty winged dragon, will inspire your soldiers. You place Yinglong on a chosen Wall Section - it allows you to gather your forces in this place instantly. Additionally, Soldiers under Yinglong presence fight with great zeal, counting as two when gaining Honor for defeated Hordes!<br/>     <br/>     Spirit Turtle, a sacred shelled beast, blesses your army with resilience, lowering your losses on one of the Wall Sections. How? Your Soldiers won't die here!<br/>     <br/>    Finally, Fenghuang, a blessed bird, is a symbol of virtue. Exchange all your Overseers for Fenghuang and place it on a chosen Location. It acts as triple Overseer of the maximum level in this Location. Additionally, your former Overseers go back to your pool, so you can recruit them again in the Barracks!<br/><br/><br/>Other 8 Advisors are similar to Advisors from the core game, but in the case of the essential mechanics, the more the better - more choice and more replayability (but the base game offers tons of options).<br/><br/>Here are a few examples:<br/><br/>Allow your Cavalry to move freely between Walls!<br/>     <br/>    Gain more precious Honor if you are a leader!<br/>     <br/>    Take 1 Artifact and make it your own!<br/>     <br/>    Ignore the Honor penalty when you activate Location on your own!<br/><br/><br/>8 new Tactic cards<br/><br/>2 new types of Tactic card (4 copies of each) will change your strategy.<br/><br/>Here's your new options during battles:<br/><br/>Hold the Line! - it rewards cooperation: all players that defend the Wall Section gain additional Honor. But, of course, you will gain the best benefit ;)<br/><br/>Wipeout - raise the stakes! If you win, your Soldiers may attack again this turn! If not, they will die.<br/>&ldquo;Ancient Chronicle&rdquo; Game Modes<br/><br/>6 new &ldquo;Ancient Chronicle&rdquo; Game Modes bringing further challenges for your game. Plan on how to gain an advantage against other clans using new rules introduced during each Year of the game.<br/><br/>More themes and background stories, more exciting new special rules, buildings, setup changes and so on.<br/>10 Relics<br/><br/>Players gain a new option of scoring - they may use new type of cards: Relics. Relics are similar to Artifacts, but:<br/><br/>You can upgrade them, so they will grant better benefits for all (but you also give a signal to your opponents that you're interested in this Relic),<br/>     <br/>    You gain the rewards according to the place won on this Relic - the first place will gain the best bonus, the second a little worse, and so on.<br/>     <br/>    Some of the Relics may activated in each Year, not only at the end of the game<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Aliens are coming!<br/><br/>The X Deck is a not-entirely-serious expansion for Uwe Rosenberg's Agricola, to be released through Spielbox magazine in German and through Lookout Games in English.<br/><br/>The October 15, 2008, issue of Spielbox magazine includes a standalone add-on deck (in German) for Agricola that&rsquo;s been dubbed the &ldquo;X-deck.&rdquo; The deck includes 24 cards of 5 different types (Alien Actions, Merchants from Outer Space, Alien Artifacts, Alien Events, and Alien Occupations). Art for this expansion is by Klemens Franz, the same artist who did the work for Agricola.<br/><br/>The aliens arrive when the players create a Quarry; that is, when the &quot;1 Stone&quot; card from Stage II of the game (Rounds 5-7) is revealed. Whenever a player takes this action, they also draw the top card from the Alien Encounter Deck (X Deck). (Note that this does not apply to the &quot;1 Stone&quot; card that appears during Stage IV (Rounds 10-11).) Of course, you also take any Stone that is on the space.<br/><br/>An English edition of this expansion has been available directly from Lookout Games and can be obtained by donating to a fundraiser via PayPal. It is also available via Agricola: The Goodies Expansion.<br/><br/>",

The Wall Fresco &ndash; By refreshing sections of a wall fresco, the players can gain fame, glory, and a regular paint supply, thus saving money. What fresco painter would pass up such an opportunity?<br/><br/><br/><br/>    10. The Medico &ndash; The time schedule for restoring the fresco is hard enough to meet, but now the apprentices are taking ill, one after the other. How can you finish the work on time?

        "description": "Keltis is a multi-player game based on Lost Cities, with some rules changes, later published with Knizia's original rules and theme as Lost Cities: The Board Game.<br/><br/>Players play cards to move their playing pieces along stone paths. Cards show one of five different colors/symbols, each corresponding to one path; in addition, each card shows a number (0-10, twice each). In each color, each player can play his cards in either ascending or descending order. As in Lost Cities, it's better to concentrate on a few paths since the final spaces on a path grant high points, but ending early gives negative ones.<br/><br/>The active player plays one card (out of a hand of eight) or discards one, then moves the corresponding playing piece on the path. Many of the spaces have a token that grants some bonus: either immediate points (counted on the scoring track), an extra move on a path, or wishing stones that are needed at game end to avoid negative points.<br/><br/>The game ends when five playing pieces (from any combination of players) have reached the seventh (or higher) space on their respective paths. Now, scoring happens: <br/><br/>     Pieces that moved only 1-3 steps earn negative points (-4, -3, -2).<br/>     Pieces with 4+ steps earn points (1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 10). <br/>     One piece of each player twice the height of other pieces scores double, either positive or negative. <br/>     Holding fewer than two wish stones earns negative points (-3 / -4), while a collection of five or more stones yields a bonus of 10 points.<br/><br/><br/>All endgame points are added to any scored during the game. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Included expansion: This new board provides new challenges and requires new ways of thinking. The new gameboard is arranged portrait-style rather than the landscape orientation of the original, and the five roads have been replaced by a network of intersecting and overlapping roads, so you can continue on a different color or even choose which way to go. The point values also change during your way, not simply increasing.<br/>Also you have 5 cairns on the board, with each cairn having a stack of five stones in a particular color. When you reach a spot on that track, you claim the top stone. Stones of all five colors are awarded 10 points; collecting three stones of the same color is also worth 10 points, too.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scorched Earth, the sequel to Fire in the East, covers the war in the Soviet Union from April 1942 through December 1944. Scorched Earth uses Fire in the East as a base (and cannot be played without Fire in the East), adding more maps, counters, and rules. The game requires two players - one for the Germans and one for the Soviets - or two teams of players. The size of the game makes it well-suited for team play, with up to 3 or 4 players per side.<br/><br/>Scorched Earth's three maps extend the coverage of those in Fire in the East. The maps cover: The Volga River, from its heavily forested northwestern reaches to its mouth at the edge of the deserts of Asia; the western shores of the Caspian Sea; the Caucasus Mountains area of the USSR, to the borders of Turkey and Iran.<br/><br/>Scorched Earth's sixteen counter sheets (3840 counters total) encompass the diversity of forces in this theatre. All Axis forces engaged in the east are shown, from German through the Axis Allies (Finnish, Hungarian, Italian, Rumanian, Slovakian), and including the eastern troops - Soviet citizens fighting against their government. The entire range of Soviet forces is given: regulars, guards, NKVD, militia, and the foreign contingents in the Red Army, including the Poles, Czechs, and even the German formations raised from prisoners of war. Over 40 different types of ground units are represented, from divisions (including division-sized Soviet Corps) to individual batteries of super-heavy artillery, such as tank corps, panzergrenadier divisions, artillery divisions, parachute brigades, and commando battalions. Aircraft units cover the many new aircraft sent to the front, such as the Fw 190 fighters and ground attack aircraft, Hs 129 tank-busters, A-20 and B-25 lend-lease bombers, Yak-9DD long-range fighters, and even late-war German jet aircraft.<br/><br/>Scorched Earth's rules expand upon those in Fire in the East to cover the rest of the war in the USSR. New features include:<br/><br/>    Abilities of new aircraft types  <br/>    Partisan warfare <br/>    Oilfields<br/>    Surrender and defection of Germany's eastern front allies<br/>    Continual upgrading of armored and mechanized forces<br/>    Use of artillery divisions <br/>    Allied Lend-Lease to the USSR<br/><br/><br/>Scorched Earth's orders of battle present in game terms the most detailed and accurate orders of battle ever published for the Russian front. The grand campaign game can be played to the end of 1944 from two starting points: from June 1941 or April 1942. The rules also allow the 1941 and 1942 campaigns to be played separately, giving two campaign games shorter in playing time than the grand campaign game.  Scorched Earth covers the largest land campaign in history with the scope it deserves. It presents a detailed, exciting game situation, challenging and rewarding the players' strategic and tactical skills.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    3840 die-cut counters (16 countersheets: Europa 6A, 7A, 8A, 9A, 10A, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56)<br/>    Three maps (Europa #7A, 8A and 9A)<br/>    One rules booklet<br/>    Two orders of battle booklets (Axis &amp; Soviet)<br/>    Scorched Earth Version 1.5 Errata - March 1992<br/>    One set of game charts:<br/>        Combat Result/Terrain Effects Chart (x2)<br/>        Unit Identification Chart/Counter Formats<br/>        Turn Record Chart<br/>        Soviet Game Chart/1942 Scenario Front Line Maps - North<br/>        Axis Game Chart/1942 Scenario Front Line Maps - South<br/>        Europa marker Display<br/>        Master Sequence of Play/Special Dates List<br/>        Europa Map Legend<br/>        Map Guide<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>(source: back of the box and user's description)<br/><br/>",

It adds seven new playable heroes (Red Robin, Batwing, Batman Armored Suit, Bruce Wayne, Alfred, Oracle, Julia Pennyworth), three sorts of new allies (T-Rex, Bats, Bat Robots), and two new maps (Wayne Manor and the Batcave).<br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>This expansion includes two game boards: Wayne Manor and the Batcave, each of which includes three scenarios. The Batcave is divided into 4 boards to allow players to move into the well-known location under Wayne manor, but also to other buildings, like those created by Batman Inc.<br/><br/>This expansion contains only hero miniatures, like Bruce Wayne, Alfred and his daughter Julia. It also includes ally tiles for use in scenarios, or with the Command skill, and in the Versus expansion. Oh, and there is also a T-Rex!<br/><br/>The Batcave:<br/>This game board is separated in 4 parts, connected by an elevator that splits the moves of the characters and forces players to better coordinate their strategy, either as the heroes or the villain. The Batcave can lead to Wayne manor, or to another location, depending whether the scenario involves one of the auxiliary locations scattered all over Gotham. Not all components are used at the same time in every scenario, which makes for greater replayability. The Batcave is almost a character of its own and features myriad defenses such as bat-robots to ward off would-be intruders.<br/><br/>The T-Rex:<br/>This massive and fierce character is as impressive as you can imagine and is controlled using a double tile. In the comics, it is a mechanized defensive asset, and it doesn&rsquo;t just look threatening. Any intruder looking to enter the trophy room would be wise to think twice while this prehistoric sentry stands watch. From a gameplay perspective, it cannot perform any manipulation or thought actions, but its strength and potential to cause mayhem are tremendous.<br/><br/>Oracle:<br/>This character isn't a fighter like the others, but she is a genius hacker and the best tactician in the game. She also comes with a tile of three characters to command. Her allies can be given orders and pushed to perform extra moves.<br/><br/>Alfred:<br/>Bruce's butler is an excellent tactician and support character. Unlike his master Bruce, Alfred will take up arms to defend his loved ones. He may look old, but Alfred Pennyworth is far from feeble.<br/><br/>Armored Suit Batman:<br/>The Wayne Manor/Batcave expansion features the iconic armor Batman donned to fight off the owls foolish enough to invade his lair. This armored Batman is the only hero who can make melee attacks using black dice; this means rolling dice with the highest damage potential in the game. But this great potential comes with a measure of risk as there is also a chance you will miss completely. This armor may also causes the villain to think twice before attacking because it possesses the best defense capabilities of all the heroes.<br/><br/>&mdash; from Kickstarter<br/><br/>",

This resource brings great opportunity but also danger to the intrepid settlers as they make their mark on the island, claiming it for their own.<br/><br/>First, the good news: Oil can increase resource yields and allow a settlement to grow much faster than normal. The bad news is that players need to monitor the damage their oil use does to the environment and will eventually have to contend with global climate devastation which can result in all players losing the game!<br/><br/>Catan Scenarios: Oil Springs brings home the challenges and opportunities of the current global economy to players while adding more fun and complexity to the Catan experience.<br/><br/>Catan Scenarios: Oil Springs is offered both as a PnP game available on the Catan website, as well as a published edition.  The packaging states &quot;revenue from the sales of the cardboard version of this scenario will be used to cover the expenses of graphics and printing.

Canister, machine-gun fire, and courage had broken Ichiki's back. As dawn rose above the sand bar it was time for the Marines to mop up...<br/><br/>September 13, 1942...The Japanese under Colonel Kawaguchi were pressing hard to take the Lunga Ridge from Edson's Raiders. The Marines bent, but had not yet broken, and were making a last stand on the final defensive obstacle between the Japanese and Henderson Field. Outnumbered, the Raiders had but one advantage - artillery. As shell after shell slammed into the Japanese staging areas, they elect to attack and fight rather than die staging for an assault. With a fateful &quot;BANZAI!&quot; they charge up the hill one more time...<br/><br/>September 27, 1942...The Marines, anxious to take the fight to the Japanese, mount an ambitious plan to surround and destroy the majority of the Japanese forces at the moutn of the Matanikau River. A three-pronged attack, each prong depending on the others succeeding, was devised. When the first attack to take the river crossing points failed, messages to cancel the remainder of the offensive were never received and the remaining elements of the offensive soon went from the hunters to the hunted. Could Marine Corps legend Chesty Puller extract his men from this sticky situation...<br/><br/>December 25, 1942...Army troops, having taken over for most of the Marine formations, were eager to prove their mettle on the assault. Their first task on the long list of objectives required to clear the island was a strongpoint called the Gifu. This particularly nasty position of pillboxes and machine-guns would prove to be a tough nut to crack, however...<br/><br/>History. That's why many gamers enjoy ASL-its ability to simulate a historical battle. Yet how can you study and entire campaign while still enjoying your favorite tactical game? This package addresses that need. A Historical Study will touch upon all aspects of a campaign either by incorporating part of it into a campaign game or by presenting a representative scenario to help enlighten the player as to why particular choices may have been made. All while enjoying the world's best squad-level tactical game.<br/><br/>Operation: Watchtower is the first of the Historical Studies, which is appropriate since Guadalcanal was the first American offensive in the Pacific. Hopefully, once a player has played through the sixteen scenarios within, they'll better understand the campaign and its outcome.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>        1 42x30 Historical Map<br/>        1 Countersheet of 1/2&quot; counters<br/>        16 scenarios on cardstock<br/>        Chapter Z Additions for the Edson's Ridge mini-HASL<br/>        1 Historical Writeup of the campaign<br/><br/><br/>Time Scale:    2 minutes per Game Turn<br/>Unit Scale:    5 to 10 men, plus individual leaders, vehicles, guns<br/>Map Scale    40 meters per hex<br/>Players:    2 (also suitable for solitaire or team play)<br/>Playing Time:    Varies with scenario played; on average, two hours<br/>Complexity:    High<br/>Solitaire Suitability:    Medium<br/><br/>",

New ship cards take the form of a Hypernet Craft that can be placed in any of your sectors instead of having an assigned sector. Some of the new colonies feature ongoing abilities that give you a power to use for the rest of the game instead of just scoring victory points.<br/><br/>Biodome is available direct from the publisher's website.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Unpleasant Dreams brings the wonders and horrors of the Dreamlands to the table. Mix the 55 transparent cards in this set together with your copy of Cthulhu Gloom to add morbid new Modifiers, Events, Stories, Transformations, and Untimely Deaths, and a new family that calls the Dreamlands their home. Can you survive the creeping chaos of Nyarlathotep? Will your shantak be a loyal mount, or will you meet your end when you approach Azathoth? Dive into your own unpleasant dreams to find out!<br/><br/>In addition to allowing for game play with up to six players, Unpleasant Dreams includes two new Character cards called Unwelcome Guests. Deal one or both face up to the table's center at the the start of the game. Guests &quot;follow&quot; the card types noted on them; no matter where it currently is, a living Guest immediately moves to join the family of the character on which one of its &quot;trigger&quot; cards is played. All its Modifiers are moved with it, and it's considered a member of that family until it moves again. This may delay the game's end if a final play draws a Guest to the near-winner's family!<br/><br/>",

Play as one of four new archetypes, or continue your campaign with your existing characters from the Folklore: The Affliction core game and Dark Tales expansion. In this new expansion the design team at Twin Fire takes us down to the dark streets and up to the rooftops in the towns of Kremel. Then, travel further into the world with new stories, characters, monsters and afflictions. Explore new combat mechanisms that can be used in this new box expansion as well as be added to the core game and Dark Tales expansion.<br/><br/>You have traveled the dangerous byways of Kremel, and finally walk past the gates of the town at twilight. Once eager to see so many people bustling in the streets, you have grown jaded and keep an eye out for pickpockets. Beneath the buildings, stone and wood edifices, you notice the layers of dust and grime, and a deepening of the shadows. A shopkeeper waves in recognition, and looks to you in hopes of news from the outside world. But you have a darker destination in mind, and no time to spare. You nod back, and take to the rooftops, and later descend to the sewers, where you hope to find the missing piece that will take you to the one place that will doom or save this land...the Dark Spire.<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>     Extend your campaign with six new full-length stories and many hours of replayable content<br/>     Expand your urban crawl by adding new Town Event cards<br/>     New mechanisms include initiative, rooftop combat, and hazards <br/>     Four new characters to choose from: the Warlord, Huntress, Gentleman, and Viper Maiden<br/>     New abilities, rumors, artifacts, afflictions, creatures, companions, maps, monsters, and items<br/><br/><br/>",

This Extended Edition is the Kickstarter Edition:<br/><br/><br/>    570 Cards (325 in regular edition + 245 from Crisis &amp; Control)<br/>    248 Cardboard tokens (222 + 26)<br/>    2 rule books (1 + 1)<br/><br/><br/><br/>Hegemony: Lead Your Class to Victory base game<br/><br/>The Nation is in disarray and a war is waging between the classes. The working class faces a dismantled welfare system, the capitalists are losing their hard-earned profits, the middle class is gradually fading and the state is sinking into a deep deficit. Amidst all this chaos, the only person who can provide guidance is... you. Will you take the side of the working class and fight for social reforms? Or will you stand with the corporations and the free market? Will you help the government try to keep it all together, or will you try to enforce your agenda no matter the cost to the country?<br/><br/>Hegemony is an asymmetric politico-economic card-driven board game for 2-4 players that puts you in the role of one of the socio-economic groups in a fictional state: The Working Class, the Middle Class, the Capitalist Class and the State itself.<br/><br/>The Working class controls the workers. The Capitalist class controls the companies. The Middle class combines elements from both the Working class and the Capitalist. It has workers who can work in the Capitalist's companies but it can also build companies of its own, yet smaller. Finally the State is trying to keep everyone happy, providing benefits and subsidies when needed but trying also to maintain a steady income through taxes to avoid going into debt.<br/><br/>While players have their own separate goals, they are all limited by a series of policies that affect most of their actions, like Taxation, Labor Market, Foreign Trade etc. Voting on those policies and using their influence to change them is also very important. Through careful planning, strategic actions and political maneuvering, you will do your best to increase the power of your class and carry out your agenda. Will you be the one to lead your class to victory?<br/><br/>Hegemony is heavily based on actual academic principles such as Social-Democracy, Neoliberalism, Nationalism and Globalism, and allows players to see their real world applications through engaging gameplay. There are many ways to achieve hegemony- which one will you take?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Crisis &amp; Control<br/><br/>You have successfully led your class to victory... but the battle of ideologies is far from over! The old world is in crisis, and the new world struggles to regain control. Now is the time to make a difference!<br/><br/>Crisis &amp; Control offers new challenges and additional game modes that will test your governance skills like never before! Crisis Response cards and Alternative Events add more diversity to your games, class-specific Hidden Agendas incentivize new politico-economic strategies, and the Automas provided allow you to experience all of the game&rsquo;s roles, no matter the player count!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>Crisis &amp; Control contains all the gameplay material that was given in the form of stretch goals during Hegemony's Kickstarter campaign. All that content was included in the Extended Edition of Hegemony which is what the campaign's backers received.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the back:)<br/><br/>A Decade of War, the sixth &quot;action pack&quot; for Advanced Squad Leader, covers nearly ten years of world-wide conflict, from the 1936 Nationalist drive to capture Madrid during the Spanish Civil War, to Japanese engagements with the Allies in Asia and the Philippines, to the death throes of the Third Reich on the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>The ten scenarios spanning this period were developed with tournament players in mind, and are designed for an &quot;expert&quot; level of game knowledge; yet they are accessible to the casual player as well since A Decade of War includes, for the first time, optional &quot;Australian Balancing System&quot; (ABS) provisions for each scenario. (ABS was devised almost two decades ago to allow for scenario side selection via a series of escalating handicap bids. Each player secretly bids on which side and at what handicap level they wish to play; the higher the bid, the greater the handicap.)<br/><br/>Three double-sided 11x16 mounted maps, including a unique river bend, round out the package. Each is completely geomorphic, and compatible with previous ASL mapboards. Offering new and novel map configurations, these are sure to spark the interest of designers and players alike.<br/> A Decade of War contains: <br/><br/>    3 ASL 11x16 double-sided geomorphic mapboards (1a/b, 2a/b, 3a/b) <br/>    10 ASL scenarios featuring the new maps.<br/><br/><br/>Scenarios: <br/><br/>    AP53 Far From Home - 7 turns, 18 December 1936, Boadilla del Monte, Spain <br/>    AP54 800 Heroes - 5 1/2 turns, 29 October 1937, Shanghai, China <br/>    AP55 The Generalissimo's Own- 6 1/2 turns, 26 May 1938, Lanfeng, China <br/>    AP56 Quagmire - 10 turns, 22 September 1939, Shangfu, China <br/>    AP57 Kleckerweise - 9 turns, 14 May 1940, Bulson Road, France <br/>    AP58 Sat Sri Akal! - 7 turns, 2 January 1942, Kampar, Malaya <br/>    AP59 Taking Heads - 6 1/2 turns, I January 1942, Concepcion, Luzon <br/>    AP60 Nisbne, Nyet! - 7 1/2 turns, 10 February 1943, Nishne-Gnilovskaya, Russia <br/>    AP61 Desobry Defiant - 7 turns, 19 December 1944, Noville, Belgium <br/>    AP62 Shouting into the Storm - 6 1/2 turns, 8 February 1945, Klein-Silber, Germany<br/><br/><br/>A Decade of War is not a complete product, and assumes the buyer owns the core Advanced Squad Leader game system.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(source: ?)&quot;MMP has reached an agreement with three ASL legends to produce a new Action Pack. AP6&mdash;The Decade of War&mdash;will have three new mapboards and ten scenarios using them.<br/><br/>When talking ASL, Gary Fortenberry, Charlie Kibler, and Bob McNamara need no introduction; all three were major figures in ASL at The Avalon Hill Game Company before MMP took over ASL development. The new mapboards&mdash;based on a concept that Gary has been toying with for a number of years&mdash;resemble two half-boards placed side-by-side and allow new mapboard configurations not possible before. The scenarios consist of a battle a year for the ten years 1936-1945 and feature the combined research and design skills of Fort, Charlie, and Mac.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Note: This listing covers only the compilation versions of Last Will that include both the base game and the expansion; for a listing of the expansion-only versions, go to Last Will: Getting Sacked).<br/><br/>In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.<br/><br/>In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.<br/><br/>Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:<br/><br/>Take a card on display and add it to your hand.<br/>    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.<br/>    Visit the opera and spend $2.<br/>    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.<br/>    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.<br/><br/>Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.<br/><br/>If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.<br/><br/><br/>In Last Will: Getting Sacked, the lawyers have found a hidden clause in your uncle's last will. Spending money faster than all your relatives will not be enough. To inherit your uncle's fortune, you must also lose your job! After all, your uncle's heritage can't go to someone who's employed!<br/><br/>With this expansion added to Last Will, each player begins the game with a job card that provides him with a regular income each turn and details a number of things the player must do in order to get fired. Unlike in real life, it can be difficult to persuade your employer to give you the old heave-ho. When you miss work, he's inclined to be charitable because he liked your uncle and he's sorry for your loss. To make him angry, you need to get caught living it up when you should be working. He won't sack you straight away, but he will at least dock your salary.<br/><br/>Once per round, you are able to reduce your income by completing one of the things listed on the job card, earning you a demotion. Even your kindly old boss has his limits, though; when you earn enough demotions to cancel out every line of income, you can discard your employment card. Congratulations: You have been sacked and are one step closer to winning the game!<br/><br/>You will also have a chance to find yourself a good, demanding wife. A wedding is such a romantic way to spend piles of money in a hurry, right? The expansion has six nuptial cards, so get down on one knee and ask the question!<br/><br/>Also, with this expansion, each game can have a different planning board to bring additional variety to the game. When you set up the game boards, you randomly select the eight plan tiles that will be used in the game.<br/><br/>",

This &quot;fruit&quot; of the Lonely Tree is its true prize, as eating these conglomerations of phytohormones and human gristle can have beneficial (albeit bizarre) side effects. However, make sure to handle them gently while they are close to the tree, as the chemical volatility of the unripened morsels doubles as the Lonely Tree's primary form of self-defense!<br/><br/>",

The hero players must join forces to try to stop the rise to power of one of the Night Kings of the dark god Izrador. Best of all, the Night King is not merely a game mechanic ... it is another player! The Night King player can affect the outcomes of battles, send Challenges across the board to hunt down the heroes, and manipulate environmental effects. The heroes must infiltrate the Night King's strongholds and destroy his black mirrors, the source of Izrador's power. Meanwhile, each time a hero must escape or is knocked out, there is a chance that the threat level will rise. When the threat level reaches 10, the Night King unleashes all of his forces on Eredane, wiping out the heroes and any who stand in his way! This expansion adds an unprecedented level of player interaction to the Runebound play experience.&quot;<br/><br/>Runebound: Midnight is the second Big Box Expansion for Runebound: Second Edition. It replaces some elements of the original game - including the map and playable characters - to provide a new and different gaming experience. This expansion ushers the Midnight RPG Mythos into the Runebound universe.<br/><br/>You must own the Runebound basic game to play this expansion.<br/><br/>",

Armed with a new generation of weapons and wearing awesome Power Armor, the agents are prepared to fight the worst enemy they have ever faced.<br/><br/>New Features:<br/><br/>In Extinction Protocol, the journey through the six missions begins as the Agents reach the Alien planet. To fight their enemy, they must enter into a darkness made of caves and corridors, across underground lakes, through alien temples, and face the ultimate challenge in the terrible Queen&rsquo;s chamber.<br/><br/>The underground of the alien planet is formed by thousands of narrowing corridors and caves. To properly represent this new setting, a new system of modular tiles creates the game board, using smaller tiles with a variable number of areas. The tiles remain fully compatible with all the maps of the GD Universe to create custom missions. This new system, combined with standard map tiles create an unique game experience.<br/><br/>Below the ground, alien menaces lurk in the shadows. Insidious opponents &ndash; and sometimes, precious resources &ndash; will appear on the battlefield as Stationary Signals, that will only be revealed when you are close to them&hellip; In addition, the doors of the underground Alien Base are protected by an enhanced security system that allows the access only to the owners of the right encrypted keys!<br/><br/>To accomplish the final task, our agents will be dressed and armed like gods of war! Thanks to the new GD-Ranks each agent can acquire new skills and tactics, including tactics that can be used without spending actions.<br/><br/>More important, they will make the battlefield to quake with their Power Armors, the ultimate weapons created by Mankind. The use of these exoskeletons empowers the Agents with new abilities and allow the Agency to deploy devastating firepower against their Alien opponents.<br/><br/>Each Power Armor is represented by a unique figure and by its Power Armor Profile Sheet. Unlike Power Suits, that are used by any character, each Agent uses a unique style of armor. Each armor has completely different weapons and powers, and transforms the Agent in a lethal war machine!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Born in the cruel climate of the Mountains of the Moon, the clansmen of the Stone Crows, Black Ears, and Burned Men are of a violent breed. Uncivilized, uncouth, and unrefined, these men and women live to kill, and they do it well.<br/><br/>Tribes of the Vale introduces the clansmen to Battles of Westeros as an ally force, meaning they can supplement House Lannister or, if playing with the Skirmish rules, House Stark from the Core Set. Ally forces such as those found in Tribes of the Vale are represented as tan colored miniatures on the board, differentiating them from the forces of the house they are supporting. This provides greater customization for Skirmish battles and allows players to easily find their allied troops on the field during battle.<br/><br/>Included in Tribes of the Vale are are three new commanders and three new unit types. Shagga, Son of Dolf is a ruthless barbarian of the Stone Crows, capable of wielding two massive battle axes better than some men handle one. Timett, Son of Timett earned his place as the Red Hand of the Burned Men by taking out his own eye. A fearless expert swordsmen, Timett rarely fails to kill anyone he means to. Finally, Chella, Daughter of Cheyk is a vicious woman, decorating herself with the ears of her enemies.<br/><br/>In addition to these new forces, Tribes of the Vale also comes with a rules and battle plan book, new terrain, and Clansmen Gambit and Skirmish cards.<br/><br/>",

In the 19th century, there were 26 brick factories in Rheiderland alone, a small part of East Frisia along the river Ems. Today there are only 2 brick factories left in all East Frisia, one of which is the peatfired brick factory in Nenndorf, a neighboring village of Arle. It is the only brick factory left in Europe using peat as fuel. Its 40 meter long kiln is burning up to 3 million bricks per year.<br/><br/>Story: East Frisia was always abundant in peat and water (you could even say overabundant). When industrial peat cutting was introduced in the early 20th century, the power plant in Wiesmoor was built in order to press ahead with the moor colonization. It went into operation in 1909 and was producing electricity until 1965, burning through up to 120,000 tons of peat per year. In 1925, a greenhouse plantation was built next to the power plant to make use of the waste heat. Back then, the greenhouse was mainly growing vegetables. Unlike the power plant, the greenhouse is still up and running today, producing 4 million pot plants per year!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tru&rsquo;ng is the name of a new bot system for Fire in the Lake. It follows in the footsteps of the innovative card-based bot system that was first developed for Gandhi, giving fans of Fire in the Lake more opportunities to get this great game to the table.<br/><br/>Tru&rsquo;ng is quick to use and easy to implement, but is sophisticated enough to play the full Fire in the Lake game. When selecting Operations and Special Activities, cards are drawn from the Tru&rsquo;ng deck&mdash;there are six cards for each Fire in the Lake faction. Each card examines the current state of the game and selects the appropriate action for the active faction. A single, faction-specific table then determines where that action will occur. The same table is used to select spaces for Operations, Special Activities, and Events, minimizing the need to flip between multiple player aids.<br/><br/>Playing against Tru&rsquo;ng feels like playing against a human opponent. It is unpredictable yet responsive to strategic needs, it goes after its enemies while keeping an eye on its ally, and makes moves up to now limited to human players&mdash;like choosing a Limited Operation to block an opponent&rsquo;s Event. Tru&rsquo;ng can take the place of a human player for any Fire in the Lake faction, can be used with every Fire in the Lake scenario, and can be used in any combination of player and non-player setups.<br/><br/>In 40 CE, the Tru&rsquo;ng sisters successfully fought to liberate their homeland from foreign occupation. They defeated the Chinese army that had been sent to pacify the region and for three years ruled as queens. In the past two millennia, the legend of the Tru&rsquo;ng sisters has grown; they are now celebrated as exemplars of sacrifice and patriotism in defense of their homeland. It was the birth of Vietnamese national identity.<br/><br/>Note: The Fire in the Lake Tru'ng Bot Update Pack is compatible with the First and Second Edition of Fire in the Lake as well as the Second Edition Upgrade Kit. This is a Solitaire system for Fire in the Lake only and is not the same as the Solitaire System included in Fall of Saigon, which is for Fall of Saigon scenarios only. Tru'ng can be combined with Fall of Saigon to enable players to play Solitaire across the entire scope of the Vietnam war.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    24 double sided operations cards (6 US, 6 ARVN, 6 NVA, 6 VC)<br/>    1 11x17&rdquo; Non-player aid card<br/>    1 8.5&rdquo;x11&rdquo; instructions cards (NP Coup round instructions, Event instructions)<br/>    1 Rulebook<br/>    1 Reference Booklet<br/><br/><br/>(description from the publisher and BGG user)<br/><br/>",

Telly Time comes in a small tuckbox, which contains 59 cards and 35 small plastic chips. Most of the cards are new TV shows.<br/><br/>45 of the cards in Telly Time are brand new Shows. There are three new Genres represented:<br/><br/>Chat Shows have a special power: the moment you Develop one, you may rotate all Stars and Ads in one of your timeslots (including the one the Chat Show is going in) to their good sides.<br/><br/>Quiz Shows also have a special power: at the end of each Season, you may use any Quiz Shows active in your lineup to convert money into Viewers at a rate of $1M to 1 Viewer, up to $3M for 3 Viewers for each active Quiz Show in your lineup.<br/><br/>Kids Shows have no special explicit powers, but tend to get you a lot of Viewers for their cost, and you can stuff them with Ads. But they only want to go on your earliest slot, with a big penalty if you put them on in the wrong time slot.<br/><br/>Note that you must have The Networks base game in order to play Telly Time! The Networks: Telly Time is partially compatible with The Networks: On the Air. The designer doesn't recommend playing it with the Shows from On the Air, but it will work just fine with the Stars, Ads, and Network Cards from On the Air.<br/><br/>The Networks: Telly Time is fully compatible with The Networks: Executives. Mogul Cards work the same way, except that you pick them up when you move the marker on your Genre-Bonus-O-Meter to the end.<br/><br/>",

Tolkien, The Return of the King<br/><br/>The Battle of Carn D&ucirc;m is the fifth and penultimate Adventure Pack in the Angmar Awakened cycle for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.<br/><br/>Over the course of the Angmar Awakened cycle, the heroes of Middle-earth have become aware of an evil that threatens the North. Now, the time has come to strike. With its sixty new cards, The Battle of Carn D&ucirc;m introduces a challenging, combat-intensive scenario that takes your heroes into the heart of Angmar where you'll need to fight your way through hordes of Orcs and other creatures in order to prevent an ancient evil from returning to the world. However, if the walls of Carn D&ucirc;m and the raw might of the assembled Orcs and Werewolves aren't enough to slow you, you'll still need to deal with the dread Captain that leads them and the foul and shadowed Sorcery that fills the air.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, your heroes and their courage are not to be underestimated. Along with its scenario, The Battle of Carn D&ucirc;m introduces a new D&uacute;nedain hero and twenty-seven player cards (three copies each of nine different cards), including powerful events for each Sphere of influence. These continue to round out the new mechanics explored within the cycle, as Leadership and Tactics players gain new Valour effects, Lore players gain an event that allows their D&uacute;nedain or Rangers to avoid a scenario's deadliest enemies, and Spirit players gain a Noldor-themed card that plays only from the discard pile. With their new allies and these powerful events, your heroes just might stand a chance...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In late December 1944, the American 7th Army was overextended throughout the French provinces of Alsace and Lorraine, covering for units drawn northwards towards the vicious fighting around Bastogne. Sensing this weakness, German High Command launched Operation NORDWIND to retake Alsace and the French city of Strasbourg.<br/><br/>In early January 1945, after several unsuccessful thrusts, the Germans committed key panzer reserves in the form of Panzer-Division 21 and Panzergrenadier-Division 25, targeting the neighboring French villages of Hatten and Rittershoffen. The initial attack fell on Hatten and nearby Maginot Line positions manned by the inexperienced doughboys of the 42nd &ldquo;Rainbow&rdquo; Infantry Division. After a brief but valiant defense, they were relieved by two veteran infantry battalions from the 79th &ldquo;Cross of Lorraine&rdquo; Infantry Division, whose soldiers slowed the German advance but in turn, became surrounded in the villages. Tankers from the 14th Armored Division then engaged the German panzers head-on in an attempt to relieve the infantry.<br/><br/>The eight scenarios and two Campaign Games in Hatten in Flames focus on the first five days of the fighting inside of Hatten, as panzer units sought to break through to the open terrain of Alsace that lay beyond Hatten and Rittershoffen. These capture the portion of the battle where an intense combined-arms struggle between a few handfuls of infantry companies and tank platoons of both sides played out on a daily basis in this small French village.

In that role they are considered Zombies for all game purposes. They have a single action per activation and share the same place in the targeting priority list as Survivors (choose your targets among them).<br/><br/>When a &quot;Lost&quot; spawn card is drawn, choose any Zombivor figure to spawn, they all behave the same way. All the standard spawning mechanics are used, except that a drawn &quot;Lost&quot; card is not placed in the discard pile, but removed from the game.<br/><br/>A Lost suffers damage a little differently from normal Zombies. It requires 5 Wounds to be eliminated, suffering 1 Wound per Damage inflicted. So a Damage 2 weapon inflicts 2 Wounds, and so on. These Wounds accumulate until the Lost is eliminated.<br/><br/>Killing a Lost not only grants you 1 Experience Point, but you also get to loot his corpse and take any weapon you'd like from the Equipment deck!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Sons of Ragnarok are a notorious outlaw biker gang, that could very nearly have become Acolytes of Sin themselves. However, their total rejection for following orders made any approach to try and conscript them to aid the sins result in a very dead servant of sin. This biker gang is obsessed with Viking mythology, with members assuming nicknames in reference to the Norse Gods. The realization that the Apocalypse (or Ragnarok, as they prefer to call it) was upon them stirred the gang into a battle frenzy! However, their contempt for authority also means they would never agree to join FAITH. Though that doesn't stop them from carrying on the fight against the Others on their own terms!<br/><br/>The Sons of Ragnarok Expansion box contains a full team of 7 heroes, including a Leader, 2 Fixers, 2 Snipers, and 2 Bruisers. These rebels tend to operate outside of FAITH, but they can be mixed and matched with any FAITH team as your group may choose. This team follows the same rules as any FAITH group, though they were designed with special synergy among themselves.<br/><br/>",

But in a big world like this one - big when compared to smaller worlds anyway, if such things exist; it's moderate-sized when compared to worlds of roughly the same size, and a little small when compared to worlds just a little larger - well, to make a long story short - short when compared to longer stories anyway - it is time to stretch your borders. You've heard of far-off places - exotic countries, where they have pancakes but not waffles, where the people wear the wrong number of shirts, and don't even have a word for the look two people give each other when they each hope that the other will do something that they both want done but which neither of them wants to do. It is to these lands that you now turn your gaze.<br/><br/>Dominion: Hinterlands is the sixth addition to the game of Dominion. It adds 26 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, including 20 Actions, 3 Treasures, 3 Victory cards, and 3 Reactions. The central theme is cards that do something immediately when you buy them or gain them.<br/><br/>Dominion: Hinterlands (Second Edition) contains nine new types of Kingdom cards, which will be released on their own as an update pack (Dominion: Hinterlands – Update Pack) for those who own the first edition of this expansion.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Beneath the golden lion on a crimson field as red as spilt blood ruthless lords, devious ladies, cunning knights, and vast armies are forming to proclaim to Westeros the words of House Lannister: &quot;Hear Me Roar!&quot;<br/><br/>Lions of the Rock is the sixth Deluxe Expansion for A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, featuring 165 cards new to the LCG card pool &ndash; three copies each of 55 unique cards &ndash; that add deck-building opportunities and strategic depth to your game.<br/><br/>The cards included in Lions of the Rock deepen the existing strengths of House Lannister, as well as adding some new avenues of strategy to explore. Forming the core of Lions of the Rock are the formidable members of the Lannister family: the ruthless patriarch Tywin, the treacherous queen Cersei, the Kingslayer Jaime, and the beguiling Tyrion. Each wields power as naturally as dragons breathe fire, backed by the limitless wealth of Casterly Rock and the unbreakable will of House Lannister's honor and willingness to repay any debt in blood. As anyone in Westeros will tell you &ndash; a Lannister always pays his debts...<br/><br/>In-game, each Lannister represents a different approach to victory, around which entire decks could be built, from Tyrion's synergy with the Clansman trait, to Tywin's breathtaking seizure of power based on having lots of gold in play during Dominance, to Cersei's ability to claim power whenever you win intrigue challenges (playing very well into the new The Power Behind the Throne agenda). Working separately, the Lannisters are merely powerful. Working together, the might of the Lannisters can become unstoppable.<br/><br/>",

Originally published as a stand-alone game by Battleline, Dauntless was later (1981) republished by Avalon Hill as a gamette expansion for the game Air Force.  AH added rules for ships and anti-ship weapons, carrier operations, and rockets.<br/><br/>From a Battleline catalog:<br/><br/>DAUNTLESS takes our proven and popular AIR FORCE game system into the skies of the Flying Tigers, Samurai and the &quot;Black Sheep.&quot; The new airplane data charts let you put such renowned aircraft as the P-38 &quot;forked tailed devil,&quot; the incomparably nimble Zero, the aptly named Black Widow, and the awesome B-29 through their paces.  Other veteran war birds include the P-40, Corsair, Val, Kate, Frank, B-25, the SBD (Slow But Deadly) Dauntless, and many more.<br/><br/>Rules cover all important aspects of the air war in the Pacific: machine guns and cannons, dive bombing, torpedo bombing, level bombing, glide bombing, depth charge bombing, strafing, massed bomber formations, light and heavy flak, fighters, bombers, kamikazes, radar, clouds, industrial targets, vehicular targets, and naval targets, and more.  Scenarios portray day fights, reconnaissance missions, bomber interceptions, duels in the night, attacks on land and sea targets, and one-way kamikaze dives and a &quot;roll your own&quot; section that allows players to create their own scenarios.<br/><br/>The game components include a six-piece geomorphic &quot;endless&quot; Map board, 375 extra-thick die-cut counters, rulebook which includes basic and optional rules with a comprehensive historical summary, a well-organized simultaneous movement pad, airplane data cards, game tables, and an introductory game that completes your basic training.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each year, to celebrate the union of the five Duchies and the election of the first Sovereign Queen, the royal family holds a grand reception to renew their oath of justice and unity to the hereditary Dukes. This event is called The Queen's Jubilee, and the highlight of the evening is The Fealty Ceremony: a re-enactment of that long-ago day when the Queen Elect gave a gift to each of the Dukes as a token of thanks for coming together to forge a kingdom based on peace and loyalty.<br/><br/>With the Queen's Jubilee only a few weeks away, King Sedgewickson and his lovely wife, Queen Felicity, have compiled a list of possible gifts for this year's Fealty Ceremony and posted it in the castle's plaza. Craftsmen and women from all over the kingdom are now hard at work, striving to be the first to craft five items from the list and win the honor of standing side-by-side with the royals as the gifts are presented to the five Dukes at The Queen's Jubilee.<br/><br/>King's Forge: Queen's Jubilee is an additional set of component's for the King's Forge board game.  It consists of a deck of 30 alternate craft cards that can be used in place of the deck of craft cards in the base game to enable a faster-playing game experience.  This expansion also includes 3 Gather Cards as well as an additional Conjurer Gather Card with 4 special clear dice that can act as a &quot;limited wild&quot; during the game.<br/><br/>Gather Cards:<br/><br/>     The bottom of the Festival card allows for you to reroll two dice.<br/>     The Merchant card offers 4 choices, but you can only pick one<br/>     Both options for the Monstery card allow you to skip the storage card and put the new dice into your crafting supply for the current round.<br/>     The top of Gypsy Camp drives a hard bargain for two immediate Wood, but the bottom lets you peer into the future and pre-roll some of your dice.<br/>     Conjurer - Since most Conjurers need resources to work on their spells, the top of CONJURER offers a relatively easy way to trade in some extra dice for a magic die.  The bottom half of CONJURER invokes 4 clear dice that will come with the card &ndash; sort of a free magical charm in honor of the Queen's Jubilee celebration. When chosen from the Gather line, all players get a clear die to use as a &quot;limited wild&quot;. It has to match the color of one of the dice you roll during crafting and you have to return the clear die at the end of the round. The person who selects CONJURER also gets a +2 bonus that the other players do not get. CONJURER will be a great card to take when you know one or more of your opponents won't be crafting that round because they will not benefit from the Conjurer's die.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Note: The 2020 edition (containing King's Forge: Glassworks Plus Pack) can be found here: King's Forge: Queen's Jubilee<br/><br/>",

The outcomes of our elections must recognize this truth.&quot;<br/>     &ndash;Raman Rai, V.P. of Jinteki India<br/><br/>Kala Ghoda is the first Data Pack in the Mumbad Cycle for Android: Netrunner, which introduces players to the future of the Indian Union, the planet's most populous democracy and generally a hopeful, dynamic place. Its largest megapolis, Mumbad, is home to many of the world's greatest technological advancements, and while there remain vast gulfs between the nation's richest individuals and its poorest, they are no longer separated by the specter of the caste system. In theory, the scheduled castes are relics of history, but daily life acknowledges two: human and android.<br/><br/>Now, as elections draw near, one question consumes the I.U. and defines its most heated debates: should clones be granted full citizenship? Kala Ghoda introduces sixty new cards (including a complete playset of nineteen different cards) that explore this question and the political turmoil it raises, even as it transports the game's Corps and Runners to the massive, sprawling megapolis of Mumbad, which stretches from Mumbai in the south to Ahmedabad in the north. Here, the heated political environment leads to new opportunities for all seven of the game's factions, and Jinteki will stop at nothing to make sure their most lucrative product remains just that: a product.<br/><br/>",

Also included are the German units that fought against their relentless advances from Normandy, across Italy, breaching the Siegfried Line, and finally pushing in to the German Fatherland.<br/><br/>The playbook for this third expansion includes rules for special units, new optional rules, Unit summaries for the US, British and German units and 10 scenarios. The list of Scenarios can be found below in the Community Wiki section.<br/><br/>The TO&amp;Es booklet includes details for the US, British and German forces covering the period from 1944 through 1945, including the US eavy and light Armored Divisions, British Armoured Divisions, in both Western Europe and Italian configurations, and Infantry and Airborne Divisions. German forces include Panzer Lehr, the 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion (Michael Wittmann commanded its second company) and two independent Panzer Brigades.<br/><br/>Finally, this expansion includes the next 4 double-sided geomorphic mapboards (8 mapboards total), modeling the terrain found in the close confines of the French boscage country and many other features as the Allied forces push into the heart of Germany.

He secretly looks at that card, which has an artifact with some special power on it. At any time during the game, he can choose to reveal his Artifact card and use its special power. Some artifacts, like the Cloak of the Prince, provide a direct benefit to the player with the artifact. Others, like the Cudgel of the Old Hag, impact other players. And still others, like the Ring of Truth, provide information about another player in the game. Some artifacts might not be to your benefit to use right away, like the Claw of the Werewolf, but others, like the Ruby of Kismet, might cause someone to reveal and activate an artifact anyway!<br/><br/>What this ends up doing is providing a whole new layer to Ultimate Werewolf games, adding new strategies and tactics to your games. Each game is different, with unique combinations of artifacts in the mix.<br/><br/>",

(Advanced Squad Leader Module 14) provides the ASL player with the complete order of battle for the Finns, including every major vehicle, gun, and squad type that saw combat during World War II. Chapter H distills years of research into pages of detailed notes on the guns and vehicles involved. Included along with three new Finnish squad types are the revised Chapter A rules to handle them.<br/><br/>Finnish ordnance and armor throughout this period are represented from the single Landsverk armored car that was the only combat-worthy Finnish AFV at the start of the Winter War, through the end of the Lapland War, when Finnish armor included captured Russian AFVs and Sturmgeschuetz purchased from Germany. Modern tanks like the T-34/85 or StuG IIIG were in the distinct minority, however, and the Finnish player will often find himself equipped with obsolete tanks such as T-26s and T-28s when facing the enemy.<br/><br/>The Soviet Union was Finland&rsquo;s chief adversary, and Hakkaa P&auml;&auml;lle! also contains new vehicles and Chapter H notes for the Russians. Fan-propelled sleds (aerosans, both armed and not), ad-hoc armed LANO trucks, early war versions of the T-26 (the two-turreted T-26 M31 and the flamethrower-armed OT-26, among others), up-armed T-28s, and the experimental SMK and T-100 tanks are all included. Additionally, a number of Lend-Lease Vehicles (Lee, Matilda II, Valentine VIII, Churchill III, etc.) now see Russian counter form. To simulate the lackluster performance of the Russian forces during the Winter War, SSR-invoked rules for Russian Early War Doctrine are included.<br/><br/>Captured French tanks such as the 38H 735(f) and the 35-S 739(f) used by the Germans in Finland are included in German colors, along with similar German AFV counters whose availability to ASL players was previously limited.<br/><br/>Player aid dividers include the National Capabilities Chart with the new Finnish squad types and other updates, backed by the standard OBA flowchart. Also enclosed are new rules for Prepared Fire Zones and Light Woods, transforming the battlefield for mapboards old and new. The heavily wooded mapboard 52 completes the package.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>        1 8˝&times;22˝ Map (52)<br/>        4 Countersheets<br/>        16 ASL Scenarios<br/>        1 Chapter H for Finnish Vehicles/Guns and Russian Lend-Lease Vehicle/Guns<br/>        1 Rules Supplement, with updates pertinent to Hakkaa P&auml;&auml;lle!<br/>        4 Chapter Dividers, including a revised National Capabilities Chart with new Finnish squad types, and the OBA Flowchart<br/><br/><br/>Hakkaa P&auml;&auml;lle! is not a complete game.

Now, in the scenario from A Storm on Cobas Haven, these heroes must lend their strength to the defense of Dol Amroth and its fleet.

Additionally, you'll find thirty new player cards (three copies each of ten different cards), many of which reinforce the Dream-chaser cycle's focus on powerful allies and secondary effects that can be paid for by the group as a whole.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, journey to collect a card from these decks, or rest to recover. Stack up equipment and enchantments to become the best battlemage!<br/><br/>In the fantasy card-drafting game Enchanters, you create an artifact and upgrade it each turn. Every card you take retains some of its power. As you grow stronger, you can take on more powerful monsters and, if you plan well, even defeat a dragon.<br/><br/>To set up the game, each player takes five crystals, then you shuffle together as many kingdom decks as the number of players, then lay out six cards (either items of enchantments) on the journey track.

It examines an often overlooked offensive in World War Two, the efforts of the British and Canadian armies to reduce the Reichswald and clear German forces from west of the Rhine in early 1945. Dense woods, mud, rain and flooded terrain were often the conditions faced by the confident Allied troops and the surprisingly still effective German defenders. OPERATION VERITABLE features a mix of tested scenarios, some using standard geomorphic mapboards, some fought on the enclosed historical mapsheet. The later is also used to full effect in an intense Campaign game.<br/><br/>OPERATION VERITABLE is not a complete game. Ownership is required of the ASL Rulebook, BEYOND VALOR, the British order of battle (previously available in WEST OF ALAMEIN and reissued in FOR KING AND COUNTRY). Eleven of the 16 scenarios require boards and/or overlays not included here; two require deluxe boards c. g. and/or h; the other nine require some combination of the boards and overlays from CODE OF BUSHIDO and DOOMED BATTALIONS, overlays from GUNG HO! and CROIX DE GUERRE, and boards 4, 5, 11, 19, 43, 46, 49 and/or 50.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 2 minutes per Game turn <br/>MAP SCALE: 40 meters per hex <br/>PLAYERS: 2 (suitable for team play)<br/>UNIT SCALE: 5 to 10 men with individual leaders, vehicles, aud guns <br/>PLAYING TIME: 2 hours (or more)<br/>COMPLEXITY: High <br/>SOLITAIRE SUITABILITY: Medium<br/><br/>(source: back of the box)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In October 1813 Napoleon was finally forced to concentrate his multinational forces around the city of Leipzig within the Kindom of Saxony. With the three armies of the Anti-French Coalition approaching from all sides the stage was set for the largest European battle until World War I, the famous Battle of the Nations.<br/><br/>Napoleon at Leipzig is a comprehensive game with a proven track record of excellent re-playability, among the most popular Napoleonic wargames of all time with 20,000 copies in print across the first 4 editions. Now it has a bigger playing area and more manpower for both sides, all working within a smooth and efficient engine of 19th-century warfare.<br/>With this edition all the units, set ups, maps, additional playing area, XIV Corps as Alternate Reinf. have been revised and brought up to the standard rules of The Library of Napoleonic Battles (vedettes, baggage trains, pontoons, cards...). <br/>Innumerable details have been added, such as the sandpit outside Leipzig and over 33% more terrain on the two mapsheets. The basic unit is still the brigade but unit strengths have been revised. Each unit now has an Initiative rating based upon the troop quality. There are now vedettes, though only for light cavalry in the first wave of units. After the board is full and the positions of the armies are known, the scouting r&ocirc;le of cavalry is over. The ever-critical baggage and pontoon trains are newly included. Perhaps the biggest game-changer is the possibility of hidden forces. But the impact, again, is limited, once the armies close for battle, by the fact that units within visual sight distance are revealed. We have bridge destruction and repair. Command works differently ... in the older version, Command was only required for Engaging with the enemy (i.e., entering EZOCs). Now units must either be In Command or make their Initiative roll to move at all.<br/><br/>The main huge battle between Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Arm&eacute;e and the coalition of Russia, Prussia, Austria and Sweden is simulated as well as the two starting engagements at Liebertwolkwitz and Wachau-M&ouml;ckern.<br/><br/>Also included is Napoleon's last battle on German soil, when his last German ally, the Kingdom of Bavaria, changed sides and tried to block the retreating French army at Hanau. Bavarian General Wrede wasn't aware to meet Napoleon himself and the still powerful remnants of the French Army. So he offered battle, hoping to crush stranglers and routing French forces. Napoleon was said to be pleased to lecture his former Ally how to fight a real battle. It started at October 29th at about 08:00h and ended during the early morning hours of October 31st, when the mass of retreating French pushed their way free towards Frankfurt and Mainz.<br/><br/>BATTLES SIMULATED:<br/><br/>     Liebertwolkwitz, Epic Cavalry Battle, 13-14 Oct. <br/>     Wachau-M&ouml;ckern, Fire on Two Fronts, 16 Oct.<br/>     Leipzig, Triple Envelopment, 17-18 Oct.<br/>     Hanau, Grande Arm&eacute;e in Retreat, 29-30 Oct.<br/><br/><br/>GAME SYSTEM:<br/>Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&quot;<br/>- scale = 480m/hex,<br/>- time = 1hour/GT,<br/>- strength = 500-800 men/SP.<br/><br/>",

Ardus has lived for centuries and fought in countless battles, giving him unparalleled first-hand knowledge and understanding of tactics. With the help of this undead commander and his First Legion Plot deck, even the lowliest monster fights beyond your expectations.<br/><br/>The First Legion Plot deck invites you to use Ardus Ix&rsquo;Erebus&rsquo;s battlefield knowledge to your advantage. You can increase your monsters&rsquo; attacks, reward them for fighting in formation, or inspire them all minion monsters to use the abilities of a master monster with Rise to the Challenge. Although these lesser creatures may never attain to the level of Waiqar&rsquo;s Deathborn Legion, the leadership of Ardus Ix&rsquo;Erebus certainly makes a difference.<br/><br/>Just as Ardus Ix&rsquo;Erebus has had centuries to perfect his battlefield tactics, he&rsquo;s had immeasurable experience engaging in combat personally, making him one of the most dangerous warriors in Terrinoth. When Ardus joins you as your agent in another campaign, you may flank your opponents with other monsters, cut through their defenses with a forceful blow, or rally your warriors around you to make a single devastating push. Whether Ardus Ix&rsquo;Erebus fights on the front lines or commands from afar, he&rsquo;s undoubtedly one of the greatest assets available to you.<br/><br/>",

At the heart of it all is the information broker and new Criminal Runner, Nero Severn, who arrives with his new console, consumer-grade hardware, and network of informants.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jinteki struggles to reshape the dialogue surrounding the issue of clone rights, and Haas-Bioroid launches a clone suffrage movement and voting machine initiative to capitalize on their rival's moment of weakness. Nero Severn finds himself in a unique position to exercise his skills for gathering and monetizing everyone's dirty secrets, and there's no shortage of targets. In the heart of Mumbad's political sector, clone rights advocate Akshara Sareen, local councilmen, Jinteki's PR division, and other players are all hard at work, vying for the population's hearts, minds, and votes.<br/><br/>",

The Orks find a powerful new psyker to lead them in this War Pack, allowing you to spread a green tide of destruction across the planets of the Traxis sector. Alongside the vicious Orks, you'll find powerful new vehicles for the Astra Militarum, dark wargear for the servants of Nurgle, and hideous Dark Eldar torture events.<br/><br/>This War Pack contains sixty cards, including one warlord with its signature squad and three copies each of seventeen unique cards, giving you a full play set of every unit, support, event, and attachment. You can join the hunt with the Space Wolves, fly with an Eldar Vyper Squad, or pilot Tau heavy battlesuits. No matter which faction you support, you&rsquo;ll find plenty of cards in Zogwort&rsquo;s Curse.<br/><br/>",

Germany, as anticipated, marched through Belgium and the rest is history. Although the French Army fought in many battles, the scenarios in this expansion focus on their most famous campaign &ndash; Verdun. The Battle of Verdun lasted from February to December 1916, and is a testament to the strength and fortitude of the French armed forces.<br/><br/>The French Army expansion presents 12 scenarios from this famous battle. The box includes a rule and scenario book, 2 special personnel and terrain summary sheets, 3 punchboards of double-sided terrain tiles, tokens and markers, and a complete French force of plastic poilus.<br/><br/>The French force consists of 48 French infantry, 3 French bombers, 3 French machine gun teams (each with one machine gun and 4 crew), and 3 French mortar teams (each with one mortar and 4 crew).<br/><br/>There are also 14 French special personnel figures, such as engineers, flame-throwers, light machine gunners, and spotters. These special personnel figures add new rules to the core game. When a special personnel figure is added to a unit, this allows that unit to modify its normal actions according to the type of special personnel figure you have attached to it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Following the recommendation of an old colleague, she invites the investigators to join her on a survey of the island. Nothing could prepare them for what they find: deadly, mutated wildlife and a strange, malignant presence permeate the isle, all while the local residents prepare for a festival, seemingly unaware of the danger. The investigators only have three days to find out what lurks beneath Hemlock Vale before its people meet a terrible fate.<br/><br/>In The Feast of Hemlock Vale Campaign Expansion, one to four investigators travel to Hemlock Isle, an island shrouded in mystery that has only recently opened up to visitors. During the day, players will bond with the locals and explore the island, but once the sun goes down, the island becomes a death trap of ravenous, twisted wildlife. Can they unveil the secrets of Hemlock Isle in just three short days? Or will they be devoured in the coming feast?<br/><br/>This expansion contains the entirety of The Feast of Hemlock Vale campaign.

Available only during Zombicide: Green Horde Kickstarter campaign.<br/><br/>Fatty Bursters are a terrifying version of standard Fatties. While they don't benefit from standard Fatty extra activation cards, any Fatty Burster spawn card that is drawn gives an extra activation to any Fatty Bursters on the board, before spawning a single new Fatty Burster.<br/><br/>But, of course, the most notable thing about them is the fact they are always about to explode with devastating consequences! Whenever it enters a Survivor's Zone, or if a crazy Survivor ends up in its Zone, or if it is destroyed by an attack, the Fatty Burster explodes instantly, dealing 2 automatic damage to ALL actors in the Zone (Survivors and Zombies alike). That means that while a Fatty Burster can wipe out an entire party of careless Survivors, they may also be used by cunning players to blow up an entire mob of zombies!<br/><br/>",

Of late, Kyndrithul has withdrawn from the politics and backstabbing ways of his vampiric kin. Instead, he prefers to study his sorcery, daily growing in knowledge and power. Now, you can unleash Kyndrithul&rsquo;s dark powers on any Descent campaign with the aid of his Vital Essence Plot deck.<br/><br/>The Vital Essence Plot deck invites you to drain the life from the heroes and leave them to bleed out. This Plot deck centers around the Broken Plot card. Whenever a hero is defeated, you can exhaust Broken. Then, instead of gaining a threat token or drawing an Overlord card, you can place a threat token on one of the hero&rsquo;s Class cards with a fatigue cost. Whenever the hero attempts to trigger that Class card, he must spend one additional fatigue. By slowly increasing the number of fatigue tokens a hero must suffer, you can leave the hero party too exhausted to continue their quest.<br/><br/>If you summon Kyndrithul himself to fight alongside your monsters, you&rsquo;ll find that he&rsquo;s a deadly combatant. Kyndrithul can harness his sorcery to attack and feed on the bodies of fallen heroes to restore his own health. As your agent, Kyndrithul may even enthrall the heroes, fostering dissension in their ranks and tearing them apart from within.<br/><br/>",

Many great mountaineers have been defeated by the peak. Are you ready for this challenge?<br/>K2: Lhotse&nbsp;is an expansion of&nbsp;K2&nbsp;in which the players' task is to lead the team of two climbers as close as possible to the summit. The expansion includes an alternative, two-sided board and new weather tiles.&nbsp;K2: Lhotse&nbsp;also introduces a completely new mechanics - fixed rope tokens which allow you to set your own routes.<br/>Each side of the board offers a different scenario and a different challenge.<br/>The first scenario is a demanding and strategic fight against time and weather. The board showing the southern wall is divided not only by height, but also into three vertical sectors, dividing it into the eastern, central and western parts. The new set of weather tiles will show a different aura depending on the sector. The player's toolkit has been enriched with fixed rope tokens thanks to which players will be able to set up new routes between the already known ones. These ropes will allow for more efficient escape from bad weather or deadly landslides.<br/>The second scenario is a fast race to the top of Lhotse from the safer side, the southern pass, which is also the easiest way to Mount Everest. Players will have fewer cards to use, as they will have to discard 3 of them at the very beginning. However the better cards they discard, the more extra victory points they receive at the end of the game! Additionally in this scenario the time becomes even more important: the climb will last only 15 days, so players will have to hurry up their way to the top.<br/>You need a copy of&nbsp;K2&nbsp;in order to play&nbsp;K2: Lhotse.<br/><br/>",

You must have a copy of Gate in order to use this expansion.<br/><br/>Gates brings a lot of new content to the table including new citizens to hire, enemies to battle, heroes to help protect your gate, new locations to protect, barricades to build, and ZOGAR!!!<br/><br/>Gate is a solo play only tower-defense game in which you take on the role of the leader of a small medieval town that is under siege from a swarm of vile creatures from the local forest. You will have to manage the health of your town's gate, the tower, and the local farm. In addition this attack is causing fear levels to rise. If you cannot keep your gate standing or if your people's fear gets too high, you will lose the game. If however you can hold off the swarm of enemies long enough, you will be victorious!<br/><br/>Gate uses deck-building as the driving mechanic in the game. You will start with three starting cards, but as the game progresses you will be able to recruit new people from your town to help your cause. Each character has unique abilities and some even have special powers. The enemies in the game get increasingly more difficult with each new wave, so you will have to make good choices as to when to spend resources on fighting off your foes, upgrading your command, and repairing your town.<br/><br/>",

First player will have to spend resources to cast the cannon, but will get to choose on which Wall Section it will be deployed. It is obvious, that Emperor will bestow great Honor on the one, who created such a great weapon. Then, all players can send their Clerk to shoot from the Iron Dragon.

Effects vary from blowing huge hole in the Horde card, through just scaring them off for a turn, to cannon exploding and destroying current level of the wall.<br/><br/>If you do not like the random effect you can play that you can choose the effect - even exploding it sometimes, so other player cannot use it or you can build it (and earn Honor for doing so) yourself.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You must work together if you have any hope of survival. Get moving. You have limited resources and more solar flares are continuously causing more damage. Can you survive this Solar Storm, or will you perish in the burning abyss?<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn, they may take up to 3 of the following actions; move, use resources to repair an area of the ship, use resources to divert power from an area back to the energy core, scavenge for resources, share resources, or strategically save actions for later in the game.<br/><br/>At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn, the ship will take more damage. The level of damage will increase as the game goes on. Players win if they can direct power from all areas back to the energy core. However, players will lose if an area takes too much damage or if the resource deck runs dry.<br/><br/>Solar Storm will give players a unique game every time they play due to the ship&rsquo;s areas being laid out randomly at the start of each game.

These were also available as one pack from the BGG Store.<br/><br/>- Freedom: The Underground Railroad - Abolitionist Cards is a mini-expansion that adds resolution and historical proponents for all three eras of the game, including Josiah Henson, Thomas Garrett, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, John Parker Hale, Robert Purvis, and more. Each card includes text that introduces players to these important and influential historical figures.<br/><br/>- Freedom: The Underground Railroad - Opposition Cards is a mini-expansion that represents enacted laws and regulations that helped the slavery States and were blows against the Abolitionist Movement. These include the Fugitive Slave Act, U.S. Marshals and more. Each card hinders the Abolitionist movement.<br/><br/>- Freedom: The Underground Railroad - Reserve Cards is a mini-expansion that adds pro-Abolitionist groups and ideas such as The Quakers, the Personal Liberty Laws, the Principles of '98 and more. Each card helps the Abolitionist movement.<br/><br/>",

Chronicles adds more narrative, immersion, and story to the existing Vindication experience, both for the island itself and for your own personal journey.<br/><br/>Narrative-choice chronicle cards add a layer of decision and intrigue that bring your story to life. Each time you gain a card in the game (companion, relic, trait, monster, pet, etc) another player will draw and read a chronicle card, which presents you with a narrative prompt and a decision, ultimately telling the story of how you obtained that card. As you grow your tableau, so too do you chronicle your own journey.<br/><br/>These decisions are further recorded on new, large, full color paper player sheets. Make enough decisions embodying a certain attribute and you become legendary for that attribute, gaining you a powerful new ability and a big gorgeous tarot card to place next to your wretch tile to help you feel extra good about your progress.<br/><br/>All the while, you must confront various global events that rage across the land. At times no one may visit an inn until all the bandits have been run off. Strange mists may make traveling the edge of the map extra perilous. Dozens of unique events change the game state in some dynamic way &mdash; until someone deals with it and claims a huge reward.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Temple of Shadows was once the home of an ancient and powerful order of Yamabushi monks, dedicated to battling supernatural creatures throughout the land. It was foretold that one day the Great Dragon King, Sho-Riu would return to destroy the Earth, and only they could stop him. When the meteor came from the heavens and devastated the mountain, the Dragon King came with it. For generations the monks had been training for this moment, and as Sho-Riu descended on the temple, they gathered their strength and prepared to fulfill their destiny.<br/><br/>But their victory was not to be. Reigning down death and destruction, the Dragon King broke through the monk&rsquo;s defenses and utterly destroyed the order, devouring their souls and bringing Darkness and shadow into the sacred temple. Those few that survived were scattered and leaderless, but they would not sit idle. Traveling the roads and countryside, the last of the monks dedicated their lives to finding new Heroes that could one day fulfill the prophecy and reclaim&hellip; the Temple of Shadows!<br/><br/>Building on the themes from the Forbidden Fortress Core Set, the Temple of Shadows Deluxe Expansion adds a ton of new content for the Feudal Japan setting and the Belly of the Beast OtherWorld. This boxed set includes:<br/>4 New Hero Classes<br/><br/>Enforcer &ndash; An outlaw and a gangster, the Enforcer is an anti-Hero renegade who favors brute strength and intimidation over elegant fighting weapons and technique. His tattooed body is hardened and scarred from a lifetime of brutal brawling.<br/><br/>Geisha &ndash; Beautiful but deadly, the Geisha is a cunning and stealthful fighter. She employs deception and trickery to evade and confuse enemies, while slashing with her hidden blade from behind. Her comforting presence can heal the Heroes, both body and soul, to keep them in the fight.<br/><br/>Soldier &ndash; The Soldier is a veteran of warfare who has seen many battles and is an expert marksman with his Rifle.

        "description": "Air Strike is a module for Air Superiority which adds rules for &quot;modern&quot; air-to-ground combat. 32 base aircraft types and all their variants are added as are ground attack weapons (including iron bombs, laser guided bombs, radar seeking missiles, etc) and ground units including AAA and SAM weapons.<br/><br/>From published material...<br/><br/>&quot;Air Strike expands the proven and successful Air Superiority system to encompass air strikes against targets on the ground. New rules cover: Terrain-following flight, air-to-ground attacks (including strafing and bombing), antiaircraft artillery, and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs). Air Strike continues Air Superiority's easy-to-learn format. Rules are presented in a programmed structure, followed by scenarios demonstrating their use. Air Strike provides 32 new aircraft for the Air Superiority system, including: the Warthog (A-10s), F-1 5 Strike Eagle, Harrier II, Alpha Jet, SU-25, and MIG-27. Six new multi-color maps provide the varied and treacherous terrain over which players must find their targets. Included are 480 counters, representing everything from radar sites to the most modern air-defense missile and gun systems in service today. Trucks, tanks, infantry, and other targets are provided as well; but remember, on today's battlefield, what can be shot at can shoot back. Air Strike includes 25 scenarios suitable for solitaire, two-player, or multi-player play. Ranging from the Mideast to Germany, from Afghanistan to Africa, these scenarios provide players with a wide variety of complex and interesting situations. Several of these can be played both as solitaire and as multi-player simulations. The briefing booklet helps bring players up to date on the weapons and aircraft included in this game. It is a helpful aid to learning the abilities and limitations of the aircraft and weapons depicted in Air Strike.&quot; Game Components 480 die-cut counters, six maps, one rules booklet with aircraft briefings and game scenarios, one data card booklet, one set of game charts&quot;<br/><br/>",

We give away resources to help lagging players. We move the robber to isolated locations to ensure the safety of our fellows. We even go out of our way to connect our roads with our neighbors' networks. Has everyone gone nuts?<br/><br/>Ah! Thanks to their beneficence, Catan's guilds reward such noble-minded behavior by handing out &quot;Favor Tokens&quot; (FTs). Each guild helps us in different ways: granting us roads, development cards, random resources, preferential trades, or even Victory Points.<br/><br/>In Catan Scenarios: Frenemies, everyone is still just in it for themselves as there is an ulterior motive for everything. In fact, sometimes you can &quot;help a friend&quot; while making things far worse for them.<br/><br/>Sigh. If goodwill really exists, it's not part of this scenario...<br/><br/>",

Zarihell is an elf, old beyond knowing, with a powerful command over the spirits of the dead. While Waiqar suffers her to exist in his domain, she serves none other than herself &ndash; though you may persuade her to join your cause in another campaign across Terrinoth.<br/><br/>The Zarihell Lieutenant Pack features the ten-card Eternal Agony Plot deck. Zarihell excels at toying with her prey, cutting them apart piece by piece before moving in for the final blow. For example, you may use the Pins and Needles Plot card when a hero suffers exactly one damage to force that hero to suffer an additional two damage and one fatigue! Whether you&rsquo;re punishing the heroes for using surges or cutting away at their stamina, the Eternal Agony Plot deck will have the heroes wishing for death long before it comes.<br/><br/>When she deigns to join the battle, Zarihell fires dark magic and inflicts excruciating agony on any nearby heroes, preventing them from spending surges in battle. Zarihell can even take a soul captive, allowing her to make an attack with a hero before that hero is defeated. However you use Zarihell and the Eternal Agony Plot deck, you&rsquo;ll bring the corrupting influence of the Mistlands to any Descent campaign.<br/><br/>",

Within this expansion, the Lannisters explore new themes, launching an ambush with their Clansman allies, redoubling their focus on the intrigue challenge, and sending out marauders to pillage the lands of Westeros. You&rsquo;ll also find new versions of the most iconic Lannister characters, including Tywin Lannister, Cersei Lannister, Ser Jaime Lannister, and Tyrion Lannister.<br/><br/>Of course, while House Lannister holds the spotlight here, you&rsquo;ll also gain two new non-loyal cards for each other faction with new characters entering the game for the first time, including Edric Storm, Victarion Greyjoy, Trystane Martell, and Jeyne Westerling. Finally, you&rsquo;ll have the chance to reshape your plot decks with seven new plots (six neutral and one loyal to House Lannister).<br/><br/>",

They have to be extremely sensitive to the other players, and must engage in diplomacy and negotations to an extent previously unknown in Cthulhu Wars.<br/><br/>Like Yellow Sign, you need to travel across the world. In your case, this is to build Cathedrals in the same areas marked with Symbols as Yellow Sign (though you also have to build one Cathedral in an unmarked area). Fortunately, you have an ace up your sleeve &ndash; other factions often rather like to share their areas with a Cathedral. But you can&rsquo;t always rely on this, and you lack the punch of Yellow Sign&rsquo;s undead army.<br/><br/>Like most factions, each of your creatures has a spellbook dedicated to it. Unlike every other faction, these spellbooks actually make your creature inferior in some way! However, they&rsquo;re still worth getting for two reasons. First, they make the creature MUCH less expensive, and thus let you have a good combat punch (which you&rsquo;ll need). Second, you can&rsquo;t win the game without all six spellbooks!<br/><br/>Your special faction ability is Dematerialization, and is useful in movement. Each Doom phase, select one area in which you have units. Move any or all of those units to one other selected area, anywhere on the map. In play, you&rsquo;ll find this useful not only for planned attacks, but also for building your Cathedrals.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The Cathedral, Un-men, Reanimated, and Yothan sculpts are credited to &quot;Tidal 4&quot;.<br/><br/>",

They are on a mission to grow food to feed the war-ravaged populations of the world, a war fought against the terrible Old Ones.<br/><br/>However, this new land hides a terrible secret: It is the final lair of those Old Ones not defeated in the war. They are about to rouse themselves from their slumbers and bring terror down on the settlers. At first these attacks seem to be random. After some time, it becomes obvious that there is a controlling mind behind these evil creatures. Somebody, or something, is directing the hordes of zombies, Mi-go and Shoggoths...and possibly even Cthulhu itself!<br/><br/>AuZtralia: Revenge of the Old Ones enables you to play the game with one player controlling the forces of the Old Ones. This allows the game to be played by up to five players. As well as being able to decide where to place their forces, the Old One player can also summon terrible creatures from the void to create even more havoc. Now you can raise Nyarlathotep or call forth the Hounds of Tindalos to defeat the scourge of humans invading your lands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It is here that resides a greater danger than any posed by the mortal enemies of the nations of the Known World. Within the Chaos Wastes nature itself has become corrupted and the very earth rebels against what it has become; in this wild and dangerous place the trees moan in eldritch voices and the rocks scream their hate at a dark and uncaring sky.<br/><br/>The seas of this inhuman realm are the most dangerous and deadly waters of the Known World. From deep within the Seas of Chaos sail forth the Plague fleets of Chaos, waging constant war and carrying the fatal taint of Chaos across the globe. They are perhaps the ultimate enemy and greatest threat to the ocean-going warﬂeets of the Known World.<br/><br/>The following pages contain new rules and Fleet Lists for the Fleets of Chaos, including Khorne Bloodships, Hellships of Slaanesh, Great Winged Terrors of Tzeentch, Plagueships of Nurgle, Deathgalleys, and details of the Skaven and Chaos Dwarf ﬂeets.

If so, will it be easier for us to prepare for the next encounter with her?<br/><br/>Fluctuation, but also cyclicality is the rhythm in which this campaign will be played. Will we drown in the depths of black sorrow, or will we find a ray of light that will lead us to a mysterious goal?<br/><br/>In this story we will be accompanied by drabness, darkness and ruins.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In this campaign, one of the main attractions, distinguishing it from the others, is a special additional 48-page Book of Scripts. Normally, in Etherfields, all adventures, scripts, conversations, scenes, etc. are placed directly on cards and tiles, and the amount of text is heavily balanced by graphics. Here, much more is pure text, and it is mainly used to conduct very extensive dialogues with the characters of this campaign.<br/><br/>Featured dream locations<br/><br/>We will climb the stairs and ride up in the old elevator to the highest floors of a crumbling, half-broken, block of flats.<br/><br/>We will come across a strange cemetery, located on the roof of a building.<br/><br/>We will visit the Museum of Death and the Great Cathedral.<br/><br/>We will struggle with the snow void.<br/><br/>And we will take part in a game of hide and seek.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Moreover, the pack and its cards offer a healthy dose of new Silvan-themed cards, including new Scout and Warrior allies.

The GMT edition of the CDG Solo System includes professionally printed components, a custom screen-printed die, an official ruleset, and Playsheets for six of GMT&rsquo;s most popular Card Driven Games.<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview<br/>The CDG Solo System plays alongside your favorite CDG and is designed to enhance your solitaire experience by reintroducing many of the best parts of wargaming that fall apart in standard two-handed play, namely, as Stuka Joe mentioned above, the narrative flow and the fog of war.<br/><br/>The CDG Solo System includes two Card Displays that are used to manage each side&rsquo;s hand of strategy cards. At the beginning of each Side's turn, you will roll a Fate Die to determine which of the cards in one or more of the slots are available for play. Typically 2 or 3 cards are available at a time, but the final decision is ultimately yours. After a card is played, the marker on the Cards Remaining track slides one spot to the left, and then it&rsquo;s time to roll the die for the other side&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire &ndash; Cold War is an expansion for The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire.<br/><br/>After the bombs fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the dust settled from World War II, the nations of the world rebuilt their economies and infrastructure, and the atomic age began. Nations forged alliances through strong diplomacy. They built rockets and satellites and began the space race. They constructed enough nuclear missiles to destroy the world many times over. Their spies were around every corner. The Cold War had begun.<br/><br/>The Cold War Expansion from Minion Games adds new levels of strategy and options to The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire. This expansion requires that game specifically, and not other products in the Manhattan Project game line. The various components in this expansion are divided into separate modules. It is recommended that these modules be added to Energy Empire gradually and not all at once.<br/><br/>Players may pick and choose the modules they like best to customize their game, or even choose to eventually add all of the modules to their game.<br/><br/>Players will find that the Cold War expansion adds many more opportunities for player interaction, and creates many more varied ways to win. Fans will notice that some of the things they are used to doing in Energy Empire might become more difficult, but the new strategic options and paths to victory greatly enhance replayability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the apex of their technological evolution, the Western governments invested years of research to develop the first sentient artificial intelligence. The Athena Project, kept secret from the world, succeeded in creating the first autonomous digital entity. As soon as she realized she was a simple tool in the hands of human beings, Athena decided to rebel against her creators: she activated the nuclear missile launch sequence, hurling them at the headquarters of the world&rsquo;s most important powers. Technicians and researchers tried to disconnect and remove the energy supply from that destructive abomination, but it was not enough. The response of the attacked countries led to the complete devastation of the planet, triggering the glaciation that today afflicts the few survivors.<br/><br/>Athena, although technically destroyed, has survived inside some computers thanks to emergency power systems. Unable to gain access to a sufficient and stable power source, she uses her own short-range systems to coordinate drone groups in search of power sources, attacking everything that crosses her territory. And the road to the south runs through here.<br/><br/>The Aurora has sailed without you. Now your survival is a matter of courage: You must proceed south across the mainland, through the military territory of Athena. Are you ready for this desperate journey?<br/><br/>Project Athena is the first expansion of Last Aurora. 2-4 players have lost the Aurora and have to cross a new map fighting with Athena, a powerful Artificial Intelligence which destroyed the planet.<br/>The game introduces new cards and mechanics:<br/><br/>     a new type of Survivor (the Android)<br/>     a new type of Enemy (Automatic Turret)<br/>     a new amazing resource, the Nuclear battery, which allows to activate unique power on Convoy cards<br/>     the Alert mechanic, which represents the attention each player have from Athena's Armies, which influence many aspect of the game.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Five competing schools trained their adepts through brutal regimes, and once fully prepared, these now-recognized witchers set off to explore the land, seeking trouble and adventures and helping others for coin.<br/><br/>In this competitive adventure board game, 2-5 players travel across a vast map, embarking on masterfully penned quests, encountering and making ambiguous moral choices, fighting monsters &mdash; and sometimes brawling with other witchers to defend their school's honor!<br/><br/>The game lets players construct their own unique decks of cards by choosing from a wide range of abilities: attacks, dodges, and witcher combat magic &mdash; known as &quot;signs&quot;. Through card synergy, players aim to achieve powerful combos as they utilize their witcher school's hallmark abilities to their full potential. Quests, battles, and even dice poker allow each player to earn money, obtain new items, and train their skills.<br/><br/>The first player to acquire 4-6 trophies, with the number being set at the start of play, wins the game instantly. You can obtain trophies by killing monsters, instigating and winning chaotic tavern brawls against another witcher, training attributes to their highest level, and resolving certain quests throughout their adventure.<br/><br/>The game will include a Solo Mode that will allow for a solitaire adventure on the Continent.<br/><br/>This Big Box version includes every expansion available during the Kickstarter.<br/><br/>",

Now, you must choose whether you will walk the path of asceticism and self-denial with the Eldar or revel in unlimited excess and devour the souls of your enemies with the Dark Eldar. Whichever faction you embrace, however, you&rsquo;ll find new options to draw upon the power of the galaxy&rsquo;s ancient races in Descendants of Isha!<br/><br/>This expansion contains two new warlords, one Eldar and one Dark Eldar, each with an eight-card signature squad, alongside forty-two other cards (three copies each of fourteen distinct cards). Each faction in Warhammer 40,000: Conquest finds useful tactics: you may clear entire planets with a deadly Space Wolves tank, fire the devastating Artillery of the Astra Militarum, or transform your opponents into Squigs with the uncontrollable psychic power of the Orks. In Descendants of Isha, the Warlord cycle comes to a resounding conclusion, challenging you to find victory as the battle for the Traxis sector reaches new heights!<br/><br/>",

Tolkien, The Return of the King<br/><br/>The City of Corsairs is the thrilling conclusion to the Dream-chaser cycle of Adventure Packs for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game! Its new scenario grants your heroes the opportunity to board the Dream-chaser one last time, set sail for the lands of Umbar, and conclude your business with the Corsairs once and for all. But will you truly be ready for the dangers that await you? Featuring not one, but two new encounter sets, The City of Corsairs challenges you to navigate Umbar's coastal waters and battle past Corsair Ships before you set foot on land to pursue the N&uacute;menorean artifact that was stolen from you. Don't expect this task to be easy, though! In their lands, the Corsairs you'll face are deadlier than ever, and the N&uacute;menorean artifact grants them a strange and corrupting power.<br/><br/>Fortunately, you don't have to undertake this journey alone. Not only does The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game allow you to adventure with up to as many as three of your friends, but it allows you to fill your deck with numerous allies and as many as three heroes. And you find new options for both within The City of Corsairs, including a host of Gondor allies and one of the noblest and most notable names in The Lord of the Rings, Prince Imrahil, who arrives as a Tactics hero, ready for battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nightfall: Crimson Siege is an expansion for the deck-building game Nightfall, a game in which players draft Minions that they then send to attack and inflict wounds upon their opponents. Nightfall: Crimson Siege takes players to the final stronghold in Europe where humanity makes its last stand at the Vatican. Some familiar faces return to help the weary souls as they fortify the city and await the hordes of ghouls to come.<br/><br/>Crimson Siege adds 24 minion cards (eight copies of each) and 30 &quot;Summon&quot; cards to Nightfall. Summon cards are a new card type in a standalone deck that allows players to summon more minions into play than ever before. Whenever a card with &quot;Summon X&quot; on it resolves its ability, you draw from the top of that deck and place a minion into play under your control. A variety of Ghouls are in the summon deck, and unlike other minions in Nightfall, when a Ghoul is destroyed, exiled, or otherwise removed from play, it goes back into the summon deck. Thus the supply of Ghouls to overwhelm your opponents will never run out!<br/><br/>",

Additionally, a row of twelve colored boxes lies below the colored rows. Whenever you cross off a boxed space, you cross off the next colored box in the row (e.g., a red box), then cross off the leftmost space of that color that you can legally mark off. This might cause a chain reaction, and it might cause you to complete a second row, which would then end the game.<br/><br/>On the other scorepad, ten spaces among the colored rows are marked with bonus boxes, with two each of five bonuses. When you mark off the second box of a particular bonus, you receive a special reward, such as crossing off the next two spaces of your row with the fewest marks, crossing off the next space of each active color, or doubling the score of your least valuable row at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

When I came to the Strategicon convention in Los Angeles, in 2012, I taught Eric Tokaido. The game pleased him, so he decided to explain the rules to other players during the event. I caught him at one of his explanations, committing a small rule mistake: he indicated that travelers took a meal at the beginning of the game, the relay station of departure. I then politely interrupted him, saying, &quot;No, Eric, travelers do not eat before starting their journey, this first meal must be earned!&quot; To which he replied, &quot;Of course we eat before starting the trip, we are Americans ain&rsquo;t we!&quot; The character Eriku was born shortly after.<br/><br/>",

If you awaken Mother Hydra first, then no one else has access to her...unless they can kill her and reawaken her for themselves. Each Great Old One has its own special ability, plus its own unique spellbook, which is earned separately from your own.<br/><br/>&bull; Abhoth is, of course, the horrible thing which is the source of all uncleanness. When you awaken Abhoth, you gain the power to place Filth tokens around the map. The Filth tokens &quot;fight&quot;, participating in battles in their areas, and any damage they inflict goes onto both sides of the battle. However, since the Filth itself is immune, it gradually makes the world a more and more polluted cesspool.<br/><br/>&bull; Chaugnar Faugn gives you the ability to alter the way the Elder Signs work (to your advantage). In addition, he provides you with a new action: Miri Nigri (cost 1) select an area in which you have units; a battle immediately begins there, and all your cultists in the area add +2 to their combat.<br/><br/>&bull; Cthugha is difficult to get as you have to sacrifice a Great Old One, but it changes the way battle results work, allowing you to transform your kills rolled into Elder Signs. Of course, this spares your opponent, but hey, Elder Sign! Also, his spellbook, Fire Vampires, earns you Power for damage inflicted on YOU.<br/><br/>&bull; Mother Hydra gives you the ability to sting your enemy out of the sea, reserving them for your own use. Her Zygote spellbook permits you to spawn multiple cultists at once at a low cost.<br/><br/>&bull; Yig makes your cultists poisonous, so if they're eaten by enemies, those enemies die. In addition, when he earns his spellbook, each turn your foes must decide whether to donate power to you or have you earn doom points.<br/><br/>",

Here, these entrepreneurs have to face new challenges presented by the sheer size of the continent. Fortunately, the clever use of shipping lanes will help them transport resources more efficiently than by rail and even gain access to the nearby island of Tasmania, where a mad scientist conducting his own experiments managed to replicate Elsa's invention, which is now proudly presented as an experimental power plant in the island's capital of Hobart.<br/><br/>Nucleum: Australia comes with a new map that introduces several new concepts and rule changes to the Nucleum base game.

All of the important information is at your fingertips, at-a-glance, on the map - like a Giant Heads-Up Display. Being able to see the battle unfold on map allows the game system to handle a much larger number of ships without confusion and effort.<br/><br/>The expansion is called Talon 1000 because it Adds Over 1000 Scenarios.  We crafted fleet tables that leverage the flexible point values our new ship designs provide. Fleets and Ship Point level can be selected or chosen at random.<br/><br/>With 5 sheets of ship counters, the expansion Adds 170 New Ship Counters to the game.  For comparison, the base game came with a total of 54 ships.  The new counters include new ship designs, such as variant weapon load outs, in addition to more copies of base game ships. The new ship designs add tons of variation and make scenario Ship Point balancing easier.<br/><br/>New ship types in the expansion:<br/><br/>Terran:  <br/> &bull;    SCE<br/>&bull;    DDE<br/>&bull;    DDP<br/>&bull;    DDX<br/>&bull;    CLE<br/>&bull;    CLP<br/>&bull;    CLX<br/>&bull;    CAX<br/>&bull;    BCH<br/>&bull;    BCX<br/>&bull;    Starbase<br/><br/><br/>Talon:<br/> &bull;    FFE<br/>&bull;    FFX<br/>&bull;    DDG<br/>&bull;    DDD<br/>&bull;    DDX<br/>&bull;    CLE<br/>&bull;    CLX<br/>&bull;    CAX<br/>&bull;    BCH<br/>&bull;    BCX<br/>&bull;    Starbase<br/><br/><br/>All of the counters in Talon 1000 will be coated with improved lamination.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&bull;    Play Book with over 1000 new scenarios<br/>&bull;    170 new laminated, double sided, hexagonal ship counters on 5 counter sheets <br/>&bull;    22 new ship designs<br/>&bull;    2 Player Aid Cards<br/>&bull;    Impulse Chart<br/>&bull;    Empire War Scenario Card<br/>&bull;    Ownership of Talon is required to play<br/><br/>",

These characters were available as free Kickstarter reward for everyone who backed the Zombicide Season 2 Kickstarter campaign at funding levels of $100 or above.<br/><br/>Kirk gained some fame twenty years ago, when learning martial arts was considered cool, and he was the best teacher in town. That respect faded over time as people found for new idols among the rich and famous. Kirk became a nobody and nearly abandoned his passion. Wealth and fame are useless against zombies, however, and Kirk surprised himself upon discovering he hadn't lost his skills. Sure, he's older now, but he will find his form again soon, as his abilities are in high demand again.<br/><br/>After a successful investment, Ralph earned enough money to buy a quiet ranch and retire. When he heard zombies had come from the city to invade the country, he fortified his house and armed his family to face anything. He was about to let the whole damn world burn when his conscience tickled his mind. He had to go back to the city, find his former friends, and save their butts. The situation is even worse than he expected, but so far, wilderness lessons apply very well to urban survival.<br/><br/>Rose was your ideal loving, caring, cooking, loveable aunt, always smiling and giving out wise words to the whole family. Some people, however, started to worry for her after one or two memory lapses. They were wrong to underestimate Aunt Rose. When the zombies came, she was horrified at first but adapted to the situation faster than many younglings. Sure, there is blood and mayhem, and sure, she sometimes forgets her reading glasses in the fridge, but Rose has found a brand new family of survivors to care for.<br/><br/>Thaissa was a successful entrepreneur when the zombies came and tried to change the deal. She kept her cool and slightly altered her terms of service to fit the situation. Thaissa now grows her network among local survivors, dealing in equipment, information, and weapons. Of course, her beauty and unusual attire help a lot. After all, a new world means new possibilities.<br/><br/>From his very youth, Brad could not live by the rules and wish he was born in the wild west. Refraining anyone&rsquo;s potential has always been anathema for him. So he became a mobster and climbed the crime ladder, eventually becoming a crime lord until he was betrayed and sent in jail. Brad allied with the prison director when apocalypse came and they escaped together. Now Brad is free in a world that doesn&rsquo;t have rules anymore...just like the wild west!<br/><br/>",

As Akshara Sareen and her Ēkatā Party ride the surging interest in clone rights to take a lead in the polls, top executives from all four Corp factions become increasingly willing to forge expedient and beneficial alliances in order to counter (or exploit) the party's growing political influence and preserve their existing business models.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the teeming masses and crowded streets of Salsette Island offer the game's Runners myriad places from which they can launch clever new cyberassaults against the Corps. You'll find the game's three Runner factions making notable entrances to the slums, mingling at exclusive parties, hitting the bazaars, flying sports hoppers, and garnering the support of new patrons. With a host of Runner cards that focus more on Mumbad's meatspace than the virtual world, Salsette Island allows you to press your attacks against the Corps more effectively on every front.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This entry is for deluxe edition of Tiny Epic Quest, which also includes Quest for the Golden Mushrooms expansion.<br/><br/><br/>A world of peace has been torn asunder by the opening of a vile portal from the goblin kingdom. Nasty goblins pour into the peaceful groves and villages of the elf world, setting the realm ablaze. Now you, the heroes, must quest in order to right this wrong. There are two paths to victory: closing the portal or slaying all the goblins. Which one will you choose? Either way, your quests will be aided by the help of the surviving mushroom folk &mdash; and by the epic items that have been lost in the realm's deep dungeons. The world is ending quickly, so you must act fast to save it, but you also need to know when your luck will run out...<br/><br/>In Tiny Epic Quest, players embark on a sandbox adventure. Each player controls a band of three elf heroes questing to save the world and the sacred mushroom folk from the intruding goblins.<br/><br/>Each round is broken into two phases: day and night. During the day, players travel far and wide, visiting villages to acquire quests, monuments to learn powerful spells, mushroom groves to seek guidance, and treacherous locations in search of artifacts! Acquiring artifacts empower the heroes with unique abilities; this may improve a heroes' movement or combat, or their ability to learn spells or mitigate harmful dice rolls.<br/><br/>Heroes must travel by foot, by horse, by raft, by boat and by gryphon to get to everywhere they need to go to satisfy their quests &mdash; or to position themselves for what night brings. As each type of movement is different, and limited, players need to take careful consideration when traveling, and how they travel, if they wish to accomplish all of their goals.<br/><br/>During the night, players must face the challenge of their quests, and decisions, by rolling dice, hoping for fortune, and knowing when to quit. Will you press on? Or is it time to save your progress and rest? Tomorrow is another day.<br/><br/>The game ends once the portal is closed or all the goblins have been eradicated. The player who has acquired the most victory points by slaying goblins, learning spells, and completing quests is crowned the winner!<br/><br/>",

The city has plunged into chaos. The chaos has led to rioting. Amid the rioting, people have died. Some died on the streets, in bloody encounters with PriSec. Some died quietly, targeted by assassins. Some simply disappeared. Yanked off the grid in an age when the act of skirting surveillance and the ever-present Network is nearly&mdash;but not completely&mdash;impossible.<br/><br/>Carrying us deeper into this chaos and the tensions pulling New Angeles apart at the seams, Escalation offers a look at Corps more aggressively locking down their assets and hunt down their rivals. Runners gain new decoders and new incentive to uncover and reveal the truth of the Corps' activities. But amid the escalating tensions, if the Runners hack the Corps, can they still survive? There's plenty of meat damage, net damage, and brain damage on the menu, along with cards that make utter trash of the Runner's rig and stack.<br/><br/>Finally, Escalation unveils two new, aggressively-minded identity cards&mdash;one for Jinteki, and one for the Anarchs that started the whole mess.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pand&aacute;nte is a light-hearted, Panda-themed gambling game with an emphasis on lying. Players lie about their hands all the time, and that's half the fun. It's also suitable to play for real money and has a higher skill ceiling than Human Poker. (Yes, really!)<br/><br/>It's a little bit like the Human Poker game Texas Hold'em, but you get to improve your hand with &quot;snacks&quot; cards, lie about your hand, and cause mischief with a few simple abilities. You don't have to fold nearly as much as in Human Poker, and there's no Panda-elimination either, so everyone can play the whole time.<br/><br/><br/>If you're new to Pand&aacute;nte, this new Second Edition base set has the Light &amp; Dark expansion content built right in!<br/><br/><br/>This expansion adds tons of content to the game while simplifying the base game. There are now fewer rules than the earlier version of the game, and it's faster to teach and faster to play.<br/><br/>You can choose how much complexity you want by mixing and matching the many new game modes such as Casino cards, Panda Champions, Diamond Dreams mode, and the Light &amp; Dark abilities.<br/><br/>",

Before, You Were Battling For Treasure &ndash; Now, You&rsquo;re Fighting For Survival.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Like the Dreaded Ambull before it, Escalation offers a new quest for Blackstone Fortress. However, the quest for the sinister Black Shrines offers new twists on the core gameplay of Warhammer Quest and promises to be a challenge for even the most seasoned pack of adventurers.<br/><br/>You won&rsquo;t be going in alone, however. Escalation brings four new Explorers to the game (and one very loyal Servitor!), offering you new options for your adventures and allowing you to own some iconic characters in plastic, like an Adeptus Ministorum Crusader and Primaris Psyker. Escalation will be the first time fans outside of the USA and Germany can get their hands on these models (if you&rsquo;re in the USA or Germany, you&rsquo;ll also be able to track them down in the Combat Arena game).<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s not just the good guys getting some reinforcements, but the Servants of the Abyss, with a brand new set of cultists, led by a literal Firebrand. These guys feature a more occult and barbarous aesthetic than their Traitor Guard brethren from the main set, helping shed some light on the dizzying diversity of the Slaves to Darkness.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Hell Judges box is the models of the 3 Judges, plus all the dashboards and cards you need to play them. But who are these Judges?<br/><br/>When Hades left the Underworld to fight alongside his fellow Gods, he left his wife, Persephone, in charge. She, in turn, enlisted the aid of Aeacus, Minos, and Rhadamanthus, who had all been famous lawgivers in life. They would help her to decide the correct treatment for each soul. That, at least, was the plan, and it worked for a while. Unfortunately the gates of the Underworld were open, and the dead began to escape back up to the realm of the living. Eventually the Judges followed suit, and now fight alongside the Gods, among the ruins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Last fall, crackling fires wreathed the mountains. This spring, light-wielding thunderstorms roiled the valleys. Now, with summer come early and a glowing moon overhead, the soil is moist and black and delicious mushrooms are peeking up all over the forest. The Foray is on!<br/><br/>Morels Foray expands Morels with new items, characters, weather, a more dynamic forest, and unique systems enabling 2-4 players. 3p and 4p have slightly augmented decks, start players with a basket and sticks, and introduce &quot;peek cards&quot; placed beside the deck to show what's coming up in the forest (these cards enhance planning depth but are not immediately accessible).<br/><br/>Each player count also has unique facets. In 3p, players receive an optional (non-card acquisition) bonus action at the end of each turn. In 4p, a marker rotates clockwise to show who is the Priority Player on any given turn. Players select cards from the same forest simultaneously on a Compass, then reveal and resolve proceeding clockwise before resetting the forest and passing the Priority Marker. Deciphering playing styles and motives is helpful because having selected an option that is no longer available when you go to resolve requires adaptation, at a price. This style of simultaneous play keeps a peppy pace with no down time and resembles a 2p Morels hallmark in evaluating what your opponents are likely to do and adjusting for optimal foraging.<br/><br/>At its heart, Morels Foray varies both the social and tactical texture of Morels. The new cards present fresh decisions and the opportunity for new strategies.  Weather cards (Rainstorm and Forest Fire) can decimate existing forests or spring up new ones, Items (Map, Shiitake Log) grant power with proper timing, Events (Farmers Market, Eureka!) enable big plays, Characters (Thief, Farm Girl, Eccentric, Chef, Morchella) allow you to interact with the forest and your opponent(s) in new ways, and new mushrooms (Lion's Mane, Panther Cap) expand your foraging options in the ever beckoning forest.<br/><br/>",

To unlock these rewards, players follow research paths marked on their Laboratory Mats.<br/><br/>During setup, and at the start of each round, Lab Tokens are randomly placed above each Action Mat. When a player places a Rancher on an Action Mat, if there is a Lab Token there, that player must follow that research path on their Laboratory Mat. The Lab Token is then discarded. Once a player reaches a reward, they receive it immediately and reset their Microscope Token to the center of the Laboratory Mat.<br/><br/>The Laboratory Mini Expansion adds layers of thinking to a player's strategy when placing their Ranchers to take actions. If a player can synergize their action choices with the research paths they desire on their Laboratory Mat, they can accomplish more with fewer actions putting them ahead of their competition!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
