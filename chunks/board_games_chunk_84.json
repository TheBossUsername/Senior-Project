Capture outlaws to collect the reward.  If an outlaw escapes, his reward increases.  The winner is the player with the most total reward money after all the outlaws are captured.<br/><br/>On your turn, roll the single die and choose to move either your Lone Ranger pawn or the Tonto pawn.  Landing in one of the areas allows you to draw a card from that area.  There are three types of cards you can discover:<br/><br/>1) Law abiding citizen - returned to the bottom of the stack.<br/>2) Wanted poster - keep this in your hand to search for the outlaw.<br/>3) Outlaw - If you have the wanted poster turn him face up for capture, otherwise he goes to the bottom of the stack like a normal citizen.<br/><br/>As outlaws are exposed you can try to capture them by landing on a tin star space and rolling a die.  If you succeed, collect the outlaw and the reward amount.  If you fail the reward goes up, all of the cards are collected, shuffled and redealt, and you must try again next turn.<br/><br/>",

In February 1941, Hitler decided to dispatch the German Afrika Korps to North Africa. Rommel's Afrika Korps immediately launched a counterattack, encircling Tobruk in Libya. On the other hand, the British army launches &quot;Operation Crusader&quot; with the aim of liberating Tobruk.

Types include light, heavy, and powered infantry that can fly using rocket packs. There are three &quot;forces&quot; represented by the counters: Confederation Infantry (the earthlings), Mercenaries (non-Confederation humanoids), and Telzans (lizard like aliens).<br/><br/>The game mechanics are mostly simplified versions of Squad Leader's mechanics with a few alterations as well as the additional nuances required for the futuristic infantry types and aliens.<br/><br/>The game mapsheets are geomorphic to accommodate the various scenarios that are included.<br/><br/>The production quality of the game is not bad, but not up to the better games of the same era (like Squad Leader).

The other progenitor game for Dong Wu Qi is Lu Zhan Jun Qi and it would be accurate to describe Dong Wu Qi as a hybrid between Dou Shou Qi and Lu Zhan Jun Qi.<br/><br/>In brief, the 8 kinds of animals in Dou Shou Qi are doubled for each player and pieces are placed face down on the board as in Lu Zhan Jun Qi rather than face up as in Dou Shou Qi. The board has similarities with Lu Zhan Jun Qi, with safe areas for animals to move into, and a base at each end of the board which the opponent is trying to get an animal into. The hierarchy of pieces is the same as in Dou Shou Qi, with the Elephant as the strongest piece, but susceptible to the Mouse.<br/><br/>Play is as in Lu Zhan Jun Qi - pieces are known only to their owner and combat (when a piece moves onto another) is resolved by a third person acting as a referee.<br/><br/>Unlike the traditional games of Dou Shou Qi and Lu Zhan Jun Qi, which many companies manufacture, Dong Wu Qi appears only to be made by one or two companies - currently, Da Fu Weng (Uncle Wang) produces this game.<br/><br/>",

But other snakes will try to stop you, so watch out!<br/><br/>There are 4 types of snakes: Cobras, Rattlesnakes, Kingsnakes, and Pythons, each one having special abilities that make them unique. Each player chooses a breed of snake to play and then moves their snakes through the plane, trying to scare the passengers and crew. When all sections of the plane have been thrown into chaos, the game is over and the snakes with the most points win.<br/><br/>Beware of the Bad Mother F$%#@! and the Air Marshall! Spook people with snakes on a plate and snakes in the head! But don't forget that snakes don't plan good and snakes can barely see!*<br/><br/>The game comes with a 5 piece board, a deck of 99 cards, 4 snake species cards, 20 snake markers, 10 chaos markers, rulebook, and scoresheet.<br/><br/>Cobras in the Cockpit supports 2-4 players and the average game takes 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/><br/>     actual names of cards; bad grammar intended<br/><br/><br/>",

From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Nsolo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Nsolo</a>:<br/><br/>Nsolo, also called Nchombwa, is played by the Angoni in Malawi and Zambia. It is the one of the largest mancala games known to exist. A close variant of the game was already described in 1913 by Meredith G. Sanderson, a military doctor in the British colony Nyasaland (today Malawi). The rules which are given in this description were reported in 1975 from Ndola, Zambia. The holes are usually dug in the ground.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a board ranging from 4 x 8 to 4 x 36 holes.<br/><br/>Each player owns the two rows on his side. If a very large board is used, two teams are fighting against each other.<br/><br/>Initially, there are two stones in each hole except in the rightmost holes (as viewed from the respective owner) of each inner row which are left empty. The largest variant needs 284 stones.<br/><br/>At his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes one for one in a counter-clockwise direction in the consecutive holes of his two rows. If the last stone falls in a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last stone) are picked up and then distributed in the same way.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last stone is dropped into an empty hole.<br/><br/>It is only permitted to move singletons for a player if he has no holes left which contain two or more stones. However, singletons may only be moved if the next hole is empty.<br/><br/>If the last stone falls into an empty hole of the players inner row and the opposite hole of the opponents inner row contains stones, these enemy stones are captured.<br/><br/>In addition, this move entitles a player to remove, from any part of his opponent's area, the same number of stones as were captured from the occupied hole.<br/><br/>The captured stones are removed from play.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player resigns or does not have any stones left. When the board position repeats, the game is a draw.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The thirty stones of the outer ring are auctioned, one at a time, and then the five trilithons.  Players place blind bids for a stone, but the bids utilize the trump rule of a trick-taking game.  Additionally, a player may include a trilithon card with their bid to nullify that trump rule, making that particular auction a standard blind bid.  The winner of an auction gets the stone, which is worth points equal to however many of that stone she now has (&times;2 if the new acquisition is a trilithon).  The winner of the auction gets no new cards, and the lowest non-zero bid gets two new cards; everyone else, one.  The first player to 20 points wins; or, if the last trilithon is auctioned with no one getting there, the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Auction Blocks is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.<br/><br/>",

If not, you discard the markers.  No markers should return to your initial supply unless a Derby card states otherwise.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when a player either places her last portion marker on a dish, or has at least one portion marker on each of her Yen cards.

        "description": "Moral Conflict 1940 is a strategic team game played by 2 to 6 players, which powerfully reconstructs the military, economic, diplomatic, technological and moral conflict as it enveloped the globe in course of the Second World War. It is possible to learn and practice not just teamwork, but also strategy, negotiation, planning and focus to achieve victory. This is a streamlined 12-sided dice version, ideal for play from 90 minutes by experienced gamers.<br/><br/>Victory points are collected in the beginners&acute;game like many one dimensional military games, by capturing territories and defeating the other players. In the advanced game it is possible to play and win through the further four dimensions.<br/><br/>FIRST the military war of great land, sea and air battles.<br/><br/>SECOND the economic crisis, the struggle for economic growth and access to critical oil and iron ore resources. The price of military war is clearly seen and the player who amasses much wealth can win even without fighting.<br/><br/>THIRD the diplomatic pressure to coerce neutral nations into trade or conflict. The excitement of winning a major ally such as the Soviet Union and the pain if they change sides.<br/><br/>FOURTH the race to develop new war or economic technologies, such as jet aircraft, radar, rocketry or more efficient manufacturing through prefabrication and standardisation.<br/><br/>FIFTH the moral decisions which shaped each nation&acute;s conduct. Seizing power through violence and treachery is contrasted with close cooperation, trust, sharing and self-sacrifice in search for peace.<br/><br/>The interplay of all five dimensions on each other is the unique Moral Conflict experience. Each game progresses differently with almost unlimited options.<br/><br/>An extra guide book, with historical background, teaches strategy in five dimensions and how to master each dimension to win the game and in real life.<br/><br/>Information on Moral Conflict 1941, a deluxe 20-sided dice version for sophisticated gamers, is also to be found on BoardGameGeek. Look out for information on BoardGameGeek for Moral Conflict 1939, an easy 6-sided dice version for play by most games enthusiasts.<br/><br/><br/>",

Two players duel in a fast paced turn based battle. Each participant chooses an army, and must dispose of their heavy and light infantry, shooters, cavalry, siege weapons and special abilities to defeat the opponent.<br/><br/>There are 2 types of cards: bases and abilities. Bases must be played on a territory. Each player has 3 territories and each territory can have up to 3 bases. Troops are recruited on a base and a base can have up to 2 troops.<br/><br/>On his turn a player must decide to reload or not. If he does both players recruit a troop on each of his bases and draw 2 cards. The player can also attack on his turn. Attacks are always from a territory to another. All troops must participate on an attack.<br/><br/>Each troop has a power that counts both for attack and defense. Bases always have a power of 4. To destroy a base one must destroy all its troops first. The goal is to destroy the opponent's Palace that sits behind his territories and has a power of 10. The Palace can only be attacked if at least one of the territories has no bases on it.<br/><br/>",

Relive one week of your life in one hour.<br/><br/>Remember how you said you wanted to be a writer? An artisanal pickle maker? Now's your chance. It only takes you two hours to finish your data entry, but management doesn't know that. Do you really want to make copies of copies all day? Why not work on your novel and brine pickles in the bathroom instead? You&rsquo;re pulling a paycheck either way. At the end of the day, players that didn't complete their tasks will be reprimanded, unless of course they can play an excuse to get out of it. Watch out for Wednesday, though, as there's always something that goes wrong on hump day.<br/><br/><br/>No Benefits is set in an average workplace, where players are average employees trying to get through the daily grind. You need to balance not getting fired with working too hard, in order to finish the week as the least productive worker.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to gain the most slack by the end of the 5 day working week (5 turns).<br/><br/>Each turn, players will be given an assignment from the day's inbox by the current Assistant Manager. On Wednesdays, crisis cards are also drawn and dealt with. Players can then play morning memos, plan their workday by selecting Grind cards to play, and then revealing their selected cards to show their progress towards their assignments. Players with incomplete assignments can plead their case with excuse cards. Without an excuse, players receive a write-up, and are fired if they gain 3. Finally, any late memos are resolved and that round's slack scores are tallied up.<br/><br/>The game involves a careful balance between putting off work for points, or doing work to gain sway and perks from your superiors.<br/><br/>",

Being the ring bearer will give you points at the end of the round, but it can hamper you during the round, so it's a bit of a risk.<br/><br/>This set can be combined with the Mordor set. Or each can be played on their own. The two are not just reskins of each other. They actually have different rules (while sharing the basic Crazy Eights mechanism).<br/><br/>The covenant formed around Frodo, Gandalf and Aragorn was known to have discord, and in Herr der Ringe Mau Mau: Freie V&ouml;lker you can determine who in the group has the final say.<br/><br/>",

Teams alternate play: but unlike most such card games, each team-mate plays a card secretly together, then discusses (without revealing anything about the played cards) which should take effect first.  Each card played adjusts the ownership of important resources, might grant a hunting token, or might increase (in a good season) or decrease (in a bad) the size of the tribe.

Marching time for the Carthagians to move your army or morale/money for the Romans to keep your Empire together.

        "description": "Operation Pincher (OP) is an alternative history wargame, designed by Ty Bomba, which allows two players to investigate the strategic parameters that would&rsquo;ve been in place in southeastern Europe and the Middle East had Stalin attacked there at that time, most likely in conjunction with a drive into Western Europe. His goal in starting such an operation would&rsquo;ve been to blitz to the oilfields and Allied base areas in North Africa and the upper Persian Gulf. That would&rsquo;ve effectively broken the geostrategic back of the British Commonwealth of Nations, disrupted Europe&rsquo;s oil supply, and delayed the US from being able to mount an atomic bombardment campaign into the USSR.<br/><br/>The scenario is based on the actual &ldquo;Pincher&rdquo; series of defensive plans drawn up in the Pentagon from 1946 through 1949.<br/><br/>There are rules for US atomic bombs, but their use is constrained by politics. That is, the late 1940s marked the arrival of the anti-imperialist (&ldquo;third world&rdquo; or &ldquo;nonaligned&rdquo;) movement on the world stage. So, if the Americans try to win by using enough bombs to blow to bits Stalin&rsquo;s attacking horde, they do so much damage to the environmental and socio-political ecologies as to undo that victory in the strategic sense.<br/><br/>The extra-large-hex 34x32&rdquo; map covers from Albania and Thrace south to Benghazi and Kuwait and east to Tehran and the Caspian Sea. Each hexagon represents 60 miles (97 km). Each of the eight full game turns represent two weeks of &lsquo;real time.'<br/><br/>Communist units of maneuver are Soviet and satellite-nation armies (plus super-elite Guards Airborne divisions) along with Allied armies, corps, divisions, brigades, and regiments. There are no US units on-scene at the start of play, but army &ldquo;regimental combat teams&rdquo; and Marine Corps regiments and a brigade rush in as reinforcements. Air power is abstracted, with counters and rules showing the effects of one side or the other gaining temporary air superiority over portions of the map.<br/><br/>Since this is a secondary theater (in regard to a presumed main front in Western Europe), the Communist player is never certain exactly what his order of battle will be until set up. He knows, however, it will contain a total of 12 to 14 Soviet combined arms, mechanized, shock and tank armies, along with 10 satellite-nation corps and armies (and possibly three to seven divisions of ultra-elite airborne divisions).<br/><br/>Each match generally runs through three phases. In the first, the Communist juggernaut drives deep across Turkey and into Mesopotamia. Only the Turkish and Israeli Armies, and the use of a-bombs by the US, can slow the advance. As Soviet losses mount and US prestige sinks, the middle stage begins. It&rsquo;s characterized by both sides maneuvering, seeking to hold or take still-contestable key areas. The Soviet guards airborne force is most likely to make its appearance. A-bombs are still going off, but their targeting has to be ever more selective and there are fewer such attacks. During this period a well executed Soviet campaign will achieve its victory objectives. The end game sees an Allied counteroffensive, as that player throws in everything he&rsquo;s got to try to take back from the Communists enough victory hexes to overturn what will otherwise be their end-of-play win on points.<br/><br/>",

Losing points isn't always a bad thing in Jewelers Row, however, as just before you score you will send the points in your lowest scoring gem color to your neighbor. Players then score for their top two gems, and only those two.<br/><br/>As you try to maximize your highest two gem types, you will want to watch your neighbor on your left to try to knock them down a notch, and watch the neighbor on your right to see the damage they're sending your way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Autumn is the time for taking a relaxing hike in the woods and seeing all the beauty that nature has to offer. In A Walk in the Woods, players take the best path to see as many features as possible and score the most points.<br/><br/>A Walk in the Woods takes 15-30 minutes and is for 1-10 players. This is a print-and-play game which requires the following: <br/>- Player Sheet<br/>- 1 red die<br/>- 1 green die<br/>- 1 yellow die<br/><br/>One player rolls all three dice and then selects two of the three dice. The sum of those two dice is used to determine which shape can be added to their path. Once a shape is added to the player's path, any features that are covered by the new path are scored at the bottom of the player&rsquo;s sheet. After each player selects their two dice to use, there will be 1 die left over. The player will fill in one side of the top most incomplete shape on the Bonuses section of the player sheet that matches the color of that die. When all sides are filled in, the player gets a special power they can use on any future turn.<br/><br/>The game ends on the round when 1 or more players extend their path to or past one of the 6 ending Finish squares. In the solo variant, the game ends after 22 turns.<br/><br/>",

You play as a sorcerer fighting for your life against a horde of deadly creatures, casting spells and summoning creatures of your own.<br/><br/>Creatures are made up of two cards: one for attack and one for defence. You bring your ally creatures to life by choosing which of the cards in your hand will be used for their attack and defence. Each of your creatures will be given a turn each round, which they use by attacking or blocking an enemy creature.<br/><br/>You and your virtual opponent take turns sending creatures into the arena, with enemies in one row and allies in another row underneath. The goal of your enemies is to kill you and anything that gets in their way. Your allies benefit from your spells and can combine some attacks and defences, as well as save certain turns for later use. But your enemies are relentless and have a greater range of attack and defence.<br/><br/>To win, you must play through the deck and defeat the entire horde of attacking enemies before your life is reduced to zero.

Regrettably, for those tasked with running the experiment, Schr&ouml;dinger himself has snuck into the group and wishes nothing more than to sabotage the experiment as he believes the Benefactor has missed the entire point.<br/><br/>Schr&ouml;dinger's Cat is a quick social deduction party game for 6-12 players. Game-play typically lasts 10-15 minutes. Player roles include a host, Lab Techs, Schr&ouml;dinger himself, a Financial Benefactor and several Think Tank Physicists.<br/><br/>Roles are split into two teams, blue and red. On the blue team are the Financial Benefactor, the Honest Lab Tech and the Think Tank Physicists. Their goal is to determine weather the cat is dead or alive successfully. On the red team are Schr&ouml;dinger and his Lab Tech. Their goal is to ruin the experiment.<br/><br/>The experiment is prepared by placing the two sided cat meeple into the experiment box (mint tin). One side shows the cat as dead, the other alive. The tin is passed and shaken by each player. The host reveals the status of the cat to the two lab techs. The host also introduces Schr&ouml;dinger to his lab tech. The identities of Schr&ouml;dinger and the lab techs are unknown to the other players.<br/><br/>Through stages of voting and deliberation the players determine if the cat is dead or alive. They also distribute influence to select a think tank chair. If think tank chair is on the blue team AND the think tank gets the state of the cat right, the blue team wins. If the red team tricks the think tank into voting wrong OR is selected as the think tank chair they ruin the experiment and win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Created in partnership with the NBA and NBPA, FLEX NBA lets fans play as their favorite NBA players, using their FLEX 'superpowers' to take down opponents!<br/><br/>The game comes with 10 NBA player tiles, from which each of the 2 players drafts a team of 5 tiles. Players also have the option to purchase expansion sets that include additional NBA player tiles so that they can build their collections. Players don't need to watch actual NBA games in order to play the game. The game mechanic itself is similar to many other TCG's out there (although because of our NBA license we can't call ourselves a TCG - hence why we refer to ourselves as a BTG - battle tile game).<br/><br/>Once players have assembled their lineups, they then take turns rolling the play action die and taking actions based upon the results of the roll. There are additional status FX tiles that enhance the player's move set and give them various competitive advantages. With many of the moves that a player makes (aka Flexes), they will whittle down the other player's confidence points (health) until the opponent's team is depleted of CP.<br/><br/>The mobile companion app integration serves 2 primary purposes - 1) it is necessary to view the player tiles' AR animations, and 2) it is necessary if players wish to register the unique bar codes on their player tiles to our database and thereby claim ownership (per our NBA license, we cannot use the words NFT or blockchain, but that's what it actually is).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Barnyard is an 18-card drafting game designed specifically for 2 players in which you will compete to corral the best combination of farm animals that you can. Manage an ever-shifting barnyard of animal cards and carefully wrangle the animals you want into your corral to score the most points and win the game!<br/><br/>On your turn, you'll choose an animal in the farm and use its power to manipulate the animals in the Barnyard line. Then, you'll flip that animal over and add it to the back of the line.<br/><br/>Next, you'll take whatever animal is currently at the front of the Barnyard line and add it to your corral.<br/><br/>Be careful! Some critters get along better than others, so you&rsquo;ll have to carefully plan the layout of your corral if you want to score the most points and win the game.<br/><br/>Want to ramp up the complexity? Every copy of Barnyard comes with the free 6-card Farmers Expansion. Work towards your own secret corral objective to score even more points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Careful: you will lose points for ingredients that fall off the sandwich.<br/><br/>You are an Ogre Chef, and you must compete against other  Ogre Chefs to impress the Ogre King with your culinary  skill. Gather ingredients and Stack them on your sandwich  to create the most delectable meal in the swamp. At the  end, carefully present your sandwich to the Ogre King. The  Ogre King demands a perfect sandwich and he&rsquo;ll only eat the most delectable offering&hellip;May the best Ogre Chef Win.<br/><br/>What Players Do: Roll two dice, the first dice is a mandatory action that involves taking an ingredient of the indicated type from the supply and putting it on your sandwich. The second dice roll is an optional bonus action that will let you grab additional ingredients, place additional ingredients, steal ingredients or force another chef to remove an ingredient from their sandwich.<br/><br/>Game Mechanics: The placement of the ingredients has a few rules. Chefs may only use two fingers when placing an ingredient on their sandwich. Critters must be placed standing up. Lettuce and Cheese must be placed over the top of the critters on your sandwich when you place it. Once you have placed a cheese or lettuce, you must place all future critters on top of the top layer of your sandwich, no tucking critters underneath.<br/><br/>If a critter falls over, you may pick it up one time and attempt to place it again. If you knock anything else over or off of your sandwich during this second attempt, follow the rules for a knocked over or knocked off ingredient.<br/><br/>If a critter is knocked over but remains on the sandwich, it does not count towards your set of critters at the end, but it is still worth 1 point.<br/><br/>If a critter or ingredient is knocked off the sandwich, meaning it touches the table in any way, remove it and any ingredients on top of it from your sandwich. Those ingredients are removed from the game.<br/><br/>The game comes with two modes: Standard Play: Ages 8+ and Basic Play: 5+.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of television network battles for ratings. Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks (ABZ, NBZ, ZBS, IND), and the goal is to have the most money when the game ends, after three rounds.<br/><br/>Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events: drawing an event (Flash) card, buying a TV show or star, etc. Stars are assigned to shows, shows are assigned to time slots. Shows may be bumped to the next night to accommodate a new show just purchased. Each player goes around the board once, populating his Friday night schedule. Once all players have completed the round, each 30 min slot awards money to the top-rated network, with ex-aequos splitting the money. The process is repeated for Saturday and Sunday. When going around the board again, visiting an owned show space forces a payout to the owner. Finally, the Sunday round is followed by an additional weekend scoring, where the ratings across all three nights are summed and compared. The richest network wins.<br/><br/>Note that when one rolls doubles, one either moves ahead the full die score, or one goes backward by the single die score. This adds strategy.<br/><br/>The game was later republished by Avalon Hill as TV Wars (q.v.), but the latter's rules are considerably different.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Napgammon&quot; is a light weight wargame of luck and maneuver. It takes the core roll-and-move mechanism of Backgammon and applies it to a two-dimensional point-to-point map with differentiated terrain and movement costs. As in Backgammon, players roll two dice at the start of their turn and make one move for each die. Rolling doubles allows four moves, but also enables multiple divisions that begin the turn stacked together to move as one, potentially achieving superior combat odds and an advantageous column shift. Combat is resolved using an odds-based, but completely deterministic, CRT, and losses are permanent. A pool of reinforcements can be brought in from your Capitol city. The game is won by either completely surrounding your opponent's Capitol, or by Eliminating sufficient enemy units that you outnumber them two-to-one.<br/><br/>This is the second of Hollandspiele's annual holiday mini-games, the first of which (Christmas at White Mountain) gave birth to the successful Table Battles. It will be packed in, free of charge, with any order placed during the 2017 holiday sale containing at least two games. After the sale, it will be made available for purchase as a downloadable PNP game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rebel Yell is a simulation of American Civil War small-unit tactics. The playing pieces in the game represent companies of infantry and cavalry or sections of artillery Each infantry and cavalry unit has one strength point and is equivalent to between 45 and 100 men, depending upon the scenario. Each artillery unit has two strength points and equals two guns. The players of Rebel Yell assume the roles of divisional commanders.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken down into segments. During an action segment, the units of a particular player may conduct a single action. In the beginning modules these actions are: Move, Fire, Assault, and Rally. During any Small Arms segment, the units of a particular player may only fire.<br/><br/>There are no movement phases, fire phases, etc., as there are in other Civil War games. This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.<br/><br/>One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the &ldquo;problem of approach,&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of &ldquo;modern&rdquo; weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.<br/><br/>Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.<br/><br/>Once players have learned all the rules (or even before), they can design their own scenarios. The game includes six geomorphic maps. Because the maps can be aligned in a variety of ways, the players can recreate a &ldquo;microscopic&rdquo; examination of virtually any Civil War engagement.<br/><br/>Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area. Rebel Yell is &ldquo;big&rsquo; only in the sense that it is detailed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a sculptor who must prove to be the best.<br/><br/>After his recent victory in the war against the Pandyas, their arch rival, the Chola King decides to build a temple tower as a mark of his victory. The King, whose dynasty built thousands of temples in South India, invites sculptors from across his empire to help build the temple tower. Each sculptor is expected to bring stones from their region to build the temple together with other sculptors. The sculptors are expected to use all stones available to build. The King also sets the reward objectives for every stone and sculpture placed on the temple tower.<br/><br/>The sculptor can gain rewards incrementally when placing stones of other sculptors on the temple structure. When placing their own stones, the sculptor does get any reward points. But the sculptor does get points for pattern(s) created on the temple structure using their stone. Hence the objective for the sculptors would be to focus on building the temple structure with as many stones possible and creating patterns using their stone. It is important for the sculptor to ensure patterns are not created with stones of other sculptors.<br/><br/>The game ends when the temple tower is completely built with stones and sculptures or when a sculptor is unable to perform any of the possible actions. The sculptor with most reward points is declared as the winner or the best.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The first person to collect all six wins. Good luck and happy hunting!<br/><br/>Each player starts with the same six-card hand. One each of numbers 1-6. The remaining cards, including the Wild Card, are shuffled and placed face down as the draw deck.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, each player chooses a card to play. When a player has chosen, they will place that card face down in front of them to show the other players they are ready. Once all players have chosen a card to play, each player flips their card over to reveal what they have chosen. Highest card wins the round. When players reveal their hand, the winner keeps their card face up in front of them. The remaining cards go into the discard pile. At the end of each round, all players draw another card from the draw pile so everyone has six cards in their hands at the beginning of each round. When there are no more available cards in the draw pile, reshuffle the discard pile and use as the new draw pile.<br/><br/>Sound easy? Not so fast!<br/><br/>There are some special rules when playing the game.<br/><br/><br/>    Number 1 card always beats a Number 6.<br/>    A number 3 card gives you the ability to choose to keep your number 3 card or trade for your opponents 1 or 2 card.<br/>    Wild card always wins the round and can be played as any number of players choosing.<br/>    If two or more players play the same number card, they cancel each other out. If there are only 2 players, neither player wins and the next round is played.<br/><br/><br/>",

Other similarities include an extra turn when doubles are rolled, two decks of cards (&quot;Production&quot; and &quot;Exploration&quot;), income tax, income upon passing the start space and even incorporation of the unofficial &quot;Free Parking&quot; variant, here called the Slush Fund.<br/><br/>Different is an interior board path and an elevated 6x6 drilling board. Landing on an outer board space usually offers the chance to lease a plot on the drilling board if not already leased. Travel on the interior board, possible only by landing exactly on its entrance or possession of a plastic permit token (obtained by landing on other spaces), permits drilling once one has a drilling company. This is very much a costly hit-and-miss affair, especially when drilling without any other proven oil fields nearby.<br/><br/>If the player does not go bankrupt, eventually his plots should be populated with a lot of black plastic pegs indicating gushers rather than the yellow ones which signify dry holes. Then each time a player passes the start, he is paid based on the number of barrels he is pumping.<br/><br/>Unlike Monopoly, the idea is not to drive others into bankruptcy, but to be the first to reach one million dollars. While there is a good atmosphere of real drilling situations, there is also much chaos in the dice, cards and spinner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungeonrunner is a solitaire card game inspired by classic pen and paper fantasy RPGs. The player takes a hero on a quest through one of nine adventure decks. Each adventure deck is filled with danger and peril as the player guides the hero through hazardous traps, countless monsters, and dreaded curses.<br/><br/>Each deck of 54 cards make up ten separate adventures with varying difficulty. Infiltrate Emperor Zinn&rsquo;s castle with the Lowly Thief, trudge through Muck Elf Swamp with the Amazon Warrior, or if you dare, confront the Demon Queen, Lawnadynn with the Paladin of Truth!<br/><br/>Each turn, you play a card from the adventure deck. It may be a monster, trap, event, or item. Once that card is resolved by combat or your decisions, you draw the next card. If you can make it to the quest card for the given scenario, the hero completes the adventure!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dungers are smelly, short sighted, hairy, violent beasts lacking intelligence. What to do with them? RACE THEM! Up to 5 players can grab their Dungers and race through checkpoints to be the first to cross the finish line. However Dungers have trouble listening and are as likely to run into a wall or the the completely wrong direction as they are to head where you want (oh and did we mention the traps on the track?)<br/><br/>Each turn a player indicates the direction he hopes his Dunger will run.  Dice are rolled to see if he is listening.  If he is not listening you roll to see what direction he is going to run.  Then dice are rolled to see how far your Dunger runs that turn.  Running into walls and boulders knocks your Dunger out but knocks some sense into them letting you control their movement better when they wake up.   Running into another players's Dunger results in a fight with the winner getting to decide the direction the loser's Dunger runs for his next turn.<br/><br/>Dunger Derby the Board Game has easy to learn rules is meant to be played in 45 minutes or less for a great family game night.  We have test gamed the game with several 6 year olds (with the parents helping them play) and we've had them have a lot of funs watching the pigs run, knock themselves out or get into fights.  As a result we've rated Dunger Derby the Board Game for ages 6 and up based on our testing.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the first player to use all of his chips or all of his rings.<br/><br/>Anytime a player gets to form a row (orthogonally or diagonally) with 4 rings or 4 chips, he is allowed to put a new chip on the board.<br/><br/>A player can put a chip over an opponent's chip, but be aware: the third chip played in a single stack is the last one, and it allows the player to change the color of the ring - blue player can take a red ring from the board and put a blue ring in the same space if he got to play a blue chip as a third one in that stack.<br/><br/>There are also 4 white neutral rings in the start of the game, used to give even more replayability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paper Pinball is a dice game that tries to capture the feeling of playing pinball. All you will need is a pencil, three dice, and about five minutes.<br/><br/>Each round, roll two dice and fill in one of the scoring zones. Some zones need to be filled in a certain way, and most will cause some sort of effect, so the order you fill them in is important. If you ever can't fill a zone, you'll lose a ball. Lose three balls and the game is over. Try to fill as many scoring zones as possible while triggering multipliers, opening tunnels, and getting the coveted multiball.<br/><br/>Sherwood 2146 is one of three Paper Pinball titles available, together with Laser Sisters and Wolf Hackers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Step into the world of Sunlight, a roll and write game that will transport you to the arid desert where cacti thrive. This game is perfect for players who love strategy and are looking for a fun and engaging way to spend an afternoon or evening. With a cactus theme, players will get to embrace the beauty of the desert and collect points by strategically placing their cacti on the grid.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is simple: collect as many points as possible by placing your cacti in the best position on the grid. Each turn, players will roll a set of dice that will determine the type and the location of their cacti. They must then decide where to place their cacti on the grid, taking into account the placement of other cacti and the scoring opportunities available. As the game progresses, the sun will move across the sky, casting its light on different sections of the grid. Only cacti that are in the sunlight will earn points at the end of the round, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game.<br/><br/>For players who prefer to play on their own, Sunlight also features a solo mode where you can play against an AI opponent, Nyx. In this mode, players will still roll the dice and place their cacti on the grid, but their decisions will also impact the AI's score. The AI will make its own decisions based on the player's moves. With its solo mode, Sunlight is the perfect game for players who want to test their skills and strategy against a challenging opponent, even when they are by themself.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each of the 3x3 corner quadrants of board represent the different seasons, and the goal of the game is to get a row of three stacks of counters placed in one of the seasons.  Players alternate placement of counters on empty squares until such time as somebody gets three in a row in a season (or overlapping seasons).  When a row is formed, all single pieces in the involved seasons are removed, and the player's removed pieces are stacked onto the last played piece of his color.  One goal should always be to minimize stack sizes, because when you run out of pieces to play, you have to use up a turn reclaiming a non-critical stack from the board.  The first stack a player forms will of necessity be at least three high, but subsequent stacks can be held to two piece height due to the fact that stacks themselves are eventually used to help form rows, and only single pieces are removed to form new stacks.  First person to get three stacks within one season wins.<br/><br/>",

To win, you need to rescue all 9 neighborhoods, fighting off the evil bots that are terrorizing them, reuniting friends and family, and cornering the Evil Doctor in his secret lab!<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Lightning always plays first. On her turn, she can move, smash DocBots on her location by rolling her die, and rescue neighborhoods she's cleared of bots. Lightning ALWAYS defeats all DocBots on her space, even if she rolls below the number of bots surrounding her. But, when she rolls low the extra DocBots make her trouble meter tick upward&mdash;one for each extra bot. Once her trouble meter is full, Lightning is trapped, and can't move until Bolt comes to rescue her!<br/><br/>Lightning rescues neighborhoods by flipping over tiles that have been cleared of DocBots. Once she flips over a neighborhood tile, it stays face-up until the next neighborhood is rescued. If the tiles match, they're safe, and remain up and clear of bots for the rest of the game! If they don't match, they both flip back face down, and moving back to fac edown tiles you've visited before brings a new batch of DocBots to fight.<br/><br/>On Bolt's turn, the giant robot rolls three dice, and assigns them to the actions described on its player mat. Some actions (like moving and searching a neighborhood) require 1 die assigned, regardless of value. Others (like attacking DocBots or rescuing Lightning from trouble) depend on the value rolled. If Bolt needs to increase the value of its roll, it can increase its heat by 1 per die re-rolled. But if Bolt's heat meter gets full, it overheats, and must spend all three dice on the following turn to cool down. Still, sometimes overheating is preferable to taking too much damage from being swarmed by DocBots in neighborhoods Bolt enters&mdash;bots Bolt doesn't defeat remain on its tile turn after turn, dealing continual damage and preventing it from moving or taking any actions until Lightning swoops in, destroys the bots, and spends a turn repairing her robotic friend.<br/><br/>If Bolt rolls a 6 on any of its dice, it can choose to assign that die to downloading an upgrade, drawing a card from its upgrade deck. On the following turn, dice can be assigned to that upgrade to activate it.<br/><br/>To win, Lightning &amp; Bolt must match all four pairs of neighborhood tiles. But if at any point they reveal the Evil Doctor's lair, all unmatched tiles are shuffled, setting back our heroes badly! However, if all four matches are made, and the last tile flips up to reveal the Evil Doctor's lair, Lightning &amp; Bolt have cornered him, and take him off to jail, saving Midtown once again!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rules of the Game:<br/><br/>4 cards are dealt for all players to see, two of which have yellow backs. The first player uses as many or as few cards as needed, (the only rule is each card can only be used once per turn) to create an equation that equals 1. The next player uses the same cards to create an equation for 2 and play continues as high as cards or ability allows. The player that finds the highest consecutive operation wins!<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is a mental math game using math operations, which can be differentiated for all grades, inclusive of K-5, 6-8 and even high school level students (when factorials and exponents are incorporated into the game).  Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is easily differentiated, it provides the teacher or parent with flexibility to adjust the game to each student&rsquo;s level.  A teacher can easily raise or lower the ability level of the game by choosing different numbers with which the student(s) can work.  It allows for individual use, small group and whole class learning experiences.  The game can teach students in small groups and as a whole class to work collaboratively and cooperatively, encouraging team work within the classroom.<br/><br/>Because Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is a mental math game, it gives students the opportunity to think and solve equations in order to achieve success in the game.  Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia is not a game where students methodically repeat drills in order to learn their math facts.  Students naturally acquire this ability through the different processes needed in order to complete the solutions.  Students are able to first visualize the numerical operation by the number on the face of the card, then by referring to the different operation signs (add, subtract, multiply, divide).  The game can also allow for tactile bodily/kinesthetic engagement as students move the cards or touch the cards while working through their solutions.  Students inherently begin to acquire the knowledge of multiplication and division through their repetitive use of the numbers to consecutively count the sheep in the game.  When students achieve a solution, they reinforce their newly acquired skills and the other students participating in the game also hear the repetition of the mathematical equation, which provides reinforcement of the necessary math skills needed for students to be successful in math.<br/><br/>Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia appeals to students because it is purposely sized to fit in small hands.  It does not have the look or feel of flashcards, allowing students to feel like they are always playing a game instead of doing school or homework.  But because they are instantly and continuously engaged, they are learning while having fun.  The developers purposely designed the game so students never feel as though they are going through math drills, and as students achieve their goals to win the game, the teacher or parent wins because the students have learned and practiced their math facts and order of operations while playing the game.  Even reluctant math students get hooked on Albert&rsquo;s Insomnia because each hand begins very easily, and players are fully involved in &ldquo;playing a game&rdquo; before the more challenging aspects of math kick in.

This is a light and quick card game where you do battle with a rival, running, jumping and boxing, trying to force your opponent to run out of options.<br/><br/>The game involves two players each having a small deck of 18 cards and taking it in turn to play a card which follows their opponent's play either in suit (run, jump or box) or value (1, 2 or 3).  The suits dictate an action: run involves drawing cards, jump involves returning a card to their deck, and box forces their opponent to discard a card.  The numbers dictate a penalty number of cards to draw if the player cannot follow the previous play.<br/><br/>Game play focuses on managing the number of cards in your hand and in your deck so that you always have an option for your next turn.  If you ever get into a situation where you are unable to complete an action, you lose the game.<br/><br/>",

The object is to collect the most triplets. Each player begins with a hand of five cards. In turn order, a player asks for a food. Every player who has a card or cards of that food in her hand must offer all of those cards  and no others to the questioner. Players who do not have that food in their hands may either sit out or bluff by offering the questioner one or more cards of any type. The questioner chooses one offer, sight unseen, and adds those cards to her hand. Players meld their triplets when they create them. Play continues until only the cheese cards remain in players&rsquo; hands. Players score one point for each melded triplet and minus one for each cheese card in their hands.<br/><br/>",

This is a game of mass battle in which you command an army with the goal of smashing your enemy into ruin. Ages of Conflict employs a flexible system allowing you to create units and armies from nearly any time and genre, including ancients, fantasy, black powder, and science fiction.<br/><br/>Scale Agnostic: Ages of Conflict treats the miniatures as representations of the soldiers in the unit allowing you to use any scale miniatures you prefer - 2 mm, 3 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, 28 mm, etc.<br/><br/>Multi-Genre: One set of rules to battle with historical, fantasy, black powder, World War II, and sci-fi. This means you can also mix genres allowing you to fight an army of American Civil War Confederates against undead, a World War II Allied force against alien invaders, and so on. This does not mean the armies will be equal.<br/><br/>Army Lists: The Ages of Conflict core book includes over 50 historical army lists spanning the ancient world to the early Renaissance, 20 fantasy army lists, and close to 30 black powder army lists from the Seven Years War, the American War of Independence, the Napoleonic Wars, the Crimean War, and the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Customizable: Use your favorite miniatures and bases you already have. Uses a large variety of miniature manufacturers including MicroWorld, Baccus, Essex, Irregular, Victrix, Perfect Six, Old Glory, 2d6, and more. You can also use a variety of basing standards: 60 x 30 mm, 40 x 40 mm, 40 x 20 mm, etc.<br/><br/>Fast Paced: Minimal book keeping and alternating actions keep you engaged and the game moving at a brisk pace. There are no result tables to reference with each roll. Once you learn the turn sequence the only information you reference is your army roster sheet.<br/><br/>Solo Play: While not strictly designed for solo play, Ages of Conflict does play perfectly well as a solo game and includes guidelines for playing Ages of Conflict in solo mode.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

The play board is a network comprised of 6 sliding play pieces or shuttles that can be moved right or left, offensively or defensively, by either player.  The game objective is to place 5 stones in a row -- horizontally, vertically, or diagonally -- while blocking the opponent's attempts to line up 6 stones in a row.  Each shuttle has spaces for 7 stones.  PerPlexus requires that a player plan moves several turns in advance whether playing stones or moving shuttles.<br/><br/>",

Kids won't know they're learning how to think strategically, and adults will wish they remembered how! Four levels of difficulty provide a challenge for anyone who sits down with Dozen Doubloons in front of them.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 54 cards.  There are four sets of numbers 1 through 12, plus 4 BLOCK cards, and 2 WILD cards. The object of the game is to deplete all cards in play.<br/><br/>Shuffle. Deal 6 stacks of four cards face down, and a fifth card on each stack face up.  The remaining cards are your draw stack. To play: combine up to three cards that equal 12, and place them in a discard pile.  Turn over the next card in each of your stacks.  If a BLOCK card shows up, do not remove the card but move it and all cards underneath it to a position above any other unblocked stack.  You may not touch the BLOCK stack until the stack beneath it is depleted.  Once the stack is depleted, slide the whole BLOCK stack down into position, discard the BLOCK card, turn over the next card, and continue playing.<br/><br/>When there are no cards that equal 12 (or if you choose not to use a combination that is available), turn over the first DRAW card. If it's usable, use it. If not, place it face down in front of you.  Continue to DRAW cards as needed, and keep placing them to the right of the original card. If a BLOCK card comes up from the DRAW pile, discard it and ALL the other cards accumulated from previous draws--they are now out of play.<br/><br/>Once you have gone through your DRAW pile one time, the game is over.  If you have not depleted all six original stacks, you have lost.<br/><br/>This is a summary of the rules and not meant to cover all possible scenarios.<br/><br/>",

The game was a promotion prize by the Landliebe dairy, makers of pudding, milk, ice-cream in Germany.<br/><br/>It consists of a (flimsy) card board board, made out of 2 pieces that will form a bigger board, 3 cardboard playing pieces per player (2 player), 1 scoring marker of cardboard, gemstones, 4 special chits for the board and 33 small cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to Keltis but simplified of course: From a starting point three paths can be reached. On these paths 9 chits (5 gemstones, 4 other chits) are openly laid. Each player gets 6 cards, the remaining 21 are put in a central card pile. Players lay one card on a private pile of a certain colour. The piles can be ascending or descending, but this choice can only made once. Once a card is legally added to a pile the player can choose to advance one of his playing pieces on one of the paths on the board. If one playing piece reaches a chit the chit is removed and gives points or if its a gemstone can be taken by the player. When the public card pile is exhausted the game is over. Players get points according to the advancement of their playing pieces (-2 to +10 points are possible on each path) and for each gemstone they collected (0 gemstones = -3, 1 gemstone = -1, 2 gemstones = 2, 3 gemstones = 3 4 gemstones = 6, all 5 gemstones = 10 points). The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of gladiatorial combat in ancient Rome. Played using counters or miniatures figures (54mm or 25mm) on a hex grid. For two or more players.<br/><br/>Gladiators was designed as a system for single figure miniatures combat. But it is more like a role-playing game's combat system than a traditional miniatures system. Combat takes place on a hex grid making Gladiators similar in nature to Steve Jackson's Melee system (the combat system which evolved into The Fantasy Trip which eventually evolved into GURPS). Of course, the rules are a bit more specialized than Melee in that they focus on the gladiator combat of ancient Rome.<br/><br/>Gladiators took two years of play-testing and conceptual development to create. A set of playable yet detailed and realistic rules for simulating gladiatorial combat. Players will be able to move their gladiators, feint, and dodge about as they prepare to lunge at their adversaries. They can slash or jab at their chosen targets, and must parry the return blows of their opponent. Shields can be used to bash opponents off guard. Accidents also have a place in this simulated universe. Men can trip or stumble, weapons or shields can be dropped, or nets cut to shreds. In short, an imaginative player can momentarily enter the arena and prepare himself for a contest which will be won or lost by the same elements that brought victory or defeat, fame and wealth or sudden death to a gladiator. Skills, cleverness, foresight, and luck all play their respective roles.<br/><br/>These rules open a new dimension of wargaming--the realistic and exciting simulation of one man versus one man in the arena. Give them a try. You'll find a game hard to beat for moments of challenge.<br/><br/>Contains 1 cardstock sheet of tables printed on both sides and 1 cardstock hex sheet printed on both sides (2 difference sized hexes, one size on each printed side).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Mow 'Em Down, players represent different landscape company owners who bid to win landscaping contracts throughout an ever-growing city.  Players can bid only if they have enough lawn mowers available in their company.  As players win contracts, they earn money to purchase more lawn mowers, which allows them to bid on future contracts.  Contracts can expire, so players must be savvy with their bids to maintain a profitable business.<br/><br/>During one's turn, a player receives earnings from previously won contracts and purchases new equipment if desired.  Then the player roles the die to determine which of three sizes of land tiles to act upon for the duration of the turn.  Once the size of land tile has been determined by the die, the player chooses from one of three actions to take:  BUILD, BID, or BOOT.<br/><br/>If the player chooses BUILD, the player expands the city by drawing and placing a new land tile of the determined size to the existing city.<br/><br/>If the player chooses BID, the player opens an auction on one or two land tiles of the determined size for eligible players to bid on contracts.  (In most cases, the lowest bidders win the contracts.) The winning players will receive these earnings on future turns.<br/><br/>If the player chooses BOOT, the player cancels and removes a contract of the determined size and the affected player will not continue to receive these earnings on future turns.<br/><br/>Various bonuses and event cards can be earned or played throughout the game that add some random elements.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last land tile is placed onto the city and all other players take one additional turn.

Many of Azytecal's once great temples stand on the cusp of ruin, the voices of the faithful no longer echoing throughout their halls, and the altars lay barren.

Raise the Ruins is a card driven set collection game with easy to grasp mechanics and engaging game play decisions for 3-4 players, Ages 10 and up, and plays in 45-60 minutes.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>52 Offering Cards<br/>8 Trophy Cards<br/>12 Temple Cards<br/>3 Deity Cards and 3 Wooden Deity Markers<br/>2 Wooden Crest Markers<br/>4 Favor Cards<br/>24 Wooden Followers (6 in each color)<br/>4 Score Cards &amp; Wooden Markers<br/><br/>________________________________<br/><br/>Raise The Ruins will be available later this month in standard Small Box Games limited print run.

Rivalry among and within noble families would often lead to Machiavellian politics, outright theft and sometimes kidnapping. The Beh&uuml;tuns family was no different, as different branches of the family squabbled over money &amp; subjects.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Beh&uuml;tunsburg is a two-player card game usually played in 4 rounds. (Two copies of the game can be used to play with 3-4 players.)<br/>Players will assemble a &quot;court&quot; of Barons &amp; Knights with their Ladies, then a King and Queen, and finally adding a castle.  Each of these elements are worth a certain number of victory points. Knights can be sent on quests to find treasure and more vassals for the King, (i.e. drawing more cards).  Opposing players can attempt to disrupt plans by sending rogues to steal from the treasury or kidnap ladies, knights, barons or baronesses.<br/><br/>The round ends when a player with a complete court and castle discards their last card.  Scores are totaled based on the victory points of the cards in play.<br/>The goal is to have the most total victory points at the end of four rounds of play.<br/><br/>",

The returning mechanic of Magic 2014 is Slivers, a series of creatures of which each grants an ability to each Sliver.<br/><br/>Magic 2014 marked a change to the Legend rule. It made the &quot;Indestructible&quot; effect a keyword, and changed the phrasing for unblockable creatures to &quot;can't be blocked.&quot; Slivers in Magic 2014 also worked subtly differently from Slivers in earlier Magic; they now only affected Slivers owned by the same controller, rather than all Slivers in the game. Slivers also received an art redesign that de-emphasized their original beak-headed, one-clawed, one-tailed insect-like appearance, and instead became monstrous humanoids whose appearance varied heavily by card, but had &quot;normal&quot; features such as faces and eyes. This redesign proved controversial; one reviewer noted &quot;slivers are one of the most iconic designs in all of Magic: The Gathering. To essentially muddle them down into just another humanoid monster thing is really disappointing.&quot; Wizards of the Coast acknowledged the negative feedback, noting that some players disliked the new art style, and included a card in Magic 2015 that used the original Sliver appearance in Sliver Hive<br/><br/>",

In response the Police Commissioner has selected you, our most expendable officers, to form Precinct 9's first Bomb Squad.<br/><br/>But it's not just the bombs you'll have to contend with. There's also the new sniffer dog that keeps setting them off, not to mention your back-stabbing colleagues who are all out for personal glory at your expense. Meanwhile the bombs keep on ticking down, one slip up means disaster, and someone keeps hiding the wire cutters!<br/><br/>Bomb Squad #9 is a game of bluffing and deduction, set against the slow ticking of a time bomb. Players search for the bomb and the wire cutters amongst nine face down cards. Each card has a special ability: allowing a second card to be seen (wire cutters, sniffer dog, metal detector), mixing the cards around (anarchist, panic), or just reacting to other cards (bomb, rat, can). On their turn, a player secretly looks at a card and declares it to the others. If they are not accused of lying, or if accused and acquitted, they get to perform the declared action. Certain combinations make the bomb explode, and if not defused the bomb explodes after six turns regardless. Bomb Squad #9 was derived as a combination and miniaturisation of Lost Legacy and Memory, but with a metal detector that actually beeps!<br/><br/>",

The goal is to obtain the maximum points by being the most successful at catching fish and receiving credit for implementing conservation measures to maintain a healthy population.  Each fish follows a uniquely structured life cycle that models their real-world dynamics and susceptibility to overfishing, including snapper, tuna, sardines, sharks, mahi mahi, and crabs. Players select which fishing zone and species will present the best fishing opportunities each round.  The availability of sea life to catch changes throughout the game, as the fish go through various life cycle stages and are harvested by the players. If they are abundant, they are easy to catch. But if they are overfished, it gets harder, just like in real life.  Strategize to protect your stock from overfishing while collecting the boats and gear to tip the odds of a big catch!<br/><br/>-description from designers<br/><br/>",

You get 3 rolls of 6 6-sided dice and one special category dice. If you use all of your dice, your score doubles. If your dice match your category (high, low, same, different, odd, even) then your score doubles again. Once this score is made, you may chose to roll the Multiplier Dice. The Multiplier Dice will come up with 1,2,or 3, and this number is multiplied by your current score, but be careful, the multiplier die also has a 0.<br/><br/>",

The game involves the quest of the fellowship and the military situation simultaneously.<br/><br/>As the game was not properly licensed, it was quickly pulled from distribution and is, as a result, quite rare.<br/><br/>(Description from the Diplomacy Boardgame Compendium and Gallery)<br/><br/>This game is based on the basic game mechanics of Diplomacy (moves, holds, supports and convoys), but is set in Tolkien's world of Middle Earth.  The game is played either by two opponents or four players (two per team, one controlling armies and fleets and one controlling the other individuals).  Because the game is intended to be played by two opponents (a person or a team), the one part of the traditional game of Diplomacy that is not preserved in this game is the diplomacy itself.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of negotiations, the basic game mechanics are taken from Diplomacy but with a number of extensions or modifications.  Armies and fleets are supported by supply centers, but can have single, double, or triple strength.  In addition to armies and fleets, there are a number of characters/roles, such as Gandalf, Strider, The Ringbearer, and the Nazgul, each of which has certain attributes or abilities (for example some characters increase the strength of the army they accompany).  There are a variety of special rules regarding terrain, as well as victory points given in special circumstances such as The Ringbearer getting to Mount Doom, a Nazgul with the Ring getting to Barad-Dur, the Ring being captured by Mordor's strongest army, and others.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of 60 cards and on each card there is a different picture, eg. a city, a mug, a bike etc... One player places a number of cards on the table (the more cards, the more difficult). The other players study the cards for 30-60 seconds, then they close their eyes. The dealer turns one card over and on the count of three the other players can open their eyes and try to remember what's pictured on the flipped card. The first player to shout out the correct picture on the flipped card gets it. Get the most cards and win the game.<br/><br/>This game can of course be played with anything (a standard deck of cards, toys, kitchen utensils etc.) but it's more fun with a dedicated deck and since it is packed in a real small box it can be taken everywhere.<br/><br/>",

Players each receive four cards, corresponding to themselves and the other three racers in the game (rules are included for 2 and 3 players). Players<br/>also start with 5 oranges in their provisions (tracked on a scorepad). A neutral party begins to flip over the remaining cards one by one. Some are Way cards (no effect; anyone playing cards loses an orange), some are good actions (gain oranges), and some are bad (lose oranges).<br/>The action cards contain ranking(s) (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th), and the corresponding gain or loss for each ranking. When one of these actions comes up, players play one or two cards into a central area. These cards are then picked up and sorted through by the neutral players, discarding the second and succeeding instances of a given racer's card<br/>(so, if the corresponding cards played were racers 1, 3, 1, 1, 4, 3, 2, 2, the order for card resolution would be 1, 3, 4, 2). The players corresponding to the played cards' rankings then either gain or lose oranges based on the ranks shown on the action card.

All players can influence the speed of a car through their card play. Cards are played in tricks that are used to determine what car can move that round, how far it will move, who will drive the car, and finally what player will lead to the next trick. The track itself is far from any ordinary race track with various short cuts and back tracks scattered throughout the circuit allowing for drivers of the cars to have quite a bit of control over their progress. In the end, the player that most closely predicted the finishing order of each car will emerge victoriously.<br/><br/><br/>A note about how to &quot;short cut&quot; a homemade version:<br/>Use the cars from Knizia's Formula Motor Racing game and the cards from Sticheln. Using the cards from Sticheln is a real time and work saver! Granted, they won't have the cool race car look but it's a nice trade off if you have the game sitting around.<br/><br/>",

The system allows players to choose their method of approach and their style of combat. Will they go into close order, or spread our for better fire possibilities. What are the pros and cons of the rifle-armed American militia? Can your dragoon forces exert any influence?<br/><br/>Carolina Rebels contains a high amount of tactical detail, all in a very short group of rules, designed for quick learning and fast, easy play.<br/><br/>The two battles chosen highlight small tactics towards the end of the war, where both sides had ample opportunities to watch, learn and practice, with an emphasis on Formation. Some of the great commanders of the war, from Nathanial Greene to Daniel Morgan to the infamous, but capable, Banastre Tarleton are in full action at the surprisingly even battles at both Cowpens and Hobkirk&rsquo;s Hill.<br/><br/>Carolina Rebels is designed for quick learning and easy play, using a system that has almost unlimited possibilities. Game rules are short, but there are lots of charts and tables to cover every aspect of battle at this micro level. The combat rules, covering both ranged fire as well as bayonet shock, will seem familiar, yet different. Playing time is less than 2 hours.<br/><br/>Each game of Carolina Rebels includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemick&rsquo;s, colorful cut-and-paste counters, and 2 spiffy Bill Ramsay maps (in 4 sections).<br/><br/>Carolina Rebels was a nominee in the Charles S. Roberts awards for Best DTP-Produced Boardgame (Charles S. Roberts Awards) for 2005.<br/><br/>",

The morale system is now somewhat brutal, and there is an effective command-control system where each company HQ throws one movement-pip dice. Players purchase and field companies, though these can be 'ad-hoc' companies made up of platoons from different sources. The extremely detailed armor and gun charts have been completely re-written including footnotes notes on every item. Also soft skin and truck-mounted gun charts, and very detailed army and equipment lists for all thirteen nations. Usable with 1/300th, 1/76th or 15mm scales, these rules have a 1:1 ratio, though infantry are based in fire teams/crews. Infantry fire-fights are quickly resolved and require only 1 dice thrown per group of combatants, with casualties being complete teams. The nations covered are Belgium, Britain, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Poland, Romania, Soviet, US Europe and US Pacific. These rules are complete, no future supplements or expansions will be needed. Page count has increased from 70 to 121 pages. The rules are not full of glossy color photos, however, when it comes to content, they are without compare.

Once a fairy tale has been selected, each player needs to write down five words commonly associated with that tale.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get the other players to say their secret words by asking questions and through general conversation. Once the game has started, you must not speak your own secret words.<br/><br/>On your turn, pick a person and ask him a question about the story. He has to answer it. Remember, not only is your subject not allowed to use his or her secret words, but you aren&rsquo;t allowed to use your secret words either.<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn, you may instead pass your turn. If all of the players in the game but one pass their turns in one round, then the game ends.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, jot down what you think each player&rsquo;s secret words are. Take turns declaring your secret word guesses. Score one point for every correct guess. Score a point for every one of your secret words that no other player guessed. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The attacking player now throws his 4 dice three times and gets all the matching cards and the points on them. The cards still on the table go to the &ldquo;defending&rdquo; player. After 6 times, the cards are used up, and both players count their score.<br/>The second round players change roles.<br/>After this, the player with the higher score decides, which player gets which role in the third round. Who wins this third round, wins the whole game. In a variant, players play only two rounds and the higher total score determines the winner.<br/><br/>There are more rules available, one kind of &ldquo;Yahtzee&rdquo;, and one tactical &ldquo;memory&rdquo;-variant, using only the dice or the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Runaround, your goal is to get your pieces out of your home, all the way around the board, and back again before your opponent.  Sounds familiar, right?  The twist is in the board:  It's a &quot;U&quot; shaped board.  Your pieces frequently pass your opponent's pieces on the other side of the wall.  If your piece lands across the wall from one of your opponent's pieces, you swap places.  Often, this'll jump you ahead and push your opponent back.  As you play, you'll uncover a remarkable depth of strategy from this simple roll-and-move game.<br/><br/>Runaround is a game for two players.  Runaround uses a six-sided die, five pawns per player, and a custom board.  A two-player game takes about 40 minutes to play.  Runaround is appropriate for ages 9 and up.<br/><br/>",

O jogo &eacute; para jogadores de wargame iniciantes com regras f&aacute;ceis de asimilar e que permite o entendimento e a entrada neste estilo de jogo. Composto por um livreto de regras, mapa, tabelas e pe&ccedil;as de jogo, inaugura nossa s&eacute;rie Bellum Brasilis.<br/><br/>English : Tracunhaen&acute;s Slaughter is a tactic wargame (platoon level), for 2 players. The game recreates the slaughter what 2000 potiguares indians attacks the &quot;Tracunhaem&acute;s Engenho&quot; (Tracunhaem&acute;s Sugarmill) and kill all Portuguese colonists and slaves. The main objective for Portuguese player is resist for 8 turns against the indians. The objective for indian player is kill all colonists and slaves.  The game is for novice wargamers, easy rules and short time of play.<br/><br/>During the period of colonization of Brazil, in the year 1534, there was an incident known as Trag&eacute;dia de Tracunha&eacute;m, in which Indians killed all the residents of a mill called Tracunha&eacute;m in Pernambuco. The justification for this attack was due to the kidnapping, followed by the disappearance of the chief Iniguassu&rsquo;s daughter, after marrying a Mamluk adventurer. It was a requirement that both of them, after the wedding, remains in the Indian village, but this did not happen. Iniguassu&rsquo;s first step was to send two of his sons to Olinda, in Pernambuco, to claim justice. Fortunately, they met on a visit to Pernambuco, the governor of Brazil, Ant&ocirc;nio Salema, who ordered the beautiful Indian to return to her father&rsquo;s house immediately. On the way back, they had to spend the night at Engenho Tracunha&eacute;m, by Diogo Dias. When dawn dawned, India disappeared, possibly hidden by Diogo Dias. His brothers complained a lot but did nothing and returned home without his sister.<br/><br/>Taking advantage of this, the French stationed in Para&iacute;ba instigated the Potiguares to revenge, and soon a contingent two thousand Indians of diverse Potiguares tribes marched against the mill. The Indians surrounded the fortified mill and used an unusual tactic: only a few Indians let themselves be seen to make it believe that it was the action of a small group. When the plantation&rsquo;s defenders went out to counterattack, they were attacked by a crowd of Indians. The mill was burned, and it appears that only two family members survived because they were not at the mill. After this episode, other Itamarac&aacute; mills were also attacked, resulting in 614 deaths. This episode generalized the fear in the Portuguese settlers of the region.<br/><br/>It caused the king of Portugal to extinguish the captaincy of Itamarac&aacute; and create the captaincy of Para&iacute;ba, with limits from the mouth of the Popoca river to the Bay of Trai&ccedil;&atilde;o. In this way, it would protect the sugar industry, expelling the French, and expand the domain to the north of the Northeast region.&quot;<br/><br/>The Bellum Brasilis series was originally produced by the extinct Riachuelo Games and was directed to games at the tactical level, covering several episodes in the history of Brazil. This wargame is the first in the Voxelhouse Old School Wargames series.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The French Grande Arm&eacute;e under Emperor Napoleon I attacked the Imperial Russian Army of General Mikhail Kutuzov near the village of Borodino, west of the town of Mozhaysk, and eventually captured the main positions on the battlefield, but failed to destroy the Russian army. About a third of Napoleon's soldiers were killed or wounded; Russian losses, while heavier, could be replaced due to Russia's large population.<br/><br/>The battle at Borodino was a pivotal point in the campaign, as it was the last offensive action fought by Napoleon in Russia. By withdrawing, the Russian army preserved its combat strength, eventually allowing them to force Napoleon out of the country.<br/><br/>Game allows to play either side and decide about the fate of Napoleon and his conquer of Russia.<br/><br/>",

How will your country develop?<br/><br/>A surprisingly simple game of country building, city connecting, and pick-up-and-delivering for one. The player places domino-like cards to create a map. Land cards indicate both natural resources and railways links. Outpost cards have both resource production abilities and resource demands. When placing outpost cards, gains resource cubes based the outpost's ability to produce a resource that matches the natural resources of neighboring land cards. If another outpost becomes linked to a another outpost via a connecte railway, and one outpost hHas a resource demand while the other has a matching production cube, then that resource can be delivered, increasing the recieving outpost to a town. A second delivery increases it to a city.<br/><br/>Designed for the 2012 print-and-play Solitaire Contest.<br/><br/>",

You navigate the mountain while exploring the man's thoughts as he contemplates about the unknown abyss that lies exactly after his life's biggest accomplishment.<br/><br/>There are five exit points on the board, one for every element that will affect your journey - frost, sun, wind, sky and horizon. As you try and find the path down, you learn more about yourself through the story cards, divided into five different story lines that affect you as a protagonist.<br/><br/>However, the path down is not immediately obvious. Your movement subdues and stimulates the elements. If three or four elements are acting, you start suffering from ennui; a feeling that perhaps getting to the bottom of the mountain is not that important after all. If all five elements are raging, you will succumb to nature and die.<br/><br/>Traverse through the safest path and take care of yourself. This could be either the most important journey of your life, or your last.<br/><br/>Story Writing by - Johnathan Harrington, Mathew Agius Muscat, Fran Borg<br/><br/>",

What makes this game unique is that one player commands the Union in the Eastern Theater, and the Confederates in the Western Theater; the second commands the Union in the Western Theater, and the Confederates in the Eastern Theater. Both players are competing to gain the most Victory Points in each Theater while defeating their opponent on the other.<br/><br/>The objective of each player is to score the most Victory Points in terms of seizing critical cities and winning battles. The idea is that you are positioning yourself for a major promotion for total command of all your side's armies for the rest of the war. Units represent corps, divisions and individual leaders with their staffs. Each turn is one month.<br/><br/>Published in S&amp;T 297, Mar/Apr 2016<br/><br/>",

They are not competing each other but the worms that want to get to the fruits faster. If the basket is full, the kids win!<br/><br/>Game play: the active player draws 3 cards. If a worm is shown, spin the worm spinner first to know which worm needs to be moved one step closer to the cherries. After this, move the pawns on neighbouring fields - of the color shown on the cards showing leaves. There are cherry tokens showing 1, 2 or 3 cherries. If any worm reaches a cherry token the players lose. If a pawn arrives on a '1' cherry token it can be taken. For a '2' cherry token 2 pawns have to be present on the given token and a '3' cherry token can be taken only if there are 3 pawns on the same space.<br/><br/>",

Some models have a Neutral alignment, which means the can join either team.<br/><br/>The game is scenario based, although You can play a simple deathmatch just for fun.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/><br/>Each Round is broken down into four distinct phases, which proceed in the following order:<br/><br/><br/>     Power Phase: Players distribute Power counters to each of the models in their team, usually up to the character&rsquo;s Power value. If a character is KO, Power counters are instead generated.<br/>     Initiative Phase: Players determine the order in which they will proceed through the round. This stage adds a level of unpredictability to the game &ndash; you might go first this round, but end up going last in the next.<br/>     Action Phase: The players activate each character in turn &ndash; moving, fighting, shooting, and resolving special actions. Play alternates, with the player who went first activating a single model, then the second player activates a model, and so on, until all models that can act have done so.<br/>     Final Phase: Some special effects must also be resolved in this phase. This is also a &lsquo;tidying up&rsquo; phase, where Power counters are removed and scenario victory conditions are checked. If, at the end of the Final Phase, one player&rsquo;s entire crew is Knocked Out and/or has been removed from play, the game ends and the other player is declared the victor.<br/><br/><br/>Every test/combat (To Hit, Agility etc.) is resolved by rolling dice, usually 2d8.<br/><br/>",

Just be sure to send me an invite to the wedding if you do!<br/><br/>Bossbattle Bunnies originally had my own artstyle for consistency, but then I figured it would be way cooler to have many different artists (18 in total) contribute to this project in their own style.

During the game, players move around the board made up of tiles (districts of Krakow). The game starts with six tiles - the oldest districts - and as it progresses, more districts are added. In each district there are some important places identified (divided into categories, e.g. Art or Spiritual Life) represented by tokens. The winner is the player who first collects a certain number of tokens of a certain type.<br/><br/>An online knowledge platform is integrated into the game. On each of the elements (board tiles, tokens) there are QR codes, which link to pages with descriptions of districts and places in the game. The platform was prepared under the supervision of the Jagiellonian University staff. In the game there are also cards with important events from the history of the city, which introduce minor modifications to the game (e.g. give extra traffic to the player).<br/><br/>The game is not available for sale. It was distributed for free at promotional events and is available in city libraries.<br/><br/>",

The person who wins this robot -- ten times stronger than Helltoken -- will be the king of the universe! However, ten secret stone orbs scattered across the cosmos are needed to start Godra. Two evil organizations, the Magic Society Fumblers and the Revolutionary Army Sun Seater, race to collect the orbs. Dr. Dicenykov has promised ownership of Godra to the first organization to find them all. Now we see evil against evil dropped into the middle of the Cologascal Islands in Nankai&rsquo;s secret area! Fight! Two dice will roll!<br/><br/>Overview<br/>Players control evil organizations. Victory is won when 10 stone orbs are recovered before the other team.<br/><br/>The game is divided into rounds consisting of two parts:<br/>Fleet battles<br/>Landing operations<br/><br/>During fleet battles, players sink the opponent's ships with a die cannon (random type remote weapon).<br/><br/>In the second half, landing operations, the soldiers remaining from the fleet battle are divided to conquer &ldquo;Island Cards&rdquo; arranged in the center of the table. If players land the required amount of soldiers on the island, that player will earn the stone orb hidden on the island. However, it is important to be careful because the soldiers who land on the same island will eliminate each other. During the round, players receive support from the merchant, Gafnorick, from Dr. Dicenykov&rsquo;s support organization. Players can build up their base with a variety of items like robot brigades that can be used as mercenaries, or a secret weapon that empowers the function of the die gun.<br/><br/>",

The winner will be whoever manages to empty their stockpile first. Cards are played onto four shared building piles in numerical sequence from 1 to 11. On each turn, a player draws until they have three cards in their hand, and then plays cards from: their hand, a top card of their discard piles, or their stockpile. At the end of their turn, a player must discard onto one of their four personal discard piles. Strategy involves the organizing of cards into the discard piles, care in not setting up the next players for good plays, knowing when to play from which option, and especially the timing of playing a valuable &quot;Skip-bo&quot; wildcard.<br/><br/>",

Then place the Eidolon anywhere on the Map.<br/><br/>Powers:<br/>Hierarchy (Ongoing): The Eidolon generates 1 Power during the Gather Power Phase. He can be Captured like any Cultist and is Recruited, rather than Summoned. He cannot Create or Control Gates.<br/><br/>Eldritch Wisdom (Ongoing): If the Eidolon is in play, after any player's Action you can force each player to write down his or her next Action and then flip this Loyalty Card face-down. Example: an enemy who plans to Move must write &quot;Move&quot; but he need not say which Units are Moving, nor to where. On each player's next Action, they must perform that Action unless it is now impossible to do so. In this case another Action may be taken. Flip this Loyalty Card faceup in the next Doom Phase.<br/><br/>",

Then leave an ephemeris in the center of the table with the date in sight. This last card will be the starting point of the timeline. In turns, each one must place one of their cards to the left or to the right of the initial event, depending on whether it happened before or after. Once located, it will turn you over. If he did it correctly, he will leave her in the timeline. If he did not guess correctly, the ephemeris is discarded and the player must take a new card from the remaining deck. This dynamic will be repeated with the rest of the participants. Whoever first manages to place all their cards on the timeline will win. The challenge will appear when cards are added, since there will be more options to decide.<br/><br/>Secret Ephemeris<br/>Take a random ephemeris card, to discover what different people did, in different parts of the world and at different times. Do it any day of the year and at any time. Then, take out a card of questions, which will question us about issues of the anniversary that were not counted. The question may be answered orally or in writing, but yes or yes, it will have to be done creatively.<br/><br/>Ephemeris on Demand<br/><br/>Read ephemeris to inspire your own actions. This haphazard reading can also give us clues or hints of hope in times of uncertainty. It can invite us to reflect or help us solve dilemmas, as if it were an oracle.<br/><br/>An Ephemeris is Born<br/><br/>Make two lists: one of professions, jobs or hobbies (eg architect, teacher). Another with qualifying adjectives (eg: fast, insistent) The more original, the better! Then cross elements from both categories (randomly or by choice) and thus create a fantastic binomial (Gianni Rodari, 1973) such as: &ldquo;Insistent Architect&rdquo;. Name the new character, place it in a city in the world and assign a date. Imagine a short story: tell something that happened to him or tell what he was doing that day. They can also be inspired by the questions on the cards. You just have to get carried away by the fantastic combination of words!<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with five money.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player uses special cards (optional), turns two cards face up, keeps one of these cards while flipping the other face down, sells sets of food cards (optional), and auctions cards on hand to other players (optional). The special cards, which are claimed like any other, allow a player to steal one card from an opponent or keep both cards revealed that turn. When a player sells a set of food cards, she receives 2-16 money for selling 2-5 cards of the same type; these cards are then removed from play. A player can auction any number of cards, with opponents bidding in round-robin fashion for the entire lot.<br/><br/>Once the last card has been claimed from the table, the game lasts three more rounds with players being able to take only the optional actions listed above: using special cards, selling sets, and auctioning cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dark Shadows was the first of two board games based on the TV series to come out onto the market in the late 1960s. Each player is dealt 4 cards of varying types. Players use these cards to drive their movement across the board by matching a card to a particular space. Each turn, a player either plays the appropriate card to move ahead or discards one and stays put, then draws a new card. The first player to reach the end space is the winner.<br/><br/>Some strategy is added by the nature of the board spaces. Certain paths will call for any card that matches a number value (1 or 2) or color (red or black). Others require a specific symbol (bat, spider, poison cup, or knife), or one of the special vampire cards (Barnabas or the generic Vampire). There are alternate paths a player may choose which are shorter, but require more specific items.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Creature Castle<br/>    Black Hole: Space Alert Game<br/><br/><br/>",

You play the role of an ambassador on board Babylon 5. You explore the vast stretches of space, lead huge fleets into battle, and control the economy of your faction. There are several ways to achieve victory ranging from economic growth to all out militaristic control of the universe. Diplomacy is not to be neglected either, as the more powerful game changes are brought up in Babylon 5 council vote to be decided.<br/><br/>You construct your playing 'board' using hexagonal shaped pieces that come with the game. The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards. Players may buy cards allowing special actions above and beyond the normal game, like an extra move or more EPs.<br/><br/>Using your faction's wealth and resources you play the game and explore the map. You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals. The choices are yours and will decide if your faction is successful.<br/><br/>",

Build your herd of dinosaurs and send them to destroy your friends' nest before they get to yours. Defend yourself against rival herds with well timed Triceratops shields, redirect damage with an Ankylosaurus tail whip, or just completely wipe out your friend's herd with a meteor strike!<br/><br/>Each player starts with 4 cards, 6 Dino eggs (Life Points), and a Herbivore Habitat. Start your turn by drawing 2 cards from the Draw Pile, then choose up to 3 cards to play before ending your turn. To survive Extinction, you'll want to build an army of Dinos. You can play 2 types of egg-smashing Dinos: Herbivores and Carnivores. Since you start with a Herbivore Habitat, you are free to play Herbivore Dinos on your turn. If you're lucky to draw a Carnivore Habitat, you'll be able to cause more destruction upon your opponents with your Carnviore Dinos!<br/><br/>All Dinos start as Hatchlings that deal baby damage to opponents. If you want real egg-crushers that deal even more damage, just feed them food! Food can be used in two ways: to grow Hatchlings and to fend off Dino attacks! Managing your food can make or break your chances of survival, so plan wisely.<br/><br/>When it comes down to the end, there can only be one person to survive Extinction. This game forces you to test your friendships. Will you ally with your best friend or cold-heartedly wipe them out?

Within the Gamot lie dangers untold, for no hero has yet returned from its deep depths. The journey here has not been an easy one. You dismount from your trusty steed and ready your sword and shield. If you conquer the Gamot, you will earn the greatest glory in the land and with it a place among the King&rsquo;s personal guard. A worthy position for a hero such as yourself!<br/><br/>As you approach the entrance to the Gamot, you can smell the foul stench of death and are overcome with an unexplained dread. While you steel your nerves against this dark air, you hear the sound of hoof beats behind you. Your horse has fled in fear&hellip; You are truly alone now. You step into the entrance of the Gamot, filled with determination. As you do so, however, the floor gives way and you find yourself suddenly tumbling down an incline. You hit the ground below with a hard thud. After taking a moment to regain your bearings, you search in the darkness for your sword and shield. They are nowhere to be found! Rising to your feet, you see that you have fallen into a long corridor lined with doors. A haunting laugh echoes in the dungeon. The only thing that stands between you and whatever horrors await you in the dungeon is your will to live and your desire to prove yourself the greatest hero in the land&hellip;<br/><br/>Will you survive the Gamot?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Gamot is a solitaire dungeon crawling card game, designed to be quick and playable on-the-go. You take the role of an adventuring hero as you attempt to navigate the perils of the dungeon. You will search for weapons and items in which to defend yourself, while fighting fearsome monsters and drinking potions to keep your health up! No two games are ever the same!<br/><br/><br/>     Arm yourself with swords, bows and warhammers, or locate powerful weapons such as the Golden Trident!<br/>     Use special items like the Magic Ring to rearrange the shape of the dungeon!<br/>     Choose wisely when to face a threat head on and when to run!<br/>     Face monsters such as werewolves, black knights, great worms and the dreaded and deadly lich!<br/>     Search the halls of the dungeons for potions to help you recover from your wounds suffered at the hands of these brutal beasts!<br/><br/><br/><br/>Gamot is the perfect game for on-the-go players! Gamot requires little space to play, plays as quickly as you can make decisions and can be carried in your pocket. Designed to be played while waiting in lines, travelling on buses or trains, or on your break at work, Gamot also works for filling in time while you wait for your turn at the gaming table. With only a deck of 54 standard playing cards (and some small counters that you can easily replace with your memory or a scrap of paper and a pencil), and developed to appeal to both your mind and your wallet, Gamot provides a great and inexpensive dungeon crawling experience that won't break the bank!<br/><br/>Gamot is easily learned, but tough to master. Gamot is also family-friendly, and requires only basic math skills to get started.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We set out to build a game that truly captures the legend of Sasquatch. There have been more than 10,000 reported sightings of Sasquatch in the US alone, yet no one has successfully proven or disproven their existence. In Finding Sasquatch, you'll find elements of the legend of Sasquatch - mystery, deception, fact-finding, adventure, and a little right-place-at-the-right-time. We hope this game can bring some mystery and excitement to your game nights, and maybe even create some believers.<br/><br/>What makes Finding Sasquatch unique?<br/><br/>Gameplay depth: There are unique strategy elements around determining how and where to find Sasquatch and players must be strategic about how they influence Sasquatch's location, what information they share with other players, and what information they keep for themselves.<br/><br/>Caters to broad audience: The game has multiple layers of strategy and complexity, making it great for everyone from newbies to hardcore gamers. Play it for family game night, with your gaming group, or just 1 on 1 with your bestie.<br/><br/>Beautiful artwork and high quality cards: To fully capture the Sasquatch theme we focused on getting the artwork, graphic design, and physical features just right. Gameplay aside, we think you'll be pleased with the quality of the product.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quadryx is defined as a &quot;logic game of strategic control&quot;. It's an abstract game played by 4 players on an octogonal game board divided in 37 square spaces. Each player has a group of 9 square tiles, each divided in 4 triangles of different colors. Each player will be represented by a one color, and the goal of the game is building squares (quadryx) by joining two triangles of the same color, while trying to make it difficult for the other players to do the same. The one who builds the most quadryx wins.<br/><br/>It's also possible to build a fulldryx, which is 4 quadryx of the same color joint together. If there is a tie on the number of quadryx, the winner is the one with most fulldryx.<br/><br/>Quadryx (also known as Qryh) is an ancient game whose origins go back to the 11th century. It was brought back thanks to spanish teacher and researcher Antonio Jos&eacute; L&oacute;pez,who spent almost 25 year gathering information from historical documents about a similar game from the Escuela de Estudios Talm&uacute;dicos de Lucena (Spain), where Jews, Christians and Moors took part equally.<br/><br/>According to the researcher, there is historical evidence of its presence on Lucena's nobles' homes around 1100. <br/>Later, the game re-appears on El Cairo, where the greek sailor Saulo de Quir&oacute;n finds it and gives it as a present to King Alhamar of Granada (Spain), who gave it to his concubines from the Alhambra's harem. It stood there from 300 years until the kingdom fell in christian hands.<br/>In 1501, Abraham Cohen, a convert merchant from Lucena found it in Granada's Aljaba, and remembered seeing it when he was young, so he took it back to Lucena.<br/>From that moment on, the game's trail was lost.<br/><br/>It was first brought back on May 2001, and it was later launched internationally by Famosa on 2002.<br/><br/>",

At the same time, the player to your left rolls 2 dice, a color die and a number die and keeps the results hidden from you.  You must choose either a) take a color and number die from the four you rolled, or b) take the mystery dice rolled by the player to your left.  Whichever you take, you must write the number you selected in a space matching the color you selected on your player board.  The remaining players then each choose a color and number combination from the remaining dice and write that on their board.  Remember, the higher the value of the die, the more points it's worth (and you want the lowest score possible).<br/><br/>If you ever manage to create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of numbers that are either 3-of-a-kind or 3 numbers that add up to 10, you get to cross out that row, reducing their value to zero.<br/><br/>The game ends when any one player completely fills in two of their three grids, then all players add up the total value of the numbers showing on their boards.

        "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>FOURSIGHT - a classic game for two, is the only board game that actually allows you to play half of your opponent's pieces as well as your own.  To win, you must learn to think like your opponent and have the foresight to change your strategy as conditions of play change.  Your object: get 4 in a row to win immediately or three in a row four times.  Colored scoring pieces may only be played on neutral (foundation) pieces.  Plan your strategy well, because once you've placed your pieces on the board, they can't be moved.<br/><br/>FOURSIGHT combines the simplicity of tic-tac-toe with the challenge of chess for a game of infinite variations.<br/><br/>",

Rules at the back, map front and 17 double sided counters along the sides.<br/><br/>The game is a hex and counter game where troops are activated though a standard deck of cards: black activates French units, red Coalition. How many and all is determined by the specific card.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.<br/><br/>The player who controls both towns of Probstheide (L4) and Wachau (O3) wins the game, otherwise it is a draw.<br/><br/>This game is part of a series of postcard games about the battle of Leipzig, which can be played individually or combined into a single game called A Bridge Too Few (for this you will need an article published in the 2013 Against The Odds Annual):<br/>13) Marschall Vorwärts!<br/>14) \"A Matter of Honor, Sire\"<br/>15) The Nations Assemble<br/>16) Trapping the Ogre<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Swords is a fast-paced simultaneous action card game for 2-5 players that feels like a multi-person sword fight!  It's quick, fun, intense, strategic, and not too difficult to learn.  Players play their cards at the same time either on themselves or on an opponent and each card has a different effect depending on where it's played!<br/><br/>Swords is an exciting game of quick decisions and sudden changes in fortune, just like a real sword fight!  You and your opponents make your decisions in secret and execute them at the same time, strategies adapt by the second, and every hand is a surprise!  You can win by playing aggressively, always attacking and making opponents draw cards, or you can hope that the others will be so busy fighting each other that they won't notice your quickly diminishing hand as you Yield and discard an extra card.  Often a person you were just attacking might suddenly become an ally when you realize, almost too late, that someone else is about to win and you need to team up to take them down!  There are many different strategies, some readily apparent and others more sneaky, and reading your opponents is just as important as making the right choice at the right time!<br/><br/>Here's a quick summary of how to play!<br/><br/>Everyone starts with seven cards. Each round, players each choose a card in secret and then play their cards at the same time.  The goal of the game is to run out of cards first.<br/><br/>There are four types of cards: Attack, Defend, Yield, and Riposte.<br/><br/>You can play any card on yourself or an opponent and each card does a different thing depending on where it is played!<br/><br/>Attack when played on an opponent makes them draw 2 cards.  If you play it on yourself you lay a trap for any player who plays a card on you, making them draw 4 cards.  But look out, it's risky!  Anything that's played on you still hits you, and if no one plays anything on you the trap backfires and you have to draw 2 yourself!<br/><br/>Defend when played on yourself does what you might expect, it defends you!  When you play it on someone else, it acts as a sort of guard break, negating cards they've played on themselves... just watch out for that Attack trap, Defend is defenseless against that!<br/><br/>Yield lets you sneak an extra card into the discard pile when you play it on yourself.  When you play it on an opponent, however, instead of putting that extra card in the discard you give it to them!  Like some kind of card vampire!<br/><br/>Riposte is like a counter attack when you play it on yourself, it bounces Attacks, Yields, and Ripostes back at the person who played them on you.  When you play Riposte on someone else it immobilizes them for the next turn, leaving them wide open!  Careful though, if more than half of the people playing lay down Riposte on the same turn it causes a Clash and every single person has to draw 2 cards!<br/><br/>The main game is played with 3-5 players but there is also a fun and sneaky 2 player variant that shakes things up with a hidden Dagger mechanic!<br/><br/>A battle usually lasts around 5 to 10 minutes!  You can play single battles or play a war where battles award 1 point for a tie or 2 points for winning alone, and the first player to 6 points wins the war!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players are trying to amass the largest collection of pets by claiming pets from the pet shops.<br/><br/>The game is played over a several rounds, each of which goes through the following 4 phases:<br/>1. Supply - The pet shops randomly gains new pets.<br/>2. Donation - The players each donate a new born pet to the respective pet shop.<br/>3. Claim - The players attempt to claim older pets that the pet shops are giving away by bidding. Pet shops give away older pets to the first customer that wants them. However if more than one customer wants to claim the same pet, they will decide to keep the pet to avoid a confrontation. However, if one of the claimants can provide a more conducive shelter for the pet, he will be given the pet during a confrontation. This phase will recur until all the pets in the shops are given away or the players all decide to stop claiming pets.<br/>4. Birth - The players' pets give birth to new born pets.<br/><br/>Play continues through the 4 phases in each round recurrently until the deck runs out.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players tally the number of pets they have as well as check who has the most shelters for each type of the pet. The player with the most shelters for each type of pet takes a penalty(loses some pets) as they are deemed to have too many shelters and thus insufficient space for the pets to live comfortably. The players with the most pets for each pet type gains a bonus (gains more pets of that type). After applying the penalties and bonuses, the player with the most pets win.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns to check the cups, memorize them to discover their delicious tea, and use action cards to rotate the cups' positions.

Build your railroads from the Piney Woods in East Texas to the wide desert swaths of West Texas. The map primarily covers the eastern portion of Texas where the railroads were most abundant.<br/>The game starts with private companies that are much simpler than most 18xx games, but each game will be a little different with a random company selected by Jay Gould.  This company will have a head start on the other companies because of this initial investment. However, the other players will have a chance to catch up with balanced private company powers of their own!<br/>Enjoy your time criss-crossing the state with twisting tracks!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players can then move Olivia around the board by swapping her card with other cards. The board gets progressively smaller as the game goes on, a mechanic you need to use to your advantage to knock out other players or end rounds while you're ahead on points. Drawn cards allow you to move Olivia, discard cards from the board, secretly swap the card in your hand with one on the board, and, eventually, have Olivia catch other players who are not protected by any cards between them and her!<br/><br/>Every round the cards that are available change, so your strategy can switch between heavy offense, strategic card removals, and unofficial alliances with other players to knock out those who are further ahead.

Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed. If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>The set, for the Italian market, Scienza e Natura contains historical events which are related to science and nature discoveries and strangeness. Like all Anno Domini the Scienza e Natura edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>Anno Domini Scienza e Natura is a functional merger of two previous set themes, Nature and Wissenschaft &amp; Forschung.<br/><br/>",

Will you lead the Axis and Soviet Union along this path of history or will you attack southwards to acquire the oil rich Middle East or strike the Empires a death blow? As the USA player can you thwart an Axis surprise attack on your Pacific fleet in Pearl Harbor and avoid the USA&rsquo;s sudden entry into the war?<br/><br/>A Moral Conflict game can be played in either a co-operative or non-co-operative way. The rules you need to play are not difficult but Moral Conflict requires many skills to master the dimensions and the game. In this fast moving non-turn based educational game, opportunities are continuously presented to make decisions and act. You can sit on the sideline and watch as world events occur. You can co-operate with other players to defend and develop your lands, or you can trust no one but yourself, as you build up your power and influence around the globe.<br/><br/>How will you guide your power? Set your heart and mind on one or more of the 5 dimensions:<br/><br/>Military war: great land, sea and air battles.<br/><br/>Economic crisis: the struggle for strategic resources and economic growth.<br/><br/>Diplomatic pressure: coerce or persuade new nations into trade or war.<br/><br/>Technology race: develop new weapons or production methods.<br/><br/>Moral conflict: the eternal fight between good and evil.<br/><br/>As your courage grows you can add the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th dimension games. As the intricacy increases with added dimensions, you will enjoy the growing challenge to plan more strategically, think more long-term and more effectively leverage the interdependency of the dimensions. Interact with your friends in 5 dimensions and watch how victory is won and lost as players use different resources and skills to gain advantage. The interplay of each dimension on another makes each game different and gives the opportunity to test your skills, as you develop your power and learn in all 5 dimensions.<br/><br/>Moral Conflict 1941 the version for highly sophisticated and skilled strategy game players<br/><br/>Are you ready for war in all five dimensions?<br/><br/>A relentless pursue of limitless possibilities: the intellectual challenge to grow in military skill, negotiation, teamwork and master the 5 dimensional interaction with other players.<br/><br/>This game pushes players to the limit of their game playing abilities; turning them into real generals, diplomats, economic and technological leaders who are able to distinguish between good and evil. Moral Conflict 1941 delivers a detailed and highly realistic global warfare experience that makes the players want to come back to play again and again.<br/><br/>If Moral Conflict 1941 was a car this would be the high power Ferrari sports car.<br/><br/>",

Airpower and naval gunfire are handled abstractly.<br/><br/>There are three scenarios: historical, free setup using historical units, and variable historical occurrences. Short rules and a low unit count make the game move quickly, but it can last up to 25 turns.  The rules include optional rules and several scenarios (including a couple of &quot;What Ifs&quot;), and an historical commentary.<br/><br/>The Allies have more units and the ability to make sea invasions, but they also have the burden of attack. The Axis need to make wise use of the difficult terrain to delay the Allied advance.  Points are awarded to players based on objectives either captured or held... the player amassing the highest number of points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a tafl game. See Hnefatafl.<br/><br/>[from the box]<br/>Free the King before invading forces block your get-away!  Handy portable case!<br/><br/>The Blue Challenge &mdash; maneuver the King to safety past Ivory's forces.  The Ivory Mission &mdash; foil blue's plans by surrounding the King on four sides, preventing his escape.  It's anyone's game until the last move!<br/><br/>One of the simplest, yet most challenging games ever developed, BREAK AWAY is also one of the oldest.  The game was already being played in Scandinavia well before 400 A.D. where it was called tafl (pronounced &quot;tab-l&quot;), from the Latin word tabula, meaning &quot;board game.&quot;  As new games were introduced, the name was modified to hnefatafl to distinguish it from other board games.  The Norsemen carried the game to Iceland, Britain and Ireland &mdash; from whence it spread to Wales.  In Britain it was the only game played by the Saxons until the Norman conquest.  By the twelfth century, however, the game had been largely eclipsed by chess, although evidence shows it enjoyed a following in Wales well into the sixteenth century.  The Lapps of northern Sweden named it tablut and played it into the eighteenth century.  In their version, the king and his defenders were Swedes, while the invaders were the oppressive Muscovites.  It is from this incarnation that BREAK AWAY has been developed as a modern game of classic strategic objectives.<br/><br/>This game was published as part of &quot;the Hi-Q collection&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The flip side of the tiles from the game Down Under (if you own Down Under, you own Sturt's Stony Desert). This is a simple connection game for 2 players only (though the rules say 2 to 4).<br/><br/>Try to connect your two sides of the board using the tiles with various curved paths on them.<br/><br/>The game has two phases. In the first phase, players take turns laying tiles with just two curves on them. These are either Y shaped forks, or two bends around opposite corners. If you let your opponent complete their path in this phase, you're doing very badly.<br/><br/>In the second phase, players start over-laying the 2 curve tiles with 3 curve tiles. This makes it much easier to complete a path. When one player does so, the other still has a chance to lay a 3 curve to disrupt the path. But 3 curves only go onto 2 curves. So by clever placement, you can force yourself into a path with two solutions, so your opponent cannot block both at once.<br/><br/>It's a remarkably simple design, but seems wide open with possible techniques. Tiles can always be placed in any orientation. The clever part is that a valid path cannot follow an oblique turn. You go round bends like a train on tracks. So by placing a fork in the correct way, I can improve my path but block yours. But when you get to lay 3 curves, you can undo the damage.<br/><br/>NOTE: There are no Versions listed under this Game entry, as this is played with the components of Down Under.

        "description": "What&rsquo;s the funniest thing about elephants? Their poop! Especially if it is on the loose side. But not everyone is into classic humor. Besides, we&rsquo;d then be talking about<br/>Elephant Runs, which we clearly are not. So, what&rsquo;s the second funniest thing about elephants? The way they squash anyone who doesn&rsquo;t get out of the way fast enough! This, too, is classic humor, but will not be offensive to the scatologically challenged. So, let&rsquo;s enjoy a few minutes of elephants squashing people!<br/><br/>In Elephant Run, one player is an elephant that&rsquo;s big, strong, and equipped with a good memory and a huge appetite. The other player controls a group of six rice patty<br/>farmers in India trying to eke out enough sustenance to support their huge households. Things are tough enough for the farmers until one day the elephant decides to use the<br/>shared rice patty as the lunch buffet. While local statutes prevent the farmers from hurting the elephantine freeloader, it is perfectly legal for the farmers to starve to death should they not find some nonviolent way to save their crop. So, they run into the patty and try to herd the elephant  but. Assuming they can avoid getting stepped on, will they<br/>be able to save enough of their rice patty for the upcoming harvest?<br/><br/>Play:<br/><br/>     The tiles are laid out face-down in a 4x6 grid. You may want to leave a little space between each tile, as you will be removing tiles throughout the game. <br/>     The elephant player takes a pawn and places it on any tile they wish.<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Next, the farmer player takes six coins and places them face-down anywhere on<br/>the board, one coin per tile.<br/><br/>Sort of a fox and geese game with a twist. when the elephant moves off a square it is because he has eaten all the rice and the square is removed from the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dragon's Hoard is a competitive dungeon crawling game for one to four players.  The catch is that the adventurers must exit the dungeon before time runs out, lest they be engulfed in darkness and perish.  The game is designed to use a standard piecepack and as many colors of Icehouse pieces as you have (at least four colors, though).  You should also have two opaque bags or cups out of which you will draw random Icehouse pieces.<br/><br/>The piecepack tiles are set up to represent the area that the dungeon will occupy, and players explore that area, using Icehouse pieces to represent the dungeon's rooms, passages, treasures, and creatures as they are discovered.  The game's pace is set by a pre-determined, fixed number of turns; however, escaping the dungeon in time may be complicated by what you find along the way....<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The following description is mainly copied from the Wikipedia description for the game.<br/><br/>Khanhoo is a non-partnership &quot;draw-and-discard&quot; card game which was adapted to Western taste by British diplomat William Henry Wilkinson and published by the London card maker Charles Goodall in 1891. The Chinese game from which Wilkinson got his inspiration was called Kanhu and seems to have been widespread in China in the second half of the nineteenth century.<br/>As it is a card game of the Rummy family, the object of the game is to get rid of all cards by melding them. The first player to do so is granted 5 points and the first to reach 50 wins the match, which can be achieved in two, three or four rounds of games.<br/>t was first brought to England prior to 1895 by Sir William Henry Wilkinson (1858-1930), a British Sinologist who served as British consul in China and Korea and who wrote many articles and books on Chinese games such as A Manual of Chinese Chess (1893), Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards (1895), The Game of Khanhoo (1895) and Bridge Maxims (1918).<br/>In 1891 Wilkinson induced the card maker Charles Goodall to issue a special pack of cards with accompanying booklet of rules to play Khanhoo. The deck contained two sets each of Ace through Nine of Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds, with two specially-designed Jacks, Queens and Kings standing in for the &quot;extra cards&quot;.<br/><br/>This entry is for the game promoted by Wilkinson and should be distinguished from the earlier Kanhu or Kwa Oh played with money-suited playing cards. The game should also be distinguished from allied games like Cuajo, which use Spanish-suited playing cards.<br/><br/>",

The scenario supports 1-4 players!<br/><br/>In the solo version, the player takes control of Rick, with another Survivor of his or her choice being controlled as an Ally. With 2 players, the second player takes the place of the Ally, playing as the Survivor of his or her choice to aid Rick.<br/><br/>Rick does not start with his normal 15-card Survivor deck. Instead, he uses the 10-card Wounded Rick deck.<br/><br/>The controlling player must use these cards efficiently to ensure Rick survives long enough to make the trip from the hospital to the nearby Sheriff&rsquo;s Department. Once there, Rick will be able to recuperate and arm himself, at which point the player controlling Rick will switch out the Wounded deck for Rick&rsquo;s normal Survivor deck.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, his fellow Survivor starts the Scenario on the other side of the map&mdash;with a handful of Walkers in the way!&mdash;meaning it&rsquo;ll be hard for this Survivor to offer Rick much support at first. If this Survivor moves quickly, he or she can provide Rick with some valuable cover as he makes his way towards his gear.<br/><br/>Getting Rick fully armed is quite an achievement, but it won&rsquo;t be enough to get him completely acclimated to the frightening new world around him. The Survivors will need to spend some time raising their Morale, which, unlike most Scenarios, starts completely depleted in &ldquo;Days Gone Bye.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Getting equipped gives the Survivor&rsquo;s a hefty Morale boost to start with, but they will still need to build their confidence by successfully evading Walkers and scavenging for Resources. If the Survivor&rsquo;s manage to get their spirits up, Rick will be ready to head out on his own, earning a victory for the Survivor team.<br/><br/>Includes Hospital Gown Rick Figure, his 10-card &ldquo;Wounded&rdquo; Survivor Deck, 4 double-sided Map Tiles, 10 Event Cards, and a thrilling Scenario that takes you back to the very first episode of the TV series.<br/><br/>",

It plays in about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>On their turn, players can play a card for its action, letting them interact with other players to gain other rumor cards, gamble by drawing cards and checking their gambling value to see if you win or lose, start a game such as darts or arm wrestling, or play a legendary adventurer card.<br/><br/>A legendary adventurer card may help free the player from Shadow Riders or let them draw cards, get money, or help them win playing darts at arm wrestling.<br/><br/>The games of darts, arm wrestling, and the drinking game are resolved by drawing and comparing cards to determine the winner.

        "description": "The chemical elements make up all the things around us (including us!) &ndash; they are the building blocks of nature. Now you can use the elements like never before &ndash; and Battle, Steal, Block and Heal your way to victory with Elementals Unleashed! The game that brings the Periodic Table to life!<br/><br/>Featuring 32 chemical elements of the Periodic Table, each turned into unique characters (Elementals) with their designs and skills based on their chemical and physical properties, and history. These properties also determine whether an Elemental is classed as Battle: duel another player&rsquo;s Battle cards; Steal: Attempt to steal from another players hidden hand or Chemical Battlefield; Block: Try to stop the steal!; Heal: replenish your hand with cards from the deck.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Each player starts with 4 cards from a shuffled deck, which are hidden from the other players.<br/><br/>The first player draws a card, and depending on what Elementals they have, can either battle, steal, or heal. The success of this depends on the level of the card, and the skill of the Elemental. After a player has used a card, it moves to the Chemical Battlefield in front of the player, becoming visible to all players. However, the cards in the Chemical Battlefield still count towards the players total score.<br/><br/>Battle Elementals are the warriors of the game and are used to duel with other players. When the active player uses a Battle Elemental card their chosen opponent must also produce a Battle Elemental card. Battle Elementals are revealed at the same time and the card with the highest level wins, unless the other Elemental&rsquo;s special skill gives it an advantage. The winner receives their opponent&rsquo;s Battle Elemental into their hidden hand, then places their used card into the Chemical Battlefield. When an opponent doesn&rsquo;t have a battle a card, the active player may take a random card from the opponent&rsquo;s hidden hand.<br/>Steal Elementals are the thieves of the game and are used to steal other players&rsquo; cards. Cards can either be stolen from both the hidden hand &ndash; a random selection - or the Chemical Battlefield - where players can choose the card they want. The Steal Elemental will be successful unless their opponent has a Block card.<br/><br/>Block Elementals are the police of the game and are used to prevent the theft of cards. When a player tries to steal from the hidden hand, Block Elementals will always stop any Steal Elemental.  However, a Block Elemental can only prevent stealing from the Chemical Battlefield when the Block level is higher than that of the Steal Elemental.  Block cards must be used when an opponent attempts to steal and are revealed at the same time as the steal card, then moved to the player&rsquo;s Chemical Battlefield.  In the case of Steal cards with Elemental skill 2x steal, two Block cards must be used. When a player has only Block cards in their hand, they may pick another card from the deck and immediately play it.<br/><br/>Heal Elementals provide the support of the game and allow a new card to be taken from the top of the deck, unless otherwise specified by the Elemental skill.<br/><br/>When a player is asked to battle, or is being stolen from, and they don&rsquo;t have an appropriate card to retaliate (Battle vs Battle, Block vs Steal), they may take the top card from the deck. If the player can use it, they must do so immediately, however, if not, the card is placed into their Chemical Battlefield.<br/><br/>When there is a draw (Battle vs Battle, Steal vs Block), both cards are moved to the relevant Chemical Battlefield, and the active player&rsquo;s go is then over.<br/><br/>Cards taken from another player (through stealing or battle) go into the hidden hand.<br/><br/>The game is over once the deck has been depleted, but the last player to draw a card may still play a card from their hand. The players must then count their total points in both their hidden hand and Chemical Battlefield, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

These animals are lost! To help them find their way home, players must pretend to be their mummies. The first player starts by secretly choosing an animal from the table, and imitating the sounds they make, the way they move, or both. The other players have to work together to try and figure out what animal they are  pretending to be. If they get it right, the animal can go home. Another player chooses a different animal to imitate, and so on until all 4 animals have found their way home!<br/><br/>+++  A introduction to imitation games for little ones to play together.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On the way, your ship slams into a rock, not far from the sad sandy shores of Purgatory Island. You manage to escape the sinking vessel on a trusty inflatable flamingo and reach the shore, self-assured that you&rsquo;ve survived a shipwreck and shark-infested waters - only to be bludgeoned by a falling coconut.<br/><br/>What are the chances?! Well it turns out, there are an average of 150 deaths by coconut per year. You regain consciousness to the realisation the shipwreck has turned your heavenly cruise to Eternal Paradise into a hellish race across Purgatory Island.<br/><br/>From Coconut Beach, you&rsquo;ve gotta move by backing your betting ability in deciding which of the three options is most deadly. For example: Falling Coconuts, Lightning Strike or Extreme Selfies<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll be betting by using the only currency to hand: coconuts (ironically). You&rsquo;ve got a one-in-three chance of getting the answer correct. Which is roughly the same odds as being struck by lightning&hellip; if you play golf in a thunderstorm&hellip; dressed like a medieval jouster.<br/><br/>Bet small and move cautiously. Bet big and move quickly - but risk going backwards just as fast. Navigate shortcuts and lava flows - you know, the usual features of a deserted tropical island. Oh, and look out for buried treasure, it could be the difference between life and death.<br/><br/>Whichever tactic you choose, only the first to the finish gets into Eternal Paradise. It&rsquo;s a pretty exclusive guest list - so you better get a move on! Or you&rsquo;ll be wandering the wastes of purgatory for eternity... And that sounds like a fate worse than death!<br/><br/>So, grab yourself a few fellow shipwrecked shipmates and get going on the race to Eternal Paradise, where your knowledge of death just might save your life.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Vertellis: Relationship edition, couples ask each other questions over three rounds with the goal to stimulate conversation more than score points.  That being said, some of the questions do score you points for guessing your partner's answers, much like the game show &quot;The Newlywed Game.&quot;<br/><br/>Some example questions might be: &quot;What is one activity that you don't enjoy doing, but feel relieved once you have done it?&quot; or &quot;Who or What has had a positive influence on your partner recently?&quot;<br/><br/>From the publisher: &quot;Mindfulness, communication, and connection come together in a compact and pleasant design. Many games come in oversized boxes, but we&rsquo;ve made a point of providing you with an easily transportable, aesthetically pleasing game that will have a real impact on the table! The name &quot;Vertellis&quot; is derived from two Dutch words &quot;Vertel Eens&quot;. These two words, loosely translated, mean &quot;Tell Us More&quot; - which is what Vertellis revolves around! Not only by answering the questions in this deck, but also by engaging and ask each other to tell more. This will result in a deeper connection with with your partner!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can be played as a board game between 2 individuals (1 army each).  The rules are simple.  You can move as far around a ring, or in a straight line as you want without jumping over other pieces.  Eliminate your enemy pieces by catching them in a crossfire (phlanx) either left to right on a ring, or front to back on a rail.  You win when your enemy has 1 or 0 pieces left.  You cannot phlanx across the center, but you can move straight across it.<br/><br/>League Play<br/>The game is much more fun though if you can get more people together, and join boards (movement along rails allows you to continue your movement to an adjoining hive).  This city play also brings into play the Crystal Transporters (which sit at the center of hives the city designer selects).  Should your piece enter one of the transporters, it comes out the other (color coordinated) crystal in any of the 8 directions you choose.  In this version, up to 3 players play in teams (6 armies total, 3 on 3).  During its turn a team moves 1 piece from each of its 3 armies.  League play earns points posted on web page, as well as merits, badges and pins.<br/><br/>",

You and up to 4 other dealers travel around a Monopoly looking outer track buying drugs and picking up the ever present action card.  In this case it is a rock concert card.  You buy drugs (properties) and then you can enter the inner map which is a representation of New York neighborhoods in an attempt to sell them.<br/><br/>The more money you make selling drugs the more you can skim off some of the drugs to get high on.  Getting high gives you karma points but beware the bad trips.  If you gain 40 karma you win.<br/><br/>The game is actually very involved and not just a different version of Monopoly.  Believe it or not it comes from the same people who brought us Blue vs. Gray the civil war card game.<br/><br/>",

Probability of a hit depends on distance. Movement reduced for damaged ships. Movement is variable depending on wind direction and speed. Players decide whether to change wind on each turn, die rolls determine if a change will be allowed then the new direction and speed. Long game: first player to get a merchant ship to away port and back home wins. Short game, points are awarded depending on the order that merchant ships get to away port. Very simple rules with examples. Away port is across the board diagonally from the home port meaning the players' paths cross, making battle likely.<br/><br/>From the box: '&quot;Seeschlacht&quot; does not just mean Battle at Sea. Treacherous seas, unpredictable winds and valuable cargo to protect make this game a challenge to even the most experienced seafarers.'<br/><br/>For 2 players, Ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>",

The first four of those scores are public the last two are secret. <br/>Each player also fixes the minimum scores for each characteristic of his/her ideal partner. <br/>The board depicts a city, divided into hexes. Players wander on it, looking for their ideal mate: a character of the opposite sex whose 4 open scores fits their secret goals. In the meantime, their own scores change: in the Gym the physical appearance increases (if there are no accidents...) while in the Fast food it can suddenly drop down!<br/>When two characters suit each other with their 4 open characteristics, they can make a couplet. They then move together with a 4-sided die (instead that alone with a 6-sided one) until they reach a private house or a hotel. At this point they can show each other the two secret characteristics: if they don't fit they split apart. But if they fit, they win as soon as they reach the Cathedral or the City Hall.<br/>Each hex of the map and each playing card has a humorous comment about each game effect.<br/>To play, you do not need to have the same amount of male and female characters: you only need at least two males and two females. A rare quality of this game is that player can enter the game later or go away before the end with no problems.<br/><br/>",

Each card also has a positive or negative cult value in the top right hand corner and perhaps and edit, that can change the cult value under certain conditions, in the bottom right hand corner.<br/><br/>The game progresses in a series of rounds consisting of a 'creation' phase and a 'selling' phase.<br/><br/>During the creation phase players are dealt cards and build film titles, playing cards into their own films as well as those of other players. After playing any card they can wrap one of their own films to stop people playing cards into it, including themselves.<br/><br/>During the selling phase players take it in turns to roll for each of their wrapped films, trying to get under the cult value on a d6. If they succeed they get an amount of money dependent on the cult value and length of the film. The first player to a given amount of money, dependent on the number of players, is the winner.<br/><br/>Revenge of the B-Movie 2 can be played as a standalone game or can be combined with Revenge of the B-Movie to make even more ridiculous titles.<br/><br/>",

If you hit, the terrible tank turns on your opponent.  If you miss, it keeps coming and blasts your anti-tank gun into the air.  The exciting, two-player game of skill, strategy, and timing.&quot;<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>1. Install 2 AA batteries in the Terrible Tank.<br/>2. Remove the steel ball bearings from center bridge supports storage compartment.<br/>3. Assemble the two piece plastic bridge with the center support and an &quot;anti-tank gun&quot; emplacement at each end.<br/>4. Lock the gun emplacement's &quot;explosion&quot; spring loaded arms.<br/>5. Place the molded fake guns over the arms.<br/>6. Load each gun emplacement with 6 balls.<br/>7. Place the Terrible Tank on the center of the bridge with the turret facing perpendicular to the bridge.<br/>8. Unleash hell (eg: turn on the tank).<br/><br/>Play:<br/>After powered on, the Terrible Tank will start heading down one side of the bridge or the other.  Instead of a main gun, the Terrible Tank features a spinning pointed auger ... hence the Terribleness of the aforementioned Tank.<br/><br/>The player being advanced upon must use the plunger on his gun emplacement to fire steel balls at a target switch under the Terrible Tank.  When hit, the target switch will cause the Terrible Tank's turret to turn 180 degrees and reverse the motor to advance upon the opponent.<br/><br/>The target moves in and out of the Terrible Tank so a successful shot must be timed to hit the target when it is exposed.  A robotic &quot;driver&quot; also moves in and out of the top of Terrible Tank's turret.  Since the driver and target are synchronized, a successful shot will reach the Terrible Tank as the driver and target are fully exposed.<br/><br/>If the Terrible Tank advances all the way to a gun emplacement, it triggers a spring loaded &quot;explosion&quot; and your opponent gains a point.<br/><br/>Two counters on the center bridge support show the progress of the game.  The first person to reach six points win.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns adding quest cards (with difficulty values that correspond to player stats) to the notice board until a player is challenged. When a player is challenged, they see if their stats (and loot, if needed) can overcome the challenges of the quests.<br/><br/>A player can win in one of two ways: if they win three challenges and get three success tokens, or if the player is the last one standing when all other players fail three challenges. It's suggested to play to two wins/losses if in a group of five or more. Also check out the other play modes for faster or more devious play styles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Studies show that 38-percent of infants and toddlers use smartphones or tablets. And it doesn&rsquo;t stop there...children ages 8-10 are exposed to an astounding 8 hours of media each day. In an age where electronics are taking over society, Tall Tales brings back the classic magic of imagination in a new and exciting family game. This creative, non-competitive storytelling game is for people of all ages. Players draw random story elements from a bag and twist their best tale using each piece, just like the world used to do before the technology revolution. The only limit is your imagination!<br/><br/>Real 3-D game includes 50 detailed game pieces, 24 full color story cards and a story bag to store game pieces.<br/><br/>5 Ways to Play:<br/><br/>Basic Game: One player reaches into the story bag and draws 8 story pieces one at a time. Player then begins telling a TALL TALE using one of the pieces drawn until all the pieces are included in the story. The story can be as wacky or fun as your imagination will allow. When the story is over, all the pieces go back into the story bag, and the next player draws to start their TALL TALE.<br/>World Tales: Follow the BASIC GAME directions. After drawing 8 story pieces, draw one story place card and use that card as an environment for your TALL TALE. As you tell your story, place your story pieces on the story place card as used.<br/>Taller Tales: Choose a number 9 to 50. One player draws one piece to use in their story. Once that piece is used, that player draws another piece which must be the next piece they use in their story. The story continues until the number of pieces chosen to use is achieved. Story place cards may be added for even more variations.<br/>Group Tales: Each player draws two or more story pieces, making the total number of pieces among all players between 10 and 20 (or whatever amount you desire). The first player chooses one piece they&rsquo;ve drawn and begins the story. Once the first player uses their piece in the tale, they pass the story onto the second player who continues, using one of their pieces. The story passes from player to player until all players have used up all their pieces. Story place cards may be added for an added challenge.<br/>Marathon Tales: Like TALLER TALES, but the number chosen is always 50 pieces (the entire bag). Have one story teller, or make it like Group Tales where the story travels from player to player. Story place cards may be added for professional storytellers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gogol was conceived in a prison, where no paper or pencils were allowed. Designed to be playable under the most primitive circumstance, each move in Gogol sets off firecrackers of endless possibility!<br/>There are two players (White and Black), each having one king and eight pawns at their command.<br/>On a common chessboard, place eight white pawns on the first rank and eight black pawns on the eighth. Then, the White player may place his king anywhere on the board, except on the second rank. Black, in turn, places his king anywhere except on the seventh rank.  The game then starts, each player moving in turn.<br/>The pawns are free to move anywhere on the board, not being confined to moving along lines or diagonals! (You can think of this as &quot;teleportation&quot;.)  The king may move along any straight line or diagonal, like a chess Queen.  <br/>If a piece begins its turn adjacent to an enemy piece, then it can capture the enemy piece by jumping over it (straight or diagonally), and landing into an empty on the other side of (and adjacent to) the captured piece.<br/>The player who captures the enemy king, or reaches the last rank with his own king, wins the game.<br/>For more information, please go to <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/gogol.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.di.fc.ul.pt/~jpn/gv/gogol.htm</a><br/><br/>",

Standard cards feature a color and the name and picture of a creature from Ork while special cards feature characters from the show. Players are dealt 7 cards and eggs are placed on the table (there is one less egg than the number of players). The rest of the cards form a draw pile and the top card is flipped over onto a discard pile. On their turn, players discard a card which matches the upper card of the discard pile in either name or color. As they discard their card, players must call out the name of the card. If they fail to do so and are challenged by another player, players must draw cards. When a player is penalized, he must call out &quot;Shazbot&quot; and can be penalized again if he fails to do so. If someone plays a Mork Na-No Na-No card, each player must immediately grab a styrofoam egg while shouting &quot;Na-no Na-no!&quot; The player that is not able to grab an egg is penalized and must draw cards.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all his cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each deck includes 58 cards and a rulebook.<br/><br/><br/>The objective of the game is to score the least amount of points.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 4 cards, arranged on the table face-down on a 4x4 grid.<br/><br/>Players draw and discard cards, trying to achieve the lowest possible score based on card values. If a player discards a special card, its power is triggered.<br/><br/>The final round is triggered when a player believes they have 6 or less points on their cards, declaring &quot;Amnesia!&quot;. Each other player plays his last turn and the game ends.<br/><br/>The player who ended the game sum their cards points, and gets a bonus or penalty. The rest of the players sum its cards values for their score.<br/><br/>Several rounds are played, until one player reaches 80 points on &quot;classic&quot; mode, or 40 for a &quot;turbo&quot; game.<br/><br/>",

Only one cowboy is walking away from this dust up so once you've got'em on the wrong end of a shootin' iron, you better keep'em there. Let loose with everything you've got to win, or play your ace in the hole to turn the tables. Either way you best be the last one standing if you want to win this Do-Si Duel!<br/><br/>Do-Si Duel recreates the feel of an Old West shootout across the kitchen table. Two players will alternate playing cards to claim actions. These actions move players around the table: players will simultaneously move one seat to the left or the right (always staying on opposite sides), switch places, or simply hold still. The player standing at the &ldquo;Win&rdquo; half of the table when either player runs out of cards is the winner. Complicating this are the various action costs. Each of the four actions has two available slots. The first player to claim that action spends one matching card to use the action and can reuse that action once later at the same cost. The second player must spend two matching cards for that action and can only use it once. Of course, spending more cards isn&rsquo;t always a bad thing: once a player&rsquo;s in position, they&rsquo;ll want to get cards out of their hand quick to end the game! With hand management elements and a unique approach to real-space movement, Do-Si Duel packs a lot of wallop for players looking for a light strategy game.<br/><br/><br/>Do-Si-Duel is a 2-player action drafting 18-card game for all ages that can fit in your pocket and be played in 5 minutes!  What makes Do-Si-Duel unique?  In Do-Si-Duel, you are the game piece.  Each action will cause you and your opponent to move (or not move) around the table. The game is simple yet mentally menacing and lots of fun!<br/><br/>On each turn, players will play cards in the middle of the table on the available actions (left, right, hold, switch) and move accordingly around the table, trying to be on the Win side of the duel at the end of the game (when one of the players has no cards left in hand).<br/><br/>",

If the player is able to complete the food order, they turn in their ingredients and sell the food for money. Players can also use their hard-earned money to buy Special cards, which allow them to attack other players' vendor booths using food inspectors, thieves, and more.

        "description": "This game advertises itself as &quot;the first computer based Tank game in the world&quot;. It is a board game 'controlled' by an electronic handset which serves as a randomizer for combat actions. According to the instructions, the computer &quot;has counters, gates, oscillator clock, programming, read out and execute functions. The 'brain' is made of three miniature TTL logic chips containing over 300 transistors, diodes, and many other components giving a vast computing capacity with a wide range of probabilities for conflict purposes.&quot;<br/><br/>In essence, this is a straightforward  hex-map based battle game for up to four players playing individually or as teams. It contains plastic miniatures and a rectangular game board with pre-marked battlefield features. There are no battle cards or other modifiers apart from the handset. The game depends entirely upon the handset to determine the amount of movement and the result of any attack. The handset therefore replaces dice, but serves much the same function. However, players have the freedom to select position, and direction of movement, and the miniatures are marked with values that determine their firing power, and this has a bearing on the result of combat actions (see below).<br/><br/>Each team deploys a regiment of 8 of tanks (slow moving, high fire power) and 4 armoured cars (fast moving, low fire power) in a pre-mapped fictive country on the game board (Kazaldis, Armania, Sarapan and Calderon) separated by marked national borders (which are red) and terrain features such as a river (with bridges), forests, mountains, and buildings. Each country also has a major city marked by a blue border. Inside the blue border several buildings are marked, into which tanks cannot move, meaning they must navigate the city to get to the enemy HQ or get out of their service/repair area and back into combat.<br/><br/>The objective is simple: to win by occupying the opponent or opponents' headquarters by moving a tank (or armoured car) into the HQ space (pre-marked on the board), or by destroying all enemy tanks.<br/><br/>Though the mechanic is therefore a fairly standard hex and counter skirmish, the computer in the handset ultimately drives the game.<br/><br/>The handset consists of six small red bulbs, two buttons and three switches. The lights appear over six icons indicating conditions of movement (the computer determines 'movement points' which may be spent according to terrain features - for example moving through a city costs one movement point per movement but armoured cars moving in open country may move two spaces per movement point), result of firing, repair status and range of attack.<br/><br/>The bulbs have three states - on, off, and flashing, each of which has a different meaning (see below). Of the three switches, one is a power switch. The other two switches determine the conditions of the 'roll' on any given player's turn. One indicates whether the player has opted to attack or retreat (the selection becomes a variable in the computer's calculation of the result), the other on whether the tank is moving or being repaired (tanks under repair cannot move or fire, but if the handset indicates that the service has been successful, the tank can move and fire in that turn).<br/><br/>The handset also has two buttons: one red, one black. The black button is pressed for between 2 and 5 seconds to command the computer to run a computation cycle that will determine movement and repair status (depending on the switches). It will also secretly determine a firing result that will be shown if and when the player presses the 'fire' button (firing is optional).<br/><br/>The red button is for firing. When a player wishes to fire, they press this button and the computer indicates the result of the firing action. If the bulb is fully lit, the result is a hit and the tank with the lower fire power is destroyed. In the case of equal firepower, the attacking tank is considered to have the advantage and destroys the defender. If the bulb flashes, the tank with the lower fire power is damaged and must be placed on a service space for repair. If the bulb stays dark, the attack has failed. According to the instructions &quot;When the computer is programmed for Assault the 'firing result' probability is expressed as a 50% chance of a Hit, 25% chance of Damage and 25% chance of a Miss, while the chance of a 'Service Ready' is 25%. When the computer is programmed for Retreat the 'firing result' probability is expressed as a 25% chance of a Hit, 25% chance of Damage and 50% chance of a Miss, while the chance of 'service ready' is 25%.&quot;<br/><br/>Firing is further complicated by the game board and player actions though. A tank in open country can only fire at an enemy tank in a directly adjacent hex in front of or behind it, and it must turn to face in the direction it wishes to fire. Within city boundaries a tank may fire at an enemy in any hex in contact with the one it occupies, though it must again turn to face the target. Ranged firing (two spaces) is possible in open country, but is again a random result from the handset. A tank which is allowed a ranged attack by the handset may fire across lakes and rivers, but not mountains.<br/><br/>",

The die comes with a &quot;playing field&quot; sheet randomly filled with the smileys of the die. On the back of this sheet you can find the rules of two games that can be played with the die. On the website of 999 Games you can find rules for two other games as well. Here follows a short description of the available games with the die:<br/><br/>Gezichtje Zoeken (Find the Smiley)<br/><br/>A player rolls the die. Now every player searches the thrown smiley on the playing field. The player that locates the smiley first gets a point. This game can be played until a certain amount of points is reached.<br/><br/>Bekken Trekken (Make Faces)<br/><br/>A player rolls the die hidden from the other players. He / she now has to make the face shown on the die. When another player guesses the correct face he / she earns one point and the performer earns two points. At the end of the game the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Dobbel 9 (Roll 9)<br/><br/>For this game you have to know that the &quot;playing field&quot; is devided in two halfs by a red dotted line and that the faces of the die occur many times on the playing field.<br/><br/>Both players use their own half of the &quot;playing field&quot; and throw the die in alternate turns. When a player throws the die, he / she has to mark the thrown smiley on the playing field. This way the players try to make a square of 3 * 3 marked smileys. The first player to reach this wins the game.<br/><br/>DOBBEL Bingo (DOBBEL Bingo)<br/><br/>DOBBEL Bingo works the same as Dobbel 9 but now you have to try to mark all smileys on your half of the playing field. (Only one smiley may be marked per throw.)<br/><br/>Official website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.999games.nl/dobbel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.999games.nl/dobbel</a><br/><br/>",

Complete the words by finding the missing vowels and you will move ahead on the Game Board.<br/><br/>Each player receives three Word Cards, and places them face up in front of them.  On your turn, draw a Vowel Tile and check whether it can be added to any of your own Word Cards.  If not, check whether it can be added to another player's Word Cards.  If it can, and it has no prior vowels added to it, you may exchange one of your empty cards for theirs and play your Vowels Tile.<br/><br/>If a player completes a word, they move ahead on the Game Board as many spaces as the length of that word (3 letter words move 3 spaces, etc).  The player must spell the word aloud for everyone to hear as they move their pawn on the board, then discard their used Word Cards and Vowel Tiles, and draw a new card.<br/><br/>The first time any player crosses either of the wooden bridges, recycle all the used Vowel Tiles from the Discard Tray back into the draw area, and rearrange them.

People begin to panic and run when in the distance we see an enormous reptilian monster crushing buildings and roaring in fury as it heads closer.

Convert human buildings to add to your new colony!<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Monster - crush all buildings, consume all the little tasty meats running about the city, set fire to everything else!<br/><br/><br/>Every game is randomly set up and chance allows varying factions to have advantages over others in various situations.

The adult version is meant for people who like their humor the way Scrooge likes his coffee, dark and bitter.<br/><br/>How to play the game:<br/><br/>The basic way to play is a judge reads a prompt card and each other player plays a response card. The judge picks a winner, and the winner moves forward on the board and earns special ability cards that can either help you or harm other players. The game ends when a player reaches the end goal spot.<br/><br/>It has a variety of game modes and optional rules players can choose to play it with; this paired with tons of expansion packs makes for endless possibilities. Players can even create their own content which can get printed and added to their game or shared online.

You can play the classic game, or try a version with &quot;blanks&quot; and &quot;blockers.&quot; You can even design your own custom game with the nine mini-boards.  Some of the boards have themes like &quot;outer space&quot; or &quot;in the clouds.&quot;<br/><br/>Other than the classic game, here are the variations you can try with Scrabble Switch-Up<br/><br/>Blanks and Blockers: If you play a letter that covers a blank or block square you take the appropriate tile. A blank acts as a normal wild card with the added bonus that it doesn't count as one of your seven. A blocker is a tile you can play immediately to prevent someone else from using a specific square.<br/><br/>Bustin' Out:  Make words that lead you outside the walled in junkyard. This variation also uses cards - land on a guard dog and draw a card that you can use to mess up another player.<br/><br/>Hyper-Race: A two player game with the object of making words crossword style that lead from the space station at the top to the earth below. Land on a comet and get a free blank tile. Land on a flying saucer and draw a card similar to the guard dogs above.<br/><br/>Free for All: Uses a smaller 9X9 grid with the expanded rule that words can now be made diagonally with a limit of three words made per turn.<br/><br/>Surprise: Allows you to completely change the traditional Scrabble board by mixing up where the premium spots are located plus adds new ones such as wild and quadruple score. You have nine double sided squares that you use to make up the entire board.<br/><br/>",

Players take the roles of outlaws, sheriffs, marshals, or gunfighters; round up gangs or posses and then either rob the stage/train/bank/whatever, or chase those that do, or challenge each other to gunfights, based on their profession and location on the board. Gunfights are abstract and are handled by a single roll of the die on a CRT. Outlaws win by stashing away loot, lawmen win by stashing away outlaws, and gunfighters win by reaching a high enough reputation level.<br/><br/>",

Except this storm ain&rsquo;t one of wind and rain, but bullets and blood.<br/><br/>King of the West is a weird west themed area control card game. Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.<br/><br/>For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.<br/><br/>Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and outthink them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.<br/><br/>With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone elses. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>King of the West' card game set 2: The Mavericks, including The Marshall, The Bartender, The Wolf, and their locations.<br/><br/>",

The player who got to 10 (or closest to it) wins.<br/><br/>4) Quick at Calculating - Addition/subtraction math problem cards are used (the result will be a number 1 to 10). The player calculates the answer and then plays the card from their hand. If they are right, they keep the card, otherwise the card is discarded.

Categories include Clowns, Magicians, Bears, and so on.<br/><br/>The &quot;difficulty&quot; of the game is in deciding when to stop picking cards from a category and begin a new one. In fact, if you cannot stop a category, go for another one and then come back to the first.<br/><br/>As an example: the first card is a bear, then a clown is revealed. By taking the clown, it will not be possible to take bear-cards anymore (the category is closed). So that's why a player is free to leave a card instead of taking it, which makes his turn end.<br/><br/>When there are no cards left on the table, or none that anyone can take, the game ends and the biggest collection wins.<br/><br/>",

To land requires that you line-up on the proper end of the runway and be able to touch down at the correct spot by careful card play. There is a trading phase where players can freely trade the Course cards which are used to move the aircraft. In the end game phase, once aircraft are in the controlled airspace around the airport, the players also have the option to steal a card from another player.

Since, other than in chess, the armies are not predefined, there is a setup phase before the game where players place their figures on the board. Then the game is played like chess, with players alternately moving figures according to their possible movements.

Your paltry years in the housing queue don't count for much in the absurd rental market of this city, so you have to navigate the second-hand market and jump from one shaky solution to the next. Work hard in order to afford the exorbitant sublet-rents, study hard in order to be eligible for subsidized student housing, or play hard in order to discover sweet opportunities in your network.<br/><br/>Stockholm is an angst-packed game about living someplace. The game covers six years. Each year you secretly divide your action points between work, study and social activities. Players who work more get more income, players who study more get study grants and student accommodation, and players who engage more in social activities get to pick first from the offers on the informal housing market.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to maximize any two out of three scores: Urbanity (the supply of services in your area), Living Standard (the indoor size and quality of your housing solution, incl. the absence of annoying people) and Sea&amp;Forest (the scenery, swimming and skating opportunities, ability to pick blueberries and mushrooms).<br/><br/>And if you find a flat with more room than you can afford to rent on your own, then you can snuggle up with other players. There's no place like inside when in Stockholm.<br/><br/>",

Players take on these characters on a mission to collect specific items/energies they need and go to the designated place in order to return to the time period from which they came. Alternatively, they can encounter other characters and choose to remain in Ki-pataw instead. The choice is for you, the players, to make.<br/><br/>In The Tales of Ki-pataw, each player plays as one of six characters: capybara, modern girl, man from the future, witch, Japanese soldier, and tribal youth. Each character has their own missions to find the way home. During a player's turn, players perform the following actions in order: movement, encounter, visit, and preparation:<br/><br/>1. Movement phase:<br/>During this phase, you can play any number of cards from your hand and move your character meeple accordingly.<br/><br/>2. Encounter phase:<br/>During the Movement phase, if your character passes other characters, you must choose from one of the three following actions for the final player-controlled character encountered:<br/>○Take an encounter token from said character and place it on an empty spot in the encounter area of your character board;<br/>○Place one of your character&rsquo;s encounter token on an empty spot in the encounter area of said character&rsquo;s character board;<br/>○Exchange one encounter token with the other player controlling said character and place the exchanged token on an empty spot in the encounter area of your character board (and vice versa)<br/><br/>3. Visit phase:<br/>During this phase, you can perform the unique attraction action where your character meeple is currently located. For descriptions on each attraction action, refer to the corresponding section later in the rulebook.<br/><br/>4.Preparation phase:<br/>During this phase, you can choose to keep any number of cards in your hand and discard the remaining to the discard pile; draw from your character deck until you have three cards in your hand before ending your turn for the current round.<br/><br/>In this game, a player may win two ways: A solo victory in which the player fulfills the conditions to return their chosen character to their original timeline, or a shared victory in which two players win together by choosing to remain in Ki-pataw instead of returning home.<br/><br/>&quot;Ki-pataw&quot; is the name that the plains indigenous people who lived in the area used to call New Beitou.

In each category, you must find fitting words so that you can match a letter card in your hand. Whoever can get rid of all their letter cards first wins the game and the worthy title of successor!<br/><br/>Bookworm: The Card Game increases the challenge of the original Bücherwurm / Bookworm game because now speed is of the essence, challenging you not only to think along certain lines, but to think quickly. The game now includes bigger and more cards and more categories to provide more variety of play, and it includes a number of play variants.<br/><br/>There also is a kind of spin-off : Bookworm - The Dice Game (2019)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Any word game requires using your bean, but the way to win Jabuka is to use the most beans in a spontaneous, fast-paced race to be the most prolific wordsmith. And here's the innovative twist: the coffee bean-shaped pieces with yellow characters can be turned to form different letters, changing j's into r's, m's into e's, and many more morphing moves. The totally twistable Jabuka alphabet even includes double letter combinations that change with their orientation. Use these alphabet chameleons to form new words or to hijack and transform existing words made by another player or team. The team that uses the most beans&mdash;straight up or strategically askew&mdash;wins the game (with a shout of &quot;Jabuka&quot; of course!).

In the first, players form their crews and form 617 squadron. the second section uses die rolls to make sure that all crews are fit ton fly. the third part of the game is the simulation of the raid itself, with the allied players taking off from Britain at various intervals, and flying to and attacking the dams.

        "description": "Inchon depicts the Korean War's most famous battle, the U.S. and South Korean amphibious landings that led to the liberation of Seoul and, coupled with the defeat of the last North Korean assault on the Pusan Perimeter, turned the tide of the war (until, that is, Communist China intervened in force). The map scale is 1.7 kilometers per hex. The game lasts 12 turns that evidently equate to days. Units are companies and armored platoons for the U.S./ROK, mostly battalions for North Korea (whose army the rulebook consistently calls by its Korean name, &quot;In Min Gun&quot; or &quot;IMG&quot;). Higher level headquarters units implement the game's (rather restrictive and cumbersome) command rules.<br/><br/>The components are typical of Simulations Canada: a plain but functional two-color map, simple counters and a small, tightly printed rulebook. U.S. Marine and Army counters are shades of green, South Korean shades of red, North Korean a uniform brown. Counters are one-sided, with the back giving setup or arrival information for the historical scenarios.<br/><br/>The U.S./ROK side earns victory points by seizing objectives in and around Seoul, the enemy by inflicting casualties. As alternatives to the historical setup and reinforcement schedules, the U.S./ROK may use a free setup, or the IMG may receive more rapid reinforcements.<br/><br/>Game turns are divided into &quot;impulses&quot;, a concept borrowed from White Death, a Frank Chadwick design. In each of its impulses, a side may use all or some of its 9 &quot;movement points&quot; (but always at least one). The impulses alternate until all movement points are exhausted or neither player wants to do anything further that turn. The system is attractive in principle but may bog down in practice. It also requires record keeping, as air, naval and artillery units may bombard only once per turn rather than once per impulse.<br/><br/>Although all units have the same 9 movement points, how far they in fact can go differs by type - tracked vehicle, foot, support (wheeled vehicle) or &quot;irregular&quot; - and by morale class. If, for instance, a player divides his turn into three impulses, an &quot;A&quot; class armored platoon can potentially move 45 hexes along a road, while &quot;C&quot; class infantry company could advance 9 at most. Higher class units are also less likely to break in combat and can operate effectively at a greater distance from their HQ's. Out-of-supply units are slowed down. Those suppressed by bombardment may not move at all.<br/><br/>According to the designer's notes, &quot;In the historic scenario most play-tests ended with the UN player getting most of his objectives, though about half the time he was not able to secure the Seoul capital hex in time. As a result the game usually turned on how high a casualty level was sustained to get these objectives. . . . In the various Free UN landing and Rapid IMG reinforcement scenarios playtests indicated just about anything could happen.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game uses groups of individual figures, with an open scale for time and movement, and can be used for small or large battles. The game is designed for quick play and the system is flexible and adaptable to suit the level of enjoyment for the gamer(s).<br/><br/>A player can choose to be one of the Defenders of Mankind, standing against the Children of the Darkness, or they can choose to lead the Children of the Darkness against Mankind in a battle for domination of their enemies and the survival of their own kind. You may choose to be the leader of a party of Vampire Hunters, Wolfen-Jaeger (hunters of the Werewolf), or holy warriors of Blessed Mother Church. These defenders of mankind seek their enemies in battle to cleanse the world of great evil and protect the defenseless and the innocent.<br/><br/>You may choose to oppose Mankind as a Master leading his dreaded Nosferatu (a race of natural vampires) or Vampire Lord (the classic vampire), leading his servants and slaves against mankind&rsquo;s defenders, or a Loup Garou, leading his pack of Werewolves and wolves, serving the cycles of the moon and his bestial calling.  Even the Mad Doctor, Frankenstein and his evil assistant Ygor are here, with his horrible creations, bringing terror to the night. You can attempt to raise the Mob, the local townspeople and farmers against the terror. Or seek out the Gypsies, who possess ancient secrets and special potions and talismans to aid you in your battles against the Children of the Darkness.<br/><br/>There are several different parties of Vampire Hunters, Werewolf Hunters, and servants of the Church to choose from, as well as Nosferatu, Vampires, and Werewolves, the Mad Doktor, and even the Gypsies available to the player. The time is the early 1900&rsquo;s; the place is the Balkans, or one of the many other dark places in Europe, the British Isles, or even the U.S.A. So choose, defend mankind or attempt to conquer it. The only objective is survival of your race, whether human, Vampire, or Werewolf.<br/><br/>",

This is the time when Muhammad Ghori unravels his plans to take over India. India was ruled by Prithviraj Chauhan from Delhi and Raja Jaichand from Kannauj in the current state of Uttar Pradesh. To the west, Gujarat was under the rule of Raja Bhimdev II. While history notes the success story of how Muhammad Ghori defeats these kings, Samrat gives the players another chance to rewrite history.<br/><br/>Each player takes on the role of a king from medieval India and completes his objectives to earn stars. Some of these are based on true Indian history! Players build camps in their kingdoms to produce three types of resources - Gold, Stone and Wood. Use resources to raise an army and complete the identified objectives. The first player to earn five stars (2 players) or seven stars (3 or 4 players) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Then it's time for the next round. Players do not move or re-shuffle their tiles in-between rounds. Take turns rolling the dice to begin each round. If you roll a goal that has already been taken, re-roll the symbol die until it shows a goal that's still on the board.<br/><br/>The first player to get 4 goal tiles wins the game. If there is a tie of 3 each, an extra round is played. The goal tiles are reset and the dice are rolled. The winner of this 7th round wins the game.<br/><br/>",

On a randomly constructed board, players listen to directions from the narrator on an MP3 as they try to deliver bundles to various locations. The locations are determined by Address Cards each player gets, and the routes are different based on the layout of the tiles that make up the town. Because the length of the game is determined by the MP3's that work with the game, it takes... five minutes to play. (The title seems obvious now, doesn&rsquo;t it?) The game is played in real time (meaning everybody plays at the same time with no turns). A variety of MP3&rsquo;s give players different directions and (along with the random town layout) different play experiences every time.<br/><br/>",

But if you choose Drupal as your framework, you can work together with many others to make the job easier for everyone.<br/><br/>&quot;In this quick card game 2-4 players compete to earn the most reputation by developing new Drupal modules and building complex websites!&quot; [source: rule book]<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This card game adopts the theme of building a rich and dynamic website (i.e Web 2.0) using Drupal, open source and free software used for building content management sites (e.g. WhiteHouse.gov, PopularScience.com).<br/><br/>In the real world, software developers create and contribute to &quot;modules&quot; that website builders can add to their core Drupal site, extending its features and functionality.<br/><br/>Players start by playing cards representing modules (i.e. simultaneous action selection) and then build up their own contributions to those modules (i.e. turn-based play, auction/bidding) with points on colored cards representing each player. These are referred to as &quot;patch cards,&quot; since developers fix a module by patching its code.<br/><br/>Players must contribute enough patch cards to make a module available to any player (i.e. cooperative play) to eventually build a website. They can also &quot;own&quot; that module by being its biggest contributor.<br/><br/>Finally, players try to build websites for victory points depending on whether a module is available and its color (e.g. pink, blue or brown). Victory points are also available for individuals who contribute the most to a module's development. The winner has the most victory points. Play lasts 5-10 minutes.<br/><br/>The design of the cards is unique in that modules and websites are combined on the same card, on either side, and the websites have the URL for well-known sites using Drupal.<br/><br/>The order of play is as follows:<br/><br/>1. Take 7 patch cards<br/>2. Take 6 site/module cards<br/>3. Play 3 modules<br/>4. Play patches on modules<br/>5. Audit modules<br/>6. Sites check<br/>7. Module check<br/>8.

        "description": "Create your agent, infiltrate the island, defeat Necreaux's minions, find the scientists, and escape before time runs out!<br/><br/>The Island of Doctor Necreaux is a cooperative adventure game for 1 to 4 exceptionally talented secret agents set in a 50s-era pulp-sci-fi world. The diabolical Doctor Necreaux has captured the world's top scientists and forced them to build a Doomsday Device. Your mission: Explore the Doctor's secret island lair, find the scientists, and escape in your shuttlecraft before the island is blown to Kingdom Come!<br/><br/>In this simultaneous action game, players take one turn together as a team. At the start of each turn, you decide whether you're exploring or resting. When you explore you declare a speed, which represents how quickly you're exploring the island adventure deck and determines how many encounters your team will attempt to resolve this turn. You want to draw as many cards as you can because the scientists are hidden somewhere in the middle of the adventure deck, the escape shuttle is hidden in the bottom, and you have a limited number of turns before the island blows up. However, you can't be too fast or you'll fall prey to one of the island's many traps. If you choose to rest, your team gets to heal up and recharge.<br/><br/>The Island of Doctor Necreaux incorporates creative ability manipulation (in assessing how player powers interact and applying them appropriately), press-your-luck (when selecting a speed and during combat), and resource management (deciding when to use charges - a scarce resource that fuels agent powers - and when to use a turn to rest instead of explore). The game comes with quick start rules and multiple variants to increase replayabiliy and adjust thr difficulty to accommodate a wide range of player skill. The island and agent skills are all card-based, making the island and the agents different every time.<br/><br/>We at Invisible City are excited about the improvements in the second edition:<br/><br/><br/>     All-new full-color art.<br/>     Almost all cards have their own unique art.<br/>     Full-color art on card fronts and backs.<br/>     More &amp; better components. Bigger box (with room for expansions), better cards, bigger rules, enough dice for all players to play, etc.<br/>     Quick-start rules to make it easy for first time players to play.<br/>     All-new &quot;secret cache&quot; cards to adjust the game for different skill levels.<br/>     Clearer/better ways to increase the difficulty for experienced players.<br/>     All cards are numbered for easy set-up of pre-generated scenarios.<br/>     By popular BGG demand, the game's been re-tooled to use 2d6 as the primary resolution mechanic (instead of 1d6). The rules and every card have been re-written to accommodate this.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "A relaunch of a late 70s release, Bot is a game in which each of the two players command a &quot;serpent&quot; abstractly represented as a line of pawns occupying successive hexes in the gameboard. Players organize and play their hand of cards to direct their serpents' linear movement across the board. To each hexside corresponds a color; each card has a color and a number. Thus, a Yellow-3 card allows a player to move his serpent three hexes in the Yellow direction. Once a serpent successfully reaches (hits) the opposing serpent, it &quot;eats&quot; and removes two of the attacked serpent's pawns from the game. The same cannibalistic result is achieved if you successfully drive your serpent towards the enemy home base. Serpents may defend by biting their own tail, forming an impregnable ring, or by using the board's &quot;underground tunnel&quot; for a quick escape. First player to reduce the enemy serpent to nothingness is the winner. The name Bot is a homophone for &quot;bote&quot;, a Brazilian Portuguese noun meaning &quot;serpent strike&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Play evolves, turn by turn, with each player analyzing the current battlefield situation, adjusting their game plan accordingly and executing commands (movements of the playing pieces) in a collective effort to achieve the game's objective. Certain Air pieces (Bombers and Helicopters) can Go Over pieces; likewise certain Sea pieces (Submarines) can Go Under pieces. Additionally, certain pieces (Bombers and Tanks) can Block. The complete Original Release Basic Training Game Rules include &quot;Object of the Game&quot; options, &quot;Team Game Play&quot; options and &quot;Advanced Game Play&quot; options. &quot;Future&quot; options will include new movements, expansion pieces, additional damage control options, new attack features, mini wars and expanded terrains as variants to the Original Release Game Rules.<br/><br/>While this abstract strategy war game does not include random chance, it does allow for piece enhancements both during game play and during board set up which increases come from behind opportunities and can be used to level the playing field between players of various skill levels. The game can be played one-on-one or as a social game with teams. The military theme, the terrain feature of Air, Land and Sea areas of the board and the movements of the pieces themselves relative to the military vehicles they represent give the game a real world appeal.<br/><br/>The two Armed Forces consist of the following fifteen pieces per side: one Commander, two stealth Fighters, two army Tanks, one stealth Bomber, two submersible Submarine warships, two Helicopters, four amphibious assault vehicles (Amphibians) and one surface combatant Destroyer warship. This military themed board game, representing two Armed Forces, &quot;Supports Our Troops&quot; as the game of the &quot;Y&quot; by donating $1 to the Armed Services YMCA for every game sold.<br/><br/>Commander-In-Chief is a 3-In-1 board game that includes Chess &amp; Checkers; these Classics are played on the dark and light colored side of the double sided game board. Additional game play options include: Tic-Tac-Toe and The Triangle Puzzle Game. Lastly, the 30 pieces that come with the game are miniatures, 30 Military Toys, designed for play with or without this board game and the 30 bases that the miniatures mount on, when inverted, become 30 Stackable Spinning Tops designed for multiple family fun games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction in the rules:<br/><br/>&quot;It's Christmas Eve. The little town of Elfenbein is covered with snow. To help Santa find his way in the snow, the people of the town have dug out 'streets' and crooked 'paths' between their houses. Now they are all waiting patiently in their homes for Santa's presents, roasting chestnuts on an open fire to kill the time. All people, except some naughty kids. They have discovered a new game: Santa watching! Santa enjoys the game too as he is the only one who has discovered the crooked paths. And when everything else fails to escape the kids he can always use some magic...&quot;<br/><br/>Han Heidema gave out specially designed games as Christmas cards; one for every year from 1990 to 1999. This was card #9 and was sent out in 1998. It features artwork by Doris Matth&auml;us.<br/><br/>One player is Santa and the other 2-3 players are the naughty kids. Each player is given the cards of one suit from a normal deck of cards. A round consists of each player simultaneously choosing a card to play. Whoever plays the highest card selects the order of play for the round. Each player's card will also determine how far that player can move. Santa scores points for dropping off presents at houses without being seen. The naughty kids each score points for seeing Santa and collecting the presents he's delivering. The game lasts 13 rounds (the number of cards each player has).<br/><br/>Mik Svellov's website states &quot;Han Heidema was given credit as a gesture by Alan Moon.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WICKED WHIST is a board game which adds another dimension to the classic card game - Whist.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to graduate from one corner of the playing board to the eye at the center.  This is achieved by playing Whist and, after each hand, moving clockwise around the board - one square for each trick made.  The first player to reach the center (having made exactly the right number of tricks) is the winner.<br/><br/>There are two ways of achieving this:<br/><br/>1.  By completing full circuits of the board and by moving from one level to the next at selected points.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2.  By means of special squares which send you from outer to inner circuits (or vice versa) in a manner similar to Snakes and Ladders.<br/><br/>The layout of the board forces players to consider in advance how many tricks they require to win so as to land on an advantage square, or avoid a forfeit square.  At the same time they must also consider what they need to do to force their opponents into minimizing the tricks they win, or forcing tricks on them so that they land on a forfeit square.<br/><br/>",

Then you try to create words by using as many of them as possible within 5 minutes time. The points of the tiles &ndash; depending on the chosen difficulty from 1 to 3 &ndash; are written into your score-board. The score for the longest word is doubled. Then you draw 5 more tiles, combine them with your old tiles to new words and score them again. In a third round you again draw 5 tiles, create words as long as possible with your 20 tiles, score them and determine the winner by adding all points together. With these simple rules Gilbert Obermair (who left the jury of &ldquo;Spiel des Jahres&rdquo;) created one of the funniest word-games of the last time.<br/><br/>Originally published by Intelli in 1980.

Each player receives four markers, which are one color (red, yellow, blue or white) on top.  All markers are green on the bottom.  Players roll a single D6 and move any one of their markers the total count on their turn.  Markers can land on top of one another, and, in so doing, trap opponents' markers, or their own until the top one is voluntarily moved off the stack.  If a player's marker lands on the white spaces (in the water), that marker is turned into an island (green side up) and is stuck there, able to be used as a stepping stone for other players, for the duration of the game.  The marker(s) that reach ELDORADO are stacked in the order that they reach there.  Final score is highest for the top marker (last to arrive) and decreases for those lower in the stack.  The winner is decided by the player whose marker(s) score the highest total points in the final stack.<br/><br/>",

In the center of the table, 6 tiles show fish of different colors, with another colored fish on the reverse. There are 4 colors in total. When the die roll shows a blue fish, you must turn over a plate to reveal a blue fish. It is thus useful to remember the movements of the fish. But when your memory fails, your powers of deduction can take over.<br/><br/>Imagine that you must turn over a red fish and that the situation on the table is as follows:<br/><br/>Purple fish, Yellow fish, Yellow fish, Blue fish, Blue fish, Blue fish<br/><br/>You can deduce that a red fish is under purple fish. Indeed, the three blue fish are blue/red, blue/yellow and blue/purple. The two yellow fish are thus yellow/red and yellow/purple. The last fish is thus purple/red, the only missing combination.<br/><br/>This combination of reasoning and memory allows kids and adults to play each other. Whilst the adults can play the reasoning game, kids are generally much better at memory games!<br/><br/>",

You and your pretend date get asked seriously awkward questions and the other couples get to guess the outcome. Perfect for students, dinner parties and trips down the pub. The game is only loosely based on the TV show, so you can still enjoy the game without knowing too much about it.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Players split into couples &ndash; they are on a fictional date in a restaurant. Turn by turn, each couple gets asked different questions from the &lsquo;Starters&rsquo; deck.<br/><br/>Example: &ldquo;Who has the better fashion sense?&rdquo; The couples must decide on their answers without conferring. If they agree with each other and both write down the same name, they win 2 points. If they disagree and write different names, they win 0 points.<br/>Meanwhile, the other couples get to bet on whether the active team will agree or disagree. If they predict correctly, they gain 1 point. If incorrect, they get 0.<br/><br/>Once every couples has answered a &lsquo;Starter&rsquo; card, they move onto the even more awkward questions in the &lsquo;Main Course&rsquo; deck, before finishing on the painfully-awkward questions in the &lsquo;Dessert&rsquo; deck.<br/><br/>The winning couple is the one with the most points at the end of dinner.<br/><br/>",

During the search, visit as many chambers as possible. Remember, however, to bring a mirror with you - maybe you can hunt down a basilisk!<br/><br/>Basilisk is a fast game of perceptiveness and memory, where children must memorize the appearance of rooms and find their mirror image. In real time, players reveal the dungeon cards and decide if they want to visit the given chamber (and keep the card), or leave the uncovered card on the table.<br/><br/>After each card has been revealed, the round ends and players check their cards and score. Each chamber with its mirror counterpart is worth 5 points and each single chamber is worth 1 point. But there is a twist, if a player have more than 1 card with the same, non mirrored illustration, he/she has been petrified by the basilisk and loses all cards from this round!<br/><br/>The game lasts 2-3 rounds, depending on the number of players. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The evil king forbids everything that gives joy, health and happiness! Your task is to make the magical land be vibrant again. But you must hurry - the evil king raises funds to pay for the army, which is to punish the rebel residents. The fate of the kingdom is in your hands!<br/><br/>The game was created on the basis of a book by one of the most valued Polish writers for children - Grzegorz Kasdepke.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>There are 7 action fields on the board. In your turn, you can move to any field in a clockwise direction (Players themselves choose how many squares they will move their pawn. But the consequence of this quick free access to various actions is the increasing frequency of paying tribute to the king.) On the action field, a player can perform the appropriate action: draw resources, change them into &quot;goods&quot; (for example a pencil into a picture), sell &quot;goods&quot; to inhabitants of gray houses or exchange resources. After each action, active player asks others if they want to pay him 1 coin to do the same action in a limited way.<br/><br/>The game may end in two ways: When the number of gray houses is smaller than the number of players - then the player with the most coins is the winner; When the royal treasury is full, then everybody lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NOTE: Compared to the former Das Störrische Muli edition, this one is for 2&ndash;5 players instead of 3&ndash;5 and you have one more die and therefore more choices and some other movement.<br/><br/>The game is quite simple and definitely family fare. Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.<br/><br/>The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.<br/><br/>If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.<br/><br/>",

If a player is alone in a Sauce, he gets back his own played Fries card, as well as any Fries cards stuck in that Sauce during the previous rounds, or a Graillon, which also brings victory points.

        "description": "Muzicando is a card game about the rainbow colors and about musical instruments and notes. The deck consist of 56 cards 8 for each color of the rainbow. 7 cards have the musical notes from DO to TI and the eighth card is a representing a special personality like one of the followings:<br/>Guido d'Arezzo, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Franz Liszt, Ludwig van Beethoven, Frederic Francois Chopin, Johann Sebastian Bach and Niccolo Paganini.<br/>Guido d'Arezzo was a music theorist of the Medieval era. He is regarded as the inventor of modern musical notation (staff notation) that replaced neumatic notation and thus he is the most powerfull card in the game causing all the players to skip a turn when played giving an aditional turn to the one who played it. The other personalities are some of the best composers of clasical music and when played are causing some players to skip a turn,<br/><br/>The main goal in this game is to be the first to get rid of all the cards. The mechanism to get rid of them is to put them on the table in turns in some ways that depends of an auction made in the first phase of the game. The players can bid for on of the 4 ways to display the cards on the table. These are  Sarabanda, Glissando, Parada and Muzicando.<br/><br/>",

For movement, a dice is shaken and the points distributed at will throughout a player's armies. When 2 opposing armies occupy the same space a battle occurs. Players state the values of their armies (a player can attack an opponent with more than one army), but in doing so can bluff this value. The defender can admit defeat and pay one 'power point' for every attacking army, or not believe the opposing declaration and cards are revealed. The loser now pays 2 'power points' per army. The strength cards are burned and new cards drawn by each player. For every 3 'power points' a player hold, they can control an area of Europe (by claiming it with 1 of their 7 metal towers). If a player runs out of points, a tower must be cashed back in and so a region is lost.<br/><br/>",

The player who fills his or her dance floor first wins; if someone reaches the final tile without anyone filling their dance floor, the player with the most space filled wins.<br/><br/>Gelini Nightlife is reminiscent of Tutankhamen, except in utilizing a die roll for movement instead of allowing players to move as many spaces as desired.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gusher is the direct ancestor of Oil Power and King Oil and is similar in concept. The board is a hollow box with irregularly shaped wooden spacers between the top and bottom. The game board is shaken during the game setup to randomize the location of the wooden spacers (oil deposits). The playing surface is divided into 60 real estate parcels, each of which has from one to 10 drilling sites. Players bid to lease parcels, and once they acquire one or more leases, they may drill on their leased tracts at a cost of $10,000 per hole.  This cost of drilling is lost if the result is a dry hole, but there is a large payoff for successful wells (&quot;gushers&quot;). Players begin with a stake of $300,000. The game ends when a player accumulates $1 million.<br/><br/>Although the game is largely a contest of luck, there is some strategy. Successful wells tend to be clustered. Thus tracts that are contiguous to parcels on which there are successful wells are more highly valued. Furthermore, because gushers produce revenue for the owner with each turn, successful wells obtained early in the game are considerably more valuable than those obtained near the end.<br/><br/>Play proceeds in turns, and each player upon his turn may designate one or two unleased tracts for bidding or he may choose to drill if he has previously acquired one or more leases and has undrilled sites.  Players may sell or trade leases and drilling sites, and they may form partnerships to acquire leases or share the cost of drilling.<br/><br/>In a typical game setup, approximately 15% to 20% of the drilling sites will be gushers. A game generally requires about 20 complete turns.<br/><br/>Early 1940's editions employ a 20.5&quot; x 20.5&quot; game board; these feature boxes with deep, dark colors and silvered print. Later editions employ a 15.25&quot; x 15.25&quot; game board and light colored boxes with black print.<br/><br/>Game Contents: game board, General Information and Rules, Gusher Game Money, metal drilling derrick, round cardboard markers for leased tracts, round cardboard markers for dry holes, and round wooden &quot;tanks&quot; to collect oil from successful wells.<br/><br/>",

Players pass the puck around the ice using their own cards trying to work for a player shot or a goalie shot.  Players will pass, shoot, and defend just like they do on the ice.<br/><br/>Each player has their own passing column on their individual player card. This makes for a fast action hockey game where you will get exciting possession after possession without referring to a chart.<br/><br/>Penalties, Face offs, Injuries, turnovers, special plays, and more are all included.<br/><br/>Lineup cards will keep track of your current lines and making line changes is so quick and easy you will barely realize you are making one.<br/><br/>A timing chart will help you keep track of when the period ends and the time remaining.  You will also get score sheets and team reference sheets.<br/><br/>DICE Hockey also features a full career mode.  Lace them up as a skater or a goalie and start working on becoming a legend on the ice.  You start out as a border line player and as you accomplish certain tasks in a game you can earn points.  Spend those points on card upgrades.  The better you perform the more points you earn.  You will get over 100 blank player cards in your game and more will be available for free whenever you need them.<br/><br/>DICE Hockey is available as both a print and play E-game or you can purchase the actual hard copy board game version.  The print and play game comes with the 2007-2008 season and you will get the 2008-2009 season as soon as it ends and I have it available.  If you want the printed copy, you get to select which of the two seasons you want to come with your game and you will get the other season emailed to you as a PDF.  Or for just a little more you can get the game with both seasons printed and mailed to you.<br/><br/>",

This ornament measures approximately 2 1/2&quot; wide by 3&quot; tall. The design is laser etched, from both sides, into cedar wood. Grab one for your treasure stash!<br/><br/>Rule<br/><br/>If this ornament is hanging on a tree in the room where you are playing Munchkin (any version) or Munchkin Quest, on the 24th or 25th of ANY month, Santa will bring presents. Every time a player goes up to 5th Level, that player draws a face-up Treasure. Yes, if you go down to 4th and then back up, you get another present. Only one ornament allowed per game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOtherNote that the Christmas Ornament comes in two versions: an older one where the Munchkin's eyes are nearly closed, and a newer one where they are wide open and bulging out. Also, the newer one appears to have addressed a problem with one of the feet breaking off.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>",

And so your quiet voyage turns into a mayhem as you need to find your things, put in your bag, sit in a good place at the train, and guarantee you can continue your conversation with your best friend: Yourself.<br/><br/>Each player assumes two secret roles and receives a hand of cards that can be objects for either of his roles or of other characters on the train. On each turn, a player has five actions points that can be used for:<br/>- Put an item in a bag (Not necessary his own)<br/>- Exchange an item from a bag to another bag<br/>- Look at an hidden item in a bag<br/>- Exchange hands with other player<br/>- Buy clothes<br/>- Exchange characters place on the train<br/>When a bag has five items on it, it is automatically closed and that character can no longer be target of any action, except to change places with another character whose bag is also closed.<br/><br/>When the number of closed bags is equal to the number of players, the game ends and points are awarded to each player accordingly to theirs characters:<br/>- Sitting position in the train<br/>- If they are sitting near each other<br/>- Own items on bag<br/>- Cloth on bag<br/>- Pair of other character item on bag.<br/><br/>",

All other players write their response down and turn it in. The reader then selects his or her favorite response, and tries to guess who submitted that response. If the judge guesses correctly, the judge keeps the Whoya? card and earns the point for that round. If the judge guesses incorrectly, the player who submitted the judge's favorite response gets the Whoya? card and earns the point for that round.<br/><br/>Many of the prompts on the Whoya? cards are crowd-sourced from users who have submitted card ideas. On these cards, the first name, last initial, and location that person is from is displayed in the bottom right hand corner of the card.<br/><br/>",

Take a peek into the soul; the deep, dark, twisted heart of your opponent. The player that wins, will learn a secret, something never told to anyone! One player at the table has a secret, and it's about them. They've even written in down and placed it in a secret envelope on the table. Do you want to read it? WIN THE GAME. The secret can never be shared, or be repeated. That's because it's written on EDIBLE PAPER with a FOOD COLORING MARKER, and it must be EATEN to make sure the secret DIES with the winner of the game!<br/><br/>Each player (including the player whose secret is in the game) has one six sided die and a mini coffin. Players use their coffins to hide a secret die number they've chosen, trying to be the highest or lowest unique number. That's right, no rolling of these dice. Players can choose any number from one to six. Everyone opens their coffin at the same time to see who wins each round. Choose wisely, or your number might get cancelled out!<br/><br/>Each round there are TWO winners! One winner draws a card. The other moves their token. Players try to collect a set of four cards to form the phrase: IT - DIES - WITH - ME. OR, move their token across the six grave tiles, all the way to the SECRET ENVELOPE. Complete just one of these goals, and you win. You get to READ THE SECRET! Just remember, that secret must die with you.<br/><br/>",

You check if something bad or good happens (some steps on the paths are black, while most of them are white).<br/><br/>4. A cleaning phase where also Kato gradually gets stronger and stronger.<br/><br/>The game ends either when the players manage to take Mio to Kato's castle and defeat him, or when Mio loses all his courage and it has been replaced by Kato's stonehearts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sangrevores are a new type of enemy race for Nemesis: Retaliation. There is no Queen this time - but a mighty &quot;King&quot;, an ancient being awakened from a long slumber. Mining scavengers found a mysterious-looking &quot;capsule&quot; created out of non-human bones stacked together as if multiple beings had created this tomb from their own bodies. It was quickly transported to the closest human base for further investigation. This is how it all started.<br/><br/>While the history of the mighty Crimson Despot is a mystery, you can easily tell that he feeds himself on life energy and fully dominates will, making his victims mindless puppets serving his wishes. <br/>He will be one of the most dangerous faction leaders, with a terrifying physical presence - he will also get stronger with every player he will eliminate. <br/> By his side, he will have Blood Spectres - engineered, in a way, to master humans and drain their life force. Not only can they harm your mind, but they are also quite an opponent to face. <br/> On top of that, you will have to face hordes of Ghoules - who are drained previous station residents. While not very smart, their numbers will be vast - so exploring the station will be a real challenge. <br/> There are no larvae in this race. This is entirely by intent - first, it fits the thematic way of how this race &quot;reproduces&quot; (by contact with Crimson Despot). It is also essential for the mechanics! <br/> In this expansion, we will also introduce a totally new mechanic that can drastically change the semi-co-op experience. During the contact with the King or Blood Spectres, your character might become converted! This can entirely change your secret objective mid-game without other players not being sure about it. <br/> With some of the attacks, you will get special infection cards (added next to your special objective face down) that only you can see. Most of the time, they will be neutral - but sometimes, they can transform you into Hemodyne yourself and shift your objective into, for example, killing all other players or turning off all life-support. <br/> On top of that, we will be changing the concept of contamination cards. Instead of a standard contamination card that will take a slot - you will actually get some unique ability representing your character getting mutated. This will happen only with contact with Crimson Despot or Blood Spectres. <br/> Those abilities will work as regular cards - you can use either effect on the card or use it to pay for other actions. BUT you always will have to pay the price while using it, i.e., gain one light wound or some other stuff.<br/> On top of it, those cards will be very&hellip; suspicious. Sometimes, you will be able to heal yourself by dealing wounds to other players. Sometimes, you will be able to control a group of Ghoules. Or make yourself invisible to all other Sangraverous for just a few moments.<br/><br/>Those cards will give a toolset for players to increase negative interactions - only if they wish for it. But combined with the possibility of them being turned, it will add new layers of paranoia to the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the Gamefound campaign<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Player of the Game Basketball is designed to provide a quick method of resolving a basketball game between any two teams. Where this game is truly unique is in its ability to not only provide you with a final score, but it will also give you individual point, rebound and assist totals for each player that participates in the game.<br/><br/>Once you understand the concepts behind the game, you&rsquo;ll be able to play out a full game in 5 minutes for the basic game, and 7-10 minutes for the advanced game.<br/><br/>The game offers two levels of complexity. For those gamers that wish to use Player of the Game Basketball in conjunction with another basketball title that resolves games in a possession by possession manner, the basic version will more than likely provide you with all of the detail that you require. Since the basic version plays quicker, it should be a great tool for single team replayers that want to get a snapshot of the rest of the league.<br/><br/>The advanced version of the game is designed for gamers that wish to conduct a series, or a complete season using only Player of the Game Basketball. The advanced version will provide you with hot and cold streaks for players, as well as a realistic game pace factor that will provide you with a realistic method of reproducing the high and lower scoring affairs that occur in basketball, all with their real-life frequency. The advanced version is a great method of playing cross-era teams to see who was truly better.<br/><br/>You will need 2 D10, not included with the game.  You use the d10 rolls to determine which players on a given team will play in a game and what his potential scoring total is.  Additional rolls are used to calculate adjustments due to defense, home court advantage and other factors.<br/><br/>",

But watch out for the bad guys or you could be eliminated from the race.<br/><br/>Players will push their luck by deciding prior to each card flip if they will stay in the race or retire. Retire and you'll collect all the rings and bonus cards revealed in the stage so far. Keep racing and potentially earn even more rings and bonuses, but risk losing a life when a second villain card is revealed.<br/><br/>Players will have two cards in hand, one to show that they will keep racing and one to say that they will retire. Each turn all players still in the race will secretly select a card, they'll place it face down on the table. Once all players have made a selection the next card in the deck is turned over and added to the &quot;course&quot; of cards on the table. If there are two of the same boss cards in the course when it's flipped, all remaining players lose a life token (of which they have three) and a new round begins. The game is played over five total rounds. When players choose to retire, they will collect all ring tokens on the course at the time and keep them for end game scoring.<br/><br/>",

Each course consists of differently coloured spaces; some also have symbols printed on them.

All the other players try to guess what he/she is drawing.

If the correct guess takes more time and the first timer has already run out, they both get to move one space.<br/><br/>While the active player is not allowed to speak, he/she may use a little chart printed in one of the corners of the board to mark how close the guesses are (smiling, neutral and unhappy smilie) or if a part of the word is missing (something is missing at the beginning/end of the word).<br/><br/>Special spaces allow players to challenge other players, and on &quot;x2&quot; spaces you get double the points.<br/><br/>The player whose pawn reaches the finish space first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In every show, the fierce competition between queens makes them give everything on stage, making the crowd go wild each night. But, who&rsquo;s the best of the best? Which queen deserves to be recognized as the Divaest Diva of the show? It&rsquo;s time for you to put on your heels, gown, nails and wig and show you deserve the crown, even if that implies sabotaging your fellow queens&hellip;<br/><br/>Setup: Each player gets one of four secret Divas, indicating with which card and how many copies of them in front of them, they have to get to win the game. If you&rsquo;re Miss Kitty, the comedian, you&rsquo;ll have to get 5 Laugh cards to become victorious. If you&rsquo;re Pink Lemonade, the fashionista, you win with 4 Fame cards. Katie Hart, the showgirl, wins with 4 Spotlight cards and Lee O&rsquo;poldo, the evil queen, wins when another player gets 4 Shade cards in their area.<br/><br/>So, there&rsquo;s a deck with these four cards: Laugh, Fame, Spotlight and Shade. You get 4 initial cards. In your turn, you draw one card from the deck and play one of the cards in your hand in front of you (or if it&rsquo;s Shade, in front of another player). Clockwise, players will draw and play cards until one reveals their secret identity, showing it accomplished their objective, winning the game.<br/><br/>But that&rsquo;s not all! Each card, when played and even on the table, has an especial effect. Fame cards allow you to play additional cards in your turn. Shade cards cancel Fame cards and allows you to steal cards from that player&rsquo;s hand. Laugh cards makes you switch a cards position on the table from one player or another. And finally, with the Spotlight cards, you draw 3 cards and discard 2. Every card is useful, even if they doesn&rsquo;t make you win the game directly!<br/>Balance is settled with card mix and double cards, that you can play using one of the sides only (and remain in that position even when stolen) and also affect the winning condition, making players hard to deduce how wins each player.<br/><br/>Las Divas is a game of temporal alliances, betrayal, deception and fabulous-ness, encouraging players to act like be a queen, making drama, stealing the show and revealing their hidden talents.<br/><br/>It was published in Argentina in 2018, thanks to a succesful crowdfunding campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once upon a time&hellip; not a literature quiz! Focus on the stories! We ask you to write your own bestseller!<br/><br/>Just like in an unforgettable novel, there are big laughs or even deep conversations waiting for you in this game. Once upon a time, there was no one - there was once a character you bring to life&hellip;, a dramatic turn that no one expects&hellip;, and the end result that puts the crown on your work. Creativity, playfulness, communication, imagination - all of which you will need in this great party game where the story can only be limited by your own imagination. Move the threads skillfully and be the best storyteller on your team!<br/><br/>The game lasts for 10 rounds. The first 9 rounds have 3 phases, Inspiration, Writing, and Evaluation.<br/>In the Inspiration phase, we draw 2 characters, 2 dramas and 2 end cards to the playing field.<br/>In the Writing phase, each player thinks about which combination of 3 cards they think could make the most interesting story. It is important that you choose one of each category.<br/><br/>Everyone will write on their page the letter combinations (for example, BAA) of the selected pages next to the current round number.<br/>In the first three rounds, the text of the selected Character Cards is recorded, in rounds 4-6 the text of the selected Drama card, and in rounds 7-9 the text of the End Card.<br/><br/>In the Rating phase, players receive points for each of their teammates who have selected the same letter combination for their story. If exactly the same combination is written, everyone gets 4 points, if only the first 2 letters match, 2 points, if only the first letter matches, 1 point goes. No points are awarded if the first letter of the letter combination does not match anyone.<br/><br/>The tenth round is the Synopsis. In this round, we do not put new cards on the game board, but the Inspiration phase takes place from the texts of the previously selected cards. So in the Inspiration phase, we write the final story from the text of the 3-3-3 inspiration cards previously written on the scorecard.<br/>As everyone completes in a row, tell the Final Story one after the other. Don&rsquo;t forget to give the story a title.<br/>After telling the Final Story, players secretly give each other points. Everyone can split 7 points among the other players, we give the most to the one who we think invented the best story.<br/>After telling the story, everyone adds up the victory points earned during the 9+1 rounds.<br/><br/>",

Observers report that the balloon plummeted out of a cloudy sky into thick woods close to Airesborne Castle, killing both the duke and his son. The duke's brother, Drafton, succeeds to the title. &quot;Drafty,&quot; as he is popularly known, is in poor health and remains secluded at Airesborne Castle.<br/>Lofton received much attention several months ago when he presented a proposal to Parliament to defend the coast of England with an army of armored balloons, &quot;constantly aloft, constantly alert, and threatening death to all intruders.&quot; Though the proposal was easily defeated, Lofton persisted in the study and development of the balloons, which he stated are &quot;critical to the well-being and security of our nation.&quot;<br/>It was one such balloon that the duke and his son were testing on the morning of the crash. A spokesman for the Aires family declared, &quot;The duke had developed an advanced version of his armored balloon and was in the process of testing it when the accident occurred. Whether the crash was caused by a malfunction in the balloon or its weapons systems is not presently known.&quot;<br/>Observers of matters concerning the nobility point out that it is not clear who will be Drafton's heir, since he has no children. In cases where the duke has no natural heir, he may nominate his heir from his immediate family, according to the Royal Grant of Privilege, bestowed by Queen Elizabeth when she created the Duchy of Airesborne in 1597.

        "description": "User summary<br/>DICE WIDE SHUT is a roll-and-write game that includes erasable markers and game boards. Try to fill the columns with checkmarks to score without bursting any rows!<br/><br/>In this game for 2-5 players, you'll use 3-6 red dice and 3-6 blue dice along with a single purple die no matter the player count. Each player has their own erasable game board with a red grid of dice faces at the top of it (with the red faces reading 1-5 as you go across a row) and a blue grid of dice faces at the bottom (with the blue faces reading 1-5 as you go down a column). On the right-hand side of each grid is a column of 6s; the 6s are grayed out and not considered to be part of the red or blue grid.<br/><br/>To start a round, one player rolls the dice. The starting player then chooses either red or blue, then chooses two dice numbered 1-5 or a single die numbered six in the named color. The purple die can be picked up whether you choose red or blue. After you take the die or dice, you check off empty die faces in that half of your player board that match the numbers taken. One exception: When you take a 6, you can check off a 6 in either the top or bottom of your board.<br/><br/>If you create a row of five horizontal checkmarks in the red or blue grid, then you must place a line through all of these checked die faces. Boom! Bad news! If, however, you have a checked 6 in that same row, you can choose to cross out the checkmark instead of placing the final check in the row and blowing it up.<br/><br/>Once all the dice have been claimed, then the next player in clockwise order from the starting player becomes the new starting player and begins a new round. As soon as one player has three filled columns in either the red or the blue grid, each other player takes one final turn (assuming enough dice remain), then the game ends. Players then score points for each column depending on the number of continuous check marks in that column; three separate checkmarks in a column in the red grid is worth 3 points (1 point for each check) while three continuous checkmarks is worth 6 points. An empty space or a crossed-out line breaks the continuity. Whoever has the highest total wins.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>DICE WIDE SHUT is a dice game.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, you have two 5x5 squeare grids. Each round, the first player rolls certain number of dice. During your turn, you take one or two of them. For each die taken, you check a space of the same number of pips in one of your square grids.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you score points according to how long vertical lines of coninuous checks you made in your grids. However, if you were forced to complete a horizontal line of five checks, all vertical lines on that grid are considered to be split by the horizontal line, resulting fewer points scored.<br/><br/>The rules are simple, but because of the split-line rule, sometimes you will find it difficult to make decisions.<br/><br/>「DICE WIDE SHUT」は、(1)ダイスを選び、(2)ボードの対応する部分にチェックを入れるだけの、簡単なルールのゲームです。<br/>各列ごとに得点を計算し、ゲーム終了時に得点の高いプレイヤーが勝利します。<br/>縦方向にチェックが連続すると得点が高くなります。しかし、横方向にチェックがつながると失点につながるルールがあなたを苦しめるでしょう。<br/>多くの誘惑と疑念が立ちふさがり、ダイスの選択は決して容易ではありません。<br/><br/>",

Not only pious monks, humble scholars and trustworthy merchants, but also those mischievous, cunning and dishonest. Welcome to the city of Slyville, where you become one of the latter kind! As head of a guild operating in one of the world's major trade and cultural centers in the Middle Ages, you will be sending your trusted henchmen to various districts to find trade bargains, make deals, and provide your organization with more power and wealth &mdash; maybe not always in a way that is completely legal, but the end justifies the means, doesn&rsquo;t it? After all, you want to get in the graces of the Prince, right?<br/><br/>The Jester&rsquo;s Gambit expansion introduces two new types of cards: Events and Hidden Agendas, to spice up the struggle of the guild leaders in the slyest of all medieval cities! Select your secret goals to pursue, and experience most unusual events: pirates looting the city, a fire in the library, or an audience with the Prince himself - read out a paragraph from the The Book of Slyville Chronicles and see what happens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player takes a coaster and places it moth-side up in front of them, while one coast is placed light-side up equidistant from all players. The moth side of a coaster has two black lines intersecting the perimeter (180&ordm; apart) and a red line every 22.5&ordm; around the perimeter.<br/><br/>On your turn, announce a number from 1 to 6, then roll the die. If you guess correctly, you advance your moth, possibly take a second turn, or even send a player back to start; if you guess incorrectly, you might still advance (although not as much) or another player might move instead of you.<br/><br/>To move your moth, take the flying disc and place the edge of the 1, 2, 3 or 4 space (depending on what you rolled) adjacent to one of the black edges on the perimeter of your moth disc, then roll your moth disc until a red line on your disc hits the other black edge of the 1, 2, 3 or 4 space. The higher the number, the farther your moth will move &mdash; albeit in a curved manner instead of straight toward the light.<br/><br/>No disc can ever be placed on top of another, so if a moth is blocking your way, then you must fly elsewhere! Whoever first touches their moth to the light disc wins!<br/><br/>Nachtschw&auml;rmer includes three variants, one of which has you start the game with several obstacles in play, say pretzels or gummis. Any time you hit an obstacle, you must eat it, then return your moth to its starting point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED: Players move around the Board according to the throw of Dice. Properties such as Beauty Parlor, Department Store, etc., are bought and sold at prices that rise and fall quite unexpectedly depending on whether the conditions are NORMAL, BOOM times, or BUST (depression times). The game is quick moving and amusing. The game ends when all but one player becomes bankrupt and this surviving player WINS THE GAME. If the players prefer, a time limit may be set at the end of which time the player owning the greatest amount of property and cash (when added together) WINS THE GAME.&quot;<br/><br/>The Board has 16 properties (4/side) with purchase price and rent printed on the inside of each space. The Board has NORMAL prices printed thereon. A removable panel, which fits over two pegs in the center of the board, has BOOM prices and rents on the obverse and BUST prices and rents on the reverse. The game starts in NORMAL cycle, changes to BOOM cycle, then to BUST cycle, then back to NORMAL, etc., when any player lands on any of the three corner spaces marked with a Star. (The fourth corner is &quot;Start Here.&quot;) Players try to increase their worth by buying properties at BUST or NORMAL prices, and selling properties at BOOM prices, while trying to bankrupt their opponents by collecting rents, the highest of which is $250,000. The standard rule concerning landing on Un-owned Property is &quot;buy it or leave it.&quot; There is an AUCTION option in the Rules, similar to the Auction Rule in Monopoly.<br/>This game plays like a simplified version of its more famous stable mate, Monopoly, but with the unique twist that all properties' values increase or decrease at the same time, sometimes in rapid succession, without having to develop the properties or have groups or sets.<br/><br/>The raised playing field (Board) actually sits in the 15&quot;x15&quot;x2&quot; box bottom (it is not designed to stand alone). It has a slot on the outside of each property space, wherein the owner places his/her like-colored &quot;T-card&quot; vertically to show ownership. The bills, which are the size of older Monopoly games, come in denominations of $100, $1000, and $10,000. There are also blue/white discs worth $5,000 and silver/blue discs worth $50,000. Four painted wooden markers (red, blue, green, yellow) and two white dice complete the equipment. The Rules sheet states &quot;Questions on the rules for BOOM OR BUST will be answered gladly if 3-cent stamp is enclosed.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Whoever manages to jump over the other adorns herself with a new tail feather &mdash; but the more the young chickens puff up their feathers, the slower they strut around.

Two players (or two teams) take turns moving the two chickens; each chicken needs to move to the space where a worm awaits, the worm being as many spaces ahead as the number of feathers not on the chicken. The player reveals a yard tile, and if it matches the space where his chicken's worm stands, he moves to that tile, then advances the worm the appropriate number of spaces, then tries to reveal that tile; if he reveals the wrong yard tile, his turn ends. If he manages to jump over the other chicken on his turn, his chicken gains a feather, but each feather slows a chicken down, making it harder to zoom around the chicken yard.<br/><br/>The player or team whose chicken gains four feathers first wins.<br/><br/>",

I love brocoli will challenge you to do this with groups both large and small.<br/><br/>Each card in the deck has a collection of six statements on each side. When playing with a small group, one player will leave the room, then everyone else will choose a statement and place a card showing either YES or NO face up in front of themselves. The other player then returns to the room and, after seeing the answers, tries to determine which statement everyone chose, scoring 3, 2 or 1 points based on the number of guesses it took to determine the proper statement. With larger player counts, you avoid the YES/NO cards and split the players into two groups in the room, with all the YES people in one group and the NO in the other.<br/><br/>You can also play the game in teams to allow for more banter and discussion over who seems like the type of person who would say YES (or NO) to certain statements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designer's Note: This is not a professionally published game; it is a series of homemade expansions for Hero quest. I have been selling the games for 2 1/2 years, and have sold well over 600 expansions. So I believe there is justification for presenting them in this forum.)<br/><br/>Dungeons of Peril is the collective name for my first four expansions for Hero Quest, a fantasy board game published by Games Workshop in conjunction with Milton Bradley.<br/><br/>The 4 expansions are:<br/><br/>1) Heroes of the Empire - Play one of 16 new Heroes - Cleric, Warrior-Monk, Mystic, Shapeshifter, Paladin, Halfling Thief, Alchemist, Wood Elf Mage, Vampire Hunter, Rogue, Elf Archer, Weaponmaster, Imperial Ogre, Troll Wizard, Dwarf Ranger, and Shadow Walker. This set includes 16 full-color Hero cards; 24 cards with new spells, equipment, etc. for these Heroes; a reference sheet with new Potions and Items; and a 4-page rulebook.<br/><br/>2) Endless Dungeons - Create a virtually endless number of dungeons with this set. It includes 32 different full-color dungeon tiles, a 10-page rulebook detailing the Special Tiles (with new traps, monsters, etc.), and a double-sided reference sheet. There are 16 standard tiles (4 of each of the following types: Corridor, Small Room, Medium Room, and Large Room), 2 Stairs tiles, and 14 Special Tiles. Use the tiles to create pre-generated dungeons, or create random ones in just a few minutes.<br/><br/>3) Servants of Darkness - This is a set of full-color 3-D stand-ups to use instead of miniatures. The set includes 128 stand-ups - 19 different Heroes, 8 Mercenaries, and 64 different monsters (there are multiple stand-ups for the mercenaries and some monsters). The stand- ups are (roughly) to scale and vary in size, from the standard human size to the very large Dragon and Rock Giant. Also included is a 14-page rulebook for using ALL of the monsters in Heroquest.<br/><br/>4) Perilous Quests &ndash; This expansion provides instructions on how to create and populate an entire dungeon. The rules walk you through how to create the dungeon and how to fill it with monsters, traps, dungeon features (like a Magic Mirror or strange Mould), and special rooms. This is done using two new types of cards (Encounter and Search). You can create an entire dungeon in just a few minutes. The rules are designed to allow as much flexibility as desired when creating a dungeon. The rules can be used for pre-generated quests, but they also allow you to play without a game master and are ideally suited for SOLO play! Finally, the Dungeon Bash rules allow parties of Heroes to go head-to-head!<br/><br/>Perilous Quests includes the following: 20 new Artifact cards, 16 Search cards, 8 Encounter cards, 4 Lich spells, 8 new Chaos spells, 8 Chaos monster cards (4 Sorcerers and 4 Chaos Spawn), 8 Elemental monster cards, and a sheet of dungeon counters (representing various special features).<br/><br/>Expands<br/><br/>    HeroQuest<br/><br/><br/>",

Players will compete to build the finest airship while managing their crew, stockpiling supplies and maintaining their valuable discoveries. In the end, only the most cunning captain can rule the frontier skies as the richest adventurer around!<br/><br/>In more detail, Frontier Skies consists of four seasons, spanning a total of twelve rounds of play. Each round consists of four phases: market, adventure, trade and draw. During the market phase, players compete in an open market to purchase new and upgraded parts for their airship. Purchasing new ship parts improves speed, attack power and cargo capacity, giving players special bonuses and extra space to carry valuable discoveries.<br/><br/>In the adventure phase, players embark on a new journey by revealing the top card in the adventure deck. The trade phase allows players to trade discoveries with each other, deciding which are worth keeping and which should be sold off to gain gold and free up cargo capacity for their next adventure. During the draw phase, players activate special abilities, gain an additional discovery, and compete for end-of-season and end-of-game goals which reward players with even more gold.<br/><br/>At the end of the final round, each player calculates their total value to find out which captain has amassed the greatest riches!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Signora ordered five eighths with tomatoes!<br/><br/>This game will make you sweat, as you&rsquo;ll be working for the famous and respected Italian pizzeria called Splittissimo. Its fussy clients love to order pizza by slices. By playing this game you'll become such an expert in fractions that you'll be second to none.<br/><br/>The game set is designed in a charming Italian style. It includes both rectangular cards with orders and fascinating round cards. The latter are trays with different numbers of pizza slices. Apart from cheese and olives, pizzas include tomatoes, mushrooms, and peppers in various combinations; each one can have two additional ingredients.<br/><br/>Splittissimo offers the fastest delivery!<br/><br/>There are several versions of the game.<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s start with the easiest one. If you&rsquo;re playing with children of five and older, use only round cards. Beginner level cards are marked with one dot (to make it more challenging, you can add cards with two or three dots later). Each player takes three cards and puts them face-up in front of him; the same number of cards is placed face-up on the table (playing by the rules of a more challenging version, the players draw 4 cards and 4 cards are placed on the table) The task is to use several playing field cards to assemble a pizza , so that the number of its slices would be equal to the number of slices in one of your pizzas. Or, conversely, you can choose one of the playing field pizzas and assemble it using several of your own cards.<br/><br/>Playing with older kids, add the rectangular order cards. The task is to assemble the ordered pizzas using the cards on the playing field, taking into account both their size and the ingredients. To add excitement to the game, use a number of special cards, which allow you to slow down your opponents&rsquo; work and accelerate your own pace using &ldquo;last minute&rdquo; orders.<br/><br/>All versions of the game end with counting the whole pizzas that players managed to put together. In other words, the players should make whole pizzas from the slices they have, which helps them to reinforce addition of fractions once again.<br/><br/>",

There are 10 noses, all taken from art, shown paired up in every combination on large tiles (excepting one pairing because there are only 54 tiles in the game). The tiles are shuffled face-down and distributed evenly (excess can go in the box). Players then turn up and sort their noses out.<br/><br/>They take it in turns to add a nose to the pattern according to the rules, and when a player makes or increases a group of one type of nose, they place one of their five colored markers on it. (If you happen to increase two groups, you place 2 markers.)<br/><br/>But as soon as another player increases that group, their marker replaces the first, which goes back to the other player. In this way, the pattern gets bigger and players fight to control the noses. But because of the random distribution, you will have some fewer noses than others, so the placement becomes very tactical as you try to close off groups and secure your scoring.<br/><br/>The pattern must sit within a 10x10 grid, and all the tiles are open, so it pays to deliberately extend the grid in one direction, giving or taking away opportunities. When no more tiles can be placed, you score one point for each nose you own.<br/><br/>A surprisingly tricky game given the range of noses, Nasenspiel entertains with a delightful combination of sacrifice and reward and a very unusual theme.<br/><br/>",

Place finger on launcher and press.<br/><br/>The figure flips into the air and hopefully lands on the the board. The magnets are strong enough that generally the tiki will right itself vertically (either right-side up or upside down).

        "description": "Board game &lsquo;ZooRegatta&rsquo; is a family learning game that acquaints Players with Geography and Animal world of our planet during fascinating sailing regatta. Children will like playing process as well as preparation to the game, during which it will be necessary to assemble 4 ships miniatures.<br/><br/>Players appear in the role of captains of sailing ships that received task of particular importance: &ldquo;To make a round-the-world voyage and collect animals &ndash; one animal from each continent. All animals must be shipped to the own port in order to organize a zoo.&rdquo; Winner is the Player, who first transports full collection of animals to the port, where his trip started.<br/><br/>Gameplay is divided to rounds. During a round all Players move their ships according to the turn order.<br/><br/>Distance that can be passed by a ship is determined by each Player with a die roll.<br/><br/>Oceans have plenty of currents and an experienced captain can use favorable ones in order to speed up his trip over the oceans vastness. A ship that moved to a hex with a current passes one hex in a direction of a current and this movement does not decrease remaining movement points.<br/><br/>In order to quickly pass large distances, desperate captain can use whirlpools (their total number is 6). In order to use whirpools, Player rolls a die, passes corresponding number of hexes and if he finishes in a whirlpool, he rolls a die once more. New number will show in which whirlpool the Player will start his new turn.<br/><br/>Each Player at the beginning of the game has 2 shots (so 2 fire tokens are put on a ship card). In order to fire, a Player has to finish his movement near an opponent&rsquo;s ship. After that he rolls a die and result indicates a cabin, which was hit. (e.g., cabin 6 is hit in a die roll of 6). If the cabin is empty, a shot is unlucky. If an animal was in cabin, a shoot hits an animal out of the ship, and wind and waves return it to its natural living place (a captain must place an animal token to any of the empty red hexes on the animal&rsquo;s continent).<br/><br/>SECOND GAME.<br/>The board is 2-sided. On the second side of the board there is another game: &lsquo;Dangerous race&rsquo;. It will suit to the smallest Players that only get their first steps in a board game world!<br/><br/>A winner is a Player who first passes a route from a starting fort to a finishing one. Each Player rolls a die and moves at corresponding number of circles along the line. Lines are of red and yellow colors. Red solid line is a main path. Yellow solid line is shorter but more dangerous way.<br/>AWARDS<br/>Winner of the &quot;Baby Expo Ukraine 2018&quot; (best geography game)<br/><br/>",

As the Commander of Yorkist Allied Forces, you must control a significant number of Cities and Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played.<br/><br/>Game Objective: Player takes command of the House of York. The Player&rsquo;s Objective is to attempt to control at least 16 Cities and 12 Towns before the last Campaign Card is Played. If the Lancaster Army controls 16 Cities and 12 Towns at the end of their Turn, the Lancastrians win.<br/><br/>During the Player's Turn, he/she must draw Campaign Cards which may result in Events, Actions, or Forces. The Player must gather his Nobles and their forces in order to take control of Cities and Towns. Random Events play a major part in the game, however, the Player must manage his Nobles and Action Points wisely in order to acheive victory.<br/><br/>The Game includes many colorful counters representing Nobles, Foot Levies, Men-at-Arms, Knights, Longbowmen, Hand-gunners, and Cannon.<br/><br/>A Bloody Crown can be found at the following URL:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.berserkergames.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>",

You are an adventurer who is unwittingly sucked into this time spiral. Your objective is collecting a form of energy called mana and bringing the world back to order, allowing you to return to your own time.<br/><br/>The objective of play is to travel the game board and collect mana, a strange form of energy, before the other players. Players advance the number of squares according to the number rolled on the die. Cast Cards can be set along points of the board, allowing a player to collect payment from others. &ldquo;Cast&rdquo; refers to the residents of the alien world. Once a player collects 100 mana, he wins by returning to Start. This means that even if another player has more mana than you, if you reach the goal with 100 mana in hand, you are the winner. To decide runners-up, count the number of mana each player has at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.<br/><br/>",

In order to survive as individuals and to strive for the success of their co-op, players make tough choices regarding big and small challenges while putting their teamwork abilities to the test.<br/><br/>Challenges consist of mini games of charades, guess the drawing or &quot;unspoken&quot;, in which the active player has to get the other players to guess the word on the card without saying the word or related words.  Completing challenges earns points for your co-op.  As the co-op marker moves around the board world cards may have to be drawn that can take points from the individual players, from the co-op pool of points or can be beneficial by giving bonus challenges or points.  The players win when they achieve the goal of starting up a second co-op.<br/><br/>This is an exciting game of skill and solidarity, where everyone wins &ndash; or everybody loses. Will the Point Bank continue to dominate the players&rsquo; lives, or will they break free and take control by jump-starting the movement for a truly democratic and cooperative economy in their community?<br/><br/>By playing Co-opoly, players discover the unique benefits, challenges, and operations of the cooperative world &ndash; as well as the skills needed to participate in a co-op!<br/>Co-opoly is for teens and adults.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is part of a series of games and is themed for the Jewish holiday of Purim. This entry is the series specifically is aimed at little girls and so focuses on Queen Esther from the Purim story.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of pieces which depict Queen Esther. These start on a side giving a black and white picture. After the end of each circuit round the board or after certain actions, a player flips a piece to the colored side. The first player to flip all pieces of the picture of Queen Esther to the colored side wins.<br/><br/>The game uses a dreidel in lieu of a d4, and players move round the six points of a Star of David based on the result of a spin. The movement value of a spin and the associated action in regards to a pool of cards for each spin corresponds to the value of a given spin in the traditional game of Dreidel. One set of cards serves to modify the movement results of spins, to protect one from other players' actions and to challenge other players. Another set of cards serves to create sets and so earn Hamentaschen (cookie) tokens which can in turn be used to turn over pieces of the picture of Queen Esther.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The idea for country trains came when the designer was playing Kings Gate one evening. The rectangular tiles could be stations and the tiles around them and joining them could be services and track. This was way back in 2006.<br/><br/>Over the years the design has been revisited many times and the game developed.<br/><br/>On a turn a player must lay a tile and may move their train. If the train is on connection between two stations it must move back to a station to re-coal. If the train is at a station, it may move onto a track connection to make a delivery. Deliveries are payed out based on the goods at the source and the type in demand at the destination (timber, sheep, ore). All stations have spaces for goods to be delivered too. When these are full, that station can receive no more goods. However, space can be made for more goods by delivering passengers.<br/><br/>The tiles players lay represent track, which they are paid to lay (land grant railway style). Country tiles which provide goods for carriage. Plus passengers which consume the carried goods as described above.<br/><br/>The game also has station tiles which are owned by the players. Players start with one station, but may lay extra as their existing stations are properly surrounded. Owning a station also earns players a small income as other player use the facilities there.<br/><br/>The game continues until one of the tile stacks runs out.<br/><br/>The latest version of the rules and tiles are May 2019. If you have been playing an earlier version, the designer suggests at least looking at the improvements and/or viewing the &quot;how to&quot; video section here on the geek.<br/><br/>",

The kit includes rules, hundreds of customizable tokens and stickers, disks (to mark status or conditions), isomorphic map tiles, various tracking mats (phases, turns, time, die roll modifiers), dice, and links to additional online resources. MaGCK also contains rules and briefing materials for two games: ISIS CRISIS (a conflict simulation of contemporary Iraq) and A RECKONING OF VULTURES (coup-plotting and political skullduggery in the fictional Republic of Matrixia). Matrix games are already used within the national security and foreign policy communities for training and analysis. With MaGCK the user can develop their own games on a wide range of topics, whether for professional use or hobby gaming.<br/><br/>",
