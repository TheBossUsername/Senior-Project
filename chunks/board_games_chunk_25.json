        "description": "French - German - Spanish<br/><br/>Recess!<br/><br/>A board game of pain and loss in a rough parochial school ...<br/><br/>Growing up is never easy ... especially in a rough parochial school where scores are settled on the playground. Between bullies stealing your lunch money, fights breaking out left and right, and schoolmates tattling to the ever-present nuns, a kid just can't catch a break ... or a kiss, as the case may be. Because you're a lover as well as a fighter, and all you really want is to steal a kiss from your sweetheart across the blacktop before the school bell rings and recess is over. The fact that you've bet the last of your lunch money on being the first do it makes it all the more risky. Of course, might makes right here on the playground. If you can't win your money back from the other kids, you can always beat it out of them.<br/><br/>Recess is a strategy board game for three to five players. Players each start with two boy figures and two girl figures on opposite sides of the grid-marked modular board, which is dotted with playground-themed obstacles. Children move like a rook in chess, while nuns move like a queen. A child that lands on a space occupied by another child starts a fight and takes a coin from him. Other children can break up a fight by landing on that same space, or tattle by landing on a nun's space. If a nun moves onto the fight space, the attacker is sent back to the entrance for detention. Finishing thirty of the minute-long turns marks the end of the game, or it ends immediately when one player's boy and girl figures meet on the same space while out of sight of the nuns. The resulting kiss earns two coins from each player, but to win you still have to end up with the most coins.<br/><br/>",

The miniatures are divided into sets for each colour, consisting of 2 airplanes, 4 artillery, 5 battleships and 1 anti-aircraft gun.<br/><br/>Players start the game in their own corner with 8 miniatures. The 4 remaining miniatures are placed in a reserve. The dice are rolled and the player must move two of his/her pieces a number of spaces as indicated on the dice. Pieces can be moved in any direction but are limited in where they can move based on the particular unit. Battleships must move on water, artillery and anti-aircraft must move on land while airplanes can move on either. Rolling doubles permits an extra turn while rolling a seven gains another unit from the reserve. Pieces are captured by moving over them and a &quot;home&quot; space is captured by exact roll.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has captured all of the opponent's pieces or captures all of the home spaces.<br/><br/>",

It was during that period the conventional &ldquo;correlation of forces&rdquo; between the two hostile alliances most favored the communists.<br/><br/>The scenario portrayed is the one that was most anticipated and feared by NATO&rsquo;s intelligence analysts at the time. That is, despite their knowledge of the existence of Soviets plans to begin such a war with massive chemical and nuclear strikes, the West&rsquo;s military planners gave those schemes little credence. They knew the Soviets understood such a strategy would bring on immediate nuclear retaliation by the West. That would&rsquo;ve ended the war as quickly as it began &ndash; mostly likely along with all of civilization &ndash; with no winner identifiable.<br/><br/>What was feared then was, one fine summer day, the Soviet units in East Germany would move out from eating breakfast in their mess halls and roll across the border into West Germany. It would&rsquo;ve been a &ldquo;come as you are&rdquo; kind of war, the aim of which would&rsquo;ve been to blitz across Germany &ndash; using only conventional weaponry &ndash; in under a month.<br/><br/>The Soviets would then have called for a ceasefire before any nuclear or chemical weapons had been detonated or the massive economic power of the Atlantic community brought to bear. With that, West Germany &ndash; the geo-strategic lynchpin of NATO in Europe &ndash; would&rsquo;ve been neutralized and its Ruhr industrial area &ndash; then as now, one of the most important manufacturing centers on the planet &ndash; entirely wrecked. That would&rsquo;ve caused a shift in the global balance of power in favor of the Kremlin, setting them up to deliver the knockout blow later.<br/><br/>The 50&rdquo; x 35&rdquo; map covers the core area of the Federal Republic of Germany at 6.66 miles (10.8 km) per hex. There are 352 large-size (5/8&rdquo;) unit counters, representing the divisions and brigades immediately on scene at the time, along with the masses of other units that could&rsquo;ve been sent as reinforcements. Each of the 10 game turns represent three days of real time.<br/><br/>The turn sequence uses the classic fight-move or move-fight structure. Special rules account for heliborne units, Spetsnaz, the ultra-elite Soviet Eighth Guards and Guards Airborne Armies, East German and Czechoslovakian disloyalty, ranged Soviet artillery divisions, air power, supply, the criticality of Frankfurt for US operations, paradrops, German territorials, electronic warfare and variable Soviet victory objectives.<br/><br/>The overall system is simple, at about 6 on the 1-10 scale. Two experienced players can get through a match in about four to six hours.<br/><br/>",

The object is to form the same poker-like number sets as Yahtzee, only the scoring is a bit different.  There are no scoring sheets; no pencils are needed.  Instead, built-in score cards are used which indicate the point values for each successfully rolled &quot;hand&quot;.  Plastic tabs are used to uncover the point values when a roll is successful, or a plastic ring is inserted when a zero is scored.  Highest score after 13 turns per player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the best selling book comes the Hunger Games Training Days, A Game of Strategy.  Coinciding with the final book in the trilogy being released this fall, the Training Days game allows 2-6 players to follow in the footsteps of their favorite Tributes.<br/><br/>User review: Each player chooses a district to represent and a gender. The players take the appropriate Tribute Card. Each Tribute Card gives the players ratings from one (low) to eight (high) in four attributes: strength, ability, cunning, and charm. The Challenge deck is shuffled and a player is chosen to go first. The players will take their turns in clockwise order.<br/><br/>The first player reveals a number of Challenge cards equal to the number of players. Each player has three effort tokens: one (low), three (medium), and six (high). Each player, in turn, will assign one effort token face down to any Challenge card. After all the players have assigned their effort tokens, the events on the Challenge cards are resolved. One Challenge card at a time, the effort tokens are revealed and the winner of the event is determined. Each player total one&rsquo;s own Effort tokens plus the Attribute rating called for by the card, plus alliance bonuses (from Tribute cards not already in play) plus a die roll. The player with the highest total wins the event and the approval rating associated with the event.<br/><br/>Three End of Day cards were shuffled into the Event deck at the beginning of the game. When ever an End of Day card is revealed, then all the event cards are shuffled with the End of Days cards. Before the game began the players determine how many days the will last. When that number of End of Day cards has been revealed, then the game is over and the player who has the highest approval rating is the winner.<br/><br/>",

In fact, the spirit of the game itself comes across like one of those stories, with the players being adventurers in the early twentieth century who are entering an enormous Egyptian pyramid in order to discover the riches that lie in wait. Alas, the adventurers' presence sets off a series of 3,000-year-old traps and they become separated inside a lethal maze.<br/><br/>Turns out that the maze is of their own creation, though, as players take turns laying down tiles that show corridors, monsters, traps or equipment. They must reach a staircase exit in order to gain their freedom, possibly facing off against monsters while doing so and using the strengths of their four characteristics to survive.<br/><br/>NB: Currently only in French, Spanish and Italian<br/><br/>",

It is part of the early 1980s board game offerings put out by Target Games.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplay<br/> The mapboard is actually a rather accurate map of Stockholm, divided into areas of different sizes that regulate movement. Dividing the center of the board is a streak of water, Stockholms str&ouml;m, which is impassable to human forces but not to the monster. Certain areas are also spawn points of police and military forces, that randomly enter the fight against the monster as reinforcements each turn. There are also civilian counters, i.e. monster food.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is, for the monster player, to destroy a certain well-known landmark in Stockholm, including the old Tax ministry headquarters, the &quot;degenerate&quot; statue group Paradiset, the Royal castle et al. Before the game starts, the monster players chooses from a set of monster statistics that include which landmark it is to destroy, and also determines the monster start area. The objective of the human player is simply to kill the monster.<br/><br/>Rules chrome includes the then renowned skinhead gangs of Stockholm that in the game are portrayed as violent, unkillable, and anarchist -- they randomly change allegiance each turn -- as well as the ceremonial palace guard, H&ouml;gvakten, at Stockholm Castle.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction from the rules<br/> The following is a translation of the Swedish introduction from the rules:<br/><br/>The Monster that devoured Stockholm is an exciting adventure game where tactics and good foresight are of great importance.<br/><br/>The game is played by two players.  One is the &quot;monster&quot;-player who tries to destroy a certain part of Stockholm.  The other player is the &quot;human&quot;-player and controls Stockholms' military and police forces.<br/><br/>The monster will try to reach its destination without being killed by defending humans. On its way, the monster may eat innocent citizens to regain its strength.<br/><br/>The human player must try to figure out where the monster is heading and concentrate his military forces there while trying to reduce the casualties from innocent bystanders to a minimum.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tComponents<br/> The box contains:<br/>1 Gaming board 39x52cm<br/>2 Dice<br/>1 set of 60 cardboard counters<br/><br/>(The rules is the only part of the game with Swedish text).<br/><br/>",

The value on one side differs from that of the other side by a maximum of two.<br/>The goal of the game is to collect series of four coins with consecutive values (e.g. 1-2-3-4 or 9-10-11-12). Series of four are exchanged for victory point cards. There are 12 victory point cards with values from 18 to 7. The first player to collect a series gets the 18-point victory card, the next series is worth 17 points and so on, so the sooner you complete series, the better.<br/><br/>On his/her turn, a player has the following choices:<br/><br/>     They can take the top card from the draw deck and use it in their own card display.<br/>     They can give the top card from the draw deck to one of the other players and get a single (i.e. not part of a series) card from that player's display. Before they can add it to their own display, they have to turn the card over, so its value can be up to two points lower or higher than what they originally saw.<br/>     They can take the top card from a completed series for which another player has already scored points. That card has to be turned over and used with its other side up too.<br/><br/><br/>If a player manages to incorporate a card into his/her card display, they get another turn (limit: 3 consecutive turns). There is no limit on how many rows a player can start in his/her display.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no cards left in the draw deck.<br/>The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Your deals with fellow players will ultimately determine your success or failure.<br/><br/>The resources you need to build your trading empire can only be acquired by the highest bid, so you must balance fast expansion with longterm planning. If you strike too soon, your control may be easy to challenge.

Players hurry to be the first to reach their goal, all the while moving pathways, changing the maze, and even moving the victory goals. Should you race ahead at full speed? Or spend precious time cutting off your opponents? Only one player will succeed and escape the Living Labyrinth!<br/><br/>Rules are simple, and the game can be enjoyed by both kids and families. The action cards give players a handful of simple tactical options, but playing them in the right order on the right tiles requires some challenging decisions. The double-sided tiles ensure that the maze is never the same twice - don't expect the same plan to work in every game, because the ground under your feet is ever-changing!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marketed as the first glow-in-the-dark game, there were at least three versions of the board. One was green with red spaces, another white with red spaces and the third was white with brown spaces. The glowing does not work as well as showed on the television commercials, which, if you watched carefully, were filmed using black light. (If you wish to play the game, you may like to use a black light yourself.)<br/><br/>Past the appearance, the game itself is pretty much the usual roll-and-move with a few twists. The board is up on stilts and the &quot;path&quot; has holes in it so that movers may fall through and thereby gain the privilege of opening one of the three pits (cardboard boxes containing ghoulish feeling items) and retrieving one of the precious small green ghosts. Players are not ensuring victory, but simply improving their chances in the end game which is decided by the giant green ghost spinner.<br/><br/>Originally published by Transogram; revived 1997 by Marx Toys.<br/><br/>",

You may even play cards face down to cover a face up card (your own or an opponent&rsquo;s). With each card played, the same coloured marker is moved. That means that all markers can be moved by all players. The finishing order of the 3 markers determines the sequence for the 3 tasks.

The first player to collect all the cards needed to fill their chosen zoo wins the game.<br/><br/>Interestingly, although the game says it can support up to five players, if there is a fifth player that person actually only acts as the game's banker and does not actually participate in the game otherwise.<br/><br/>The game is asymmetrical; each zoo has its own strengths and weaknesses and favour different strategies.<br/><br/>Note that there are several different versions of the game with varying mechanics, some of which have much more strategy than others; see the community wiki for details.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player is randomly dealt a set of &quot;Curios&quot; of categories: Vintage, Games, Etc, Electronics, Sports and Collectibles. Once you win an auction of the items that match each of your Curio cards you win the game. Item cards represent the items you can find for sale on the eBay website. During the game Item Cards are auctioned off to the highest bidder. There are 2 types of Bidding Cards: Money Cards and Action Cards.<br/><br/>First the Curio Cards are dealt according to the number of players ... 3 or 4 players = 5 Curio Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 4 Curio Cards each. Second the Item Cards are dealt face up in a row ... 3 or 4 players = 4 Item Cards each ... 5 or 6 = 5 Item Cards each. Third, each player is dealt 5 Bidding Cards. One D6 die is then placed on each Item Card matching the number showing on the die to the Number of Rounds field on the item. Finally, each player rolls a die. The highest roll receives the &quot;Starter&quot; Card and goes first.<br/><br/>One complete round of play consists of one turn per player and an Auction Update Phase. During each player's turn, they may perform any or all of the following actions in any order: 1) Draw hand back up to 5 Bidding Cards, 2) Discard one Item Card won on a previous turn to draw 3 Bidding Cards, 3) Either 3a) Play 1 Action Card and/or place 1 bid on an item, 3b) In lieu of placing a bid and/or playing an Action Card, you may discard as many Bidding Cards as you like. You redraw at the beginning of your next turn.<br/><br/>When each player has taken a turn, The &quot;Starter&quot; Card passes to the left.  After this, starting with the first Item Card, the die on each Item Card is lowered by one. When a die reaches zero, the auction is finished and all bids are revealed. Players may, at this point, play Action Cards which are allowed during this phase.<br/><br/>Action cards: Know Your Enemy, Bad Money Order, Tastes Change, Mass Amnesia, Offshore Financing, Lost Connection<br/><br/>Cards played during Auction Update Phase: Expensive Shipping, Reserve Price, Bad Feedback<br/><br/>You can change the length of the game by adding or subtracting the number of Curio Cards available.<br/><br/>(Most of the above was taken directly out of the rules sheet that comes with the game. Personal note: Some of the Item Card titles and flavor text is pretty funny and some are just plain &quot;cute&quot;.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the publisher's site. Translated from Norwegian.)<br/><br/>The object in Novem is to score more points than your opponent. There are numbered tiles of wood on the board in three rows and three columns - where one player controls the rows and the other the columns. In secrecy the players choose a row and column, and the attacking player takes the tile in the intersection between the selected row and column. Then the other player become the attacker, and so on. At the end of the game the player whom have collected the tiles with the highest numbers the most points! A totally brilliant tactical game!<br/><br/>Novem - ein Taktikspiel f&uuml;r 2 Spieler &ndash; einfach, aber brillant!<br/><br/>Wer schafft es, nach zwei Partien mehr Punkte zu erzielen als der Gegner? Auf dem Spielfeld liegen neun Zahlensteine in je drei Reihen und Spalten. Ein Spieler kontrolliert die Reihen, der andere Spieler die Spalten. Geheim w&auml;hlen die Spieler in jeder Runde eine Reihe und eine Spalte aus. Der Angreifer gewinnt den Stein, der am Kreuzungspunkt der ausgew&auml;hlten Reihe und Spalte liegt. In der n&auml;chsten Runde wird der Gegenspieler zum Angreifer.<br/><br/>Novem ist ein taktisches Spiel, f&uuml;r das Sie keine mathematischen Kenntnisse brauchen &ndash; aber einen klaren Verstand und Nerven aus Stahl!<br/><br/>",

The snakes lie on the tracks and must be hopped over.  Some bite - they have a magnet that is attracted to some (not all) of the frogs - others just lie still.  Flowers are collected as an antidote to snake bites.<br/>Players can move a cat each turn instead of a frog. No frog would dare walk past a cat, so they are placed in the way of frogs to hold them up and allow or prevent the theft of a book.<br/><br/>",

This unique feature creates a totally different play dynamic from other deck building games.<br/><br/>MSFG has players assuming the roles of rival houses at Miskatonic. Each house has a healthy level of sanity (20) at the beginning of the game. As the game goes on, that precious sanity will slowly be torn away by the faculty of the school. In order to combat the bad teaching methods of the Great Old Ones, the students of the house need to band together!<br/><br/>During your turn, you'll buy your new friends with friendship points and use nightmare points to send faculty after the rival houses. Eventually, those Faculty will end up in a player's hand, where they will hold class, teaching your innocent students about the horrors around them. This has a detrimental effect on your house's sanity.<br/><br/>Due to the overwhelming power of the dark truth, it's just a matter of time before your house goes completely bonkers. The last house left with any sanity wins!<br/><br/>",

The problem? You don&rsquo;t have a car, but as karma has it, neither do the others.<br/><br/>You must hitchhike your way there using planes, trains and automobiles&hellip; and the occasional bike from the thrift shop. Hey&hellip; it was 99 cents! <br/>On this journey through the continent, you&rsquo;ll hop into cars equipped with NOZ, turbos, and furry dice. You&rsquo;ll encounter some crazy drivers who might occasionally be drunk and take risky jumps just for the hell of it. You&rsquo;ll wish for awesome upgrades to your lift, but the others are wishing just the opposite.<br/><br/>On your turn, they&rsquo;ll be praying evil things upon you. Whatever they can think of to hinder your speed. They&rsquo;ll throw old ladies and moose if they have to. They&rsquo;ll send birds in your engine or just simply wish for you to crash and burn. But don&rsquo;t worry, their turn will come and vengeance will be sweet.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll have to strategically manage your limited hand size and choose which deck to draw from. Will you draw transportation cards to hopefully get the best ride in the game? Or will you draw some karma cards to boost your current ride and slow the others down.<br/>While on this awesome road trip, you&rsquo;ll have to choose your path, or let the driver take you further on his own path. The GPS will determine this. You&rsquo;ll have to stop at train crossings and travel through snowy hills, sandy deserts, big cities and farmland.<br/><br/>The race also has two levels of play. You can play the regular way, which is with the special ability text of the cards, or the Junior way. In the junior level, simply play without the text and use only the numbers. This will help young players learn simple math, strategy, and have fun while doing so.<br/><br/>But just when you thought the race was over, there&rsquo;s more to come&hellip; expansions with new maps, more vehicles, more upgrades and of course&hellip;more mayhem are already in the works. Why do you think we put STAGE 1 on the box?<br/>So pack light, head out there, and hope for the best!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The kingdom of Fayrune finds itself in terrible peril. Peasants are in uproar over the Dragon scouring the countryside, burning crops to the ground, and leaving naught but an enormous singe-mark where crops meant to feed the realm once stood. Worse still, the Dragon is never sated and has now taken to devouring livestock.<br/><br/>With his knights on the run, the King issues a final, desperate plea to those who would slay the beast, promising his daughter's hand in marriage as a reward.<br/><br/>In L'Aventure c'est dur you are one of those brave/foolish souls who have stepped forward to travel across the land and attempt to slay the Dragon. First, you must play &quot;Land&quot; cards, each of which specifies a distance, to travel one hundred miles (80 with five or more players) Milles Bornes-style and reach the Dragon's lair. Once there, you use &quot;Combat&quot; cards that have accumulated in your hand to try to exhaust the Dragon's hit points and the princess' hand.<br/><br/>",

The backs of the cards are also marked with icons that affect play.<br/><br/>Normally, each player plays one card out of hand, matching either the number or color of the previous card.  However, if a player can not or does not want to play a card from hand, they may instead follow the icon on the back of the top card of the draw pile.  This instructs them to draw cards or flip the card onto the discard pile.  Other special cards are Reverses, Wilds, and Searches (which cause an opponent to draw cards).  A player may also play a HIT card at any time, the next player must play THE, if possible, then DECK.  When DECK is played, the player claims the discard pile for points.  A round ends, and points are scored when a player empties their hand.<br/><br/>",

Once your King has become completely surrounded by pyramids and cannot move, you are out of the game, unless there are two pyramids of the same color (there are eight pyramids in five different colors) leading out in a straight line from your King, in which case you can move the one closest to your King to anywhere else on the board, and then move your King into the empty space.<br/><br/>Oddly, the box this game came in is completely devoid of any extraneous info (including game designer and year of publication), and even the manufacturer's initials are in tiny print with a &copy; symbol, crammed down in the corner of the cover. Even the rules for the game are printed on the back of the box (in English &amp; German) as opposed to being included on a separate sheet inside.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Redakai is a trading card game using the characters and setting of an animated series of the same name that debuted on the Cartoon Network in the U.S. in 2011.  Redakai cards have Blast 3D technology, making them appear 3D, as well as making attacks appear to animate as the player moves the card.<br/><br/>In Redakai, a player is trying to eliminate the character(s) controlled by the opponent to win the game. In the basic game, each player starts with one character and on a turn you draw a card from your deck, then play it immediately. The card types are monster &ndash; which are played on your own character to boost defenses and heal damage &ndash; and attack &ndash; which are played on the opponent's character. A character can have defenses in three colors &ndash; green, red, blue &ndash; and if an attack is stronger than a character's defense in that attack's color, then the attack hits and damages the character.<br/><br/>The cards are transparent and they stack on top of each other during play. A character's health is represented by three damage zones on the card, and if all these zones turn red (by playing one or more attacks on that character), then the character is eliminated. An attack can also cover up and remove a character's defense, while monsters can boost defenses and cover red damage zones with yellow ones, thus healing the character.<br/><br/>In the advance game, each player controls three characters and starts with a hand of three cards and a maximum Kairu value of three. Each turn, a player boosts his maximum Kairu by one (to a maximum of 20), draws one card, then (optionally) plays monster and attack cards, spending Kairu to do so equal to the cost on each card. Some cards have &quot;react&quot; abilities that allow you to spend Kairu to defend against attacks. At the start of each turn, your Kairu refreshes to its maximum value.<br/><br/>If you eliminate all three of your opponent's characters, you win the game. If you cannot draw a card on your turn because your deck is exhausted, you lose.<br/><br/>",

This repeats until all but one player's pieces are eliminated, or the last piece makes it to the center spot on the fourth board.<br/><br/>",

Each player draws a goal card of their choice and keeps it hidden. Flip the three-minute sand timer to begin play. To start, one player rolls all six dice, which have the numbers 1-6 on the sides with a different color on each side. Players then take turns in clockwise order grabbing and re-rolling as many dice as they wish from what lies on the table. If at any time the die results allow you to complete your goal card in hand, place that card on your &quot;completed goals&quot; pile, then draw a new card from the pile of your choice. Sample goals are have three dice with the same number, have three dice of the same color in sequence, have no visible red or black dice, or have a pair of a certain color and a different pair of a certain number at the same time.<br/><br/>When the sand timer runs out, tally the points for completed goals. To make the game more challenging, you can shuffle all of the goal cards into a single deck or you can lay out 1-4 public special goals at the start of the game; if you fail to complete all of the special goals, then your final score is 0 no matter what else you do.<br/><br/>",

Can the players work together to solve the mystery, or will the murderer escape justice?<br/><br/>In There's Been A Murder, players may not talk about the cards they hold in their hand or that they've seen during play. By playing their cards and following the instructions they can discover who holds the key cards, allowing the Detective to uncover the Murderer. When this happens, everyone wins!<br/><br/>The game comes with 24 cards (22-24 for advanced play only), and each card in the game has a unique power to aid or hamper the deduction.<br/><br/>During the game, players will hold two cards in their hand and choose one to play on their turn. After resolving any relevant effects, the next player will take their turn. The players win if the Detective is successfully used to find the Murderer, or the Murderer is passed to the Confidant. The players lose if the Murderer kills the Witness, or if the deck runs out of cards.<br/><br/>",

You each have a dueling block, showing peace or war.

        "description": "Mint Control is the newest entry into the Mint Series line of games. Mint Control is designed by the same designer as Mint Works and Mint Delivery as a deep strategy meets ease-of-play area control game that fits in your pocket, teaches in under a minute and plays in 30! It expands the world of these games such that these candy companies are now starting to vie for control.<br/><br/>Each player has five influence tokens that are placed onto buildings (that represent presence and potentially control).  The first person to play all influence tokens ends the game.  For each location, the player who has control of that location (determined by having more influence tokens than each other player), earns the victory points associated with that location (represented by stars in the top-right corner).  During play, if a player has presence on a card, they can use the actions on the cards by paying their cost.  These are effects like: kicking other players out of a location, taking more mints, and placing influence tokens.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game's theme is fairly unique: you are trying to assemble a full staff of personnel (two secretaries, two salesmen, one sales manager, one vice-president and one president) to run your company.  The problem is there aren't enough available in total for more than one company to achieve that goal.  You win by assembling a full staff and making it safely around to a New Fiscal Year (the &quot;Go&quot; square, in other words).<br/><br/>As you move about the (bilingual, two-sided) board, you'll have opportunities to hire or raid competing companies.  You must decide how much to pay your people --not enough and they'll switch companies, too much and your company will go bankrupt.  Managing your money is an important aspect of the game but it isn't the victory condition.<br/><br/>Amusingly, the early editions had all-female secretaries and all-male higher personnel; later editions kept the illustrations but shuffled them throughout the positions.<br/><br/>From Waddington ad: &quot;Ulcers is the big business game that recognizes an important business fact: PEOPLE are among a company's most valuable assets. And people are why executives get ULCERS. Suppose you had to form a company and had to hire a staff of executives, managers,salesmen and secretaries. You probably think it would be easy but it isn't. ULCRES puts you in the owners chair. You form the company, hire the staff and you try to keep them.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The active player rolls a die (numbered 3,4,5,5,6,6) and moves the corresponding number of fields forward in a straight line. The engine may be turned by 90 degrees at the end of the move. If s/he doesn't want to use up all the die's points, s/he can decide to go slower. For that, s/he gets the difference in coal coins, but must distribute them in any way among the other players (who may beg, bribe or threaten the active player). Passing another engine costs one coal, passing an engine going in the opposite direction (with more than four players, the starting positions are on both ends of the track) costs 2 coals, and getting rid of an obstacle piece and placing it anywhere else on the track costs 4 coals. <br/>For crossing the finish lines, the players may pay any number of coals and add that number to their final die roll; they can also do one turn within their turn - but only if they can actually cross the line. The first player to do so, wins. In case of a tie, the remaining coal is the tiebreaker.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to nurture and (mis-)educate your own child as badly as possible, while helping other players children to become good kids.<br/><br/>The Game is played in 3 phases with 4 rounds in every phase. Every phase represents a development stage of your kid (toddler, school kid, teenager).<br/><br/>Every player gets one illustrated kid card in the beginning. There are 4 values printed on the kid (they stand for health, freedom, love and success).<br/>Every player tries to bring his kid up as badly as possible by laying transparent upbringing cards with negative values on his kid. Only the visible numbers count in the end. Other players can interfere with defense cards or by laying positive upbringing cards on your kid.<br/><br/>There are 3 different types of cards: Upbringing cards to lay on your or other kids, defense cards and action cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the maze expands, can you be the first to reach the exit?  Players start in the middle of a maze.  Every turn a player picks a tile and connects it with the tiles already on the table and then moves his/her pawn if desired or possible.  Players attempt to keep their paths open and to block or trap their opponents with strategic placement of the wall tiles.  After the fourth exterior corner tile has been placed, tiles may be replaced as well as placed, and the exit tile is shuffled into the draw pile.  The first player to the exit tile when it appears scores zero points.  Every other player gets points depending on how far their pawn is when the exit is reached by anyone.  The fewest points after a number of rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The only board game to receive the Top Toy 2008 award from Toy Directory Monthly!

        "description": "Premiering at Essen 2001, a game of gold digging and city building. Players take turns revealing event, resource and bandit cards from the deck. After the events are resolved, the players bid for the resources. Then the active player uses his action points and resources to acquire building permits, acquire tools or erect buildings which differ in their resource costs and advantages conferred. Bandits may also be used to further the player's goal, but may backfire if the dice are not friendly. Then players engage in a subgame somewhat akin to Blackjack -- but with a greater range of results -- to distribute gold useful for the next auction. What's tricky is to take in more gold diggers than anyone else, but not to take so many that the ensuing brawl wipes out all of the profits. The eventual winner is the player who has managed to construct the best set of buildings with bonuses for achieving multiple buildings of the same type. This player is elected Mayor of Goldrush City.<br/><br/>Created by the designer of Strand-Cup.<br/><br/>",

Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.<br/><br/>",

All players keep the cards in their hands and pass one card to the player on their right until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand.<br/><br/>Each player takes one card from his hand and places it face down on the table in front of the player to his right. As soon as all players have put down a card, each player picks up the card passed to him from the player on his left (a command e.g. &quot;now&quot; may also be given for this). This procedure is repeated until one of the players has 5 identical cards in his hand. When this happens, the player in question puts his hand down on the table and calls &quot;Dingo&quot;. As soon as the other players hear the word &quot;Dingo&quot;, they must put their hands on top of the calling player&acute;s hand as quickly as possible. The last player to put his hand down must give one of his chips to the winner (the hand at the bottom).<br/><br/>The game continues until the conditions agreed at the beginning of the game are fulfilled, or the player with the highest number of chips is the overall winner.<br/><br/>",

There are two levels of play, Apprentice and Executive, to ease younger players into the mechanics.<br/><br/>Apprentice Game<br/><br/>You start the game with a set of brand cards (one per brand category per player) which are shuffled and dealt to you. You are also given 50 million and the youngest player starts. You place your chosen playing piece on the board (you can start anywhere) and move the number you spin with the arrow in the centre of the board.  Each time you land on a coloured square you collect two more brand cards of that colour, or one if the board instructs you. Once you have three or more of a coloured brand you can announce a launch of your company. The person to your right shuffles the risky business cards, turning the cards over one at a time, so you can judge how much you will risk without getting a BUST! card. You then multiply the money by the number of brand cards you launched with. No takeover or newsflash cards are used.<br/><br/>Executive Rules<br/><br/>Add in the newsflash cards for a chance, which could be good or bad (named brands will change in value), and you have a game with a greater element of risk. These rules differ as you now have the chance when you land on the takeover spots on the board to pick up a takeover disc. The next time one of your competitors launches a company you can attempt a takeover. Adding the total of your brand cards, plus any additional 'on the up' brands, plus a spin of the central spinner. If you beat the opponent you win all their cards but be careful if you lose they launch their company with more brands and therefore can earn more money.<br/><br/>",

This is done until each player has placed 5 tiles. This makes up the playing board.<br/><br/>Each player then receives 8 cards from the card deck. Cards come in 4 flavors. World cards, which are not shuffled into the deck, have info about each world tile. The player who owns that tile takes the card for reference. Character cards have a base strength, class and a home world indicator. They can be played to a tile that you own as defense against attack. If they are played to their home world their strength is doubled. Scroll cards can be placed on worlds and used by characters that can wield magic. These cards boost the base strength. Artifact cards can be used by any character. They boost strength and sometimes have special powers.<br/><br/>Each player picks a world tile to be his home and places 5 of their 8 cards there to defend it. Players also have a pawn that represents their army.<br/><br/>During a turn a player first draws 3 cards from the deck.<br/><br/>Second a player may play up to 2 cards. These cards can be played from his hand to a controlled world, from a controlled world to another controlled world or from a controlled world to his hand.<br/><br/>Third a player may move his pawn 1 or 2 worlds. If he enters a world controlled by another player he must stop.<br/><br/>Although not stated in the rules I would assume if a pawn is in a world not claimed by another player he could claim the world and play cards there. If a pawn is in a world occupied by another player you would then have a battle. A battle is fought between the cards on the tile as defense and the cards from the attacking players hand. Calls from allies can be made and other players can contribute to the battles as well.<br/><br/>The first player to control 8 worlds wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stop is a variation of Uno, with players trying to empty their hand of cards by playing onto a discard pile by matching the color or number of the card on top of the pile. Stop also includes a few special cards and rules to tweak the gameplay and differentiate it:<br/><br/><br/>     6s and 9s are considered to be identical, so a 6 can be played on a 9 regardless of the color and vice versa.<br/>     If a player has a number card identical in color to the top card, she may play it out of turn onto the discard stack.<br/>     An exchange card allows the player playing it to have everyone give their cards to their left- or right-hand neighbor.<br/>     The +X card forces the next player to draw the top card of the deck and add it to her hand. If it's a number card, she must also draw that many cards.<br/>     The +2 card forces the next player to draw two cards and skip her turn &ndash; unless she also plays a +2 in which case the next player must draw four cards, etc.<br/>     A skip card skips the next player.<br/>     A stop card, which is numbered 0, can prevent the action of an exchange, +X, +2 or skip card played by the previous player.<br/><br/><br/>When a player runs out of cards, the other players score points based on the cards they still have in hand. After multiple rounds, the game ends if a player has 500 or more points; the player with the fewest points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ninjutsu: Battle of the Ninjas, the players assume the role of ninjas and move across the board, trying to find the opposing Soke (Grandmaster of the Ninjutsu school) and defeat him. The ninjas succeed by the clever use of special dice, exciting action cards, and real ninja stars. Fight in the dojo and defeat the opposing warriors with ninja dice! A mix of strategy, action and luck decides which ninjas will claim victory in the end!<br/><br/>This game is reminiscent of Stratego. The game is played on a 5x8 board. Each player has fifteen ninjas: nine 1-star ninjas, five 2-star ninjas, and one Soke.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player places his ninjas on the three rows on his side of the board, in any formation he likes. The type of ninja (Soke, 2-star or 1-star) is hidden from the opponent.<br/>Each turn, a player has zero to three moves; the exact amount is determined at random, using so-called weapon cards. He can use these moves to move one or more ninjas. If he moves a ninja into a square occupied by an opponent, a battle ensues. Each player rolls a die for his ninja. Higher level ninjas roll better dice: a 1-star ninja rolls a six-sided die, a 2-star ninja rolls an eight-sided die and a Soke rolls a twelve sided die. The ninja whose owner rolls the highest defeats the opposing ninja, which is removed from the game.<br/><br/>The players can further influence the game by means of five action cards, which give special bonuses, and ninja stars, which allow a player to reroll his combat die.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the year of our Lord 1603. The Uskok Warlord Radoslav died during the last Venetian raid. All the Uskok leaders, including you, were invited to Nehaj, the unconquerable Uskok fortress, in order to choose their next Warlord.<br/><br/>Dark storm clouds loomed over the stone fortress, its walls battered by the bitter nothern gales, and yet the Uskok leaders could not come to an agreement. Mighty warriors though they were, none of them had proved to be enough to their comrades, so no Warlord had been chosen. As midnight struck, the debate was cut short by a shot from a flintlock. The hall went silent. The old sea dog Stipe spoke: &quot;According to ancient customs, if no agreement is reached by midnight, the title of Warlord shall go to the first lord who collects enough loot to fill twenty-five Uskok vessels.&quot; So it was written, and so it was done.<br/><br/>Uskoci were a historical pirate band in the 16th century who lived and prospered by being a nuisance for much more powerful opponents, but never on such a scale to provoke full-scale retaliation. Uskoci: The card game of Croatian pirates takes that idea of heart as players need to demonstrate both their skill as a pirate and restraint comparable to the historical Uskoci to prove the best captain among your peers.<br/><br/>In the basic game, players must combine treasures (valued 1-9) on their pile until they total exactly 25; what makes this difficult are the 14 event cards (Venetians, traitors, storms) that can mess with a player's plans or change the value of a treasure, but thankfully they can also protect you. The more complex game adds card drafting to the mix, with the player who has the least treasure on the table drafting the most cards.<br/><br/>The rules in both games are for 3-6 players, with modifications that allow two players to go head-to-head.<br/><br/>",

These Keys get placed in your Ladder of Success (in any order), and if you're the first player to fill your ladder, you win. So thematically, it's neat, but what I most remember about it are the various &quot;no dice&quot; movement systems.<br/><br/>All players start with their pieces &quot;clicked in&quot; to a spinner in the middle of the board, which, when spun, randomly puts each player in front of one of the six paths. On your turn, you can get off and attempt that path, or spin again, possibly rearranging you - and everyone else.<br/><br/>Each path has its own movement system. A few of them are flip-a-tiles, with each tile set having movement from 1-5 on them. Health has a bicycle theme, with one wheel being the tiles and the other wheel being the discard pile. Self Improvement tiles were books in a bookcase.<br/><br/>The Love path has an arrow-through-a-heart spinner, with the arrow pointing to your movement, 1-4. Two other paths also have themed spinners.<br/><br/>But the coolest of them was the Friendship path. The Hand of Friendship is a seesaw hand with a little marble in the &quot;wrist&quot; and when you seesaw it, the marble &quot;pachinko's&quot; into one of the five fingers, each having a different movement number 1-5.<br/><br/>When you finish a path - and they have text on some of the squares (&quot;start over&quot; &quot;get a hang-up&quot; &quot;move forward&quot; etc.) - you click back in to the spinner and hope you land on the next path you need.<br/><br/>",

As the cat leaps into your lap, your nose starts to itch!  Your friend laughs at you mischievously.<br/><br/>The object of Sneeze is to match Sneeze cards to your opponents&rsquo; allergies and make them sneeze.<br/><br/>If you sneeze too much, you&rsquo;re out!<br/><br/>Players each start with one Sneeze card as an Allergy.  On your turn you place a sneeze card into either the upwind pool (which will make people sneeze immediately) or the downwind pool (which is safe until the wind changes).<br/><br/>If all of your allergy cards are matched by cards in the upwind pool then you sneeze, that pool clears, you draw another allergy card and both you and the player who made you sneeze draw an 'And Now' (event) card.  These can be played on your turn instead of flipping an allergy card to effect the course of the game (e.g. you hold your breath to avoid sneezing, or play a 'mean trick' to double the effect of one of the cards than an opponent is allergic to).<br/><br/>When a player with four allergies sneezes they are out--at that point the game switches to 'sudden death' with any player who sneezes being eliminated.<br/><br/>This is clearly a kids game, but with a few twists of strategy to keep everybody interested, especially around management of 'And Now' cards, and preparing for the switch into the sudden death end game.<br/><br/>",

You mark points by visiting the most monuments possible. To win, it will constantly be necessary to try and arrive at a balance between your desire to travel alone and go quickly, so you can get to as many points of interest as you can, and the budgetary constraint that will force you at one time or another to share the leather bench of your taxi with other noisy tourists!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board is a map of the world divided into 6 areas each having 4 harbours. Each player owns a ship.<br/><br/>The game proceeds in two phases. <br/>In the first phase the object is to trade and acquire wealth as quickly as possible. To that purpose, each player sails from harbour to harbour: in a harbour a commodity can be bought [wheat  - gold - wood - cloth - wool - fruit] &ndash; in some harbours no goods can be bought.<br/>Sailing can be short distance &ndash; form harbour to harbour which are connected by dotted lines or long distance using a &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; card.<br/>Selling goods can take place in any harbour &ndash; player rolls the dice which determines which good can be sold &ndash; always at three times the cost.<br/>Using a &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; card a player can organise a storm in one of the six areas forcing the ships in that area to leave behind their goods in the harbour &ndash; available for the next ship that visits the harbour.<br/>The ships will return again using the dice as this determines to which area the ship will return &ndash; player can choose the harbour.<br/>When 2 ships are going to the same harbour the 2 captains need to fight each other using &ldquo;Squabble&rdquo; cards damaging the opponent more and more [pretty funny descriptions]. The loser of the fight looses his money.<br/>However, cards played do NOT return so there&rsquo;s limited supply. And you will definitely need some of these later in the game.<br/><br/>The second phase starts as soon as a player is rich enough to acquire the corsair ship &ndash; the corsair ship is auctioned with a minimum cost. The player will then try to eliminate all of his or her adversaries. The dice decides in which area the Corsair ship starts. On the turn of the player &ldquo;owning&rdquo; the Corsair ship he can sail 3 steps &ndash; as opposed to the other players who can only sail to the next harbour. The &ldquo;Long Course&rdquo; cards are very valuable now.<br/>When the Corsair ship catches a player&rsquo;s ship that&rsquo;s the end of it: goods return to the bank and the owner of the Corsair gets the money. The Corsair ship has done its job and returns to the bank &ndash; available for another player to buy it.<br/>The Corsair ship is sensitive to the &ldquo;Storm&rdquo; cards and will sink.<br/><br/>The winner is the one remaining player.<br/><br/>The rules are simple, but the characters are limited in what he/she can do each turn. Also all eliminated players have to wait until there&rsquo;s a winner and are no longer participating in the game.<br/><br/>",

The battles at Tarawa and Saipan are depicted on separate game maps and use two separate game systems. Although the Fresno Gaming Association was probably guilty of plagiarism in some of their game designs, their graphic presentation was always first class and this game is no exception.<br/><br/>The Island Battle of Saipan uses the system that FGA previously used in their OPERATION CRUSADER game. This is basically a traditional Ugo - Igo system. On the Saipan map, each hex is 1.8 miles across and a Game Turn equals one day of actual time.<br/><br/>The Island Battle of Tarawa is a tactical-level game covering the invasion of Betio Island, part of the Tarawa atoll. This is a two map introductory level game using a game system called STS (Simple Tactical System) that Fresno Gaming Association claimed as their own. The STS is a pseudo-simultaneous-movement system. First one player moves a stack, or performs combat with a stack, and then his opponent does the same. The first player then repeats this with another stack, etc. The Game Turn continues according to the Sequence of Play until chance ends the Turn. That is determined by combat die rolls. Each hex on the Tarawa map represents 35 yards from hexside to opposite hexside and a Game Turn represents 2 hours.<br/><br/>9&quot; x 12&quot; x 2&quot; bookcase style game box; <br/>16-page (8?&quot; x 11&quot;) Rules booklet; <br/>two 22&quot; x 34&quot; unmounted game maps; <br/>17&quot; x 22&quot; unmounted game map; <br/>960 die-cut, back-printed, unpunched, cardboard counters; <br/>five card-stock Player Aids; and <br/>a 10-sided die.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players sail their canoe down the River Ombo trying to get the most 'stick' currency. On a player's turn everyone secretly chooses a number of sticks and then reveals them. The total number of sticks determines the number of spaces the player must move. Many of the spaces make the player lose sticks or gain sticks. At the end of the river a player chooses to take 10 sticks or to 'double' his canoe causing all event spaces to double their effect on the next journey down the river.<br/>Players must use bluff and guesswork to try to land on the good spaces and avoid the pirate spaces. The first player to get 80 sticks wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Metro City is redeveloping an old industrial district for mixed use (residential, commercial and industrial) and the mayor is offering bonuses to two developers for aesthetic completion of key streets. Can you win greater bonuses than your competitor by strategically building homes, offices, stores, courthouses, parks and malls in ways that upset your opponent&rsquo;s plans for the city?<br/><br/>The city district is a 6 x 5 grid with 11 named streets. Each street has a mayor's bonus associated with it, from $1 to $15, drawn randomly at the start of the game. Players try to develop each street better than their opponent to claim its bonus.<br/><br/>Each player keeps a hand of 5 Building tiles out of 20 available to them. When placing a tile on an empty city block, if the tile completes a street (a row or column) they compare the value of their Buildings on the street to their opponent's Buildings to determine who wins the bonus. A straightforward comparison simply involves adding the number of each tile: Residential Buildings count from 1 to 5, Commercial Buildings count from 2 to 6 and Industrial Buildings count from 3 to 7. However, four types of special tiles change how the bonus is determined: a Park or Mall prevents either player's Industrial Buildings from counting towards the bonus on a street; a Power Plant or Mall prevents Residential Buildings from counting towards the bonus. Finally, the Courthouse allows the player to switch the bonuses of two streets.<br/><br/>Instead of placing a tile on an empty block, a player can discard a Currency token and build over a block they have already developed.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most money wins, and earns a key to the city from the mayor!<br/><br/>",

For each resource field on the spinner, three colors of settlements are shown. These colors will produce the resource in question for all players when the spinner lands there.

The game comes with several chunky wooden fish in three different colors, with three of each color of fish, each having a different design on them consisting of either squares, circles, or triangles.<br/><br/>On each turn, someone rolls the two special dice. One die has colored faces, and the other die has shapes. Players look at the die roll and quickly grab the matching fish from the table! For example, if blue and square is rolled, you would want to grab the blue fish with squares on it.<br/><br/>However, if a player already has the matching fish in his play area, the players yell &quot;Splash Attack!&quot; and grab the red piranha. If the player that already had the matching fish is the first to do this, he gets to permanently keep the fish as a point. If a different player is quickest, however, the player loses the fish back to the center of the table. Thus, you must be the quickest to react to a matching pattern twice in a row to score. The first player to score three fish wins!<br/><br/>",

Carefully gather materials to create unique items that are needed to execute escape plans. Each item has a special ability which will help you along the way. But be careful as you collect items from rooms around the prison as the guards can catch you!<br/><br/>Summary of play in six steps:<br/><br/>Step 1: Roll and Place Prisoner Dice<br/><br/>A player begins his turn by rolling a six sided die. Depending on the value rolled he must then place that die on a placement card that is less than or equal to that value. Since there can only be one die per placement there is a possibility that he will be unable to place his die due to another player being there or that space being patrolled by a guard, if that is the case he will temporarily lose that die.<br/><br/>Step 2: Take Action on Placement Card<br/><br/>After landing on a placement card the player then takes the action associated with that card. Some placements will allow you to collect materials while others let you steal from other players.<br/><br/>Step 3: Use Material Cards to Craft Items<br/><br/>Anytime during a players turn they may take two material cards to create a crafted item. Each crafted item has a special ability which helps throughout the game. Some crafted items will alter dice rolls while others make it easier to escape.<br/><br/>Step 4: Gather the Items for an Escape Plan<br/><br/>There will be a handful of escape plans that are available for everyone to utilize. Use the escape plans available as a guide on what combination of crafted items you should be creating. Once you have collected the required items needed (2-4 depending on the type of escape plan) you can execute that escape.<br/><br/>Step 5: Execute an Escape Plan<br/><br/>In order to successfully escape the player must draw the required success cards needed (Depending on the type of escape plan) one by one. This number is indicated on the escape plan. You may back out at any time but if you fail then you will lose all the items you used during that attempt.<br/><br/>Step 6: Escape with Two Prisoners<br/><br/>The first player to escape with two prisoners wins the game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Machiavellian game of media rivalry, Media Mogul thrusts players into the role of international tycoons seeking to spread their own operations over the globe.<br/><br/>Winning over audiences with your television, radio and newspaper media with quality content is a key element, but it won't directly bring you victory. Lucrative advertising contracts are needed for you to profit from your media operations, but they bore and repel your audiences, requiring you to balance profit and sustainability at all times<br/><br/>Each turn is divided in multiple phases: the business phase, the media phase, the advertising phase, the boredom phase and the mogul phase.<br/><br/>In the business phase, players must select two actions to branch out into new media outlets, break into new continents and secure advertising contracts. They may purchase a media outlet, draw a media card, invest in their outlets or confirm advertising contracts. Once every player has chosen two actions, the process is repeated twice more. In the media phase, players bid for the attention of patrons on different continents and receive awards according to their global and specific media performance on each continent. Bids are made using permanent content bought for each player's office in the first phase (investment) and temporary content from media cards. To maintain an outlet, players must meet minimum content requirements. In the advertising phase, players earn revenue through advertising from patrons they've attracted. In the boredom phase, players lose patrons from their office according to a pre-determined pattern found on the turn order track. In the mogul phase, the turn order marker is advanced, face up cards are changed and the leading mogul marker is passed to the next player.<br/><br/>The game ends once the media deck has run out twice or if the turn marker reaches the end of the turn track. The winner is the player with the greatest media value.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The premise is quite simple: jump out of airplanes and get your guys to land as close to the coast as possible. The closer you are to the coast, the more points you score. If you splash down into the water, however, you will score negative points. The further from the shore you are in the water, the more negative points you will suffer. <br/>The board depicts a section of land, followed by a beach and ocean. There is a lake on one space of the land section, and a one-space island in the ocean. The board also has two 'landing' tracks running parallel to each other. The tokens are placed on these tracks once they have leapt from the planes. Finally, the board also has a scoring track to tabulate the points ultimately scored following a round, as well as a cumulative scoring track which runs the perimeter of the board.<br/><br/>Each player loads his or her tokens (which vary with the number of players) into the two airplanes. There are four rows of seats in the airplanes, and where your tokens are positioned will be important when considering the timing of your jumps. Players then each receive six cards plus one 'jump' card. These cards dictate the actions that will occur during the turn. Most of the cards move one of the planes (red or yellow) forward or backward a certain number of spaces. Other cards allow a player to switch seats in or between the planes, cancel any jump attempts that round or blow a jumper off course a space. Finally, the jump card causes one of the player's token to leap from the plane and land on the space directly below where he was seated.<br/><br/>The mechanics are quite simple. Each player lays a card face down, and then all reveal their cards simultaneously. Beginning with the start player (which rotates each round), each player carries out the action his card depicts. However, if a player reveals a 'jump' card, then opponents who played a 'wind' or 'cancel jump' card must reveal them, taking the appropriate action. The 'wind' card can be disastrous, as that player gets to bump the jumper one space up or down. This may have the effect of landing the jumper in the water. Cards played are discarded, with the exception of the 'jump' card, which is retrieved back into the player's hand.<br/><br/>When a token leaps from a plane (due to the play of a 'jump' card), he is placed on the outside track of the landing track. If another token leaps into the same space, it is placed along the inside track. Any other tokens that land on that same space are shoved back to the next empty space on the landing track. This can result in a scoring reduction if the token is being moved further from the coast, but can also be a positive occurrence if this causes the token to be moved onto the land as opposed to falling into the water.<br/><br/>Play continues until all tokens have jumped from the planes. They are then moved one-by-one to the scoring track, beginning with the token furthest from the shore. There is a positive scoring track for those tokens that were fortunate enough to land on solid ground, and a negative scoring track for those jumpers who splashed into the water. The more tokens that successfully landed on the ground, the more points the players closest to the shore will score. The converse is also true!<br/><br/>Once all tokens have been repositioned onto the scoring tracks, each player tallies his final results and these are marked on the cumulative scoring track. This entire process is then repeated two more times and the player with the most cumulative points following the third round is victorious.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to arrive in Anchorage with the most money, which is found through panning for gold, visiting gold mines, and other events along the way. Hazards that players encounter during game play duplicate some of the real-life problems motorists may face driving to Alaska's largest city, such as icy roads, landslides, bears, and everybody's favorite, a boarded-up gas station in the middle of nowhere. <br/>Solid production values here, with some colorful cartoon-style graphics on the Encounter Cards and game board. There's a prospector's &quot;poke&quot; containing some exquisite pewter playing pieces (a la &quot;Monopoly&quot;) that include a moose, a jeep, a bush plane, and a dog sled, among others. The game has plenty of &quot;Yukon Sam Bucks&quot; provided in various denominations, along with a handy storage tray, and is topped off with a pair of substantial dice and a &quot;Rainbow Road/Pan For Gold&quot; spinner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In December 1805, Emperor Napoleon I led about 67,000 men against about 75,000 Russian and Austrian troops near Brunn (modern Brno) in Bohemia, part of today&rsquo;s Czech Republic. The battlefield, divided by hills and streams, became known as Austerlitz and would be celebrated as Napoleon&rsquo;s greatest victory.<br/><br/>After fierce fighting amid the morning mists, the sun broke through the clouds. The French stormed the key Pratzen Heights, and after a bloody bayonet fight with the Russian troops manning the lines forced the Allied army into a disorganized retreat.<br/><br/>The 34&quot;x22&quot; map features not hexagons but irregular-sized areas which relate to the actual topography of the area being depicted.  198 counters in two sizes (2/3&quot; square and 1 and 1/3&quot;x2/3&quot; long pieces) depict the infantry, cavalry, artillery units and the leaders so necessary in this activation system; the better leaders activate their troops more readily and more often.<br/><br/>This is a new rules set , bearing some resemblance to the earlier Napoleonic games by Avalanche Press, but also borrowing from their War of the States and Rome At War series.<br/><br/>",

(This much, at least, is true...)<br/><br/>In the game world of Banditos, the Mexican people responded poorly to these changes, resulting in a decrease in effective security and an increase in creative accounting at the new Banco de Mexico. Once some of the &quot;alternatively principled&quot; people in the land of opportunity heard about this, they looked south of the border for their ventures.<br/><br/>You will play one of several American characters making runs into Mexico to pull bank heists. You will need to acquire vehicles, weapons, seed money, and maybe even some inside information to make it all happen.<br/><br/>The first player to get his character home with the equivalent of one million US dollars wins.<br/><br/>Players can acquire cards (vehicles etc.) by drawing them each turn, by buying them from other players, or by stealing them from the discard pile.<br/><br/>Doing anything deemed illegal, however, will bring &quot;heat&quot; to your character (if you steal from the discard pile or pull a heist,) or your vehicle (if you steal gas or pull a heist,) or Mexican cities (if you pull a heist.) <br/>It's up to you as a player to manage your risk and decide how desperate you are to acquire what you need versus how much heat you currently have.<br/><br/>If you have the guts to try a risky heist, it'll either pay off or you'll land in a Mexican jail and have to play catch-up.<br/><br/>",

One is based on reflexes, the other one on memory. In the first variant there are 3 different pizzas on the table. Each pizza shows different ingredients on it. The ingredient tiles are placed face down on the table and flipped face up one by one by each player. When the players flip face up the whole set of ingredients for one of the pizza they have smash this pizza with a hand. Whoever touch it first, gains it as a point. The player who scores 3 points is the winner.<br/><br/>In the second variant the ingredient tiles are also put face down on the table, but each player has his own pizza. Now each player can filp ingredient tile face up one after another as long as the ingredients match to those in his pizza. When he encounters wrong ingredient, he has to flip all the face up tiles face down, and the next player proceeds. When one of the players finds all the ingredients he need, he wins this round. The first player to win 3 rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

If you want to become the Grand Alchemist you must gather the necessary components in order to create the magical formula. You must also study in the great European cities to increase your alchemical knowledge. But beware! The Grand Inquisitor is hunting you, and other alchemist scheme against you. Be the first to discover the secret and transmute common metal into gold.<br/><br/>General Mechanics:<br/>You control an alchemist and two apprentices. They will move around a map of Europe to various cities and gather knowledge cards. Getting a certain number allows you to attempt a transmutation. Keep the location of your secret lab from the Grand Inquisitor and other players to avoid going to trial (jail) and losing knowledge cards. Event cards in the game allow you to search, protect yourself, move further, steal from other players, take shortcuts, increase your strength in a fight, etc. The final objective is to successfully complete enough transmutations to collect 5 bars of gold.<br/><br/>",

During the game set-up, six differently-colored crystals are hidden underneath six temples placed on the board. An additional eight crystals are laid out on the game board, with four types of golden treasures on display as well, one type in each corner. On a turn, the player rolls the die and gets one of two results:<br/><br/>&bull; If the die shows one or two colors and the player has a crystal matching one of these colors, then she can move up to two spaces on the board. If she lacks a matching crystal, she picks up a temple and secretly looks inside: if the crystal inside the temple matches, she reveals it, moves her figure up to two spaces, then sets the temple down again, possibly in a new location; if the crystal doesn't match, she replaces the temple and doesn't move.<br/><br/>&bull; If the die shows a mummy, the player moves her token up to three spaces and moves the mummy three spaces around the outer edge of the board. Any player caught by the mummy leaves a golden treasure (or a crystal if no treasure is held) in that space, then returns to start. The mummy and token movement can be done in either order.<br/><br/>Land on a crystal or golden treasure that you don't have, and you can claim it. Collecting crystals helps you move more consistently, and collecting treasures is how you win the game. The rules include a few variants for mummy movement and crystal power.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Amigo: Be the fastest one to get the right lucky charm! But which lucky charm is the right one: mushroom, pig or chimney sweep? Your personal lucky number will tell you. You need luck and talent to gather the most cards of all players.<br/><br/>START OF PLAY<br/>Three target cards are placed in the middle of the table. Each player must be able to reach them well with both his hands. The remaining 63 cards (symbol and touch cards) are shuffled and this deck is placed face down on the table. One player is chosen to be the starting player.<br/><br/>The Lucky Number<br/>Now each player receives one or more lucky numbers. The starting player places the face down deck in front of him on the table. He reveals the topmost card in such a way that everyone can see it at the same time. The revealed card is either a symbol or a touch card.<br/><br/>A symbol card shows one to eight small &quot;lucky mushrooms&quot; (blue), &quot;lucky pigs&quot; (yellow) and chimney sweeps (red) in different combinations and in the color of the target cards. When a symbol card is revealed, each player has to find out, how often a symbol is found on the symbol card. If the number of one symbol equals the lucky number of a player he tries to draw the appropriate target card as quickly as possible towards him.<br/><br/>For each target card a player has successfully drawn he receives a card from the deck. These cards are placed in front of the player. If a player draws (touching counts as drawing) a card, which he was not allowed to draw (e.g. because he miscounted the symbols) he has to put three of his own cards in the jackpot, for each card he has drawn wrongly. If he has less than three cards, all of them have to go into the jackpot.<br/><br/>The jackpot is a collection of cards (maximum five). It is placed near the target cards. If there are at any time more than five cards in the jackpot, the surplus cards are shuffled back into the deck before revealing the topmost card. At the start of play there is no jackpot.<br/><br/>After the first player has given a card from the deck to each player who has correctly drawn a target card, the target cards are placed back in the middle of the table. The revealed card is placed in the jackpot as are all the cards the players have lost.<br/><br/>If a touch card is revealed, quick reactions are called for. Each player tries to touch the matching target card with both his hands, placing one after the other. This will create a huge pile of hands, sometimes in wildly mixed order. The target card remains in the middle of the table. A touch card shows a big &quot;lucky mushroom&quot;, a big &quot;lucky pig&quot; or a big &quot;chimney sweep&quot;.<br/><br/>Whoever is the first to have only one hand of another player between his two hands (e.g. there are not two or more hands between his two hands (the sandwich)) receives the revealed touch card and the jackpot.<br/><br/>After the starting player has given the touch card and the jackpot to the winner, this round is finished.<br/><br/>If there are not enough cards in the deck to give to all players the cards they won, The game ends immediately. The player with the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take on the role of a thief attempting to obtain priceless treasures and outdo their fellow gentleman and lady burglars. Two to five players take turns picking locks to steal valuable items from the vault or each other. The thief with the most treasures at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Each treasure obtained puts you closer to winning. However, each treasure has a special negative effect that makes your collection vulnerable. Steal wisely, certain combinations of treasures in your possession could make it easier for other thieves to steal from you.<br/><br/>The main mechanic of Pick the Lock has a small amount of wit and a lot of luck. Players attempt to steal treasures from each other or the vault by using one of their five number cards. These cards are numbered four through eight. When played they define the odds of success during your attempt to steal a treasure. The defending player sets the combination of the lock to his or her vault by placing a card face down that is from 1 to the number the attacking player has played. Using the right cards with the right treasure effects could ensure your victory. Pick the Lock combines a nice blend of strategy, wit, and luck. Are you clever enough to outwit your friends and Pick the Lock?<br/><br/>Pick the Lock is a Card game for 2-5 players ages 6 and up.<br/><br/>",

Each turn a player either lays one of 20 4&quot; square road tiles or rolls the die to move. If the die roll exceeds the number of tiles laid in front of the car, the move is forfeit.  Within the 20 road tiles there are 4 event tiles; 3 are road hazards, resulting in a lost turn,  and one is cheering crowd, giving an extra turn.  After the last road tile is placed a rectangular U-turn tile sends the cars back in the opposite direction over the laid out course.  No more than two cars can ever occupy a tile so the course can be blocked.  Cars moving in opposite directions do not block each other.

The colors correspond to different question categories.<br/><br/>The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors.

Bl&ouml;ff, is a bluffing card game along the lines of Cheat and Bullshit in which players take turns laying cards into a central stack and making claims about what they played. As long as the next person in line doesn't call their bluff, they're off the hook!<br/><br/>To start a round, each player receives a hand of 5-12 cards, depending on the number of players; cards range in value from -2 to 7, with a handful of special cards also being present. A limit card shows a 7, with players playing clockwise. On a player's turn, he lays one card face-down on the table, adds the number on that card to the sum announced by the previous player (if any), then announces the new sum; the player can play any card and state any sum, as long as it's not higher than seven. The next player has the option of playing a card (under the same circumstances) or calling the previous player's claim. If he does this, reveal all of the cards and sum them, with action cards counting as zero. If the claimed sum is correct, the doubter draws two cards from the deck and starts the next round; if not, the previous player draws two cards &mdash; even if he played honestly on his turn. As soon as you make a claim, you're responsible for what everyone played before you!<br/><br/>Actions cards can be played face-up for their action, and they allow you to give one card from your hand to another player, force someone to draw two cards, force an opponent to play her next numbered card face-up, or change the direction of play while simultaneously flipping the limit card; when first flipped, the limit changes to 5 and players must now abide by that limit.<br/><br/>The deck also contains three gloating &quot;Larry&quot; cards, and if one or three Larrys are in the central stack, then a player's claim of a sum is always correct!<br/><br/>When a player runs out of cards, the next player can doubt the total or let it stand. the player who went out scores 2 points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of little Larry symbols on cards still in their hand. After three rounds, the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kitsune (pronounced kit-soo-nay) are Japanese fox-spirits, known for tricking unwary mortals. We come to know them through traditional tales, wherein they do this for many reasons: purely for fun, to devour mortals or steal their souls, and so on. But this card game is about kitsune who play tricks to punish mortal fools for their foolishness, sometimes teaching them a lesson in the process. By correcting mortal foolishness, the foxes earn their tails. Those who gain all nine tails of the mythical spirit fox earn their place among the kitsune elders.<br/><br/>This is a game of luck and tactics, where each player takes the role of a fox trying to earn his or her tails. Some cards represent the foxes; others, the tricks they can play in their schemes, the fools they must teach lessons to, and the consequences that befall foxes who fail. Suitable for ages 13 and up, Kitsune: of Foxes &amp; Fools is relatively family friendly, but does include some themes suggestive of violence, sexuality, drug use, and a few cards have mild rude language. It's about teaching lessons to profoundly foolish individuals, after all.<br/><br/>The box comes with 15 fox cards, 70 fool cards(35 uniques),100 tricks(40 uniques), 60 consequences(30 uniques), 70 double-sided fox-fire tokens, 70 tail tokens, 2 d10, and 1 rule booklet.<br/><br/>",

Moonstar (1981) added planets and variants<br/>(variant number 8 is Corona, without sand timer). <br/>'Harun' (1984) is not new game, it is a rethemed copy of Moonstar! <br/>'Orbit' (1993) a new variation including the Corona variations &amp; Harun.<br/>Finally, Randolph recycled most of the game into his 'Rasende Roboter' ('Ricochet Robots') (1999) , although the course mechanism and the objective were completely changed.<br/><br/>Quite possibly the first &quot;German&quot; game to cross the Atlantic...<br/><br/>About the game (from the back of the box)<br/><br/>Moonstar is a game unlike any other game for any number of people. All the action is governed by dice, yet there is no luck involved. The dice simply establish the situation. It is up to the players to act upon it. A game with endless variety.<br/><br/>Playable by any number of people, from one to a hundred, Moonstar combines numbers calculations, memory, and quick-thinking into a fast-playing, action-packed, exciting contest of pure skill.<br/><br/>The board represents the twelve constellations (stars) of the Zodiac and the playing pieces represent moons and planets. Each game consists of a number of rounds of play. In each round, the board and playing pieces are first setup by one of the players. Then the dice are thrown. A one-minute auction period begins. Each player may bid any number of times in the auction or not at all. Each bid, however, must be higher than the previous one. When the one-minute runs out, the highest bidder plays that round.<br/><br/>The play of the round also lasts one minute. A player plays a round by placing one die on each moon on the, board and then moving that moon (and die) a number of stars equal to the number of the die. The die is then removed and the moon may not be moved again. This procedure is followed for each moon. The player must move each moon before the time runs out, or those moons which have not been moved may not move.<br/><br/>The player's score is then totaled to see if he has made his bid, by scoring a number of points for each moon, depending on which stars and planets they have landed on, If a player makes his bid, he scores a number of points equal to his bid. If he fails, he scores nothing. Rounds are setup and played in this manner until one player has scored enough points to win.<br/><br/>But this is only the beginning. Moonstar is actually twelve games in one. Game One is simply the Basic Game. Games Two-Twelve each change one or more parts of Game One, or add something to it. They introduce things like challenging bids, side bets, more moons, more dice, different planet values, no planets. and advanced scoring methods.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>    16&quot; x 16&quot; gameboard<br/>    15 moon pieces<br/>    21 planet pieces<br/>    1 minute sand timer<br/>    11 6-sided dice<br/>    rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Corona<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Orbit<br/>    Ricochet Robots<br/><br/><br/>",

The aim is to win believers from each other and proof once and for all who really rules Christmas.. well until the next game that is.<br/><br/>The game starts with dividing into two teams and choosing who will be on Team Santa and who will be on Team Jesus. At this point team members will decide which character will represent them in the game. They can choose from the following characters:<br/><br/>Team Santa: Santa, Mrs. Claus, Rudolph, Prancer, Vixen or one of the elves: Sugarplum, Eggnog or Candy Cane.<br/><br/>Team Jesus: Jesus, Mary, Joseph, Angel Gabriel, Donkey or one of the three Wisemen: Myrr, Frank or Gold.<br/><br/>Once everyone has chosen their character they have to refer to each other by these names, if they don&rsquo;t and are called out by the opposing team they will lose a believer card.  Each team starts with 8 Believer cards. If less than 16 players are taking part all the remaining character cards will need to stay near as they will be used for certain challenges.<br/><br/>From this point on the game explains it self. The teams compete in challenges to prove to their believers that they are more worthy of their adulation than the other team. If they loose a challenge their believers will lose faith and they cross over to the opposing team. There are TEAM and VERSUS challenges. The challenges involve puzzles, riddles, knowledge-based quizzes, orientation games and many more.  You never know how you&rsquo;ll be challenged next.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is simple: turn as many mall shoppers as you can into zombies. Achieving your goal is not simple. Human Heroes attempt to put you down permanently and the roaming horde of your victims is trying to eat up your food supply.<br/><br/>We Are Dead is for 2-5 people ages 13+ and plays in about an hour.<br/><br/>Art for the game was done by two amazing artists, Mike Morris and Mike Collins. I cannot rave enough about how well they brought the vision for this game to life (or unlife).<br/><br/>Players take turns attempting to attack the mall shoppers trying to satisfy their recently unlocked hunger for humans. Players will use attack cards from their hands and infection tokens they receive to defeat heroes and turn the humans.<br/><br/>During other players' turns each opponent will have the opportunity to play hero cards in the hopes of stopping the player. This interaction during other players' turns reduces down time and keeps all players engaged in the game.<br/><br/>While players are busy with their own struggles, the horde grows from their victims. When the Horde! card appears the players must work together to make sure they do not all lose to the massive horde.<br/><br/>We Are Dead is easy to learn, but provides enough depth and random elements to allow for good replay-ability. The game uses a hand management mechanic with elements of co-op play and resource management that add layers of strategy to the game.<br/><br/>",

Players receive three heart chips and an attack die. The first player rolls the numbered die and moves Link a number of spaces as shown. When a player lands on a square, he/she turns over one of the tiles and does the following:<br/><br/>-A magic tile that is found is kept until the end of the game. Finding this tile also allows access to the next world.<br/><br/>-A monster tile is fought using everyone's attack die. The number of swords must be greater than or equal to the monster power shown on the tile. You can lose or gain hearts when fighting monsters.<br/><br/>Once in the 6th world, the magic tile is &quot;Triforce Princess Zelda&quot;. In order to keep the tile, the player must roll 4 swords and is able to reroll once if 2 or more swords are shown. If unsuccessful, the attempt is passed to the next player until someone succeeds.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, hearts are totalled, each magic tile being worth 1 heart and the Zelda tile worth 2.

The last piece is booby-trapped, so you need to run for you life to the entrance.<br/><br/>On your turn, you do 3 actions that are either:<br/>- Take one action card (reloading) of either ammo (to shoot), life (to protect) or energy (to move, open tile or rotate tile) cards.<br/>- Playing 1 or more action cards of the same sort (ammo, life or energy).<br/><br/>There is one tile of each card symbol, where you may reload 2 cards of the type. You can never have more than 7 cards.<br/><br/>The players score points by getting 1 point for each discovery tile and 2 or 3 points for either paintings or evidence, depending on which team they belong.<br/><br/>With 4 players, you play in teams. With 2 or 3 players you play individually with Lara on the 'good side' and 1 or 2 'bad guys' as opponents. If equal, then the winner is the one who gets the last point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battlecards are best decribed as a &quot;scratch-and-slay trading card game&quot; that preceded the popular Magic: The Gathering, and Pokémon Trading Card Game craze.<br/><br/>There were a great variety of cards arranged into types which included artist profiles, quests, tactics, advanced game rules, checklists, spells, and shields, but the main cards were Fighters.<br/><br/>Each Fighter card had a series of 25 silver scratch panels around its main central illustration to represent locations of the body. For the basic game, players take turns to make an attack by scratching away a panel of their rival to reveal the symbol underneath. When enough wound symbols were found, one of the fighter's 'life' panels would be uncovered and a skull symbol signified his defeat. The dead fighter card would then be given to the winning player who could use the card's 'purse' (an amount of gold listed in the corner) to purchase 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by mailing Merlin with gold equal to the price agreed on a Trading Post card. These are the rarer &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; edition of the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards.<br/><br/>Quest cards normally required collectors to study their cards carefully then send the correct ones to Merlin so they could claim a reward of gold. For example, to claim a token worth 100 gold, St. Charity's Quest required you to collect five men with no gold in their purses, which obviously required you to defeat them first. Lord Magnoble's quest was worth 200 gold if you identified the artists of the five unsigned pieces in his collection.<br/><br/>Two different series exist: the UK version and the US version. The US series had 139 cards in the basic series plus eight chase treasure cards (T1-T8). US #140 was the Emperor of Vangoria, not available in packs but redeemed by mailing in all 8 treasure cards (and effectively &quot;winning&quot; the game). The #140 card was available in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; chased versions like the 'Wondrous Treasure' cards by completing the Emperor quest using Gold and Silver 'Wondrous Treasure' cards. US cards were standard US trading card sized with gold scratch-offs and an eggshell finish. The UK series had 149 basic cards as the 8 treasure cards were numbered within the basic set, plus there were two additional strategy cards not included in the US set. The UK Emperor was #150, again only acquired by redeeming all 8 treasure cards. UK cards are larger than the US cards, have a gloss finish and silver scratch-offs. There are also extra rules to cater for using shields in the UK version.<br/><br/>Buy Microbadge<br/><br/><br/>",

Every turn, players can rush to finish their work or sabotage those who are pursuing the same potions they are, and once you've completed a potion, you can keep it for victory points or drink it to try to get even further ahead.<br/><br/>Every turn, players draw cards and 'transmute' a component from a pool they share with all of the other players at the table in order to produce 'elements' (earth, air, fire, water) that can then be combined to try to match the formulas at the bottom of the potion cards that act as victory points.<br/><br/>Potions are randomized each game, so each match has its own feel - some are very directly competitive, producing potions that allow players to directly attack one another, and others require more indirection and planning. Analyzing the available potions and trying to predict the interplay between them and the value of victory points vs. the effects of the potions is a key element of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prepare for invasion! Robotech RPG Tactics is a tactical miniatures game set in the Robotech universe. While the 1/285th scale game pieces can be used as a companion to the Robotech RPG, the game system is designed to be played as a tabletop miniatures game. Players build armies of multiple squadrons of mecha to fight it out in scenario-driven, objective-based game play. Take command of the fighting forces of the United Earth Defense Force (UEDF) valiantly defending Earth from alien annihilation &ndash; or lead the massive clone armies of the Zentraedi Armada to recover an alien artifact of immense power and enslave humankind. Depending on the faction, and their choice of mecha, a player's army may include anywhere from two game pieces to as many as you desire! The rules are scalable from small skirmishes to mass combat with hundreds per side.<br/><br/>Robotech RPG Tactics uses a dynamic turn system. Players trade off activating squadrons during each turn, ensuring that a player never has to sit and wait while his opponent moves and attacks with his entire army. By using alternating activation of squadrons, the game's action unfolds at a fast and furious pace, allowing large scale battles to be easily carried out in a single evening. Each player receives a number of Command Points each turn based on the number of mecha they have on the field, and the quality of their officers. Command Points are spent throughout the turn on maneuvers such as boosted movement, devastating weapon salvos, breakneck dodging counterattacks, and potent special abilities.<br/><br/>The wide variety of mecha in the boxed game bring to bear the myriad and awesome weapon systems from the Robotech universe to lay waste to your foes. Even the battlefield itself can alter over the course of the game as buildings are leveled by destruction unleashed during the battle.<br/><br/>",

But he had no need of the moon to locate his target, his eyes were able to see in the darkness better than anyone else. He moved slowly, not to avoid making any noise, his movements were always soft, almost ethereal: never in his eternal life he had been sensed by his prey; a few more steps and he would be on target. It was there, unaware, helpless in front of his attack: a quickly and decisively move and it&rsquo;s neck would not have even realized to be drilled. No worries, no tension, the cold calm that always filled him, made him perfect for this task. Suddenly the beating of wings, a night bird, inappropriate and unwanted, alerted the defenseless creature. But it was too late to avoid the arrow...<br/>H. - Why he doesn&rsquo;t use his tentacles to destroy it?<br/>B.- Which vampire has tentacles or shoots arrows?<br/>J.- From immemorial time, orcs are killed by elves with bow and arrows.<br/>B.- You have turned the helpless girl, alone in the dark night, in a putrid orc?!

That said, VEC is a &quot;light game made for gamers&quot;, not a storytelling game.<br/><br/>Players must acquire cards through an auction system. Cards represent the writer's ideas: protagonists, characters, events, places, items, encounters. Cards have special powers and players activate them to interact with other players (move cards, turn cards, refill energy, etc). The aim of the game is to move specific cards to a special zone of the table game area, called the NOVEL area. Cards must be placed there in the right sequence and type/color: each player has a different objective with a different sequence and colors, so as the result will be identical/similar to player objective, victory points will be scored. Card powers can be combined resulting in a huge number of play combinations creating many possible strategies.<br/><br/>",

Examples include the Holy Grail, the Maltese Falcon, and the briefcase in the movie Pulp Fiction.<br/><br/>The game Get the MacGuffin is a quick and humorous deduction game involving hand management and player elimination. The goal is to be the last player with cards. The player with the MacGuffin card will frequently win the game, but holding onto that card can prove quite difficult! Also, because there are 23 cards in the deck and players are always dealt an equal number of cards, there will always be some cards that are not in play. Figuring out which cards are missing is part of the strategy!<br/><br/>Who has the MacGuffin? Will the Assassin take out The Crown? What did the Garbage Collector find in the trash? What will The Thief steal, and from whom? To the shrewd, all may become known, but sometimes all you can do is Shrug.<br/><br/>",

You need three rare treasures from the Kingdom of Calandria: a tear from the Water Nymph, a tooth from the Fire Dragon and an emerald from the Rock Giant. But these mythical creatures won&rsquo;t give up their treasure without a fight! As a student of magic, you will need to show what you&rsquo;ve learned at Isidore. You will need to trade ingredients, compose spells to control the elements of Rock, Water and Fire, and ultimately win the duels!<br/><br/>In Isidore, you can collect, buy or trade ingredients throughout the Kingdom of Calandria. You need these ingredients to make your Rock, Water and Fire spells. The top spell card of the stack shows which ingredients you need to make the spell. If you&rsquo;re at Isidore and you have all the ingredients needed for a Rock, Water or Fire spell, you can take a spell card.<br/><br/>With these spells you can challenge the magical creatures to a duel. The magical creatures are powerful and always have three different duel cards (Rock, Water and Fire) to counter your attack. The player to the left of the attacking student stands in to play on behalf of the magical creature and takes the three dark duel cards.<br/><br/>As in the &lsquo;Rock-Paper-Scissors&rsquo; game, the student and the magical creature choose one of their spell cards (duel cards), which they place on the table &ndash; at exactly the same time - after reciting the magical spell I-SI-DORE (as in  one, two, three!).<br/><br/>&bull;    Fire beats Rock (fire melts rock).<br/>&bull;    Rock beats Water (rock absorbs water).<br/>&bull;    Water beats Fire (water puts out fire).<br/>&bull;    If the student and the magical creature play the same spell card, the elements cancel one another out and no one wins the round.<br/><br/>The first student to collect three treasures can return to school, where they will be awarded a diploma from the Isidore Academy of Magical Arts. This student also wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DOCTOR WHO - BATTLE FOR THE UNIVERSE<br/><br/>Summary<br/>Doctor Who, Battle for the Universe, is a game of battles and challenges for two, three, or four players. One player takes the part of The Doctor, and the others become one of his three arch enemies, i.e. Davros, The Master, or the Cyber Controller. Each of these characters has a team of four followers, Davros and four Daleks, The Doctor and his assistants, etc. There are also many other characters in the game that may be recruited. By collecting these characters each player tries to build a powerful team. By a series of battles and challenges, players fight for control of the universe until only two players remain and a final great battle decides the victor.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>There are four main characters in the game, each having a team of four loyal assistants. These are: 1) The Doctor and his four assistants, Tegan, Ace, Romana and K9; 2) Davros and four Daleks; 3) The Master and his evil Time Lords, Morbius, Borusa, Omega and Rani; 4) The Cyber Controller with four Cybermen.<br/><br/>The remaining cards comprise three Ice Warriors, three Mutants, two Marshmen, The Black Guardian, Linx, Shockeye and Garron. Each card lists the character's &quot;Inner Force&quot; (his inherent strength), and a list of weapons and devices with which he is skilled.<br/><br/>Set Up<br/>Each player rolls the die -  the highest scorer becomes The Doctor, and takes the character card of The Doctor and places it in front of them. The other players, in order of score, select one of the main characters. The Doctor takes the four white counters - these represent his four regenerations, or lives. The other players take the appropriate colored counters. The Master - black, Davros -  red, etc. Place the silver counter on the ring at the top of the board. (The ring of weapons and devices) on the space marked by the Magic Recorder. The Doctor can then place ONE of his white counters on any one of the Tardis spaces on the three main movement rings on the board. The other players can now place their counters on any of the Hyperspace squares on the board, though not on the same space as another player. The other character cards are left in the box for easy access during the game.<br/><br/>Movement (always clockwise) is determined by rolling the die. You can move from one ring to another as long as it does not involve an anti-clockwise movement. You land on spaces that allow you to take certain actions: collect a character, hyperspace to any other hyperspace square, Battle Zone 1, 2, or 3. You select a character for battle and the silver counter is moved based upon a die roll, thus selecting your weapon for the battle.<br/><br/>The ring of weapons and devices is only used during battle and challenges.<br/><br/>The rules contain sections for &quot;How to play with 3 Players&quot; and &quot;How to play with 2 Players&quot;<br/><br/>",

Otherwise the game plays like the normal version of Would You Rather...?.<br/><br/>From the Box:<br/><br/>In this sick, twisted, and wrong version you'll find questions that are nauseating, bizarre, and disturbing, but each is a field tested conversation starter that is guaranteed to provide ridiculous fun, break the ice at any party and--if played correctly--open a unique window into the twisted imaginations of friends and family!<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;Zobmondo!! Would You Rather...? TSW comes in a square psychedelic (lava lamp patterned) box. It contains a game board and introduces Challenge Cards to make game play even more diverse and fun.

        "description": "This is an Italian humorous simulation of the Italian football championship. The players are presidents of &quot;minor&quot; football teams and must try to survive to a championship among a lot of misfortunes (such as love affairs with soubrettes and striking players) and in the meantime gain a good placement in the League, major teams not withstanding. Each president buys one or more superstar players and then fields his team to play against other teams. The match is played via dice rolls and adding bonuses and penalties due to coaches, players, referees and event cards. The board is modular so that it may change for every game, and there are many cards, although some have no effect on the game (even though they give a very sharp view of the Italian football championship). A very nice and funny game that cost the developer some legal actions due to real names used in the game itself. In Italian language only.<br/><br/>",

When a player has 2 or fewer cubes left, the game ends.<br/>Players draw a number of cubes from the pool of 50 coloured cubes (5 colours and numbered 0-9. The same number is displayed on all six faces of the die). This varies depending upon the number of players in the game.<br/>In turn, each player tries to place a higher valued pyramid on the board than the previous player. If a player is unable to do so, they pass their turn. Play continues with the next person able to place a higher value pyramid on the board unless it goes around to the last person who successfully place a pyramid. In this case, they may place a pyramid of any value. <br/>The board has inset spaces to take the cubes at an angle for stacking the number cubes. A player forms a pyramid by having using three dice on the same level to form a base. Add together the numbers on the bases of these three cubes. The cube placed on the apex of this pyramid must match the last digit of the sum of numbers on the bases. (example: the base is formed of the numbers 5,7,9. The sum is 21. The apex of the pyramid must be a 1). <br/>The value of pyramids played is similar to a poker hand and varies from High Value (different colours and values) to a 'Royal Straight Flush' (a 7,8,9,0 with a 7 at the apex of the same colour).<br/><br/>",

Each player controls five Arthurs and a host of other Arthurian characters in a heated attempt to grab and retrieve the sword before any other player succeeds in this task.<br/><br/>On the surface, the game appears to be a very simple wargame, combat being quickly resolved without any dice as characters fight each other. The key to the game, however, is that two players are always taking turns at the same time, the turns being regulated by &quot;turn tokens&quot; that pass around the board. When one player finishes his or her turn, the turn-token is passed to the next player who does not already have one. If one player is a slowpoke taking his turn, then the other turn-token passes around the table, allowing other players to take turns. This forces players to take very fast turns, usually about 5 seconds each, allowing the game to move along with the intensity of a video game. Games usually take 20 to 30 minutes to play, even with three to six players.<br/><br/>Special rules resolve potential conflicts that could occur when two players try to perform actions simultaneously where priority is in question, resolving quickly and simply.<br/><br/>No player ever quite gets knocked out of the game due to loss of characters; Arthurs always &quot;rejuvenate&quot;, returning to your pile of pieces (your &quot;village&quot;) that can enter the board. Characters start at a chosen entry space at the edge of the board, and move to the center to grab Excalibur, returning the Sword to their entry space to win. Each of the 5 character-types (Merlin, Lancelot, etc) have their own unique abilities, but everyone starts with an identical set of pieces.<br/><br/>There are also two variants in the rules, allowing players to vary the game by going after the &quot;Accoutrements of Kingship&quot; instead of the Sword, or by gathering a number of gold pieces scattered around the board so as to &quot;buy the kingship&quot;. Tokens are included for these variants.<br/><br/>The game is very intense and fast, requiring players to think on their feet and make fast realtime decisions; if you are a big fan of slow, deep thinking, strategy games, you might look elsewhere.<br/><br/>",

You shoot at the other cars, trying to destroy their tires and armor. The last player with an operating car is the winner!<br/><br/>In each battle, or duel, the players play cards to damage each others' cars. When one side of a player's car is breached (the armor on that side is destroyed), the car's driver may be attacked! If a car's driver is disabled and unable to operate his car, the player who disabled him scores a kill. (Note that the driver will be back for the next duel! Only the car is killed.) When only one car is left (or when time runs out), the duel is over. New duels continue until one player has scored 60 points to become an Ace!<br/><br/>Car Wars: The Card Game is fully compatible with Battle Cattle: The Card Game! Combine the two... take your hot rod out to the pasture and go gunning for Bossy...but remember, Bossy shoots back!<br/><br/>",

Strategy, deception, and bravery will be your most valuable assets in the complex and varied game of Kamakura.<br/><br/>The game features original artwork and game play.  The premise of the game is to capture all of your opponents territories OR gain a score of 17 or more. You combine various soldiers each with unique abilities with crafty weapons in order to take territories as your own. The mechanics behind the game are card management and general strategy.<br/><br/>As of 2014 edition:<br/><br/>Gameplay;<br/>We&rsquo;ve decided to introduce &ldquo;Clan Power&rdquo; cards. Each deck comes with 1 Clan Power card for each Clan, totaling 4 Clan Power cards per deck. Each Clan Power is unique, adding new strategic elements and depth. <br/>To compensate for adding the new Clan Power cards we took away 1 Naginata and 1 Yumi (the two most powerful weapons). The deck now totals 54 cards. <br/>Color coded backs have been added for easy sorting with their corresponding Clans.<br/><br/>Updated Territories;<br/>Barrages and Walls now have point values. 1 barrage (Attack Power of 2) can take either the Farm or Village, but 2 barrages (total Attack Power of 4) are needed to take a Fortress or Palace. Walls now have a Defense Power of 2.<br/>Walls also have the ability to scout territories. For example, 1 Barrage can be played on a palace, if your opponent doesn&rsquo;t have a wall, they must still reveal the Territory, but it cannot be captured.<br/>Even though the Barrage now has an Attack Power, it still may NOT be used with a soldier.<br/><br/>Refined Card UI;<br/>Along with enhanced card and box quality we wanted to address the card design and how they explained themselves. We rethought how to phrase the descriptions and abilities of every single card. This led us to add slight iconography to the cards to further help explain the context that each card may be used in. At the top right of the Abilities box is either a sword, shield, flag or a combination of sword and shield.<br/><br/>For more info on the 2014 edition refer to the updates section of the Kickstarter for the 2011 edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of this game (a distant relative of Stratego) is to destroy your opponent's six tanks before he does the same to you.  In addition to your tanks, you deploy an Ammo Dump, a Fuel Dump, your HQ and five Anti-Tank guns (which do not move).<br/><br/>Your tanks are numbered but the opponent knows not which is which.  You also deploy (by writing their coordinates on a scrap of paper) two land mines.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first plot secretly (using a peg board) where you think your opponent's tanks will end their move.  Once you're ready, he moves.  If you guessed correctly, the tanks are killed.  (You get six such shots each turn)  You also have five special shots which can be fired only once each --they may be added piecemeal during any turn.  You lose a special shot whenever you lose an AT gun.<br/><br/>You have 6 moves each turn, no more than 3 per tank (unless down to two or fewer tanks).  Tanks can only go sideways or forward but those that reach the opponent's starting row are marked with a flag and can now move backward.<br/><br/>Tanks attack each other by orthogonal proximity, in Stratego fashion (higher numbered tank wins).  Tanks attack AT guns using a spinner.  The installations are destroyed by being overrun.  Losing the HQ clears your mines; losing the Ammo Dump means you only use as many pegs as you have tanks remaining; losing the Fuel Dump reduces your movement points from six to four.  Tanks die if they end up on an enemy mine square.<br/><br/>Remade in to Mission Command Land<br/><br/>",

This is done through a series of reenactments of historical events from the landing of the Pilgrims through the American Revolution<br/><br/>User review: Players start the game with an Identity Card. This tells the player who that person is during the game and what victory conditions must be met in order to win: the number of Signature Cards, bounty units and amount of money. Players also start with $5000 and a pawn on Independence Hall. In turn, players will roll the dice and follow the instructions on whatever space the pawn lands. A player who lands on another player&rsquo;s space sends the latter player to stock where that player must lose one turn. Players are free to barter Signature Cards, bounty units, and money amongst themselves. Every time a player passes Independence Hall that player gets $1000. A player who reaches Independence Hall with the assigned requirements is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players must not violate her strange rules or those of her crazed consort, BullyQ, while attempting to rise further in her favor, or possibly even overthrow her rule.<br/><br/>Mad QUAO is a lightweight hierarchy card game with a few twists. Players take turns playing cards on a central pile and drawing new cards, seeking to empty their hands as soon as the draw deck runs out. The order that players go out determines the hierarchy for the next round.<br/><br/>But at the beginning of each round, the QUAO adds a new bizarre QUAO Rule Card to the game. If a player breaks a QUAO Rule, they must draw a card &ndash; and so must all of the lower-ranked players. (Of course, the player who caught them gets immunity!) Over the course of the game, other special cards may come up. Bully Rules are similar to QUAO Rules, but affect only one player. In addition, the lower-ranked players have access to a few special Wild Cards in the deck, but they require players to perform stunts.<br/><br/>The end result is a card game in which you can rise from the ranks of the chicken proletariat to ruler of The Farm through good play and a lot of luck, but you might also have to win a fashion runway walk-off, talk only through a sock puppet, and never say the word &quot;turn&quot;.<br/><br/>Good luck, QUAOmrade!<br/><br/>",

The old machines are rusted and broken and the scavengers of Gearworld live off scraps from the past and refuse from the Sky People's flying cities. The scavengers' only hope for a better life is to build great towering skyworks and gain the favor of the World Above, allowing them to outlast and outlive their rival scavenger gangs. In the Borderlands, survival is an exception.<br/><br/>Gearworld: The Borderlands is a game of conquest and survival in a post-apocalyptic world for 2-4 players who must gather resources and use them wisely. Players need those resources in order to strengthen their military might, to enhance their transport capabilities, and to reach the final goal of building the skyworks. Resources can be produced in areas with resource tokens, traded with other players, and taken by force. To build a development &ndash; e.g., weapons, transport vehicles or skyworks &ndash; all of the required resources have to be located in the same space on the map. This makes effective transport an important issue in the game. At the same time players must be strong enough to protect their resources from the other players while investing resources in their skyworks in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Seize territory, marshal resources and defend yourself from your rivals. Reclaim the machines of old to build powerful weapons and enormous skyworks. Can you forge a new future from the rusted remnants of the past?<br/><br/>Microbadges:<br/>  <br/> Gearworld: The Borderlands fan<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From fire to smartphone in less than an hour!<br/><br/>S-Evolution is a unique combination of a classic card game &mdash; with tricks, colors and trump &mdash; and of a typical &quot;Eurogame&quot; of resources management and civilization. Each player has a deck of 24 cards, and in each of the six rounds, he draws a hand of four cards from this deck. Each player starts the game in Age 1 and adds the progress card of this age to his deck.<br/><br/>Each round consists of a card phase, lasting 4-5 tricks among all the players, followed by an individual management phase. During the card phase, players try to (1) gather resources (which are on the cards) to pay for the needs of their civilization and to construct buildings, (2) avoid diasters, and (3) collect discoveries. However, the value of a player's cards are affected by which Age he occupies. In Ages 1 and 2, for example, his cards have no color, so they automatically lose to cards of players in Age 3 and above as those folks have discovered the awesome power of hue. What's more, in the primitive Age 1, you can't see the cards before you play them. That's how primitive you are! In Ages 5 and 6, a player can start using trump to beat out those in lower ages.<br/><br/>The advantages in the card phase are balanced by the needs of your population, which is much greater in later ages. In each trick, each player collects one played card based on the value of their card played, and players then use the resources on these cards (food, tools and science) to satisfy the needs of their population, erect buildings (which supply additional resources), gain advantages (which can protect you from disasters or earn you victory points), or advance to the next Age of S-Evolution. Players score points each round depending on how well they meet the needs of their population, suffering penalties if they fail to do so.<br/><br/>At the end of the sixth round, players score points for their sets of discoveries, and the player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Nine double-sided bomb tiles are placed to the side, and each bomb tile shows either a color or a symbol, but not both.<br/><br/>Everyone plays simultaneously, with each player flipping her chips one by one, flipping chips in the center of the table one by one, and swapping one of her chips for one of the publicly available chips. As soon as all seven of a player's chips match one of the target bombs &mdash; say, by being all pink or all triangles or one of each color &mdash; that player yells &quot;Boom!&quot; She then identifies the matching bomb, places one of her chips aside as a one-point scoring marker, draws a new chip from the bag, then flips over that bomb before play resumes.<br/><br/>If a player matches two bombs simultaneously &mdash; e.g., all blue and one of each symbol &mdash; she sets aside two tokens instead of one. If a players matches the Bubble Bomb, which calls for one of each color and one of each symbol, she claims the Bubble Bomb (even if another player claimed it earlier), then swaps all of her chips for seven in the middle of the table before play resumes; the Bubble Bomb is worth three points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>With four players, the game ends when the final chip is drawn from the bag and the player with the most points wins; with 2-3 players, the first player to collect nine points wins.<br/><br/>",

Or the dreaded 10 zombie card!<br/>    And if on a park (farm) tile, then you can farm &ndash; One survivor can choose to spend an action point to farm.<br/><br/><br/>Farming? I hear you ask, well in the game once you have reclaimed a park, it is used to produce food. You can spend food at the start of your turn to give 3 survivor 2 action points that turn making them &ldquo;well fed and ready for zombie carnage&rdquo; However you can actively farm a park tile, spending a survivors action point. <br/>This means that at the start of your next turn that farm produces 2 food instead of 1.<br/><br/>Ending the game!<br/><br/>The game can end in 4 ways: <br/>The research centre is reclaimed (the cure has been found and the outbreak is over) <br/>The military base is reclaimed (More guns than any one army could need, you are left with a city flooded with zombie soup) <br/>When a group of survivors has reclaimed and spends one turn actively farming 5 farms (who needs to worry about zombies when you have fresh veg and steak every day) <br/>Or finally if one player reaches 50 Victory points before any of the other conditions are met<br/><br/>However it is the player with the most Victory points that reigns king.

A wall will stop zombies and must be destroyed by attacking survivors before they can pass.<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>Combat in Surviving is simple. Survivors attack first. You roll a die for each survivor. Each die roll of 4,5 or 6 kills a zombie. Then any zombies left roll a die each to attack the survivors. A zombie must roll a 5 or 6 to kill a survivor. <br/>Repeat until all zombies are dead or all survivors are dead or have run away.<br/><br/>That is it.

Each player picks a color token at the beginning and keeps it secret.  During a turn, a player can do one of three things 1) obtain a stixx touching the single grey stixx, 2) reveal their color and pick up two stixx, or 3) guess another player's secret color and, if correct, collect two stixx.  If the player guesses wrong, she loses her turn.  The winner is the person who has the most stixx in their color, with tie breakers going to the player with the most stixx of one other color, and then the player who's secret color was revealed last.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The year is 3012. It's been a millennium since the Armageddon. Deep in the Yucatan jungle, humanity has mutated, degenerated, and segregated into five clans: Jaguar, Snake, Monkey, Gar, and Bat. These clans now battle it out for dominance in the region, cooperating when it suits them and actively working against each other when the opportunity arises.<br/><br/>In 3012, players start the game with small decks of Scout cards, which provide gold to make purchases. Two piles of cards &ndash; an Ally deck and a Weapon deck &ndash; provide static cards to buy, with three cards from each deck always available to purchase each round. Cards that are not bought remain there for other players to buy. Two non-static Action decks &ndash; one with cheap cards, the other expensive &ndash; are also available, and at the start of your turn, you reveal one card from each of these two Action decks. You get the benefits of the Action cards you reveal, whether you buy them or not, and they're removed from play if you don't buy them.<br/><br/>When you have amassed enough combat skill through Allies, Weapons, and Action cards, you can attempt to prove your worth by facing a beast in four decks of Encounter cards, ranging from easy to very difficult.<br/><br/>Unlike most deck-building games, there are many points of interaction in 3012, so players are never out of the action! And you always get to refill your hand to its maximum size at the start of your turn, so you are never penalized for interacting during other players' turns.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the Heroes reaches Level 5. The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Financial foundations are crumbling, while our nation's cherished traditions of greed, profit and exploitation are threatened.<br/><br/>As the CEO of a global bank, it's your personal responsibility to do whatever it takes to ensure a comfortable retirement. Call in government bailouts, award yourself bonuses and - when no one's looking - embezzle as much as you can, before it all comes crashing down around you.<br/><br/>Crunch is a card game for 2 to 4 players that allows you to experience the upside of down. Placed in the role of a global banking CEO, you have to juggle the conflicting demands of your ailing bank and your flourishing bank account.<br/><br/>Along the way, the game also replicates our modern banking system and foreshadows the inevitable collapse of capitalism, but that's just a bonus.<br/><br/>It's a Trust Thing<br/>Each player starts the game with a number of Assets in their bank, a small workforce and a few Trust cards. Trust is essential to your bank's survival. Not only will capitalism falter without it, but each Trust card hides on the reverse a potential Government Bailout.<br/><br/>Government Bailouts can be called in at any time you're feeling the pinch (that's at any time) in return for a variable cash injection. Occasionally though you get nothing, so spend them wisely.<br/><br/>Debt Makes the World Go Round<br/>Using your workforce, you lend out your bank's Assets as debt. You can dabble in high risk debt for potentially big rewards (and big losses) or stick to the safer (but less profitable) low risk debt. Either way, clever playing of the markets will bring in big returns.<br/><br/>Bonuses and Embezzling<br/>But then that's all immaterial because what's really important is how much money you can secure for your own personal fortune. You do this by awarding yourself bonuses at regular intervals and by brazenly embezzling your own bank's Assets and hiding them when no one else is looking. If you get caught embezzling, you lose a Trust card and you remember how important Trust is, right?<br/><br/>Surviving the Crunch<br/>Occasionally, the Crunch will hit and all CEOs have to make sure they can cover all the money they've lent out with the total value of Assets in their banks. If they can't, it's government bailout time or bust. But don't worry too much if that happens because if you've managed to bonus and embezzle enough, you can still win the game, even if you go bankrupt first.<br/><br/>Remember, you could run a model bank for the entire duration of the game, but if you fail to look after number one, you risk ending up yachtless.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a simple plain-trick game, suitable for children. It seems to be played mostly in Britain, and is often called by the alternative name Trumps. Any number from two to seven may play. A session consists of seven hands, of diminishing size.<br/><br/>A 52-card pack is used, with four suits ranking from high to low A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. A player is selected to deal, and deals seven cards each, clockwise. The uppermost of the undealt cards is turned face upwards to indicate the trump suit.<br/><br/>The player on dealer's left leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit if they can, otherwise they may play any card. Each trick is won by the highest trump in it; otherwise by the highest card of the suit led. The winner of a trick leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>After the first hand, a second hand is dealt, by the next player in order around the table, with only six cards each. The game continues like this, with one fewer card per player on each hand, until the final hand consists of one card each.<br/><br/>The winner of most tricks on the first hand chooses the trump suit on the second hand, and so on (i. e. the winner of the second hand chooses trump for the third hand, etc.). If there is a tie for who took most tricks, the players involved in the tie cut cards for the right to choose trumps.  A player who takes no tricks at all in a hand is knocked out, is dealt no more cards, and takes no further part in the game.  There is one exception to the rule about being knocked out: the first player during the game who takes no tricks on a hand is not knocked out immediately but is awarded the &quot;dog's life&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is won by the winner of the one trick on the final hand. Or if all but one of the players are knocked out before this, the surviving player is the winner.<br/><br/>Source: pagat.com<br/><br/>",

The Japanese defense forces (14 pieces) are obstacles for all players; when defeated, they are redeployed by that player and can thus be used to slow down opponents.<br/><br/>Each player has 6 pieces (2 Marines, 2 infantry, 1 naval landing support ship and 1 strategic air support aircraft). On a player's turn, they roll the die and can move one of their soldiers. The support pieces (ship/aircraft) move only on a 6 and are immediately deployed where necessary to support a beach landing. Moving a soldier on top of an opponent's by exact count &quot;relieves&quot; it and sends it back to its start space. Each player must clear the two beaches that match their color. To do this, both support pieces must first be brought to bear, and then a Marine must reach the defender by exact count. Once cleared, beaches remain clear and can be used by all players.<br/><br/>The mechanics are a variant of the old public domain game of Malefiz or Barricade.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introducing Greedy Wizards  - a two-player card game in which a red wizard battles a blue wizard for the right to eat a delicious cake.<br/><br/>Winning pieces of cake will take you closer to victory - whilst also making it more difficult to claim the next hand. Strategy, maths, probability and bluffing combine to make this a game unlike any other.<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>Each wizard holds nine spell cards numbered from one to nine. As our wizards are more &quot;Greedy&quot; than &quot;Gandalf&quot;, their spell-casting abilities leave a little to be desired -  making their spells a little on the unusual side. The game's incantations include things like summoning an &ldquo;absolutely massive chicken&rdquo; or &ldquo;a woman who shouts hurricanes.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to secretly select and then lay three spell cards face down, either side of a duel token. This is repeated until each wizard has played all nine of the cards they hold. Duels are resolved by adding up the total value of cards - with the wizard with the highest winning that particular scrap. Win two duels out of three and a piece of cake becomes theirs.<br/><br/>However, three pieces of cake are needed to win the game - and because our Wizards are Greedy, they value cake over spells. Winning a piece of cake means discarding a spell card. And as the cake cards are double-sided, the opposing wizard can see exactly when they are being played. When cake is in play, the game becomes one of strategy, bluffing and probability - do you have what it takes to get your cake and eat it?<br/><br/>Beautifully illustrated, easy to learn yet full of decisions and intrigue, it&rsquo;s a game which can be enjoyed by any level of player. As long as they are greedy.<br/><br/>",

You are run out of fuel and it&rsquo;s getting dark outside.<br/><br/>Suddenly there is a nice cosy mansion in front of you. You and your friends being naive as kids have no choice but to come in and find lots of zombies, aggressive dogs, venomous spiders and chaos! Move! Save your life, board up the windows and kill the hellish zombies!<br/><br/>Gameplay: players move across the house (one cell a turn), search for useful items, block windows and doors, fight zombies. The game field is a map containing hidden dangers (zombies and other monsters) and items (weapons, aid kits, boards for blocking windows and doors). Your goal is to find the car keys and gas, and then escape. Most preferably, escape without losing anyone. Each character has unique properties that help them and the entire team. For example, the police girl has a gun and she doesn&rsquo;t need to look for one in the house.<br/><br/>A fight against zombies is simulated with a rotating arrow with a range of possible results, from a victory to fleeing the battlefield or suffering a wound. Weapons can modify the result.<br/><br/>If a monster eats your character, you become a zombie chief. With your help, zombies can chase living characters, block their access to rooms or specific items.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The idea is for players to populate the various oceans with large schools of fish, and then strategically place their animals so they can eat the greatest value of fish.<br/><br/>The mechanics of the game are simple. There are five oceans which are set out in a column. The rest of the cards are divided into two decks: fish and animals. Fish cards carry values from 0 - 3 points each.<br/><br/>A player fills his hand with five cards, of which at least one must be an animal card. All animal cards in a player's possession are placed face-up in front of him. Animals are color coded to specific oceans and may only be played on that ocean. Fish may be played on any ocean.<br/><br/>Players then alternate playing cards to the oceans. Fish cards are played to the right side of an ocean, while animal cards are played to the left of their respective 'home' ocean. Each 'side' may only contain a maximum of five cards.<br/><br/>The idea is to time the placement of your animal cards so as to score the most points based on the value of the fish already played to that ocean. So, if three fish cards had been played to the Atlantic Ocean, worth 1, 2 ad 0 points respectively (for a total of 3 points), the first player to play an animal card on that ocean (it must be THE animal which can be played on that ocean) will score 3 points. The second player to plan an animal card to that ocean scores double the points (6 points). The third player to place an animal on that ocean scores triple the points (9 points); etc.<br/><br/>",

The challenge is carried out with cards; the player with the higher number wins and gets to place his pawn on top of the opponent&rsquo;s pawn. This is more difficult than it sounds, since you only have a limited number of cards and you have to consider carefully which cards to use. In the course of the game the pawns will form high stacks, which belong to the player whose pawn is on top. The winner is the player who has collected the most pawns!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Yundao is a reworking of Knizia's Fish Eat Fish. It's a similar case to Goldrausch/Wapi: the game has a new theme, new components, and newly developed ideas, so it's more than just a new edition. This time the underwater theme has been changed to Oriental palaces moving around and growing in height.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You're in command of an elite force. Your mission: Capture your opponents and secure the area. A good strategy game which combines various elements of war, chess-like moves and cards. Strategies will range from aggressive assaults, multi-front advance or defensive maneuvers with the idea of wearing down your opponents --- with some luck thrown in. The 2-sided gameboard is divided into 12 by 12 grids --- with one side used for a standard game and the other for a variation game. The cards provide extra power to your attacking forces, like Air Strikes, Armored, Engineering, Special Forces and more. Two basic units are used in the game: Divisions (powerful but slow) and Brigades (quick but less powerful). An interesting game. 2 to 4 players. Ages 12 and up. Army National Guard from 2003.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Around 1300, a supernatural event opened a few breaches between two distant worlds: ours and the world of FATAL. Following this event, the Queen of Fatal disappeared, and a few enchanters left that world and arrived on Earth.<br/><br/>The five breaches in Europe gave origin to as many magic birth-signs: Flambeaux (Paris), Aquat&eacute; (Brno), Terranova (Rome), &Aring;ngb&aring;t (Tallinn), Lichtenborn (Nuremberg). Five families who over the centuries kept wavering between open war and armed peace, but who never lived in harmony.<br/><br/>Since then, the enchanters have influenced humans politics, arts, and science: either directly or by inspiring and taking control over all humans who were useful for their cause, and FATAL is a piece of this tale.<br/><br/>The game features a deck of 110 cards. Each player belongs to one of the birth-signs and tries to catch the greatest number of treasures by playing &quot;trimagics&quot; (combination of three cards) and/or beating other players.<br/><br/>During his turn, the player:<br/><br/>     may play a special &quot;enchantment&quot; card,<br/>     may steal a card in front of another player (with a rock-paper-scissors system printed on the cards),<br/>     may play up to two cards in front of himself.<br/><br/><br/>Each player has two &quot;virtual&quot; columns where he can play cards: the first card of a column is played normally, the second card is played rotated by 180&deg;, the third card completes the column (the &quot;trimagic&quot;) and must be placed rotated by 90&deg;.<br/>The three cards of a tri-spell have a different meaning: the first card decides the performed action, the second one fixes the number of targets or the power of the spell, the third one closes the trimagic.<br/><br/>Each player has also a designed enemy (by secret role assignment at the start of the game): if he defeats this player, he is the winner. If nobody reaches this goal, the winner is the player with the most powerful treasures at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s up to you to commission a brave officer of the Royal Navy to pursue that black-hearted cur, catch him, and turn him into shark bait. But he&rsquo;s a rascal, that Pirate King, so you&rsquo;ll need to recruit one of the dregs of the Queen&rsquo;s dungeons because sometimes it takes a pirate to catch a pirate. Iffn&rsquo; you discover where that swab is hiding, you&rsquo;ll need to beat the Pirate King in a duel or acquire enough gold to buy back the ship. Act with haste because you&rsquo;re not alone in this hunt. Whoever saves the Sea Hammer first wins the Queen&rsquo;s undying gratitude - and the game!<br/><br/>Here's a description of the game from Timothy Rose, who saw a presentation on the game at GenCon:<br/><br/>The &quot;S&amp;S&quot; pirate game is a &quot;track&quot; based game (think &quot;Talisman&quot; more than &quot;Monopoly&quot; ). Each player controls two characters, a &quot;hero&quot; and a &quot;scoundrel&quot; type, and the goal is to retrieve the Queen's flagship from the Pirate King. Of course, each character has different ways to do that, either by derring-do and combat or by more underhanded methods (if you have enough gold, you could even BRIBE the Pirate King to get the ship back!). They showed the box design, pretty standard pirate/cutlass stuff, but nice art.<br/><br/>",

After preparation, no one can look at the monkeys - you better remember which monkey is yours!<br/><br/>On player's turn, he takes one monkey, and jumps in a straight line in any direction over ther monkeys. Monkeys are &quot;crazy&quot; so they jump over other monkeys - that's the only way to move a monkey. When monkey jumps out of a playing area, it is flipped over, and placed in front of it's owner.<br/><br/>The first player to get all of his monkeys out of the board wins the round.

        "description": "The Game of Chips is a simple dice game from the makers of the Sequence.  Components include a cloth bag for storage, poker chips numbered 1-10, a pair of dice, an instruction card, and one pad of preprinted score sheets.  Play consists of three rounds of dice rolling and in which the ten numbered chips are placed in front of a player.  The player then rolls the dice and removes any chip or combination if chips from play that equal the total on the dice.  Repeat until no further chips can be removed.  That player scores the total of the number of chips that have not been removed.  Lowest score wins.<br/><br/>This game is very similar to Shut the Box, with the following differences:<br/>- Any number of chips totaling the sum of the dice may be removed, not just one or two<br/>- The game is played to three rounds rather than to 45 points.<br/><br/>",

Once constructed, it presents a graveyard, with movement spaces, hedges that cannot be crossed, moving tombs, and a crypt containing a headless ghost. The ghost must be defeated in order to win.<br/><br/>Each player has two character pawns--only one of which they may chose to move on each turn. They move as far as is permitted by the amount shown on their die roll. Also on each turn, the tomb die is rolled, and one of the tombs is moved. This tomb movement alters the playing field by changing what some of the spaces on the game board represent. In this way, a player might land on a square that is safe, but after a tomb is shifted--they suddenly find that they are left &quot;paralyzed with fear.&quot;<br/><br/>There is complete freedom of movement, except as stated above, and players cannot cross their own path. One of the special spaces is a &quot;Goosebumps&quot; space. On this space, the player draws a Goosebumps card. Some cards require players to perform an action straight away, others allow players to play now or later. One card allows play at any time.<br/><br/>During the game, players attempt to foil each other by picking up cards that allow them to turn other players into monsters, move other players onto bad spaces, steal each other's cards, etc. After a player has been turned into a monster, they can only be cured by landing on a &quot;magic potion&quot; square. If you are unfortunate, you can also fall into one of the open tombs--that character of yours is then stuck there until the end of the game. Characters can fall into tombs only by the movement of the tomb--In other words, they cannot be moved directly into a tomb.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches the crypt, they may attempt to defeat the headless ghost. In order to do so, they first must have picked up a ring card. At the crypt, the player drops the skull down the chute--if it falls the right way, then the headless ghosts springs into the air and the player wins. If not, they can attempt to defeat the ghost on their next turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple game using the Asterix franchise. The players are racing to win a bet as to whom will collect the most Roman helmets. You move from the Roman camp (which gets you 3 cards) to the village and back until the deck is exhausted. There are obstacles in the way: Assurancetourix the Bard makes you flee back three spaces with his atrocious singing, and you trip over the menhirs, losing a card. A small Roman cohort can be hit to garner an extra card.<br/><br/>When two players end up in the same space, there can be a tussle, with one card --picked randomly-- being swapped. The real strategy comes in deciding which of the two dice to use: the slow one (1-4) or the fast one (3-6). When using the fast one, any player can cry out &quot;Exchange!&quot; and swap his hand for yours...<br/><br/>The 48 Roman cards are worth from 1 to 5 helmets each, but there are a fair number of red cards bearing non-helmets (caligae, shields, pilums, etc) which score from -1 to -5. So beware!<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Älpler-Stafette<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player uses her own deck to form the narrative of her attempted escape; the ground-breaking card design allows for each card to be used for the card effect printed on the front or as a location as indicated by the card's back. The first player to make her way to the &quot;helipad&quot; at the bottom of her deck escapes certain death and wins the game.<br/><br/>The zombies are right behind you.

This Disney version of Meme the Game is more kid-friendly than the original, and is perfect for the entire family.<br/><br/>To setup, shuffle the Word Card deck and the Picture Card deck separately, and the oldest player serves as the dealer. Each player receives three Word Cards and three Picture Cards, which are dealt face down and kept private from other players.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to create the funniest &ldquo;meme&rdquo; combining one picture card and one word card from your hand. To start, the first Dealer serves as the &ldquo;judge&rdquo;, who does not submit a meme that round, and other players submit their best picture-and-word combo for the judge to analyze. The judge determines the funniest meme created, and the player who submitted the best meme is given one point. After each round, it is important that every player draw a new word and picture card to bring the total number of cards in his/her hand back up to six (three word cards and three picture cards). From there, the &ldquo;judge&rdquo; responsibilities are passed to the left, and play continues until one player gains five points (that is, wins five rounds with the best meme).<br/><br/>Contents: 112 picture cards, 88 word cards, and instruction sheet.<br/><br/>Note: There is another boxed version with 225 picture cards and 175 word cards.<br/><br/>",

They try to guide their ships to the most advantageous cities, and find the best crews to sail them. Each successful unloading of goods in a city earns the player silver, and the game ends on the round someone reaches 100 silver marks.<br/><br/>The game is set in 16th century Europe, and revolves around choosing the best routes for your ship, finding the best crews to get there the fastest, and planning for the future. Loading Cards are revealed to show what products are available in which cities, and Unloading Cards show which cities are buying what products. A further future card of both kinds is also revealed, to show the players what's coming. Old cards go out at the end of a round, and new ones come in instead.<br/><br/>Each round all players choose a new crew for their ship. The first player token rotates over the rounds, and the last player is stuck with the only crew that is left. Each card shows a movement number, and an expertise either in coastal sailing or open sea. However, the choice of crew is not always obvious; the lowest movement number will move first, and the highest moves last. Any ties are solved with the first player token. During a turn, a player can freely move their ship between ports, load it for a fee and unload it for a reward. The faster a ship reaches a port for unloading, the greater the profit will be. The player with the most money when the game ends, wins!<br/><br/>",

If they choose to flip, they simply turn one of their dice over (making a one into a six, a two into a five, etc.).  If they choose to play, they force their opponent to put one die of their choice into the pot, taking back other dice totalling less than the value of the die played.  The last player holding dice wins.<br/><br/>Flip was invented as a dice-based variant of Pennywise.

If so (or even if you&rsquo;ve just seen all that goes into it from movies like Mission Impossible and The Da Vinci Code), then you know how incredibly important&mdash;and difficult&mdash;it can be.<br/><br/>Welcome to Cracked, the fast and furious strategic card game for 2-8 players. In Cracked, players race to be the first to end the game by having four cards in their hand that matches their unique code card. Sound simple? It is. Yet&hellip;it&rsquo;s not. In fact, Cracked was designed to be welcoming to beginning gamers, but still competitive and tactical enough for the more serious gamer in your life.<br/><br/>To play, players take turns playing one or more cards from their hand in order to match the color or number value on the central card (i.e. the card in the middle of the table). If the central card is a green 6, then you could play a green card, a 6 card, or two cards equaling 6 (i.e. a 5 and a 1). Action cards spice things up a notch, as they can swap hands, force a player to miss a turn, and more. Collect the numbers required by your code card&mdash;and discard anything that doesn&rsquo;t match&mdash;and you win!<br/><br/>With a fast playtime and high player count, Cracked can be brought out for nearly any social situation. This 2-8 player strategic card game is filled with innovative and unique game mechanics that make every game tense and exciting, perfect for any occasion. The game was designed to be casual and streamlined enough to welcome beginning gamers, but tactical enough to keep the hard-core players challenged. A fine balance between the two will introduce a new gaming experience that has not been felt in this genre of gaming for a while. Do you have what it takes to crack the code and emerge as the best code-cracker around?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Will it be of prosperity and fertility or will the endless struggle throw the country into a devastating rebellion?<br/><br/>Time is against you as you join the chaotic era of the Rising Kings!<br/><br/><br/>Rising Kings is a fun and entertaining cardgame for adults and kids age 12 years and up.<br/><br/>Each box contains 97 cards, a rulebook (English, Danish and German) and 15 overview cards (English, Danish and German).<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Players draw cards from a shared playdeck and play cards from their hands. Every card is put into play and has an effect when played. A few cards have an ongoing effect - like the Fortress and the Cityguard.<br/><br/>There are three types of cards: characters, buildings and rebellions. Each player can play one character card, one building card and any number of rebellion cards on his turn.<br/><br/>When the last card is drawn from the playdeck the game ends. Each player is awarded points for buldings and characters he controls, and the one with the most points becomes the King.<br/>It is possible to get bonus points for being the one with the most characters or buildings of each type.<br/><br/>Examples of card effects:<br/>The thief allows you to steal two cards from an opponent's hand, while the saboteur allows you to destroy a building controlled by another player.<br/>The Inn allows you to play an extra character, while the University lets you retrain and replay one of your existing characters.<br/>The Rebellion disables the effect of a Fortress or Cityguard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game Play Description<br/><br/>Exile Sun combines some of the most compelling strategic mechanics in a way that delivers a streamlined, integrated, and fast-paced game of competition and conflict. Simplified deck building, hand management, simultaneous hidden worker placement, a card draft, 6 unique player advantages, and a revolutionary zero-luck combat resolution system ensure that playing Exile Sun is like no other game. Private and public card-based objectives give players options for points, but they must choose carefully when allocating their limited resources. The player with the most points accumulated at the end of three game cycles wins.<br/><br/>A Game Round<br/><br/>The game simply consists of cycles where each player in turn makes four fleet moves and then ends their turn by moving a pawn on the 'Timer Track'. The 'Timer Track' triggers events like 'Supply' and 'Battle' that effect all players simultaneously. Once each event is resolved, the player turns continue.<br/><br/><br/>            Moves - These moves can be regular movement, scanning an enemy fleet, launching a decoy fleet, and initiating a battle.  <br/>            Events - The battle and supply events are resolved with a mechanic that may be best described as simultaneous hidden worker placement. This unique mechanic involves the use of a control card with 10 sliding tabs. The resulting game play is tense, intuitive, and intensely competitive. <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>Theme Overview<br/><br/>Far off and forgotten, orbiting the Exile star, a fragmented group of Colonial powers is struggling to exist in the harsh environment of their foreign home.  Having been unexpectedly cut off from contact with Earth over two hundred years ago, the process of gaining some economic recovery has been slow and arduous.  With dissension rising among the populace, these leaders must compete to gain military, economic, and technological advantages over each other in a race to lead the united colonies in a mission to contact Earth. Time is short. While an outright planetary assault could express dominance in military power, perhaps luring out and destroying an opposing Flagship or Construction Shipyard can have the same effect using fewer resources. Or hit and run assaults with fleets of strike craft can be equally effective. But be warned, leaders dare not neglect their own colony resources, or their supporters will lose faith in them and they&rsquo;ll fall quickly out of the race.<br/><br/>",

A player's turn ends when she can play no more cards, possibly because she has emptied her hand! Two special cards are available with five copies of each; one forces opponents to take cards from the top of a stack and place them in their personal deck, and the other allows a player to play one or more cards at the top of the stack instead of the bottom.<br/><br/>Instead of playing cards on a turn, a player can return any number of cards from her hand to the bottom of her deck, then draw that many cards.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all cards in her deck and her hand wins!<br/><br/>Two variants are included in the rules. First, players play four rounds, and after each round all players score negative points for the number of cards left in their decks and hands, while the player who went out scores three positive points. Second, instead of ignoring the card colors (blue and yellow), you choose whether you must alternate card colors in the stacks or have only a single color of cards in each stack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zombie Fried is a card game where you are a survivor of the Zombie apocalypse.  My fellow Zombies and I now rule the world, and for some reason you humans are trying to prove to each other that you&rsquo;re the best Zombie killer.  You use the few resources that are at your disposal in an attempt to dispose of me and my kin, or to sabotage the other survivors&rsquo; attempts to take out the biggest and best of our kind.<br/><br/>The object of Zombie Fried is to collect the most points in your Brain Pan, because obviously you can&rsquo;t win without the brains.  You do this by (unfairly to me and my friends) bagging Zombies.  For those of you who are not strong enough (or too lazy) to bag Zombies on your own, you can hire a Big Damn Hero, or BDH, to bag Zombies for you.  You and your BDH use whimsical Zombie killing weapons crafted from the meager resources left after the apocalypse, often modifying them with unusual items to make them inflict more damage on us (innocent) Zombies.<br/><br/>As if weapons weren&rsquo;t enough, you use Action Plans to help you achieve your goal, often using those same Action Plans to place traps on us poor, unsuspecting Zombies.  I can&rsquo;t be too upset, however, if you&rsquo;re trapping us to prevent other survivors from killing us.  I also fully support your use of Reality Checks to mess with the other pesky survivors&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>So if you dare to challenge me, Lord Dead &lsquo;N Buried, go ahead and try.   Foil your fellow survivors&rsquo; plans with traps and Reality Checks, equip and enhance your weapons, hire a BDH, and try not to get eaten.  If you&rsquo;re really lucky you might just make it to the Zombie Fried Halls of Honor and Fame.<br/><br/>How many cards are there in the core deck?<br/>There are currently 105 Cards in the core game of Zombie Fried. The game breaks into 2 separate decks that come with the core. Zombies  and Resources.<br/><br/>What types of cards are in the core deck?<br/><br/>     ZOMBIE DECK - Zombies are a unique set of Unique Zombies that are rated from &quot;easy to stomp&quot; all the way up to &quot;I think i just wet myself&quot;. The Zombie cards are what populate your Killing Field.<br/>     RESOURCE DECK - The Resources Deck comes with several different types of cards that a player may run across.<br/>         Action Plans - These little honey of a cards are cards that a player can either play during thier turn in order to help them defeat the zombie. or they can place it face down under a zombie in the Killing Field as a trap or potential trap to steal. You never know which is a trap and which is a good thing to steal from your opponents when going for a trapped zombie. <br/>         Reality Checks -  are fun. they are card you can play against your opponent to make it more difficult for them to defeat their zombie or there are some Reality Checks that stop of auto-fail the combat of your opponent.<br/>    <br/>     WEAPONS &amp; MODIFICATIONS (MODS) - There are a crazy amount of unique weapons to use. each weapon can be modified with a MOD card that will improve the cards attack power. and some other cards allow you to place more than one mod on a weapon.<br/>     BIG DAMN HEROES (BDH) - These are the last of the warrior breed. you can hire them to do your zombie dirty work for you and equip them with all the crazy weapons you have. <br/><br/><br/>",

Each round consists of a series of three tricks. Players start each round with 12 cards in hand and replenish their hands only when the round is over. The largest set played in a single color (or single color plus wild cards) wins the trick. The first trick in each round is worth one point, the second trick worth two and the third worth three. The winner of the first trick in each round becomes the &quot;Wild One,&quot; and only that person is allowed to match wild cards to color cards to increase the size of a color set. The &quot;Wild One&quot; retains this power until another player wins the first trick in a subsequent round. The first player to reach 20 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The box contains a board, 1 teacher figurine, 6 pupil figurines, 1 die, 90 pupil cards, 20 teacher cards and 1 class book.<br/><br/>Once more trouble in the class room, the pupils are busy with everything but their lessons. The teacher is doing his uttermost best to prevent disturbances. Unannounced tests are the most unpleasant means for that. But also tell-tales and careerists are on the side of the teacher. Only those who don't get caught can win the game.<br/><br/>For starters, every pupil gets a figurine and places it on a school bank of his choice on the board. The teacher places his figurine on the desk on the board. Teacher cards and pupil cards are shuffled in separate stacks. Every pupil gets 4 cards from the their stack. The teacher gets 4 cards from his stack.<br/><br/>The pupils get to play their cards before the teacher, they have to keep their card turned up side down. The teacher rolls the die after he has played his card. The die indicates how far the teacher can move in the class room. The pupil sitting next to the teacher has to show his card face up. Depending on the card this pupil gets minus point, a remark in the class book, or nothing at all.<br/><br/>After this all pupils and the teacher place their played card on the discard stack and draw a new card from their stack..<br/>A round ends when the teacher has to play the &quot;end of the hour&quot; card. The next player (clockwise) becomes teacher for the next round. The game comes to an end when every player has played the teacher role and the last teacher has played the &quot;end of the hour&quot; card. The winner of the game is the player with the fewest minus points.<br/><br/>Despite the shared name and the similar-appearing artwork, this is not the same game as Vorsicht Lehrer!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War Cards is a card game based on War, a classic boardgame from Brazil (the later is based on Risk). As well as in the original game, in War Cards each player commands an army and have objectives like conquer certain continents or a number of territories determined in the Objective Cards. Another new feature in War Cards are the special power cards, wich gives various abilities for the player to use. In the boardgame the combats are decided with dice rolls. In War Cards the combats are decided through the cards depicting dice in various combinations. War Cards plays faster than the boardgame (about 45 minutes), and unites strategy with a little luck. The game comes in a plastic box, so you can take it with you wherever you want.<br/><br/>",

It was a time of trouble, which gave birth to the most daring warriors, to strategists of unrivaled cunning, to many a legendary rogue &mdash; all household figures throughout Asia. Now, with                           117 cards and one d6, it is your turn to rise to                           the highest challenge! The fate of the Empire lies in your hands.<br/><br/>The game does not only rely on sound tactics, it also promotes interaction between the players, who can strike a deal at any time. No two games can ever be the same: each one is a challenge, a renewed test of nerve and skills!<br/><br/>The first player to have 6 points worth of land at the beginning of his turn is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Hong Kong edition published 1999 in Chinese; US English edition published 2001.<br/><br/>",

Next, each player is dealt an equal portion of the remaining deck, and must give information to the opponents; s/he must lay down a card of Higher Value, Lower Value, Different Value, and Different Suit.  Players are given notepads in the style of Clue to make notes about what cards are played, and what can't be the Hidden Card of each player. Then, each player takes it in turn to roll the die, and either reveal more information, or guess at the identity of an opponents' card.  Wrong guesses give no penalty, so you may as well try.  If you're right, you get one point for each card remaining in that player's hand.  This creates reverse suspense: players race to be first, because cards are dropped each round, and five points for last with a Hidden Card unguessed isn't enough to overcome someone who nailed two Hidden Cards early on.  After everyone has revealed their card, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Melds are of at least 3 good guy together, 3 bad guys together, or 3 of the same character and are obligatory if possible.  You can add to your own melds and do not have to discard in going out.  There are also some special cards, played as discards, to make it interesting:<br/><br/>Road Block -- Reverse direction and take another turn<br/>Speed Trap -- Next player loses a turn<br/>Parking Ticket -- Next player draws 2, cannot meld or discard<br/>Hazzard County Clout -- Played in response to last 2 cards, reverses effects onto the original player.  No effect if simply discarded.<br/>Hogg Wild -- Next player draws four, cannot meld or discard.<br/><br/>None of these special cards can be picked up from the discard pile except a Hazzard County Clout that has been discarded.  Scoring is the same as rummy, with a 50 point bonus for going out.  First player to 500 wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wands is a fast-paced fantasy card battle for two to five players, combining elements of Uno and Magic: The Gathering.<br/><br/>You play the role of a witch or wizard, engaged in a magical battle with your opponents.  You and your rivals start with 10 life points each.  Using a combination of Blasts (unblockable magicks), Spells, and Counter-Spells, you try to reduce your opponents to zero life points and be the last spellcaster standing.<br/><br/>If you cast a Spell, opponents have a chance to cast their Counter-Spells.  Multiple Counter-Spells can be cast on each other, adding more damage and greater effects, shifting effects, or canceling them altogether.  Imagine one of the wand battles from the Harry Potter movies and you get the idea.  It's quite fun to cast a spell on your buddy, watch someone shift the effects to someone else and add to it, watch someone else shift the effects to yet another player, watch someone dispel that shift, watch the next person dispel that shift, and finally, you shift it back to the original target.<br/><br/>Wands is best with two to five players.  Games can be as short as a couple of minutes, and it shouldn't take more than ten minutes for anyone to learn the rules.<br/><br/>Wands is not a collectible card game.  You only need one set of cards; there's nothing to collect; no booster packs; no rarity; no drafts.  This is the full game.<br/><br/>",

Players have 10 heavy glass marbles in black and white, the same as found in Abalone, and 2 small steel ball bearings.<br/>Players start with their marbles on the opposite side and corner of the grid and move them towards themselves forwards and sideways, but not diagonally. The trick is that before a player moves, they hold the balancing board down on their side, making the marbles roll along the grooves and changing the set up entirely. In addition, the steel balls run in side grooves, affecting the balance of the board and making the game very challenging.<br/>The winner is the first to get their balls across to their corner, but if any balls are left in the opponents corner to block a finish, you lose. <br/>Rules in English, French, Dutch and Swedish.<br/><br/>Was awarded the title &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 1997.<br/><br/>",

Whoever held on to the most provinces on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>To start, every player places his pieces on provinces on the map, every province gets a coin as well. Possible actions per round are determined by throwing 3 dice per player, then placing a chit of this player in the corresponding box. Once every player has rolled and placed his chits the actions are taken, starting with the 1 box up to the 6 box. For every chit in the box one appropriate action is taken by that player.<br/><br/>1, 3 and 5 is a barbarian attack, 2 and 4 allows a player to attack, 6 is taxation.<br/>Attacks are resolved by throwing 3 dice, any double causes one hit and eliminates the defending piece, a triple allows for a barbarian breakthrough and eliminates another piece adjacent to the original defender. Taxation allows for a maximum of three coins taken from the board.<br/><br/>",

While the game's core components offer an easy-to-learn and fast-pace co-op experience, the included &quot;Adventure Packs&quot; not only expand the game, but modify the rulebook itself.<br/><br/>Each player takes control of a ridiculous hero setting off to explore the world of Awful Fantasy and defeat the threats that seek to ruin it. Gameplay is quick and engaging; each player will take their turn by drawing a new threat card and attempting to overcome an existing threat in play. Players will have to overcome specific threats to complete their quest. Once all players complete their quest, the players are victorious! However, if even one hero succumbs to the threats before them, all players are defeated.<br/><br/>The &quot;self-expanding&quot; nature of Awful Fantasy Adventures lets players expand and customize their game at their own pace. Each &quot;Adventure Pack&quot; contains new cards and new rules stickers to apply to the pages of the rules, introducing new powers and new dangers to the game. Play until you've mastered the game, and then crack open an adventure pack for fresh challenges and enticing rewards!<br/><br/>",

Utilizing cards with variables (A, B, C &amp; D) and familiar logical operators such as 'Not', 'And', 'Or', 'If-Then' and the dreaded 'Parenthesis' (and some gotcha cards such as 'Fallacy!'), players take turns creating and changing up to four lines of 'true' statements.  Each player tries to prove that they (their variable) exists (is definitely true) and everyone else...doesn't.  Finally, with the Ergo card, whoever at last exists gets the points.<br/><br/>A fun romp and definitely one for the gray matter in us all.<br/><br/>",

Just like today, this was done through 'legitimate' businesses like laundries, restaurants or antique shops. As players of this canny card game, we must take our dirty money and invest it in money-making small enterprises. To do this, we have the use of a powerful Familia.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, other clans have something against us being able to successfully found our enterprises. So, in this game, a legitimate business only comes into being after a hefty clan war. The player who manages to make the most 'clean' money is crowned the head mafioso. But if someone should manage to open one of each of the different business types, he is crowned prince of the island without a fight.<br/><br/>",

The deck is made up of 135 cards in 7 different colored suits. Each suit is made up of 17 color cards and 2 colored Stop cards. The remaining 2 cards are Superstop cards.<br/><br/>The basic flow of the game is that everyone grabs cards with one hand and puts it into their other hand until a stop card surfaces and someone yells &quot;Stop &lt;color&gt;&quot; for the color of the stop card. Any players in the process of picking up a card can add this card to their pile. Then, each player counts the number of cards of that color and the player with the fewest (or tied for the fewest) cards in that color receives a -1 card from the initial stock of 15 -1 cards. Additionally, if any player has cards out of order in their hand (not grouped by color), they receive an additional -1. The player who called the Stop then calls Go and the mayhem continues. Superstops cause the play to be stopped and the total number of cards to be compared, with the person with the fewest cards receiving a -1. The game ends immediately when the last -1 card is given out, and the winner is the player with the fewest -1 cards.<br/><br/>",

The marks generally mean:<br/>T1 - The spinner, or pirate in this case, takes one (1) Ante from the pot.<br/>T2 - The spinner takes two (2) Antes from the pot.<br/>P1 - The spinner Re-Antes one (1) into the pot<br/>P2 - The spinner Re-Antes two (2) into the pot<br/>AP - The spinner and &quot;All Players&quot; Re-Ante one (1) into the pot<br/>TA - The spinner &quot;Takes All&quot;<br/><br/>The spinner establishes the &quot;Ante&quot; amount to start a round. There can be any number of rounds to a game. The &quot;Ante&quot; can be anything from a set amount of money, to goats. That's why soldiers and pirates loved this game! Any spinner can start a round of play. The top can be passed in any direction as long as it maintains that same direction the entire round.<br/><br/>This game is a simple repackaging of traditional Teetotum or the later 60's version Put & Take Game<br/><br/>",

These artefacts all together allow to close the gate open by the Chaos monsters. Use your weapons cleverly and help your fellow hunters by providing them ammunition, but in the end, only one hero will build up their name and get glory.<br/><br/>During your turn in Last Heroes, you choose one of the weapon cards from your hand and play it in:<br/><br/><br/>     Your supply area (with its ammunitions then being available to opponents), or<br/>     Your attack area (using the ammunition available in your or the other players' supply area).<br/><br/><br/>Then you can attack one monster provided that you have the required weapons. When you kill a boss (in the third row), the player who has made a dent in the second row gets an artefact. If you directly kill a boss (without making a dent first), you need more weapons but you score the artefact for yourself. The game may end in two ways:<br/><br/><br/>     Immediately when the players get all the artefacts (in which case, each Artefact scores 5 points),<br/>     OR after ten turns (in which case, the Artefacts do not score).<br/><br/><br/>Last Heroes is both collaborative and competitive. You need the other players' ammunition to load your weapons, and in return you help them by making a dent in the monsters' rows. The winner is the player who has killed the most valuable monsters and provided the most ammunitions to their fellow hunters.<br/><br/>",

Throughout the race, everyone searches for iconic Disney objects and gets a chance to say, &ldquo;I found it!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Set the clock to 1:00. Once the game starts the clock is ticking and players must work together to get to Cinderella&rsquo;s castle before the clock strikes midnight. On your turn, spin the spinner and either move, search, or tick the clock forward. If you spin the golden Mickey Mouse ear, it&rsquo;s time to search! Flip over a Search Card and everyone starts looking for the item on the card. For each item a player finds that is one step forward for all <br/>players. If all players arrive at the castle before the clock strikes midnight everyone wins!<br/><br/>For the 2015 Dreamworks version Dreamworks Eye Found It! (English edition 2015): <br/>Celebrate your favorite DreamWorks characters and find hidden treasures throughout the six-foot game board!<br/><br/>Explore eight exquisite lands inspired by your favorite DreamWorks films! Join beloved characters like Donkey from Shrek, the Penguins of Madagascar, Po from Kung Fu Panda, and many more in a thrilling adventure through the six-foot game board. It&rsquo;s collaborative fun where together everyone gets to shout, &ldquo;I found it!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Shuffle the search cards and put them in a pile face down. Spin the spinner, move the number of spaces indicated, if you get a search follow the card directions, if you get a movie snack take one from the snack pile. Get to the end of the game board to win.<br/><br/>Changes from Richard Scarry's Busytown: Eye found it! Game:<br/><br/>- Different board configurations. The movement track in the Disney game is noticeably longer and more complex (there are 2-3x more spaces on the board in the Disney version).<br/><br/>- The spinner wheel for Busytown is numbered 1-4, so a player moves at most 4 spaces on his/her turn. For the Disney version, the spinner is numbered 1-8.<br/><br/>- Different player count. Busytown is for 2-4 players; Disney is for 1-6 players.<br/><br/>- Busytown has a built in timer. There are food pieces that the pigs are eating. The players must all get to the ferry, which leaves when they all arrive. Then, they go the the picnic island. The more food left, the higher the score. In the Disney version, all the players win or lose.<br/><br/>",

This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his &quot;Kampf&quot; in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's &quot;Iron Dream&quot;, a pulp-tale about &quot;Ubermenschen&quot; conquering a future world filled with mutant &quot;scum.&quot; The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed in an apparent attempt to avoid infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book.<br/><br/>",

Yes, it includes both rounds of play -- Jeopardy and Double Jeopardy. And, yes, Daily Doubles, too.  But it's got more. Specially designed Simpsons art really makes the game board extra fun, and The Simpsons play money could never be mistaken for real bucks. So jump on the sofa and join the fun!<br/><br/>",

The object is to get four in a row, whether on one level or between all four levels, straight or diagonal. It is essentially a Tic-Tac-Toe game in a 4x4x4 cube.<br/><br/>The cube needs to be emptied before start. Each player choose a color of their pieces and take turn to place their pieces in vacant positions, one piece at a time. The player wins who first gets four in a row of his own pieces - either horizontal, vertical or diagonal. A player cannot remove or replace pieces that have already been placed. If all positions are occupied without anyone having four in a row, then the game is called a tie.<br/><br/>A rule that makes it less advantageous to begin is to prohibit the first player from placing his first piece in either a corner position or in one of the eight center positions.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    3D Tic Tac Toe - which is played on 3x3x3 grid<br/>    4tec - which is the same game on the 4x4x4 grid also<br/>    Flix - which uses dice to control placement of men on 4x4x4 grid <br/>    Four Letter Words - played on 4x4x4 grid, though with words<br/>    Q4 - which also played on 4x4x4 grid but with only 12 markers<br/>    Tetrano - which is the same game represented on a 4x4 board.<br/>    Qubic - which has a version for 3 players also<br/>    Score Four - 4x4 grid of pegs that are filled from the bottom up<br/>    Dimensions (1970), Hi!Noon: Das Duell (2009), Tic Tac Turn (2011), and X: Die 4.

Which of the seven will visit your trade house is up to you and your trader opponents. With the revenues you earn, you can open new trade houses or enlarge an existing trade house by building a second, third or fourth floor&mdash;all with the goal of earning yet more revenue. Pay attention, though, for one customer might visit in the safety of twilight to steal and send you into poverty.

The player with the Controller card turns the card face up and then must pick one other player to go on a mission.   The players with the Rebel and Informant cards will try to convince the Controller to pick them (without showing their card).<br/><br/>If the Controller picks the Rebel, both those players win.  If the Controller picks the Informant, the Informant player wins.<br/><br/>The game can be expanded to 4-5 players with a second set.<br/><br/>",

Each game adds to all prior games until Game 21, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, is attained.<br/><br/>As well as building WFFs (Well Formed Formulas), players must also try to reach a goal by using rules of inference.<br/><br/>For example: If the goal is 'p', a player could use the 'Ko' (or Conjunction Out) rule and use 'Kpq' as a premise.  In other terms, if the following sentence is true: &quot;The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy and the last games of WFF 'n PROOF are hard.&quot;  Then it can be inferred that the following sentence is true: &quot;The first games of WFF 'N PROOF are easy.&quot;<br/><br/>Up to 36 dice are rolled depending on the game being played.  One player sets a 'goal' by building a WFF in the goal area of the playing mat.  players then alternate playing dice to the &quot;permitted&quot; or &quot;essential&quot; sections of the play area.  If a die is placed in the essential area it MUST be used in either a premise or a rule.  If a player doesn't think that it can be used, he can challenge his opponent.<br/><br/>To win, a player must make a successful challenge or be unsuccessfully challenged.<br/><br/>Games 3 through 19 introduce the 11 Rules of Logical Inference in this order: Conjunction, Implication, Reiteration, Disjunction, Negation, and Equivalence.  Then 18 more derived rules are added to the mix for Game 20, the PC (Propositional Calculus) game.  The 21st and final game, Frantic WFF 'N PROOF, takes the PC game and adds timed moves for rapid and chaotic scoring.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monopoly with a couple of interesting twists.  For kids, the most interesting twists are the canine theme.  All the markers are dogs, the spaces around the board are different breeds, jail has become &quot;the pound&quot; and the houses are actually doghouses.  Community Chest and Chance morph into Trees and Telephone poles (less sophomoric than it sounds) and instead of bank error in your favor you get rewarded for running off the dogcatcher or you have to go to the vet. The theme encourages a more light hearted approach than the serious real estate game.<br/><br/>For adults the best &quot;twists&quot; are those that speed up the action.  The game does not require you to own all the territories of a given color before you can build a doghouse.  You can only build as many doghouses as you have territories of that color, but you don't have to own them all.  For instance, yellow in Dogopoly has three territories, if you own two of them you could have two doghouses on each, even if the third is unowned, or even owned by another player.  Whenever you first buy a territory you are also given the option to immediately buy a doghouse at half-price.  Taken together these little twists make the game go much faster.<br/><br/>There are few other twists, like the addition of shortcut paths across the board that can reroute players.<br/><br/>",

The game starts with Earth's population of 6 billion divided between up to 6 factions, including at least one Neutral faction. Players send out colonists and migrants to harvest the riches of the planets and their moons, and the Asteroid Belt. Natural growth limits, plus the Four Riders Of The Apocalypse (War, Famine, Pestilence and Death), slow the growth of your populations. Score points at the end of the game for the biggest and most widespread populations - score double for your HIDDEN AGENDA, or any DISCOVERY cards you hold. Score points during the game for cards played which 'help' the Neutral(s) and other players' populations (in various wicked ways!). Brief Optional Rules allow a player to adjust the otherwise random turn order, and to score bonus points for having a populace which is wealthy, happy or concerned for all life (not just humans).<br/><br/>",

The interesting part is that there is also a visual component as well.

The game is very fast paced and a lot of fun.  The graphics on the DVD menus and the changes are very nice to watch.

Because if the prediction displeases His Majesty, your own future may not look too bright...<br/><br/>In Oraklos, players predict the future by throwing many-colored dice onto the table.

Then, arrange the dice in a chain by matching either color or number.  The first die in your chain must match the number of the last number written on your board.<br/><br/>For example, the last number on your board is a 5.  Your chain could start with a red 5, then continue with a blue 5, a blue 3, and end with a blue 2.  When you have finished creating your chain, write those numbers in the spaces on your player board.  Finally, call out the color and number of the last die in your chain.  Any player who is able to match that number to the last number written on their board may write it down.  The player whose board matches the color of the number you called out can always write the number, even if it doesn't match.<br/><br/>Use wilds, draw 1s and minus 1s to help yourself and hinder your opponents.  The first player to fill in all the empty spaces on their board wins!<br/><br/>",

Parents pick from the Parents deck of cards, filled with phrases parents might say to kids such as &quot;This playroom is a positive pigsty!&quot; Kids get to choose from the Kids deck filled with things kids might say such as &quot;What a bummer, brother.&quot; Players read the phrase as best as they can to their teammates, but it's not so easy to do as the timer counts down and the mouthpiece is hindering them from forming words correctly. The laughter continues as players try to decipher what in the world their teammate is trying to say, and must correctly guess the phrase in order to earn the card. The team with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is a simpler version of Pass the Pigs, where little pig figurines are cast and points are scored according to how they land. However, the main difference is that instead of two pigs, the game comes with five; and there is no 'jeopardy' element in the game. Players simply cast the pigs and take their score, then the next player takes their turn.<br/><br/>",

The color sets the speed at which you fly, but if black appears you are forced to land and do repairs, by paying back cards.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is a new take on the collectible non-collectible KB line, with Jeffrey Neil Bellinger once again putting the rabbits through the grinder. Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.<br/><br/>When the insatiable appetite of Killer Bunnies game fans demanded more, Playroom looked to Killer Bunnies creator and game designer Jeffrey Neil Bellinger to coordinate the development of, like other games in the Killer Bunnies family, a non-collectible game that can offer variations through different color nick-named deck options. However, this time a new desire expressed by the huge Killer Bunnies fan-base has been fulfilled: Killer Bunnies now has a constructable game variation. Though still not collectible or random, players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey  six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.<br/><br/>The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.<br/><br/>Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey is the latest in the family of Killer Bunnies games which features, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Remix, Kinder Bunnies: Their First Adventure and Killer Bunnies and the Journey to Jupiter.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to individual starter decks (A-decks) and expansion decks (B-, C-, D- and E-decks), the following products are offered.  Each of the combination decks come with a promo card for each deck included.<br/><br/>     Heroic and Azoic (Violet, Red, and Blue A-decks)<br/>     Lively and Spry (Green, Orange, and Yellow A-decks)<br/>     Elementals vs. Animals (Violet and Orange A- and B-decks)<br/>     Energy vs. Crops (Red and Green A- and C-decks)<br/>     Technology vs. Land (Blue and Yellow A- and D-decks)<br/><br/><br/>Killer Bunnies: Heroes vs. Villains – Blue Starter Deck includes (in fact, consists of) the Blue, Green, and Yellow E-decks.<br/><br/>",

Many of the invaders have special abilities, and so does much of the equipment - these are listed on the cards where relevant.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, they choose between 1 and 3 equipment cards to draw and the same number of invaders are drawn and placed face down. The player then chooses how many of the invaders they wish to fight. That number of cards is turned over, beginning from the first card dealt. The player must then play Equipment on the Monster cards to defeat them and claim the corpses.<br/><br/>If they succeed in defeating the enemies, they chose to fight, it becomes the next player's turn.

You raise your hand giving your troops the order to attack. The die is cast, the battle begins.<br/><br/>Fantasy Dice Battles is a strategic and tactical game for two players. Each player leads an army fighting a fierce battle where only one can be the winner. Each army is split on three battalions (each composed of five units and a hero). The objective of the game is to defeat two opponent's heroes before he does.<br/><br/>The game has two stages:<br/><br/>- Set Up stage (Strategic) where players select the units that will compose his battalions from the units available to his chosen faction.<br/><br/>- Battle stage (Tactical), where players play order cards on battalions in order to roll attack dice that will remove opponent's units until one of the defeat the opponent's army.<br/><br/>On each turn, players place an order card face down on each battalion, then both players reveal the order cards and place on them a number of attack dice as a result of the order card played, matched units on the battalion, and special powers of the card. Those dice are rolled and assigned to units on the opponent's battalion. If an unit gets more dice than its morale the unit is removed from the battalion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How many of you remember the old videogames of the '80s &ndash; '90s where you had to be extremely skilled in cabinet to strip completely super-pixelled girls?<br/><br/>Oppai Go has been created from this idea, a &ldquo;strategic&rdquo; game in which each player has a sexy female alter ego taken on a desert island as a sort of &ldquo;Battle Royale&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Hunger Games&rdquo;, with the exception of only wearing underwear. Unfortunately the fate is not by your side (or maybe yes?), because you will be &ldquo;forced&rdquo; to use every means at your disposal to fully undress your opponents and try to earn your way back home.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).<br/><br/>The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:<br/>1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side<br/>2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)<br/>3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)<br/>4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)<br/>5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)<br/><br/>The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.<br/><br/>Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.<br/><br/>The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.<br/><br/>The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.<br/><br/>This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.<br/><br/>",

Six are randomly selected from the three new breed colors, and the other two from the five breeds already presented in the Starter Set.<br/><br/>Each booster has 3 Fester fiend dice, 2 Rot fiend dice, 1 Stench fiend die, and 2 random dice from the starter races.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is for one to as many people want to play.  As described in the rules there are 2 CUPONK (Ping Pong with graphics) balls and a 30 Card &quot;Trick Deck&quot; that the player draws from, it illustrates a specific trick to attempt and the number of tries to complete it.<br/><br/>If the player completes the trick in the amount of tries given they collect the card and the next player draws a new trick.  If the player fails to complete the trick in the number of tries, then the next player attempts the same trick.  Follow the same rules for completing the trick.  If all players fail, then discard the trick and move on to the next trick card, it would now be the original first player's turn again.<br/><br/>You can play until any preset goal you want, first to three tricks, five tricks, or until the deck is gone and count up the totals.  The game even recommends combining 2 or more trick cards into &quot;Expert&quot; tricks.<br/><br/>Each of the three versions has their own trick deck, so if you purchased all three you can combine them into one 90 card deck.  Also included are blank cards for making up your own.<br/>It's actually way more fun than you would think, and the cup lights up and makes sound effects unique to the version you purchased.  The cards are really just stepping stones to making your own even more elaborate tricks.<br/><br/>-----From the Box-----<br/><br/>What exactly is CUPONK? The object: sink your ball into the cup and light it up. Get it in and you&rsquo;ll hear the sweet sounds of victory, YEAH! You rock. Miss the shot and your friends get the chance to one-up you. When playing CUPONK your entire home can become a legitimate playing field. Tables, walls, chairs &ndash; IT&rsquo;S ON! Test out sick trick shots like Door Jam, Stairing Contest and Wall Banger. What you don&rsquo;t like the names? Okay tough guy, make up your own! <br/>Show your skill and sink sick shots. Features lights and crazy (gorilla / wild wrestling / killer zombie) sounds! Includes 1 CUPONK cup, 2 CUPONK balls, 30 trick cards, a ramp accessory and instruction guide. <br/>Requires 3 AAA batteries (not included). For 1 or more player(s). Ages 9 and up. <br/>[Taken from HASBRO Site]<br/><br/>There are three versions in the first wave: Gorillanator, El Campeon, Let it R.I.P.<br/><br/>The second wave includes three versions: Boomshakalaka, Monsterosity, King of L.A.<br/><br/>A deluxe edition, Le Flush Royale,was released alongside the second wave. It includes a cup with a plastic lid/backboard, Cuponk head band, five stickers, six balls, a set of thirty cards and instructions.<br/><br/>There are also two different sets of extra balls. They each include seven new balls and five stickers.<br/><br/>",

Naturally you and your fellow devils aren't pleased with this situation, so you're trying to surround yourself with as many hot things as possible in order to keep the home fires burning, so to speak. Can you end up on top down below?<br/><br/>In Dice Devils each player takes on the role of one of six devils, each ranked from 1 to 6 and each with a different special ability. On a turn, players roll their dice in secret, then one by one they each choose one of the hot items on offer on the table, starting with devil #1. When players have chosen the same item, then their dice and special abilities come into play to see who gets the goods. Fewer items are available each round than the number of players, so conflict must take place!<br/><br/>Don't think you can rely on that ability the entire game, though, as a devil's rank in Hell is never secure and the top devil might find himself demoted to Clean Freak or Problem Child. In the end, whichever devil collects the most valuable hot stuff wins!<br/><br/>",

These days not storks but steel cranes are characteristic features of Polish landscape. Building and structures are being erected everywhere. New ribbons of asphalt cut through the fields. Sleek spans of slender bridges join river banks. Ring roads encircle towns and cities. Multi-level junctions resemble gigantic works of abstract art. Polish engineers use state-of-the-art technology and heavy construction equipment. Local communities wholeheartedly support the development of transport infrastructure. An architect, a landscaper, a construction mech operator have become dream professions for a child and ideal occupations of a prospective son-in-law.<br/>Welcome to Poland! Soon, 100 years after Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski and Tadeusz Wenda the country on the Vistula will need you for the national construction effort.<br/><br/>Under construction: Poland is a family board game, which with the subtle touch of irony and strong sensce of humor treats of building roads and highways in Poland. Players become managers, their goal is to finish all the contracted jobs faster than the opponents. Engineers, workers and dozens of very special machines are ready to start.<br/><br/>During their turn players decide either they work in the office or on the building site.<br/>In the office players draw cards from the market and use special cards such as: Recruiter, Archaeologist, Supplier or Site Manager. Those cards make the game easier for the player, but harder for the opponents.<br/>On the building site players bulid infrastructure by discarding relevant cards and placing tokens on the map. They can also get rid of Arachaelogist or use special cards: Local Community or Employee of the Month. <br/>After finishing one of assigned contracts player gets 3 extra cards from the market.<br/>Whoever complete all of his/her contracts first is the winner of the game.<br/>The players have different number of contracts and infrastructures to be build, but the game is very well balanced.<br/><br/>The biggest advantages of the game are illustrations and high quality of materials used for its production. The board consists of 16 elements, shaped with great likeness to the polish voivodships. The network of roads and highway reflects ambitious plans of national infrastructure. Last but not least, few dozens of tokens and over 150 beautifully painted cards makes this game a &ldquo;must have&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

Place the five 1s in the center of the table, then shuffle the remaining cards and deal them out among the players, with each player forming a face-down draw pile. On a turn, a player first sees whether she can play the top card of her discard stack onto a pile in the center of the table (with numbers always being placed in ascending order) or on an opponent's discard pile (with both ascending and descending plays being valid). After this, the player draws her top card and plays it in a similar manner, if possible. If a player has a choice of location, she chooses as she wishes.<br/><br/>If someone makes a mistake when playing a card, any opponent can shout &quot;Schlafm&uuml;tze&quot;, then all of the opponents give the top card of their deck to the player who goofed.<br/><br/>If a player empties her draw deck, she flips over her discard stack at the start of her next turn. As soon as a player is out of cards, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>Schlafm&uuml;tze is a slightly altered remake of a traditional card game, so no designer is credited for it.<br/><br/>",

Base gamers, who do not have this wheel are left to consult a chart which cross-references the results.  The Play wheel streamlines the game--and decreases the down time significantly.<br/><br/>The game is played in quarters like in regular football, timed by the use of a time-deck.  Coaches can implement double-teams, and run trick plays versus the other.<br/><br/>The offensive plays available in the expansion set was significant to opening up the play books for each coach, including never-before-seen plays on both sides of the ball.  Additionally, certain players were hybrid players.<br/><br/>The most notable of these was the Kordell Stewart card which we used to call &quot;slash&quot; like his on the field nickname:  Because he is a QB/WR/RB, and has stats which are superlative for all three positions.  This makes him a valuable asset to any team.<br/><br/>Special Rare and Ultra-Rare cards allowed special abilities or results to be played from the hand of either coach, assisting in particular offensive and defensive plays.  Some cards also result in penalties, fumbles, interceptions, and big plays.<br/><br/>",

The Dark Lords have joined forces to completely conquer and subjugate all the known Lands, and only the combined efforts of all the greatest heroes can halt their nefarious plan.<br/><br/>12 Realms is a fast, lighthearted cooperative miniature game for 1 to 6 players. All players must band together to stop the Dark Lords' overwhelming hordes from pillaging the 12 Realms. Individual invaders can be defeated by using each hero's different talents, but to vanquish the Dark Lords you must claim a powerful artifact.<br/><br/>In their quest to stop the invasion, the heroes can travel together between different lands, or they can try to single-handedly defend a Realm. Each of the 12 Realms is an individual land, with different treasures and events, and populated by unique creatures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1932, Finance was first published through L. S. Ayres &amp; Co, and then by Electronic Laboratories. The name was changed to Finance after legal council advised game developer Dan Layman that the name &quot;Monopoly&quot; was (at that time) in the public domain.<br/><br/>Lizzie Magie first copyrighted the game in 1903, in slightly different form, under the name The Landlord's Game, and this game was made by hand in small quantities and was distributed mostly by individuals.  At this time, the name &quot;Monopoly&quot; was first used to describe the game.<br/><br/>Though slight differences appeared in regional play of the game, the game was remarkably similar to the Darrow version of Monopoly.  Parker Brothers wanted to promote the Charles Darrow version of the game, even though they knew that it was not Mr. Darrow's creation.<br/><br/>However, Dan Layman had already published Finance, and the game had been around for years. According to a Time Magazine article dated February 17th, 1936:<br/><br/>&quot;I wrote the entire rulebook for the game of Finance in 1931 (copyrighted 1932) and simplified the old game of Monopoly for manufacturing purposes...&quot; --Dan Layman<br/><br/>&quot;Almost exactly this same game as played at Williams was put on the market in Indianapolis early in 1932 through L. S. Ayres &amp; Co. The name was changed to Finance for trademark reasons... &quot;<br/><br/>This was the only article published which contradicted what would become Parker Brothers' assertion that it had published the original Monopoly, and that Layman's version was a spin-off.<br/><br/>In 1936, Layman had forced the retraction by Time of an article from two weeks earlier, titled &quot;Monopoly and Politics&quot;.  What was unknown to Time was that Layman had sold Finance to a small games manufacturer, David W. Knapp, the originator of the popular 1930s games &quot;Krazy-Ikes&quot; and the &quot;Knapp Electric Questioner&quot;.<br/> Knapp's Finance game was stiff competition to Darrow's Monopoly, and outsold it at a 10 to 1 ratio. In fact, Knapp Electric had just begun national distribution. To eliminate this legal and commercial threat to their newly acquired Monopoly game, Parker Brothers purchased the rights to Finance from Knapp for $10,000 -- a significant sum at the time. But it was a far cry from the millions in royalties that were paid to Charles Darrow.<br/><br/>Parker Brothers changed Finance so it was less similar to Monopoly and in 1935 created a front organization called the Finance Game Company in order to market the game. Parker Brothers made additional changes in 1936 and published it with the Parker Brothers name, after which the Finance Game Company was never heard from again.<br/><br/>",

But it's not quite that simple as not all of the components have the right form &ndash; and players can try to use their construction workers on the lower floors to block out others.<br/><br/>Players have 5 workers, and are dealt a hand of building tiles. The tiles, in combination with rivets which fit through holes in the center, create a 3-dimensional construction. The tiles have grids in various configurations, and some have a construction worker. On your turn, take 3 actions. Options include placing a worker, moving a worker up a level, or building = adding a tile to the construction (which must touch the tile on which one of that player's workers is standing); score points = 1 per girder touching a girder already built, +1 if worker on tile, doubled if the new tile is now the highest built. There are penalties if you drop tiles or worker tokens, but otherwise you generally alternate taking turns adding tiles to the building.<br/><br/>The rivets are placed in an hole in the center of the tile and can be fitted to other tiles already in play. There are some (few) construction rules and the building will grow turn after turn. Where add tiles is an important decision but you also need a certain amount of precision and dexterity doing that because if you cause the fall of a worker (yours of opponent) you will loose points. Actually an important part of the game is placing your workers in a way that make much more difficult to opponents to add tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends prematurely if someone collapses the building; they lose, and whoever is furthest on the score track (after deducting points for tiles remaining in hand) wins the game. Otherwise, most points (after all tiles built) wins!<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to create a path of bridges from station to station that matches a randomly selected shared binary pattern, while protecting your own path from sabotage by other players and while looking for ways to attack your opponents' paths.<br/><br/>Players take turns positioning black and white bridge arrows (shared resources) or their own player pieces. Player rings may only be placed where a legal partial path leads from the player's own base post. If an opponent undermines this path, the player's rings are removed from the board.<br/><br/>The game is dynamic, deeply strategic, and highly competitive. In the 3 and 4 player variations, additional strategic aspects of forming temporary alliances or fomenting discord between one's opponents also become important aspects of the game play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>The Gnumies &amp; their friends from the planet Gnum love big Parties! They like to see Borsis, Dancemites, Boggelors or Divalettis as guests at their parties. But no one wants the dreaded Wullawakis at his party. The Gnummies &amp; their friends are shown on the Gnumies card, &amp; the guests on the party cards. There are 4 of each party card valued from 1 to 10, &amp; one of each party card valued from 11 to 15. The players try to win the most party cards, worth the most points, by playing their Gnumie cards. If a player has 2 or more party cards of the same value, their value multiplies, (2 of kind gets you 20 points, 3 of a kind 50 points and 4 of a kind 100 points). These of course can only be done with the cards that are valued from 1 to 10. A player who wins a Wullawaki, loses points. Having 1 Wullawaki will force you to lose the lowest valued party card that you have. Having 2 Wullawakis will force you to lose the highest valued party card in his party room. With 3 or more Wullawakis, the player will discard as many party cards as he has Wullawakis, (players choice in this case). Of course, the player with the most points at the end of the game is the WINNER!!!<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/><br/>1) Any player turns over the top-most card in the party supply stack. <br/>2) Now each player selects a Gnumie card from his hand (Cards have a value from 10 to 100), and places it face-down in front of him (in his Party Room!). When all players have placed their bids face-down on the table, all players then reveal their bids. <br/>3) The player who played the highest valued bid in his party room wins the face-up party card. <br/>4) If 2 or more players tie with the highest bid, the player who has the the most Luckynits (small figures at the bottom of each Gnumie card), wins the party card. <br/>5) The player who wins the party card must discard the Gnumie card that he won with that bid. <br/>6) The other players take back their losing bid party cards. The round is now over and we repeat with Step 1 again.<br/><br/>7) There is a little twist in the bidding when the Wullawaki card (bad card) comes out. The player with the highest Gnumie card still wins the Wullawaki card, but gets to take back his Gnumie card into his hand and the other players lose their Gnumie cards!<br/><br/>8) The is also a &quot;WILD CARD&quot; in this game. It is called the &quot;COPICASTOR&quot;. It is a card used to make at least a pair of party cards. The Copicastor takes on the form of the lowest valued party card that the player has in his party room. This insures that a player will have at least a pair of cards and also make the low valued cards somewhat valuable to have, since some people may avoid making a high bid on a low value card. But, if you get this Copicastor it makes that low valued card at least worth 20 points (for a pair).<br/><br/>9) The game ends when 1 player is left with his Gnumie cards. Since, he can't bid against anybody else, he takes the top most party cards as he has Gnumie cards in his hand.<br/><br/>10) Scoring is based on attaining pairs, three-of-a-kind &amp; 4-of-a-kind of the numbered party cards that the players bid on (check the Overview paragraph above). If no pairs are attained, the value of that card is scored. So, if you have two 5-point cards, you score 20 Points for having a pair. But, if you have only one 5-point card you score 5 points!<br/><br/>10) The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!!!<br/><br/>Ages 8 and up<br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Asterix: Das Kartenspiel<br/><br/><br/>",

It is easy to learn and fun for the whole family! Each player is dealt 5 cards and the remaining cards are placed face down in the center of the table to be used as the draw pile. Players should maintain 5 cards in their hand at all times until they hit &ldquo;Top Speed.&rdquo; Players do this by drawing after each turn. At the end of their turn, players must call out their current speed. To start the game, players place a card from their hand on the playing surface in front of them, face up. This is the &ldquo;Speed Pile.&rdquo; Players have their own active speed piles they are trying to increase to 200MPH. Players track their speed using their &ldquo;Speed-O-Meter&rdquo; by adjusting the wheel at the end of each turn. This process is repeated until someone reaches &ldquo;Top Speed,&rdquo; but players must try to avoid the Blow Out, Caution, and Pit Stop cards along the way! Start your engines, you are ready to play!<br/><br/>",

To win, find out who did it, where, when, how, and why.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a card game that shares some similarities with Clue, but adds some other questions to the mix, like what time of day did it happen, and what was the killer's motive? To the usual process of elimination and deduction found in most Clue-type games, they've added scoring elements.  You can collect sets of clues and reveal them to score points.  Obviously, though, this aids the other players as well by eliminating some categories.<br/><br/>You start with a number of cards, each of which contains a specific clue. As play progresses, you can attempt to accumulate all the clues in a category, which will earn you points based on what turn you choose to reveal your set.<br/><br/>Each turn, you are allowed to direct a question to a specific player.  The question must be answerable with a number.  For example, you may ask &quot;How many Cookie Carpenter cards do you have?&quot;  or  &quot;How many Jealousy cards have you seen?&quot;  Doing this will help you eliminate some of the icons (clues) on your score sheet.<br/><br/>Your other option during your turn is to make an accusation. You need to be careful though, since this also will end the game! On the other hand, you do get some bonus points for being the First Accuser.<br/><br/>Cards are passed after each player's turn. For the first round it is only one, but it increases by 1 for every round the game lasts.<br/><br/>Once someone decides to accuse, all players can make any guesses they want to, filling in the answers they've come up with for each category (Suspect, Place, Weapon, Emotion).  You can also fill in the specific answer within a category for more points. The problem with guessing, though, is that wrong answers result in negative points, and the First Accuser loses double!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Wheel of Time CCG is based on the novels of the same name, penned by Robert Jordan, and later, Brandon Sanderson. One player takes the side of the light and the Dragon Reborn, while another takes the side of the shadow and the Forsaken, in a struggle for control of the Pattern, the ultimate fabric and destiny of the universe.<br/><br/>Each player requires his or her own Hero or Villain deck to play. Each deck features a major character from the Wheel of Time book series. The light side player chooses a hero to play with while the shadow player uses a villain deck. Characters in the side of light include series protagonists Rand al'Thor, Matrim Cauthon, Perrin Aybara, and the other characters of good found within the books. Characters for the shadow include dark friends, as well as Rahvin and the other chosen.<br/><br/>The players attempt to sway the Pattern to their side and amass the might needed to defeat his or her opponent in the final Pattern challenge and win the game. Along the way players will engage in politics, marshaling of armies, magic, and intrigue in an effort to bring characters, troops, and entire kingdoms onto their side.<br/><br/>The core of the Wheel of Time CCG involves rolling dice. Characters and troops, each have different stats corresponding to their skill in politics, intrigue, combat and the one power. These stats translate into dice rolls, used to win challenges and to generate resources.<br/><br/>Every turn, players commit their characters and troops into challenges. Challenges are done via playing challenge cards or initiating the pattern challenge, which is the ultimate objective for both the light and shadow. Unassigned characters and troops can be used to generate resources which in turn, can summon more allies or to attach buffs called advantages.<br/><br/>Players then contest challenges by comparing dice rolls of their committed characters and troops. The attacking player attempts to roll swords in the in-game custom dice, while the defending player attempts to roll shields. Winning challenge cards grant advantages based on card text, while winning the Pattern challenge may place Pattern tokens toward the side of the victorious player.<br/><br/>End game triggers upon both players having a total of twenty Pattern tokens, together with any neutral tokens generated during play. The game then proceeds to the final challenge, where the players fight for dominance, again rolling the dice generated by their characters and troops, but this time, adding their Pattern tokens toward their success rolls.<br/><br/>",

Also they collect power and gold (both represented by cardboard chips). Every turn, a player gets one more card (selected from 1-3 cards turned over).<br/>Players can also perform special actions (e.g. get gold, get power, exchange cards with other players, destroy cards or power from other players) if they have a) the most cards in an ability, b) a special card which can be bought in an auction, or c) pay gold.<br/>In the end, players gain points for having power, gold and certain cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This dexterity game consists of a long wooden board with holes cut at various intervals marked with increasingly higher point values.<br/><br/>Attached to the board are two long metal rods, slightly above the scoring holes.  The rods are placed just slightly narrower than a large steel ball that is placed on the rods at the base of the board.<br/><br/>Players must attempt to slide the rods apart and make the ball roll &quot;uphill&quot; before it drops into a score hole.  Making it to a higher scoring hole takes quite a bit of concentration as width of the rods at the highest scoring hole is roughly the diameter of the ball.<br/><br/>The first person to score 5,000 or more points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

One team draws an orange card and secretly comes up with an answer &quot;e.g something that makes people laugh&quot; and places it face down. <br/>The performer for the other team looks at the answer without showing anybody and then turns over the top purple card which shows the activty and how many points for guessing the answer. <br/>There are 5 possible activities: Cameo - acting out the answer, Cloodle- drawing the answer, Listofacto - describe it by using no more than 3 facts, Grilleps - spelling it backwards and Choose it - you get to pick which activty you want. Lots of fun and laughter! <br/>If you are successful, keep the purple card and the points - you've earned it! Then the other team has a turn.

Play dominoes on their corresponding spaces on the game board. As you complete squares, you conquer territories and claim them as your own. Dominate the game board and you win! For ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>From a review in &quot;Games Quarterly&quot;, Winter 2005:<br/><br/>The Domination board is a seven-by-seven grid of squares with sets of numbers that resemble half a domino at each corner. Each player starts with seven dominoes. When it's your turn, you lay down a domino along one edge of a square so that the numbers on both corners match your domino. Then you draw another domino.<br/><br/>If your play closes off the fourth side of a square, you put a poker chip in the center of that square to claim it. You keep playing until all the dominoes are used, which fills up the entire board. At that point, the player with the most chips on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Sometimes the phrases pair well with the accents, but for the most part they don&rsquo;t &mdash; and that&rsquo;s Utter Nonsense.<br/><br/>How You Play<br/><br/>The game consists of Accent Cards and Phrase Cards that players combine and act out. Sometimes phrases pair well with the accent, but more often, they don&rsquo;t &mdash; and that&rsquo;s Utter Nonsense.<br/><br/>1. Each game set has 40 Accent Cards and 460 Phrase Cards.<br/>2. All players have 7 Phrase Cards.<br/>3. One player serves as the Nonsense Judge and selects the Accent Card for the round.<br/>4. Once the Accent Card is revealed, players select one Phrase Card from their hand, and say it in the accent indicated.<br/>5. It&rsquo;s up to the Nonsense Judge to decide which player&rsquo;s phrase and accent combination is the funniest, and that player wins the round.<br/>6. After a player wins 5 rounds, that player wins the game.<br/><br/>You don&rsquo;t have to be good at accents and the combinations don&rsquo;t need to make sense; in fact, we encourage players to make the Phrase Cards their own. With each successive round, competition sets in and the most composed, mild mannered players become improv masters.<br/><br/>",

(Note that unlike Yahtzee, each symbol is worth only one point; note also that in the lower section, each line has a specific scoring combination, e.g. three elephants score only with two bears, not with a two of something else. Roll five identical items, and you get a 10-point bonus. Whoever has the highest score when all the score sheets are filled wins!<br/><br/>",

During the way the gods will help you get the elements necessary for the fight. Once you complete your tests then you will have access to the island where you must fight the guardians and enter the temple to steal the magic eye from the cobra. The winner is the first player to do this.<br/><br/>The game is a standard roll and move fare with the added twist that one of the gamers controls the forces of evil and attempts to stop all of the other players from winning.

Once the grid is built, players drop their red and yellow checkers into the top of the game and watch as the checker bounces down into a row. Add U-Build bumper arms to the top of the grid to help to steer a checker into a chosen row in your attempt to get four in a row. Bumper bricks can be used to assist a score or used as a defensive move to keep the opponent from scoring. Drop the checkers and see where they land &ndash; slide, bump and block your way to victory!<br/><br/>",

The most vibrant ecosystems are those that have organisms from all levels of life, from the producers up to the dominant predators.  Therefore, to win a game of Habitat, a player must create a complete collection of cards ranked 1-8.  Cards are stacked in order of rank, from lowest to highest, to form Food Chains.  There may be multiple Food Chains and duplicate ranks, but only one card from each rank is needed to win.  By contrast, an unsupported chain of cards carries the risk that creatures become hungry, or even begin to starve!  When a player has collected the necessary cards and all animals are fed, that player declares a &quot;Habitat&quot; and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

So one morning he summoned his children.  &quot;I am prepared to hand over the kingdom to one of you.&quot;, he said. &quot;But first, you must pass a test --the same test I passed, and my father before me, and my grandmother before him.  You must go out into the land and find four Jewels of Justice and a crown which I have hidden.  You must uncover the Ruby of Love, Emerald of Faith, Sapphire of Wisdom, Amethyst of Truth and the Crown of Enlightenment.  The first of you who finds these precious objects and brings them to me will have demonstrated worthiness.  This is the one who will rule the kingdom&quot;.  Not wanting to be recognised by their enemies and delayed in their quest, the children disguised themselves as sage old men.  And, leaving the safety of the castle, they ventured out into the world --each with a guardian dragon, each hoping to be the one who returned with the four Jewels of justice and the fabulous Crown of Enlightenment.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to find a Crown of Enlightenment and one of each color of the four Jewels of Justice and return to home base with them.  The first player to do so inherits the kingdom and wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules include several variants.<br/><br/>Also included are rules for &quot;Emperor's Chess&quot;, which is considerably different, and two more two-player games (The Emperor's Secret and Sage &amp; Dragon Sets).<br/><br/>Lovely bits.<br/><br/>",

A red light starts to blink and a nasty wailing sound is played. Suddenly, the light will turn green and the sound will go silent. At that point, players must push the button on their handle. The last player to do so gets an electrical shock. A player will also get shocked if they push the button too soon--while the light is red.<br/><br/>The game uses three AAA batteries, so the shock isn't dangerous, but it certainly adds an element of tension to an otherwise rather simple test of reaction speed.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Lightning Reaction Extreme<br/>    Lightning Reaction Revenge<br/>    Lightning Reaction: ReLoaded<br/>    Pocket Shock-It (AKA Pocket Lightning Reaction)<br/><br/><br/>",

The title comes from a rather audacious act of the Roman admiral, Claudius the Handsome.  He was told by the official augurs that the portents were not good for a naval battle: &quot;the sacred chickens will not eat.&quot;  Claudius threw the sacred chickens into the sea, saying &quot;then let them drink.&quot;<br/><br/>The game comes with 100 counters representing both ships and informational counters, an 11&quot; x 17&quot; map (28x43 cm), and eight pages of illustrated rules with sidebars.  A small game by wargame standards.<br/><br/>The basic sequence is mutual assignment of speed to galleys, Carthaginian ships move then board, and finally Roman ships move then board.  Facing is important, ramming, fouling other ships and shearing oars are all possible.  Melee fighting is common.  There are optional command/control/formation rules.<br/><br/>All in all, fairly low complexity as wargame simulations go.<br/><br/>",

Each card has one of four colors, one of four numbers and one of four symbols on it.<br/><br/>Players get a hand of 7 cards and 2 cards are turned over from the deck to create 2 discard piles. On your turn you can play a card to the top of a stack if 2 of the 3 components match.  You can play as many cards as you want but only to one stack.  If you can not play you have to draw a card.  There are also wild cards that have all attributes on them and semi-wild cards that only have 1 attribute to match.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 15 points and when a player goes out he deducts from his score the total number of cards in the other players hands.

Players take turns turning over a single card face up. If a Hot Dog card is turned over, nothing happens. If a Petey Card is turned over, all face up Hot Dog cards are turned face down. If a Dog Man card is turned over, players race to collect all face up Hot Dog cards on the table. Players may only use one hand and may only collect one card at a time. If the last card to be turned over is a Hot Dog card, players race to collect all remaining face up Hot Dog cards.<br/><br/>Once all cards have been turned over, the player with the most Hot Dog cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It's three crafty cats against one tricky mouse. Who will outsmart whom in this game of chase?<br/><br/>One player controls the three cats. That player's job is to trap the mouse so it can't make a move (cats win). The other player controls the mouse. The mouse must try to scurry past the cats and get free (mouse wins).<br/><br/>The cats may only move forward, sideways, and forward diagonally along the inscribed lines on the playing surface. Only one cat may move per turn. The mouse may move in any direction, including backwards, one move per turn.<br/><br/>Similar to 1 contra 4 (4 gegen 4 und 4 gegen 1)<br/><br/>",

So you don't have to seek the dice every time your child has 'thrown' it. Learning to count should be made easier this way.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to find the 3 bones in the colour of your own puppy dog first. The bones lay spread upside down at random in a circle.<br/><br/>The game is made easy by magnets in the puppy's nose, with witch even very small children can turn around the bone to check if it has their own dogs colour.<br/><br/>",

Like Bingo, one may win by matching all of the fields on the grid-card, or by matching a horizontal, vertical or diagonal line. The cards themselves are colourfully and engagingly illustrated, and the Spanish captions will be helpful to anyone studying that language. Because the Loter&iacute;a cards include the name of the item beneath its illustration, they are used to teach reading, writing, history and social values. Many bilingual teachers use the game as a teaching tool in the United States.<br/><br/>The most recognized version of Loter&iacute;a is the &quot;Don Clemente Gallo&quot; version, introduced in Mexico in 1887 by French businessman Don Clemente Jacques. The owners of Don Clemente Gallo Pasatiempos have continued this version through three generations. Throughout the past hundred years, the original artwork found on its 54 cards has remained the same, though the company issued a special edition in 2002 featuring the paintings of artist Teresa Villegas.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player spins the spinner, and moves his pawn according to the number spun. The space that he lands on puts a restriction on his next attempt to get a treasure by either specifying the color of the treasure, the kind of treasure or the tool to use.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the treasures have been removed from the hammock; the player with the most treasures wins. The game also ends when Captain Hook (which is also in the hammock, next to the treasures) falls from the hammock.

        "description": "Eragra is moving through 2  different worlds, the Ancient -  an unknown and legendary Era and the Future, after our days, there where our planet has become a vast desert full of Machines and Cyber-Environments. In the Ancient World ('Kingdoms and AntiKingdoms Division Age), the Summoners (you) own several decks. The basic one is the Duel Stack that consists mostly of Figures  and Characters which belong to the Eragra Saga as well as several new Card Leagues such as Ploys Ad Hoc (Artefacts n' Constructions), Relics, Walls, Incantations and many other. The next 2 Stacks are the Mastery (10 cards) and the Grim (15 cards) one where you must Unfold, meaning you cannot use them from the beginning of the Duel. The rest of the cards form a Common Space which can be used by all the Summoners! There, a War of Incantations and Artefacts take place and the most powerful combinations with Minions wins<br/><br/>Purpose in the Ancient World is to send as many Rival Minions as you can, to Limbo, in order to collect as many as you can from your Crystals (max. 25). The next step is to enter the Future World which can be done by activating 1 specific card from your Mastery Stack, a Vortex called Cyberspace. You can enter there any time you want but will you have enough Crystals? If you enter the Future World, then the rest Summoners must follow you with the Crystals they have collected from the first phase. Tough balance? No, the game in the Future World is totally different and much faster. In this world all change, so the rules.<br/><br/><br/>     The Future Stack is divided in 4 parts. Each Summoner owns a Stack of 30 cards. The cards you handle here are Viruses, Machines, Weapons, Ambushes, Resources &amp; Future Survivors. Here you use your collected Crystals. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Each Future card has the sing of a Crystal along with a number. For example you may have a Hybrid Machine and on it the Crystal sing and the number 3. Since you activate this card, place the equivalent Crystals on it. That means, your rivals have to beat this card thrice. Following this way, this Machine will be destroyed. Each time the rival wins a small battle, you remove a Crystal from your card and gives it to him. This world is faster since the Machines are moving in each round and carry dangerous tools capable of the ultimate destruction.. here the Duel here may last...few minutes!! <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Final Goal' of the Duel is to remove by any mean the Crystals from your rival(s) or to destroy their Future Survivor (there are 4 Future Survivors (1 for each one of you): A Hacker, a Cybermage, a Rebel and a member of the Torrius Syndicate who are protected by your Machines). <br/><br/><br/>In this game you will find more and more things to discover while you play. The point is to combine your cards well. You will enjoy it more, if you play with more than 1 rival and then you will face the brutality of Eragra. You can create Alliances with a rival Summoner to defeat another, but at the same time you must defeat your ally too. Your only true ally is your Minions. Are you ready?<br/><br/>",

Each player must keep their children alive and sane through the night.<br/><br/>The school bus sat waiting in front of the fairgrounds. Children from all parts of Harlington County were excited to start their trip, eager to see the Blue Mountain Campground on its opening weekend.  It was late evening when the Mayor wished the kids luck as they rose from their picnic tables, hurriedly shoving bits of cake into their mouths as they climbed aboard the old school bus.  Songs and the laughter of children would fill the first few hours, only to be cut short when one of the children called out &quot;I just saw a dark man standing in the road ahead of us.&quot;  As the laughter subsided and the children strained their eyes to see into the darkness, tree limbs burst through the windows, sending tiny glass fragments into the air that found their way into the soft flesh of the children. Metal groaned and cried out as the bus pitched over onto its side, sliding before finally ending up in a ditch on the side of the road. Screams echoed out of the interior of the bus as the children begun moving and freeing themselves from the wreckage. The driver lay dead against the wheel. It was almost midnight, and the children were alone in woods that could swallow them from every angle. It would be daybreak before anyone would even begin looking for them...<br/><br/>Players choose 1 card from the six gifted children cards and 4 random cards from the 24 children and assemble their survivors. Each child card displays the child's name, age, sanity level and &quot;end game&quot; point value. Your goal is to keep as many children alive and as sane as possible by sunrise. The gifted children have high sanity values and a special ability to help their group survive. These special abilities include the power to absorb a creature&rsquo;s damage, evade enemy attacks and even pass damage meant for you onto your opponent's survivors. Survival is key and differs from child to child. Some kids are young and low on sanity, while others may have increased sanity due to age or street smarts. Each child card contains a simple descriptive term like Bully, Class Clown, or Doll Baby to give insight into each child and add flavor to the core game.<br/><br/>The goal of Zero Hour is to survive from midnight until dawn. Each turn, a card from the Hour deck is flipped over, advancing time forward by one hour. The player with the highest point total at sunrise is declared the winner.  Each child has a point value indicated on their card that comes into play once the game is over.  Each player adds together whatever cards they are still holding to determine their point value total. This number will be between 0-25 points.<br/><br/>The Game contains:<br/>6 Gifted Child cards<br/>24 Child cards <br/>30 Sanity cards<br/>8 Clock cards<br/>1 black/white Creature die<br/>1 white Escape die<br/>1 rules booklet <br/>100-card Exploration Deck (The Slender Man)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are 106 cards: 5 suits (red, yellow, green, blue, purple) of 1-14, four Wild cards and 28 Action cards (Cards Up, Black Out, Pass One, Lose One). Each suit contains one special &quot;BIG&quot; card used in scoring (Red 10, Yellow 6, Green 7, Blue 12, Purple 2). Initial deal is four, Action cards in a separate stack.<br/><br/>On your turn, you turn over an Action card and follow its instructions. You then match, build or discard one card from your hand. Cards Up turns all cards on the table face up, Black Out face down. Pass One means everyone passes a card to one's right. Lose One means you put a card down face up.<br/><br/>Matching concerns the card values; you can collect cards of the same value as the played card, or pairs of cards that add up to that value. Building means you match as above but leave the matched cards as a pile, vulnerable to another player's matching. This is usually done so you can collect another card from your own hand (so you would &quot;Build eights&quot; with the table's 5+3 and your 8, hoping to &quot;Match eights&quot; on your next turn with your other 8). Discarding is what you do if you cannot Match or Build. This increases the table's pool of cards open for matching or building.<br/><br/>After you've played your 4 cards in this way, another round ensues, and so forth until the entire deck has been gone through. Scoring is +10 for the most cards collected, +8 for the most Purple cards collected, +6 for the most Red cards collected, +4 for each &quot;BIG&quot; card collected, +2 for each 1 card, +2 for each Wild card.<br/><br/>During a Black Out, you must memorize which card is which; if you declare a play but get the cards wrong, your played card is simply added to those already face down on the table.<br/><br/>",

Avoid getting wet by playing cards such as Powder Ball and Bad Aim that affect your opponent's chance to hit.  With the roll of a die and a little luck, you'll send your opponents home for hot chocolate and to change out of their soaked clothes.<br/><br/>This game is basically a &quot;take-that&quot; style card game where players take turns targeting each other with various &quot;damage&quot; inflicting snowball cards and rolling a die to see if you hit.  Targets can defend by playing various cards that affect the die roll and sometimes allow a counter-attack.  Much more friendly for young children than similar games such as (e.g.) Lunch Money.  Most clever aspect of the design is the round snowball-shaped cards.<br/><br/>",

The hunters must work together to maximize their skills to search the surrounding waters and locate the shark before it can bring more terror to the island, or quickly respond after it attacks to do as much damage to the creature as they can. When the shark is found, the hunters engage in a rapid form of combat, intent on killing it or driving it to sea. If the hunters kill the shark, they win! The shark needs to outsmart the hunters and terrorize the island to accumulate enough terror to win the game by achieving the terror goal they chose at the start of play, which includes a minimum of nine terror tokens.<br/><br/>The game takes place over several turns, made up of three phases. The shark tries to hide among debris and other sea creatures, and the hunters try to flush out the shark that can ultimately lead to an all versus one card battle. Special abilities of the shark and hunters can influence the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>",

Trade in your furs to acquire dogs to assist in the hunt. Prove yourself as the greatest in the world in The Great American Fox Hunt.<br/><br/>Players hunt by using 1 or more of their starting 5 hunter cards and randomly drawing from the animal pile.  If the hunter values are greater than or equal to the animal card, then the hunt was successful and the player collects his reward.  If he is unsuccessful, the next players(s) may steal the animal, using the previous hunters to complete the hunt.<br/><br/>TGAFH is a light, fun set-collection game where hunters win by getting a set of either squirrels, hares, deer, or bears.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knights of the Rainbow is from FX Schmid USA. The box rates the game for 2-6, the rules rate it for 2-4, and the body of the rules refer to a maximum of five players. It is recommended that players stay within the 2-4 range, where 3 players seems ideal, otherwise the benefits of the honor cards (see below) are far too strong.<br/><br/>Players start with seven strength, two gold, and no cards. On each turn a player can flip one, two, or three cards from the deck, keeping one of them and discarding the rest. All of a player&rsquo;s cards are kept face-up, stacked by type so everyone can see them.<br/><br/>Players win by knocking out all opponents or having the highest score after three passes through the deck. Most of the cards are distributed among five color-coded types: strength, force, gold, magic, and honor. The player with the most cards of each type gains an advantage, usually at the start of his turn. The simplest of these increase a player&rsquo;s strength or gold, or decrease other players&rsquo; strength. The leader in magic can trade any of his cards for any card from the discard pile, or sacrifice any one of his own cards to destroy an opponent&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Honor works differently. Shuffled into the deck are four &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Favor&rdquo; cards. When one of these is turned up, the player with the most honor gets two gold, two strength, or the top card from the deck. Misfortune cards are the dark side of the same coin, forcing loss of gold, strength, or cards from all players. Many cards bear a rainbow icon, however, and the player showing the most rainbows at the top of their stacks is protected from Misfortune.<br/><br/>A player can spend gold at the end of his turn to buy another card from the deck, decrease an opponent&rsquo;s strength, or trade cards with an opponent. A player losing his last strength is knocked out of the game. Anyone who survives to the third appearance of the Long Live the King card (which triggers a reshuffle) scores a point for each magic card, strength, and gold they have. The highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

The inhabitants, on the other hand, try to make their own lives in the block more bearable, preferably a bit comfortable too, and to ocassionally return Mr. Aniol the favor, undermining his position.<br/><br/>The game is full of humorous situations and negative interactions. It consists of several turns in five rounds. Turn reflects day of life. At the beginning of each round, players choose the location to which they want to go and perform the associated action given a location (or a card on hand).<br/><br/>Each character in the game has different bonuses and ways of scoring. First person who at the end of all the rounds has the most victory points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Altaria is an island drifting in space that can be accessed through portals from different dimensions. Three enormous altars situated on the island give power over all dimensions to those who take control of them.<br/><br/>In Altaria: Clash of Dimensions, each player uses three of ten characters to try to capture all of the altars placed in the center of the game board or the portal that belongs to her opponent. The game consists of seven rounds, and each round is divided into three stages. In each stage, a player gets action points (APs) that are used for the skills of one character. With the help of these APs a player can relocate the character, attack the enemy, or place a unique token of power on the board. Each token can change the course of events in the game.<br/><br/>The modular board has removable components that provide players with a number of starting combinations and make it possible to play a unique game from the very start.<br/><br/>An interesting feature used in Altaria is the passing of the tokens of power. After a few stages of the game, they disappear from the board which makes the game more dynamic and constantly changes the situation on the board. Try to make the most of the skills of your characters, outwit your opponent, and be a better tactician.<br/><br/>",

Go ahead, make sure you're a true commando. Good luck!&quot;<br/><br/>Each player is a commando soldier lost on mystery island.<br/>To leave the island and win the game one need to locate and gather helicopter parts scattered  in the interior of the island and fly away.<br/><br/>Game uses simple d6 roll mechanic for movement, and monopoly styled money (Ertrob) with which one can buy different means of faster transportation (rent-a-car, train, boat ride) or pay for trespassing the forest (Sic!), medical help in hospital (where player is placed after he is defeated in combat) and various weapons and ammunitions to attack other players and steal their gathered heli parts. Money can be earned at bank.<br/>All roads, railroads, forests and buildings are neutral.<br/>Additionally, each 1 and 6 rolled for movement result in a  card drawn from random events deck.<br/>Unique mechanic allows one to build a safe house for storage of found parts and possessions.<br/>Interesting system of randomly &quot;dropping&quot; helicopter parts and players on their starting positions on the island.<br/><br/>Despite poor production quality of the gaming elements (board was the exception) the game has interesting gameplay, powerful marketing campaign (tv commercials) and was very popular at the time. <br/>There was a poster included with the game (on the poster: bigger version of box cover).<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The new Goblin chiefs are ready to sound the charge and assault the castle! This time, the fortress is defended by a moat full of muddy water, but our fearless heroes did not come unprepared! Among the Goblin warriors are lifeguards, rafts, divers, fishermen, and even a pedal-boat &ndash; and they will all be needed to face the hazards (as well as the monsters!) hidden under the waters defending the castle! There are plenty of heroes of every kind, but this does not assure victory, especially when a fray erupts among the Goblins in the middle of the battlefield! But at the very end, there will be just one cry: Goooooobliiiiiiins!!!<br/><br/>Coming from the unleashed minds of 4G, Goblins: Epic Death, a fast-paced &quot;card 'n' luck&quot; game, is a new chapter in the saga of our green-skinned little friends. Victory is at hand, and the castle is ready for capture: Both are just an &quot;epic death&quot; away from you! So toss your Goblins, cross your fingers, and pray they all die. That way, victory will be yours!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Do you remember the movie of The Thing? That of the eighties, that of John Carpenter. You liked it, did not you? Well, look no further. If you want to relive the best moments of the film (if you suffer a horrible death you consider a good time), then The Creature is your game.<br/><br/>The Creature is a competitive card game in which you will all have to fight against all to escape with life from the scientific base in which you are locked together with an Being from Another World known as The Creature.<br/><br/>In this hidden role-playing game you will not have friends, because anyone can be infected. The only thing that matters is to survive and to escape in the only available place of the rescue helicopter ... although that supposes to finish with your companions.<br/><br/>The Creature is a card game for 3 to 10 players in which no one is who they seem to be and where paranoia reigns throughout the game. Use your event cards to beat your teammates, vote against them to sedate them, collect weapons for the final showdown and try to prevent The Creature from taking over your body. Does it feel like little stress? Then wait for the helicopter to land and you have to fight everyone to occupy the only seat.<br/><br/>A game of The Creature lasts from 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>The game is not recommended for children under 13, we do not want children to become accustomed to crushing their friends.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to escape from the research base on the helicopter. The bad thing is that there is only one place for a scientist, so only one of the players can escape the horror. Will it be a human who gets on the helicopter, one of the infected scientists or the creature itself?<br/><br/>The helicopter will arrive when all the turns of game are finished. There are as many turns in a game as participating players minus one, which are controlled in the time marker with the clock tab. The minimum number of turns to play is 2, and the maximum 10. This represents the difficulty or ease of the creature to infect scientists when the group is more or less numerous.<br/><br/>It can neutralize the Creature so that it does not continue to infect the scientists, sedating it twice (the first time the silk manages to escape).<br/><br/>The scientist who escapes in the helicopter wins the game, even if it is the creature or one of the infected will mean the end of humanity ...<br/><br/>Overview.<br/><br/>The game is divided into turns, and there are as many turns as players are present in the game minus one (maximum 10 turns), plus the final turn of the game, the helicopter phase where everyone fights against everyone to sit in the available seat and Escape from base. Each turn is divided into three phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Event Phase<br/>     Voting phase<br/>     Movement phase<br/><br/><br/>During the events phase players put their event cards into action to produce effects during the game.<br/><br/>In the voting phase players use their voting to decide which scientist they will sedate.<br/><br/>The movement phase is played after the voting, and in it all players deliver their character cards (including that of The Creature) to the boss, who shuffles them and re-allocates them among the players, in such a way that the Creature moves from one scientist to another, infecting them.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to escape in the helicopter. Players who have had the creature's card at some point become infected, and therefore will try to help the creature carry out its plans, complicating the existence of other players who are still human. The bad thing is that there will be moments during the game in which no one will know who is who, further sowing chaos in the game.<br/><br/>",

Players take it in turns to roll a die and move their pawn the indicated number of spaces along the track.  There are special spaces along the track where a player is asked to solve a riddle.  If the player guesses incorrectly, the play moves to the next person.  If the riddle is answered with the aid of a clue, the player may move four spaces , or jump over one wall of the maze.  If the riddle is solved without the aid of a clue, the player may either, move seven spaces, jump over one wall and move forward four spaces, jump over two consecutive walls, or jump an opponents piece over one wall.  There are other special spaces named 'pits of ignorance'.  If a player lands on one of these spaces their turn ends. To get out they must answer a riddle correctly, without a clue, on their next turn.  Upon answering a riddle the player rolls the dice and plays a normal turn.  When a player moves their piece to the center of the board, they must answer a riddle correctly, without a clue, in order to win the game.  If their answer is incorrect, their piece remains at the center of the board and another riddle is asked each subsequent turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Firefly: Shiny Dice lasts three rounds, and whoever has the most points after three rounds wins. In each round, each player takes one or more turns. On your first turn in a round, you roll all fifteen dice &mdash; seven crew dice (brown), three passenger dice (white), and five bad guy dice (black) &mdash; then place them in the appropriate places on your display. Crew members and passengers all have unique abilities, some of which involve the option of rerolling dice.<br/><br/>After any rerolls, you reveal your mission for the round. If you have dice on your board that match the numbers given at the top of the mission, then you're unaffected by the bold line &mdash; Bushwhacked, Gorram, etc. &mdash; immediately underneath. Otherwise, you might be forced to end your go after the current turn, forced to take an additional turn, or affected in some other way. After revealing and resolving the mission, the bad guys strike:<br/><br/><br/>    Each Badger die holds one supply die.<br/>    Each Saffron die moves a crew/passenger die of your choice to the cargo hold.<br/>    If Niska dice are present, KO a crew/passenger die of your choice.<br/><br/><br/>After this, you then use any remaining crew and passenger dice to defeat the bad guys, which generally require one point of damage to defeat. Remove them all, and you score 1 VP for each type of bad guy defeated, with half-points for each supply delivered; fail to remove them, and you score no points for the defeated bad guys. If you clear the turn, you can opt to take another turn &mdash; rolling all the bad guy dice and all non-KOed crew and passenger dice &mdash; or end your turn. If you opt to continue, but then fail to defeat the bad guys, you lose all the VP that you earned previously on that turn.<br/><br/>After three rounds, whoever has the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

Everyone's always involved in the game, even when it's not their turn to move their playing piece!  The game is completely different every time you play! Warning:  If a board game needs to be all about strategy, setup, and &quot;the win&quot; in order for you to enjoy it, then you may want to avoid The Tower of Mystery because it's a rapidly changing game that's frequently outside of your complete control.<br/><br/>But if you enjoy a purely social game that's all about player interaction, fun, laughter, and &quot;the journey&quot;, then chances are great that you'll love the Tower of Mystery!  Social gamers of all ages (adults, college students, teens) and Families enjoy the game!<br/><br/>The Tower of Mystery contains no occult elements, magic, spells, or evil characters.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDetailed Game Description<br/> The Tower of Mystery combines luck, unpredictability, and a dash of strategy make this an exciting, lively game for everyone. Because up to eight players can play, nobody is left out! It's competitive, interactive, rapidly changing, and fun!Everyone starts in the Garden outside the Tower. Travel around the tower's seven levels, take secret passages, and use staircases, in an attempt to visit each of the four turrets in the tower (in no particular order) and collect a turret token. Once you have all four turret tokens, and have collected Mystery Cards that spell the word &quot;TOWER&quot;, declare your impending win to the other players and then head back to the Garden!  The first person to return to the Garden with Mystery Cards spelling &quot;TOWER&quot; and has a turret token from each of the four turrets, wins the game!<br/><br/>When playing The Tower of Mystery, you win by constantly adjusting your game-play based on unexpected events.  No matter how masterful you think your plan for winning the game is, it WILL be up-ended by your opponents, and the crazy events that occur within the tower. Your goal is to keep moving towards achieving the game objectives as best you can!  During the game, players move around the seven levels, up and down staircases, and into the four turrets, landing on board spaces where &quot;things happen&quot;. Sometimes a player may get money or lose money, get or lose Mystery Cards, may get to roll the dice and see what happens, might have the chance to swap the location of their playing piece with another player's piece, steal cards or money from other players, or any of many different scenarios and possibilities.<br/><br/>In addition to the &quot;TOWER&quot; Mystery Cards, there are Mystery Cards that allow you to do nice things to yourself, or try to stop your opponents.  There are several ways to collect Mystery Cards. Some ways are free, others cost money. The fastest but most risky way to collect free Mystery Cards is to stay in a turrent for multiple turns. However, while in a turret, a player is vulnerable because they cannot play any Mystery Cards. Players can collect up to 3 free Mystery Cards per turn while in a turret so even though it's risky to stay in a turret for very long, there's definitely a benefit to visiting the turrets even though playing Mystery Cards there is a no-no.<br/><br/>Players can play any number of Mystery Cards on any other players (or themselves) even when it's not their turn! This can cause &quot;mayhem&quot; when several players suddenly jump into the action at the same time!  You will have to alter your plans over and over in order to stay ahead of your opponents!  Almost constant player interaction keeps everyone on their toes, all the while laughing and having fun every step of the way!<br/><br/>At the end of each turn that a player's piece is in a turret, they must draw a Turret Card. Turret Cards might affect only the player drawing the card, might affect everyone in the game, or several players but not all.  One thing is for sure: Turret Cards often dramatically change the game for everyone in an instant! Some Turret Cards are helpful, but most of them cause unexpected, often funny events to happen to some or all of the players in the game!<br/><br/>While money is a component of the game, it has no bearing on winning the game! Tower Bucks are used to buy Mystery Cards and pay penalties. Being broke is risky, because if a player is completely broke and they have to pay a fine to the bank or a penalty to another player, they lose three turns!  Hoarding money serves no purpose, however, so each player has to decide how much money is enough to keep and how much is safe to spend.<br/><br/>The Tower of Mystery is a great Party Game for all ages! Adults young and old enjoy playing The Tower of Mystery when together for their regular social Game Night. Families enjoy it for Family Game Night because it's equally playable for both the kids and the parents. It is suitable for children as young as about eight as long as they are able to read the cards and know the best time to play their cards. Teens enjoy The Tower of Mystery because it's so unpredictable and lively.  Even retired yacht club ladies have been known to give up their Friday afternoon dominoes to play The Tower of Mystery!  If you enjoy great player interaction, surprises, laughter and fun, then the Tower of Mystery is the game for you!<br/><br/>",

The map portrays the Netherlands, Belgium, western Germany and northern France.<br/><br/><br/>Players control the actual units that fought in this campaign; most of them represent army corps with a handful of divisions. The typical Allied unit is as good as the typical German unit, and many of them are better. The German player must play to his or her advantages: an air force designed for tactical support, parachute regiments to assault key points, and concentration of force.<br/><br/>Like Defiant Russia and Red Vengeance, Strange Defeat isn't a very large game. The map is 34 x 22 inches, divided into very large hexes for ease of play. There are 140 playing pieces, and it comes in a small box that's easy to store. The game plays very quickly, concluding in about 90 minutes, with a minimum of charts and tables to consult. The game uses the same system as Defiant Russia.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 15 miles / 24.1 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiment to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; five color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (140 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Strange Defeat<br/>One Player Aid/Errata Card<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-2 Hours<br/><br/><br/>",

You move your characters in groups around the board trying to get items. As you do you will set off disasters that have to be dealt with.

        "description": "User summary<br/>ソクラテスラ (Socra Tesla) is a humourous card game that combines parts great people into fighting chimera. Each player is a Summoner, bringing great characters from out of History in order to fight for the Holy Grail. But something has gone wrong with your Summoner powers, and you end up with a mix of parts from different heroes. You must combine them as best as possible and send them into battle.<br/><br/>Each player puts together their fighter from body parts of legendary people. Each historical figure has been separated into three parts. Starting with a hand of 7 cards, each tries to form a historical figure by combining the right arm (red card), torso (green), and left arm (purple) cards. Each body part card also contains a third of the person's name and their achievement, like &quot;SOC / RA / TES&quot; and &quot;One of the founders of / Western philosophy and the first / Moral philosopher&quot;. Each card also has icons indicating its 'military power' and intellectual power'. There are also weapon cards (blue). The weapon might go on the right arm of the character.<br/><br/>Before each round, a Holy Grail Piece card is drawn to indicate the victory condition of the current battle, such as 'higher intellectual power' and 'lower military power. In this way, the strongest one is not necessarily the winner.<br/><br/>Players then take turns to draw and exchange cards between themselves until one player Summons up and announces their chimeric historical figure to enter the tournament, displaying their chosen limbs and torso. That player also announces their opponent. The battle begins when the chosen opponent has also summoned their hero. When the battle is over, the winner announces another player as their opponent and the loser discards their chimera.<br/><br/>After each player has fought that round, the final winner claims the Grail card as their prize. Turning it over reveals the lower torso which is placed on their champion, to enter the Hall of Fame. The game edns when a player makes the required number of Hall of Fame heroes according to the number of players.<br/><br/>The game is intended as a party game as much as a serious combat game. It is as much about making a chimera with a name and achievement that fits your sense of humour as about winning the actual tournaments. The game was an instant sell-out hit at the Tokyo Game Market in Autumn 2018.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>In this game, the players are up-and-coming summoners skilled in summoning great historical figures. Once every ten years, the summoners gather at the battle tournament to win the holy grail.<br/>You have carefully prepared yourselves for the battle, but the Holy Grail has suddenly run out of control. Your summoning circles have all fallen to pieces, and you can only summon parts of unidentified historical figures. Still, the battle has already begun.<br/><br/>Can you combine the parts of historical figures in your hand to create the most powerful one and win through the battle?<br/><br/>あなたは将来を期待された、優秀な召喚士です。偉人を召喚することを得意としています。<br/><br/>10年に一度、最強の召喚士に与えられるという聖杯を求めて、召喚士たちの戦いに参加したあなた。<br/><br/>入念に準備をして戦いの場に臨みますが、突如として聖杯が暴走してしまいます。<br/><br/>気が付くと、手元にあった魔法陣は全てバラバラに。強引に召喚しようとすると、正体不明の偉人のパーツが出るばかり。<br/><br/>戦いは既に始まっています。<br/><br/>あなたは、手元にあるバラバラの偉人をつなぎ合わせて最強の偉人を作り出し、無事戦いを勝ち抜くことができるでしょうか？<br/><br/>",

Although less colorful than Simon, Merlin featured six different games, namely tic-tac-toe, music machine, echo, blackjack 13, magic square, and secret number. It was even possible to save games and select your level of difficulty on a scale of 1-9. In 1999, Merlin became available once again on the internet as a free download for your PC.<br/><br/>",

You play as a modern soul accidentally sent to an ancient afterlife - Valhalla.<br/><br/>Be the first player to escape Valhalla by finding resurrection runes - all while scavenging for supplies and fighting off dangerous foes with mighty weapons!<br/><br/><br/>     Players choose who goes first - we suggest the youngest player. <br/>     Make sure there are 3 Resurrection Runes per player placed in the explore deck.<br/>     After shuffling each deck seperately, Arrange the 3 decks (Explore, Scavenge, Items) face down on the table in a line next to each other.<br/><br/><br/>The selected Player One goes first and remaining Players take turns in a clockwise direction. On your turn you can pick up 2 cards from the top of any deck. (Explore, scavenge, items). You are allowed to pickup any deck of your choice, for example, 1 'Explore' card and 1 'Item' card based on what you need.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to make your way through the 'Explore' deck and find 3 Resurrection runes that are hidden in the deck. The first player to do so wins the game.<br/>Once you receive foe cards over -4 hit points*, you cannot advance any further in the 'Explore' deck. You must then craft items picked up from the 'Item' deck, to remove foe cards, using scavenged materials from the 'Scavenge' deck. <br/>There are also helpful cards scattered throughout each deck that are free to use once found. These are discarded once used.<br/><br/>",

Usually these cards will fall into one of four Suits: Gold, Courtiers, Provinces and Musketeers. The cards feature ranks from 1-7, and after all cards have been played the person who played the highest card in each Suit collects all the cards of that type. Captured cards are then placed into a person's &quot;structure&quot;, which shows all the elements of a player's court. At the end of the game and at various points during play, a player scores points based on the value of the cards in his structure.<br/><br/>",

You need to escape or else end up as supper, and unfortunately only one spot remains behind the controls of the hydroplane!<br/><br/>In I Will Survive, players take on the role of one of six explorers, each with a unique combination of shield and weapon abilities. Each round consists of turns, and on each turn each player secretly chooses one of three moves &ndash; attack, defend, reload &ndash; then they all simultaneously make a gesture to signal their move. If a player defends, which costs a shield, no one can damage him this turn; if a player attacks, which costs a weapon, he injures the player targeted if that player did not defend himself; if he reloads, he reclaims spent tokens. Anyone injured moves one step closer to the cannibal's cauldron.<br/><br/>Players continue taking turns until one or fewer explorers are uninjured. When this happens, everyone stands up, reclaims their shield and weapon tokens and starts a new round. When a player falls into the cauldron, he's out of the game. The last explorer uneaten wins!<br/><br/>",

In the sleepy village of Peperoni, all hell has broken loose. The mayoral election will be taking place soon, and multiple leaders of the community are vying for the prestigious position. No wonder that things are a little shady beforehand. Villagers are bribed, spies slink about, pistol-packing mercenaries and judges asked for help (or set onto opponents) - the police barely have the situation under control. And in the midst of all that, sometimes even the cleaning lady can make the competition shy. Don Peperoni is a not-really-meant-seriously bluffing game. June 2006.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Here the players find themselves as Orc War Chieftains on their way to fight those intolerable forces of the Empire. Only problem is that several Orcish clans have run into each other so inevitably they start to squabble over the carcass of some unfortunate Elf that is roasting over a campfire. In the time it takes for the sun to move from up to just a little more up the Orcs are at it and it&rsquo;s each Orcish War Chief for himself.<br/><br/>Each player is trying to create armies, which are placed into 3 battle lines or formations. Each line must have one musician and one standard bearer and each of these must be placed on the far left or right of each line. Each line can be up to 12 units long but a player can create a shortened battle line by placing the two required units closer together.<br/><br/>Each turn a player will draw one or more cards from the deck. Units drawn must be placed whilst other cards are discarded for their effects. Once a battle line has a musician and a standard bearer and all spaces in between the two are filled (with units or loot), that line can go to war and attack the battle line of another player. All units are worth a battle rating. Both sides simply add up their ratings for all units and the highest total wins, although the roll of a fate dice can still mix things up.<br/><br/>The winner can take any loot present from the defeated player's line and this is in truth the main aim as loot is worth points that are tallied up at the end to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Chaos Marauders also allows for players to try and construct larger units made up of multiple cards such as War Machines.<br/><br/>See also: Summary of differences from the first edition of Chaos Marauders.<br/><br/>",

Oda Nobunaga tried to unify the country and reorganize the government by bringing the authority back to TENNO. In 1576, he selected Azuchi, a town on the eastern shore of Lake Biwa where he started to establish his new castle and power. This unconstrained and lively city reflected his ambition to bring an end to a chaotic era. The city was characterized by a luxurious castle and open markets; his city underwent unprecedented growth. Now it is your turn!<br/><br/>In Azuchi Castle, players acting in the role of retainers need to complete Oda Nobunaga's mission: Construct Azuchi castle.

When you own it all and reign supreme over your opponents, victory will be yours.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the player with the most money at the end of the game. On his turn, a player rolls two dice and moves that number of spaces around the board. If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to the battle ground (jail).<br/><br/>Fully customized game elements including:<br/><br/>Custom Money: $1 Chen (from the new Pandaren race, featured in the soon-to-be released expansion, Mists of Pandaria)), $5 Magni (Dwarf), $10 Vol'Jin (Troll), $20 Tyrande (Night Elf), $50 Sylvanas (Blood Elf), $100 Varian ( Human), $500 Thrall (Orc)<br/><br/>Custom Tokens: These top 6 tokens were voted on by fans: Corehound Pup, Murky, Doomhammer, Hearthstone, Mechagnome, Flight Path Boot<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of Phones works along the lines of Apples to Apples, with one player serving as judge each round and the other players usually trying to do something so that the judge awards them the point for that round.<br/><br/>For this game, all of the challenges involve you using your smartphone. More specifically, the judge draws a card for the round and reads the prompt to everyone else, e.g., &quot;Find the best #selfie&quot; or &quot;Show the last photo you took&quot; or &quot;Find the weirdest Google Image search result for your name&quot;. Everyone finds something on their phones and shows the judge, who then chooses a winner for that round. The first player to win ten rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Includes a 23&quot; by 34&quot; mapsheet, 240 half-inch die-cut counters, 8 page rule book, and two copies of reference charts.  No ground scale is specified, each combat unit is 100 men, each full game turns represents one full day of time (there are action rounds and segments within each full turn).<br/><br/>In this solitaire game the player takes on the role of Leonidas, Spartan commander in charge of the Greek forces, against the overwhelming invasion force of the Persians.  The rule set governs the movement and combat of the Persians.<br/><br/>The battle field itself only takes up a portion of the 23&quot; by 34&quot; mapsheet, which also areas for tracking game turns, Greek and Persian morale, and a missile fire priority diagram.  The battle field has a grid (not hex) pattern.  The Thermopylae pass was very narrow (20 meters at the narrowest point), so unit deployment is the essential mechanic instead of side ranging maneuvers.<br/><br/>Although this is primarily a solitaire game, there are minor rule changes provided for two-player play (Greek and Persian sides), and even a three-player option (commanding different contingents of the Greek force).<br/><br/>",

The bears are in 4 colors; equally colored bears sit opposite of each other. The target is to earn honey-jars by making the bears of the same color face each other. By rolling the color dice, you change the direction the bear is looking at: towards or away from the center of the circle. You can decide which of the two bears of the rolled color you turn around.  The first to get 5 pots of honey wins!<br/><br/>In 2006 a Miffy version was released, featuring the world-famous designs of Dick Bruna.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Le Jeu Du Nain Jaune (Game of the Yellow Dwarf) is an attractive and unique traditional French card game that strikes a satisfying balance between luck of the draw and genuine strategy. Quality sets comprise wooden trays inlaid with the special scoring cards (King Hearts, Queen Spades, Jack Clubs, ten diamonds and the greatest scoring seven of diamonds), plus a conventional 52 card pack and betting tokens (poker chips). Cheaper sets are invariably plastic and can be found in most French supermarkets for a few Euros/dollars.  The objective is to dispose of the cards in your hand, playing them in simple numerical sequence from 1 (Ace) to King, picking up bonuses along the way. The suits have no significance other than when playing the five special cards. The person playing the King terminates the sequence and may restart it with a card of their choice. This is where the strategy comes in. Remembering which cards have been played allows you to frustrate your opponents by starting a sequence favoring the cards remaining in your hand. The simplicity of the basic game appeals to younger gamers, whereas the hardened gambler and his/her gaming friends can enjoy the hunt for the 7 of diamonds tray full of Euros. A good way to learn this game is by downloading shareware versions available on the Internet.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by: Pope Joan<br/><br/>",

Will they succeed or are the strict guards too clever for them? <br/><br/>Strategic escaping game<br/>SECTION X is a game in which clever escapees dig tunnels themselves but also make use of tunnels belonging to other players and cut each other off. Special hiding places ensure that the prisoners are safe when the ruthless prison guards make their rounds. A rumor has spread that an escape is imminent, so it becomes more and more difficult to remain out of the hands of the guards. Doors lock the entrances to the different escape tunnels.

        "description": "Star of the Guardians is a 2-player Collectible Card Game in which the players play cards to deploy spaceships and destroy each other's empire.  The game is set in a science-fiction setting of the same name, novelized in a 4-book series by Margaret Weis.  For the game, players buy (collect) cards to build up their decks, which are shuffled and from which cards are drawn into hands and played.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of Warlords and to deploy their navies, they play system cards, which bestow Influence points.  Other cards can then be played if their cost in Influence are met.  Personality cards provide special abilities and personality points, which are required to play certain cards.  Fate, Damage, Artifacts and Tactics cards are played to alter the outcomes of battles fought among the deployed naval ships (Battleships, Carriers, Destroyers, etc) and squadrons of fighters and bombers.<br/><br/>Star of the Guardians uses a lane-based combat system (Lane-To-Lane&trade;).  Each player's fleet is deployed in five columns (lanes).  The frontline ships bear the brunt of the fight while the ships behind them can give support, depending on their positions and cards played.  When a player's fleet has been destroyed, his or her home system is open to attack.  Any damage done to a player's home system reduces his or her power, and when a player's power has been reduced to zero, he or she loses the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can you and your fellow ninja claim the four golden weapons and keep them away from the skeleton general and his army before they overrun the ninja fortress? You would think so, given that the weapons are hidden within your fortress, but ninja are sometimes so sneaky that they forget where they hid things. Start looking, ninja!<br/><br/>In Ninjago: The Board Game, a spin-off of the 2011 line of Ninjago spin-and-attack figures from LEGO, players must work together to claim the weapons and fight back the skeleton guards you'll encounter. On a turn, you spin the die, then take one of the following actions:<br/><br/>&bull; On a two, you move your ninja up to two spaces, searching a guardhouse for a weapon if you stop in a space where a guardhouse is located.<br/>&bull; On a one/guard, move one space, then place a skeleton guard on a space occupied by a ninja.<br/>&bull; On a one/general, move one space, then move the skeleton general one space down the temple steps.<br/>&bull; On a rope/general, attach a rope to your ninja's head (!) and a nearby guardhouse, then swing to any space that you can reach and land there, then move the general down the temple steps one space.<br/><br/>If a skeleton guard is in your space at the start of your turn, spin the spinner. If it lands on your color or the color of any other ninja in that space, you defeat the guard and take a normal turn; otherwise, move the general down one step and lose your turn.<br/><br/>If the general reaches the bottom of the steps, he steal one weapon from you, then climbs to the top of the steps once again to begin another descent. If you have claimed no weapons by the time this happens, you all lose the game.<br/><br/>Once all the weapons are claimed or captured by the general, enter the final battle, taking turns with the spinner to see whether the general captures another weapon, whether the ninja do, or whether nothing happens. Your sensei awaits on the side of the board, ready to aide you once during this final battle to protect the weapons &ndash; unless you've already used his power during the game.<br/><br/>As with all the LEGO games, Ninjago: The Board Game includes multiple variants, such as adjusting the power of the sensei, adding a memory component, adding or removing steps in the temple to tweak the general's effect.<br/><br/>",

(The kids love fussing with it.)<br/><br/>The game board has an outside track, the Invention Track, and an inside track, the Royalty Track. On the Invention Track is where you pick up the various inventions (like buying properties in Monopoly). Instead of building house and hotels, you get a Patent Claim Clip attached to the invention card. This patent clip has a 0, 1, or 2 on it. The number assigned is random. The higher patent clip number, the more your patent makes you come royalty collection time. Eureka Cards can also be played that allow you to do special actions during your turn. The game limit is set by the usage of the Patent Claim clips. When the last one is used, the game ends.  The player with the highest combined total of cash on hand invention value wins.<br/><br/>",

Beer flows freely, but not even the cellars of Byggvir, the God of Beer, could quench the thirst of Nordland's greatest warriors. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Not a single step back is allowed to the warrior who wishes to enter Valhalla. One single thought in everyone's mind: may Fenrir eat the sun, that beer will be mine! All vikings laugh at the thought of death, draw their war axes, joining the fight at the call of &quot;OOOODIIIIIIIIIIN!&quot;<br/><br/>In Beer &amp; Vikings you are a fierce and thirsty viking warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of beer. The winner is the most drunk viking &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most beer drink counters &ndash; at the end of the sudden death round.<br/><br/>Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the war axe. Each drink of beer prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the beer you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much beer, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the cup is empty and the sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Loki, the thirsty god of evil, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their beer. Raise your glasses (and your axes)!<br/><br/>Beer &amp; Vikings introduces 112 brand new cards! including a new type of cards called &quot;Valhalla&quot; which provide you a strong ability during the match &ndash; but to obtain them you need to kill an opponent. Thus, to gain this power you must generate a vengeful spirit first. Be careful when you follow the Valhalla way...<br/><br/>Beer &amp; Vikings, a board game for 3-8 players about war axes, blood and beer, is both a standalone game and an expansion for Sake &amp; Samurai.<br/><br/>Integrates with<br/><br/><br/>    Sake & Samurai<br/><br/><br/>Microbadge:<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

It is meant to be a feast that will long be remembered!<br/><br/>The guests attending the feast hall feel the same, for in the corners of the castle deadly plots are being developed. The guests are divided into two factions, with both planning to &quot;dismiss&quot; the king. One faction plans to smuggle a dagger into the feast hall to &quot;open the king's heart to the realm&quot; at the right time, while the other faction hopes to give the king &quot;renewed motivation&quot; with a poisoned drink.<br/><br/>In The Last Banquet, each player is a guest at the feast and needs to help his faction reach its goal and ensure that this will truly be the king's last banquet. The game includes 25 role cards, each portraying a person on the front and listing that person's skills on the back. In addition to &quot;The Last Banquet&quot;, several other scenarios are provided in the rules that can be played with each of the roles. (GameHeads' Oliver Wolf notes, &quot;Playing time ranges from 30 minutes up to 90 minutes or more, with more people tending to need more time to play.&quot; Also, some scenarios involve more than two factions.) Obstacle cards provide challenges for players to overcome.<br/><br/>When a faction succeeds in its goal, all players who belong to that faction win the game.<br/><br/>",

The fewer fire cards revealed, the better, and if you have covered all of the fire, then you win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Misery Index is based on the new game show &quot;The Misery Index&quot;, which premieres on TBS in late 2019.<br/><br/>The game includes 200 cards, each with unique (and awful) situations. Each awful situation has been ranked from 1-100 by a panel of experts based on physical pain, emotional trauma, and long-term psychological impact. This ranking is what we call &quot;The Misery Index&quot;. At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt three situation cards, which they place face up on the table in front for them, ranked by numerical order of The Misery Index. This is called a players' &quot;Misery Lane&quot;. There are three rounds of play:<br/><br/>&bull; Round 1 &mdash; &quot;Misery Lane&quot;: The player to the right of the first guesser draws a card from the draw pile and reads the situation aloud and shows the illustration, but hides The Misery Index number on the bottom of the card. To win the card, the player must correctly guess where this situation falls in their Misery Lane. If they are correct, they win that card and add it to their Misery Lane.<br/><br/>&bull; Round 2 &mdash; &quot;More or Less Miserable&quot;: After a player has collected a total of eight cards in their Misery Lane, they have now entered the second round. In this round, the player to the right takes the first three cards from the top of the deck and and reads the descriptions aloud. Now the player must correctly put all three cards in the correct order (from least to worst) by announcing them aloud to the group, without seeing their Misery Index number. If they are incorrect, play continues to the left and they will have another chance with three more cards on their next turn. If they are correct, they add them to their Misery Lane and progress to Round 3.<br/><br/>&bull; Round 3 &mdash; &quot;Margin of Misery&quot;: In this final round, the player must guess The Misery Index number within 10 points. The player to the right draws a card and reads the situation aloud. The player now must correctly guess a 10-point range that this card falls into. For example, if it is a Misery Index number of 82, and the player guesses a range of 75-85, that player wins that card and wins the game!<br/><br/>Win condition: Be the first player to have 12 cards in their Misery Lane.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this anti-smoking game, the players try to accumulate money while avoiding addiction to cigarettes.  At the start of the game, each player picks a profession likely to benefit from the smoking of others (Doctor, Undertaker, etc.) and then starts moving around the board.  If a player lands on an advertising space, there's a chance that he or she will begin smoking.  When a smoker ends up sharing a space with another player, there's a chance he'll pawn one of his brand habits to him.  The more a player smokes, the faster they advance on the Life-O-Metre, which ends with death.  The game ends once the first player dies (in the short game) or when only one player remains alive (in the longer game).<br/><br/>The game is extremely simple to play and is filled with all kinds of horrible (but sometimes amusing) puns.  The game's claim that it has the power to cause smokers to quit and to discourage people from ever picking up the habit is rather questionable, but since it's easy enough to be played by young children, its anti-smoking message might actually be able to reach an audience that hasn't heard it all before.  Unfortunately, the game's simplicity may well work against it; for some players, once all the jokes have been heard (and there aren't all that many), there's really not much reason left to play the game.  On the plus side, there's a lot of player interaction as your profession gets called upon or when you pass your cigarettes to another.<br/><br/>Smokers Wild seems related to Drinkers Wild so it may have been originally published by Gamma Two.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Drinkers Wild<br/>    Lovers Wild<br/><br/><br/>",

The Giver places the die in the cup, shakes the cup, places it face down, then peeks inside. He then claims to hear no rats behind the walls or some number of rats. If he says no rats and the next player &ndash; the Receiver &ndash; believes him, the Receiver becomes the new Giver, adds a die to the cup, and the game continues; if the Receiver doesn't believe him, then he lifts the cup. If no rats are present, the Receiver loses one &quot;brain&quot; scoring token to the Giver; clearly he's touched in the head if he's hearing rats where none exist. If rats are present, however, then the Giver loses two brains, giving one of them to the Receiver. The Caller's an even worse case!<br/><br/>If the Giver claims that rats are present, he must pay one brain, then the Receiver taking the cup can call him (with penalties going one way or the other) or he can believe the Giver, handing over one brain to the Giver as the sanity cost of accepting such nonsense. The Receiver can then either pass the cup along to the next person or he can add a die to the cup, shake all the dice, and make another claim about the number of mice in the walls, with this number being at least one larger than the previous number. In this case, the Receiver becomes the Giver, and the round continues as before.<br/><br/>Once one player has lost all of his brains, the game ends, and the player with the most brains wins.<br/><br/>",

There the death of their grandmaster shook up the knights of the Temple Order, and as the besiegers tried to find a successor for the grandmaster, a power struggle flared up among the Temple knights.<br/><br/>The players take on the roll of dignitaries in the Temple Order during the Third Crusade to the holy land. They strive to expand the power of their order in order to increase its gold and renown of the Temple Knights and spread belief in the holy land. This choice group in the Temple Order will determine the most capable member under them to become the new grandmaster.<br/><br/>Each player has 7 Temple Knights available each round. The player must use them in order to buy city cards, to finish them, and to increase gold, belief, power, and the appearance of the Temple Order. Whoever does this the best will receive additional privileges to help him realize his goals. Only the player who uses all of his possibilities and keeps his opponents in mind will be triumphant in the end.<br/><br/>",

The aim is to avoid taking the last trick.<br/><br/>Each trick is led by the winner of the previous trick (the first trick is led by the player to the dealer's left). Each in turn must then play a card equal to or higher in rank than the previous card played. If they cannot, they then must play their lowest card. Whoever plays the highest card, or the last played if equally high, wins the trick.<br/><br/>Whoever wins the last trick scores penalty points equal to the face value of the card they won the trick with (as does anyone who played a card of the same rank), counting Ace 14, King 13, Queen 12, and Jack 11.<br/><br/>A player reaching 30 points is a &quot;cucumber&quot; and drops out of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This entry serves to represent the various games (mainly rummy games) that may be played with the See Sek deck of cards.<br/><br/>See Sek (also translated  as Soo Sik; in HanYu PinYin it is Si Se) literally means four colors in Hokkien. This derives from the four colors (red, white, green, yellow) that form the suits of this deck of traditional Chinese playing cards.  In English, these are sometimes described as Chess cards because they depict the Chinese characters from Chinese chess (XiangQi). As with most Chinese traditional playing cards, the cards are much longer than they are wide. However, there are regional variants with shorter cards.<br/><br/>Note that See Sek is different from Chess cards that only come in two colors and which are used for a different game.<br/><br/>A full deck consists of 112 cards: 28 cards in each of 4 suits (the colors). Each suit has the Chinese characters for the seven types of XiangQi pieces, repeated four times.<br/><br/>They are often used to play Rummy-type games and the melds may be three or four of exactly the same kind, three or four of a kind but in all different colors, single-card melds (the General or Ong), and three-card melds in 'sequence' and in the same color. There are two 'sequences': Ong, Soo and Chiau (Jiang, Shi, Xiang); and Koo, Beh, Pow (Ju, Ma, Pao).<br/><br/>In Singapore and Malaysia, these card games are often played by Hokkiens and Teochews.<br/><br/>",

Then, their opponents have a chance to play Reality Check cards that increase the difficulty of the crisis and the initial player can adapt by playing more cards from their hand. If they still have enough Techniques to overcome the crisis, they take crisis card and earn victory points equal to the number of Techniques used. The game ends when a player has accumulated 10 victory points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mini Penguin Pile-Up is a children's game for 5-10 year olds with essentially the same (German) name as Penguin Pile-Up also published by Ravensburger.  It is however a completely different game.<br/><br/>The game comprises 8 iceberg tiles and a similar number of small wooden cylinders (in two types depending on whether you want an easy or more challenging game) on which the icebergs tiles are balanced.  The icebergs are arranged on the table in a circle.<br/><br/>A fish counter is placed one of the icebergs and the players take it in turns to move a penguin (the same type of penguin as in Penguin Pile-Up) the number of icebergs (1-5) indicated by the roll of a D6 (the sixth face of the dice shows a picture of a penguin meaning you do not move that turn). Players move the penguin from iceberg to iceberg, one at a time, attempting to place it so that it does not fall off.  If at any stage the penguin/iceberg topples off its stand then it is reset and that player's turn ends immediately.<br/><br/>Every time a circuit of the eight icebergs is completed the player moving the penguin at that time claims the counter and another draw from the stock of 16.  Play continues in a similar manner until all are claimed.<br/><br/>The number of fish (they vary from 1 to 5) on the players' counters are totaled with the winner being the player who has secured the greatest catch.<br/><br/>",

The idea is that the player who is &quot;in&quot; rolls the numbered die, scoring the number of runs as shown on the die. This continues until he rolls the side of the die with the word &quot;Owzthat!&quot; (a corruption of &quot;How's that&quot;, an appeal in cricket). Then, the other die is rolled. The faces on this die show different ways of being out, such as caught, bowled, etc. On this die are also two ways of being not out i.e. the appeal is turned down. If the player is not out, he continues to roll the first die. If he is out, he continues his innings with his next batsman, as in a real game of cricket.<br/><br/>",

In the game each player selects a character and, on his turn, rolls the die and moves on the board. Board spaces tell the players what to do (draw a new card or fight).<br/><br/>The combat system involves each player secretly selecting a card and then comparing the two; the player with the highest value card wins the fight.<br/><br/>The &quot;hit point&quot; system uses two-sided tiles (six for each character) that are placed to show the character healthy. As fights are lost, tiles are flipped to the &quot;damaged&quot; side. Once all six of a character's tiles are flipped over that character is knocked out of the game.<br/><br/>Available in three different versions.<br/><br/>Anakin vs. Dooku<br/>Obi Wan vs. General Grievous<br/>Clone Trooper vs. Super Battle Droid<br/><br/>Each set can be played alone or sets can be combined for larger games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Many Russian tales speak of the character of Baba Yaga, the ogress witch who lives in a house with chicken legs. Fortunately for them, children always find unexpected allies and manage to escape her. Will you prove as fortunate?<br/><br/>In Baba Yaga, you need to escape the claws of the hideous Baba Yaga. To do so, however, you need to collect the ingredients for your three spell cards, and to do that you need to search the forest while Baba Yaga searches for you.<br/><br/>To set up the game, place nine Baba Yaga tiles in a cross to form a flight path, then place the 16 ingredient tokens face down, with four tokens in each section of the cross. Each player starts the game with three spell cards, which must remain hidden. On a turn, the active player reveals her top spell card, which shows four ingredients, then starts searching for these ingredients in the forest, turning over tiles one by one with a single hand and hiding those she doesn't need. While she does this, the other players take turns moving the Baba Yaga figurine one step at a time along one branch of the flight path, then back. If Baba Yaga completes a circuit before the player finds the ingredients, she must place her spell card on the bottom of her stack; if she finds the ingredients, however, she gets to cast the spell on the card, lengthening or shortening the flight path, swapping the location of ingredients, requiring fewer ingredients next time, forcing an opponent to play in a distorted position, and so on. The first player to complete her three spells wins!<br/><br/>Baba Yaga includes variants for younger players, more experienced players, and those who want the chicken-legged house to be constantly on the move. In the two-player game, the single opponent does all the moving of Baba Yaga, but must swap hands with each move, keeping the inactive hand on her head.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is not so much of a game as a device for simulating a test match. The board holds a score board and two rotating randomizers. The bowler rotates his handle to first ball of the over and back to the start, revealing a type of ball (leg break, bouncer, etc). The batsman rotates his handle to the type of ball bowled, and back again, revealing a batsman scoring runs or being dismissed. If you know the rules of cricket, it's obvious how to simulate a test match given these rules.<br/><br/>There are several versions of Test Match. Johns Sands first version appeared in 1954 and shows an 8 ball Over. This being the correct rule in Australian Cricket between 1936 to 1979. Australian Cricket changed to a 6 Ball Over from 1979 and later Test Match versions reflect this change. Other graphical changes, such as updated Grandstands, players positions and scenery have also changed in time. English cricket on the other hand always had a 6 ball Over from 1946 so Waddingtons version only ever showed a 6 ball Over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not to be confused with Campaign, the identically named game produced by Wills and Hepworth in the 1940's.<br/><br/>&quot;An exciting strategy game in which each player can become a Napoleon or a Wellington leading his army across Europe.  Famous battles can be re-fought and alliances can be made and broken with this compelling game of military and political strategy&quot;<br/><br/>Large playing board in three sections, four sets of army pieces in red, white, blue and light green, comprising 1 General, 9 infantry and 9 cavalry units.  Six sets of 4 town cards of different colors, 4 alliance cards, 2 dice, 6 page rule book, and a 4 page &quot;The Years of Napoleon&quot; historical booklet.<br/><br/>The game reproduces the Napoleonic wars at the strategic level in a very abstract fashion (all players are equal).  It can be won either by the outright defeat of your opponent, or (more likely) by acquiring towns controlling large areas of territory.  The board is an abstract representation of Europe and western Russia and is divided into six areas of roughly equal size representing France, Prussia, Russia, Austria, Italy and Spain.<br/><br/>Each country has four provincial towns, and five of the countries used as starting countries also have a capital city.  Parts of the board, particularly the central area, have areas of impenetrable mountains, forests, and sea which restrict the movement of the troops.<br/><br/>There are introductory and standard rules.  Normally, each player selects a country, but in the two player game each gets two countries except that the France + Prussia combo is not allowed.<br/><br/>The pieces move using the dice, and combat is deterministic.  The throw can be used all on one piece or many pieces.  The full throw does not have to be used.  The pieces are placed in a set format on the country selected, with the General on the capital square and four infanty and four cavalry. The town cards are used to keep track of who controls what.<br/><br/>The pieces move in set ways. The General moves one square in any direction. When it attacks it has a value of one and when defending a value of two. The General must be present to take a town.  Cavalry moves two squares at a time and must move horizontally or vertically but never diagonally.  Infantry moves one square and only diagonally.  Pieces cannot pass through opposing lines unless there is a clear gap of at least one square.<br/><br/>Combat is like movement: one considers which pieces could be moved to the target piece's square and totals up the combat value --if large enough, the opposing piece is removed.  Only one piece can be attacked in a turn.  In the standard game, adjacent pieces also support each other (in a manner reminiscent of Diplomacy), which introduces a fair amount of tactics in on-going battles.<br/><br/>Lost pieces are regenerated in your country's mustering area, forcing you to keep a constant flow of recruits towards the front.  In the standard game, the towns also represent logistical support --lose the town and you lose the corresponding piece.<br/><br/>The odd movement system means you actually have two sets of cavalry and infantry pieces on the board, each set (which we could call &quot;odd&quot; and &quot;even&quot;) being unable to assist the other.<br/><br/>A capital can only be captured after the provincial towns have been captured.  Where more than two players are playing you can agree to ally with another player and exchange alliance cards as reminders.  An ally cannot cross into his ally's territory without his consent.  Alliances can be broken simply by announcing the fact; you can attack your former ally on your next turn only, giving him a turn to re-deploy.<br/><br/>The game is won if the player captures all his opponents capitals or captures 8 towns of any colour but not including the 4 in his own country.  You also win if your opponent's General is left with no troops.<br/><br/>Campaign is basically a pure strategy game.  It you are in a position to attack a piece, you will take it.  However, there is some luck depending on how high a movement throw you have.<br/><br/>from the Waddington ad for the game from 1976:   &quot;This absorbing strategy game captures the tension and the pressures of the famous Napoleonc battles. Alliances are made and broken and complex manoevers bring victory or defeat&quot;<br/><br/>",

Used dice are placed into an expended pile where they can later be rallied (re-rolled) to reset their power. Dice are ranked in power and can destroy any die of equal or lesser rank but the higher value dice have special abilities, e.g., Nukes on the Army side that destroy just about everything if you get three of them. On a player's turn, he has three options: (1) Attack with an existing die, (2) Rally any or all dice (including active ones) or (3) Use a special power.<br/><br/>If five rounds pass without either player scoring, then the game ends and the player who has the most dice in his scoring zone wins.<br/><br/>",

Note that the rules differ completely from those of the previously released board game.<br/><br/>The rules are relatively simple. You start with a Jumanji die which defines your action during a turn. The options are: rolling the dice for movement (in some cases against other players), collecting an additional life card (you start with three in your hand) or drafting a Jumanji card. The Jumanji cards can be both positive and negative and may lock a player on a certain space until being freed. All in all it concerns a game of chance based on dice rolling and card drafting.<br/><br/>Although the goal is to be the first player to reach the city of gold (Jumanji), this game is partly cooperative in that Jumanji wins when all players are locked on their space or have lost all of their lives.<br/><br/>",

He/she installs a cover over this card such that the offensive player can only see the players on the line of scrimmage. A &quot;shift&quot; card must also be selected that gives the option of shifting the defensive line to either side for the play.<br/><br/>The offensive player receives the play card and cover and must draw the offensive play on top of the clear holder. This could be a combination of runs, handoffs and passes.<br/><br/>With the plays determined, the cover is removed, the shift card revealed and the path of the play is compared to the defensive positions. Where the path crosses a triangle is where the ball is downed. A touchdown is scored when a play is not downed on the field. Players are also attempting to make ten yards in four downs, as in football, to earn a first down.<br/><br/>Random events include a roll every play to see if there is a penalty, and dice-rolling punting, kick off and field goal rules.<br/><br/>After four quarters of fifteen plays each, the winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>3M Bookshelf Series.<br/><br/>",

The game has an engaging strategy using dice based action selection and an extensive variety of cards. Immerse yourself in it's mythological theme as players deplete their enemy&rsquo;s health to win the battle.<br/><br/>Summoners begin the battle with basic creature and spell cards. Creatures will gift the summoner with worshipers in the form of blue and red dice. The more creatures you summon, the more dice you will gain. Summoners build their army using the occult symbols on the dice. These symbols gain and activate spells, creatures, auras and curses from a common pool of cards.<br/><br/>Spells are powerful actions like summoning mythical creatures and casting fireballs. Creatures can be used against an enemy to attack and defend. Auras can strengthen a summoner&rsquo;s army while curses hinder an enemy. Deplete your enemy&rsquo;s health to eliminate them and win the battle.<br/><br/>Each turn is split into 2 stages: gain and combat. In the gain stage, the player gathers the dice earned by their creatures. They then roll these dice. In the combat stage, players can use the actions available to them on their cards in any order. These actions are cast, ability, and defend. When using these actions they must match the dice symbols or types of creatures on the card. They may end their turn at any moment during the combat stage. Play then continues to the next player. The game ends when one player's hp goes to 0 or below. That player is eliminated. The remaining player wins and is declared the greatest summoner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each of the companies produces a slightly different product, which is made by combining two different raw materials.  The raw materials come from various parts of the center of the board.  When a company harvests these materials, they can choose to either take one, which retains the environment's purity, or they can take multiples, which can turn the area into an ecological wasteland.  Players must balance a work force which is used to collect and process the raw materials, and they must then try to get the best price for the finished product in a randomly adjusted market.  Typically in games of this nature, the corporation who makes the most money is the winner, but in this morally corrupt environment, it's the CEO who makes the most money who's deemed the winner.

        "description": "Players take turns rolling and moving around a circular board (a la Monopoly) in an attempt to &quot;publish&quot; 10 books or obtain $100,000.  Each player starts with $20,000 and a hand of 4 cards, each with a word (&quot;Lethargy&quot;) and four other numbered words (&quot;1. potency, 2. mutability, 3. felicity, 4. vigor&quot;).  In the middle of the board are 4 numbered spaces, 1-4.  At some spaces on the board you are allowed to play antonyms, others synonyms.  You may play up to 4 cards with the proper type to an unfilled number space equal to the number of the appropriate word.  For example on the above card, 4. vigor is an antonym for lethargy and could be played in the #4 spot on the board if empty and you are on a &quot;play antonym&quot; space.  If on your turn you fill the 4th space you &quot;publish a book&quot; and clear all the spaces.  If a player plays all 4 cards from his hand in a turn he also &quot;publishes a book&quot;.  A player may also &quot;publish&quot; a book by passing the start space (&quot;Go&quot;).   If any player feels that a card has been played incorrectly he may challenge the play.  He states what he thinks the correct play is and &quot;bets&quot; $1000.  The playing player may then call or raise in increments of $1000, back and forth until called.  The person who is correct gets the money, and if the challenger is correct the challenged card is returned to the player's hand.  At the end of a player's turn he fills his hand back to 4 cards.  Other spaces on the board require a player to pay money, allow him to collect money, or require all players to pass cards from their hands to other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is about the water cycle: that it evaporates from the sea, rivers, lakes, etc, into the air, where it forms clouds, the clouds move with winds, when they pass over mountains it starts raining, the rain will supply rivers, lakes and underground water, and from here it goes to the sea.<br/><br/>What it&rsquo;s not so obvious that they learn is that the quantity of water in the planet, in it&rsquo;s different forms, does not increase or decrease over the centuries. The population is increasing fast, and that this is originating problems in the water cycle all over the world. This is leading to shortages of water in some regions and to very difficult life conditions.<br/><br/>In this game, players can influence the water cycle. The board represents the water cycle, with all the elements described above, each of them is numbered (from 1 to 6). Players throw dices and each of them choose a movement (one dice) that they want to do. Then they will have to move their water (colour cubes for each player) between those elements. The board also has the population, that is increasing at the same time it&rsquo;s fed with water, and players will try to ensure the population gets the water that it needs. Only this way can they get points. If a player cannot do the movement for the die they chose (or were forced to choose), they LOSE 1 point<br/><br/>The player who can ensure the best balance of water between the different elements of the water cycle, whilst being able to give it to the population whenever there is an opportunity, will make more points and win the game.<br/><br/>",

It's a quick, fun game for kids.<br/><br/>In this game, there are 4 kinds of molded, realistic-looking pizza toppings: tomato slice, mushroom, cheese stick, and pepperoni.  There are 8 of each kind.<br/><br/>As well, there is a chef (Poppa, presumably); he balances the pizza on a finger, and his body can also roll on the ground.  This makes it extra-interesting to keep him balanced! (For a simpler game, connect the notch in the body to the legs, which prevents rolling.)<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a special 6-sided die.  It will either be one of the 4 toppings, a 'wild' topping (you pick), or a chef.<br/>- If it is the chef, then you don't have to place a piece!<br/>- If a particular topping is not available, then roll again.<br/>- Otherwise, put your topping anywhere on the pizza, including on top of other food, without spilling ANY toppings.<br/><br/>The goal is to NOT spill toppings off the pizza.  If you do, you're OUT!  Last one left wins.<br/><br/>Ages 3 and up.<br/><br/>",

Little do you know that it was at this exact spot, thirty years ago to the day, that infamous killer Klein aka The Hatchet Man was executed.<br/><br/>But as soon as night falls you learn the terrifying truth. KLEIN IS BACK. And he has bewitched one of the residents of Crimson Creek to seek his vengeance. You must Run, Peek, and Hide to survive until morning. But even then you won&rsquo;t be safe. You will never be safe again, until you learn the true identity of the killer possessed by The Hatchet Man.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their character tokens around various Crimson Creek locations trying to avoid Klein and deduce his lair and identity. Klein's lair is deduced by secretly looking at locations Klein has yet to attack. His identity is deduced by matching discovered clues with Suspects in a police lineup.<br/><br/>If a player is on a location Klein is attacking without having a hiding place they are slashed and killed by Klein and eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>Work together and survive 3 Acts(rounds), identify the killer, and win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>A heart wrenching co-op tabletop game where you must work with a partner to waddle your three fragile ducklings to safety. As a game where 2 parents from 2 families choose to either work together or against one another to keep their 3 duckling children safe, it simulates what life is like as a parent when the world is out to get you.<br/><br/>The parents are the players and they share a responsibility to supervise and keep their ducklings safe. Families start at opposite bodies of water, with one beginning at the lake and the other at the pond, both with the goal of getting to the other side. The path to your goal is created by the players and is constructed by a deck of randomized event cards prior to play.<br/><br/>On a turn, a parent rolls a die. They move up to the amount of spaces they rolled, and then choose an event card to land on. They will flip this card over and read its effects. Each event card has two options. The parent must choose one of the two options. They may consult their partner on what to do, but it is ultimately their choice. Some biomes can cause harm to the ducklings. When harm comes to the ducklings, an affliction token must be placed on the card. If three afflictions are placed on a duckling, both parents must flip the card so that the picture is face down. This card is now out of play, and the parents must read out loud the text on the back of the card.<br/><br/>If all of the ducklings in your family are flipped, you lose. The family with the most ducklings left alive at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Additional Mechanics Included in Gameplay:<br/><br/>     Each duckling has a unique talent that can only be used once in the game.<br/>     The die you use corresponds to the amount of Ducklings you have. The more ducklings you have waddling behind you, the slower you are able move.<br/>     A territorial duck fight will occur if two parents of different families land on the same space. When this happens, both families suffer an affliction.<br/>     Once both parents from one family reach their new home, the Winter Season begins, where the remaining family suffers one affliction at the start of each of their parents turns.<br/><br/><br/>Features of Ducklings<br/><br/>     Gameplay is simple and easy to pick up, but both the moral and strategic decisions add depth to the simple gameplay.<br/>     Unique, custom artwork for over 60 cards.<br/>     Modular game board as the game is constructed out of a randomizable deck.<br/>     Players can shape the path any way they want, even with creative branching paths.<br/>     The modular game board allows for variable play lengths to fit time constraints as the players do not have to use the full deck.<br/><br/><br/>",

Items are obtained from various shops and are also bought and sold in the marketplace, in exchange for shillings or in trade for other items.  Along the way, various events in history shake things up.  Players visit the many different buildings in a colonial American town (tavern, inn, jail, church, etc.) and find ways to strip other players of their belongings and negotiate trade.  When one player collects all the items on his or her list and ends the game, the player with the most assets becomes the winner.<br/><br/>Rules contain 3 different levels of difficulty so that the game can be tailored to different age groups (Ages 8 and up, Ages 10 and up, and Ages 12 and up).
