        "description": "Gorgon is a checkers-like game, which is played on a 8x8 board. Each player starts with 16 Gorgons - 8 on each of the two back ranks.<br/><br/>On each turn a Gorgon moves diagonally forward, sliding to an adjacent empty square.<br/>A Gorgon may petrify an opponent`s Gorgon by jumping over it to an empty space on the other side. A petrified Gorgon is unable to move and blocks the space it occupies for the remainder of the game. Jumps may be in any of the five non retreating directions: vertically, diagonally forward, and sideways. Multiple jumps are possible. The first and last row of the board are considered to be connected. A Gorgon leaving one edge will be re-entered at the appropriate space on the other edge.<br/><br/>The first player that cannot move, loses.<br/><br/>Note: The game can be played without forced jumps (standard) or with forced jumps (variation).<br/><br/>Gorgon was implemented on Super Duper Games (only without forced jumps).<br/><br/>",

Escaping to the stars was Humanity's solution, settling in space colonies all around the Solar System. Under the banner of Corpnations, the new post-Humanity has forgotten almost everything form its time on Earth, only having to turn back as a strange energy grows in their old home planet...<br/><br/>Mekawing is a Mecha Tactical Board Game in which two opposing wings battle each other in different scenarios.<br/><br/>Providing a total Cinematic Experience, Mekawing mixes the detail of miniature gaming, and the action/counter-action of card gaming to create a unique gaming experience. This is done with both wing creation and deck construction rules and mechanics.<br/><br/>Each player picks their Ace pilots which provide Wing Points from which they buy mechs - Mekas - for their wings. Players have three factions to play, each faction providing a selection of meka types and equipment configurations; focusing on melee combat, ranged combat, or special support.<br/><br/>Additionally, each player builds his/her own Duel decks with cards that show each meka's fighting style, and Upgrade cards that grant special actions and abilities to their Mekas, provide bonuses and/or create special battle situations; giving each wing its own tactics and strategies.<br/><br/>During play, players choose a scenario, build the map using terrain tiles, and use their mekas to gain control of the battleground using their meka's equipment and Action Cards.<br/><br/>Want to now the story behind Mekawing? go to <a target='_blank' href=\"https://mekawing.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/ficcion-mekawing-regimen-de-la-colmena-wan-yang/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://mekawing.wordpress.com/2015/04/28/ficcion-mekawing-r...</a> (content in spanish).<br/><br/>",

Each card represents one of 54 different gods and the three most important aspects [represented by icons] that each God represented. Each player represents a Temple Priest and starts with 3 cards, 5 scarabs [money], and a player card referred to as the TEMPLE. Each turn, players draw one or two cards, which are played to that player&rsquo;s Temple. The card icons determine where they may be placed on the Temple in order to maximize sets of Canopic Jars. For each matching icon you receive one Scarab. For each SET of Scarabs you receive 2, 3, or 4 Jars. At the end of each of the three rounds of play, for each set of four different Jars - you gain one Pharaoh. Rounds stop when the deck is emptied or three cards with special CHAOS icons are showing. At the end of the game, the Priest with the most Pharaohs wins.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-4 players, but comes with 15 extra cards and an extra Temple to add a 5th player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "QuickDraft is a fast tactical card game about drafting the best cards for your hand, maximizing your Victory Points and disrupting your opponents plans.<br/><br/>To reach this goal, the players have different card types at their disposal. <br/>There are coloured cards with different victory point values and quantities and there are white cards offering a wide selection of effects - ranging from improving or copying another card to stealing cards from another player and bonus victory points if specific conditions are met.<br/><br/>The game plays in three phases:<br/><br/>During the Drafting Phase the players are selecting a total of nine cards for their hand using a drafting mechanic like in &quot;7 Wonders&quot; or in &quot;Magic: the Gathering&quot; sealed tournaments.<br/><br/>During the Playing Phase the six of the nine cards collected during the first phase are played and the different card effects are resolved.<br/><br/>During the Counting Phase each player determines how many victory points he has using all the cards he has in front of him (+ eventual bonuses from cards on his hand).<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Though QuickDraw is a multiplayer game, there are rules for a solo game included where a single player trys to beat 10 levels of increasing difficulty.<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>One deck of cards (60 playing cards) is enough to accomodate up to 5 players. If however, two decks of cards are combined, up to 10 players can play QuickDraw.<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>In January 2013 the second edition of this game was published by the Gamecrafter. The game now features a new card type - black cards, new card effects on the white cards and offers several new strategies by strengthening the coloured cards.<br/>This new version also includes a Hold'em variant - essentially offering two different games in one small package.<br/><br/>",

These are used to track your stats and resolve conflicts as you explore the Bionic Universe through one of the adventures designed for Nano Edition.<br/><br/>Each adventure provides a few cards for items, contacts and identities unique to that adventure as well as an adventure booklet. The adventure booklet (sometimes more than one) is the meat of your adventure - a paragraph driven micro-RPG. The goal of each adventure is different, but the fundamental game-play is the same: Make choices and flip chits to resolve conflicts.<br/><br/>",

As the elven warrior maiden Kora, you must brave three increasingly dangerous levels to recover the Book, destroy Grislyk&rsquo;s magical Black Crucible, and slay the wizard himself. Magical artifacts will help you evade Grislyk&rsquo;s traps and slay his army of goblins and skeletons, but you will also need your wits and a bit of luck, for knowing when to search, when to fight, and when to run is the only way to survive the DUNGEON OF DEADLIEST EVIL.<br/><br/>Dungeon of Deadliest Evil is a solitaire adventure game that takes all the essential elements of a classic dungeon crawl, like slaying monsters, finding powerful artifacts, and exploring a multi-level dungeon, and packs them into an easy-to-learn game that sets up and plays in 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Gameplay is based on a simple dice allocation mechanic. You have three abilities, Speed, Combat, and Defense, and at the start of each turn you must assign one of three dice (a d4, a d6, and a d8) to each of them. While the game involves a good deal of luck and dice-rolling, judicious dice allocation is the key to success. Victory is achieved by destroying the Black Crucible, retrieving the Book of Lore, slaying the evil wizard Grislyk, and finally leaving the dungeon alive.<br/><br/>",

Climb aboard any one of Lydon Rail Company&rsquo;s four railways and race to be the first train to successfully deliver $1,000,000 in resources! Be wary of what lies ahead, as setbacks are bound to happen! Tariffs will slow our delivery, maintenance will stop you in your tracks and hijackers are eager to steal your payload! Fix what you can, deliver the goods and attain victory!<br/><br/>Gameplay Overview:<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of four unique railways each with a unique advantage. During a turn, a player has up to 4 available actions, Draw, Transport, Remedy, and Sabotage, each of which will either bring you closer to victory or slow down your opponents. Your main goal is to accumulate $1,000,000 in resources before another player beats you to it. Denominations range from $25,000 to $250,000, so keep a look out for highly valued resources. But it isn't as simple as drawing and transporting resources...Setbacks can bring you to a halt. Remedy them quick to keep moving! Game play is quick, with each player allowed up to 3 actions per turn! You may draw, transport and sabotage in a turn, Draw twice and then remedy, or if you are feeling notorious, Sabotage three times! A 2-player game usually lasts about 10-15 minutes. Add a third and expect a bit longer.<br/><br/>",

Then the winner of the last movement  will earn points equal to the value of the hidden card (no multiplication here).<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has 50 points or more.

The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh, with graphics by Bruce Yearian, and is published by High Flying Dice Games.<br/><br/>Head Honcho: Jet Combat over the Yalu is also the Consimworld Donation Drive Gold Level game for 2015. Head Honcho features such aircraft as the F-86, the F-84, F9F Panther and other aircraft of the war, all battling the Communist MiG-15s for air supremacy.<br/><br/>Head Honcho is not meant to be the most accurate of air warfare simulations. Rather, players should find this an entertaining diversion that still captures the &ldquo;essence&rdquo; of the violent and tense nature of Korean War jet combat. Similar to other minigames using this design (Dueling Eagles, Fighting Eagles), I also hope Head Honcho serves as a vehicle by which newcomers to the hobby of simulation gaming can be introduced.<br/><br/>",

Four of the characters will be Keepers. This deck also includes random Revelation cards which change the Keepers and the way to greet them, and causes characters to be condemned as Heretics, or pardoned.<br/><br/>The penalty for making an incorrect response or being too slow to make the correct response is to collect the face-up Acolyte deck.

They were designed by Jason Tagmire and illustrated by Campbell Whyte.<br/><br/>Each card features an illustration with 4 unique elements. There is a character, holding an item, completing an action, in a location. Each of these elements can be used to create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.<br/><br/>The cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a rank, suit, mood, season, letter, and color.<br/><br/><br/>The Storyteller Manual: Fantasy edition includes rules for different ways to play. From strategic coloring to push-your-luck storytelling, there are game variations for everyone. Many variants are story based gaining points for each card played, best poker hands and matching card elements, but others include strategic coloring (where players must complete illustration quadrants to earn points), and endless possibilities (where the players create and change the rules in a race to 30 points).<br/><br/>",

But the names and signs of Pubs have a rich and fascinating story to tell, which is celebrated in this highly original card game. Easy to learn and tremendous fun to play!<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of 5 cards and must play them all to win. To play a card you must play a pub whose symbol matches the last card played. Symbols form suits and there are 11 in the game. There are also some special cards to spice things up for the next player (miss a turn, reverse play direction). A series of 3x cards (eg 3 Barrels) also require the next player to pick up 3 cards. This can be defeated with another 3x card causing the next player to pick up 6 and so on.<br/><br/>When down to the last card, the player must call &quot;time gentleman please&quot; or &quot;last order&quot; or gain a penalty card. When the last card is played, the winner scores the value of all other players remaining cards. Rounds continue until target score (eg 50) is achieved.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "June 1994 - These boosters were also released with the first edition double decks.  They had 14 cards that could be found with standard decks, plus every pack had one of 25 chase cards.  These chase were the first AD&amp;D champions. It also had 6 cards names for people at TSR: Gib Ekim (#4), Gib Evets (#11), Gib Htimsen (#13), Dori the Barbarian (#12), Red Zeb (#19), and Fejyelsae (#7).  This tradition would continue for many boosters to follow.  This is also where we found the first &quot;instant defeat&quot; champions: Lovely Colleen (#22), and Gloriana (#3).  Now, that seems to be all you see in tourney decks.  This too continues throughout Spellfire's History.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this board game adaptation of the popular video game franchise, players take turns as they attempt to be the first player to cross the finish line, after completing two laps.  To do this, players take control of the steering wheel which acts as dice in the game.  Depending on which of three colors your playing piece is sitting on the game board, that indicates how many times you turn the steering wheel left or right.  The steering wheel will then tell you how many spaces to move your playing piece.  As in the video game, item boxes are scattered around the game board which grants items as players land on them.  Some are instant use items, while others are used later.The steering wheel is also used to determine if items are used successfully against opponents.  When hit by an item, players spin the steering wheel six times and the wheel will tell you if the outcome is successful or not.  Successful hits push the affected player to the edge of the game board marked by blue spaces.<br/><br/>",

Not only the people frequented the races, but emperors, senators, intellectuals, writers crowded the circus.<br/>The Aurigae, who drove chariots with two, three, four, sometimes eight or ten horses, where idols of the crowd, but the people didn&rsquo;t support particularly the driver, but one of the four traditional teams.<br/>Quadrigae (demo version) reproduces the Roman chariot races through a fast system which gives you the chance to revive a whole day at the races in an evening. The charioteers, each one with his own name and characteristics, assume the role of the captain looking for the victory or of a helper who try to facilitate his captain blocking and attacking the adversaries. Not all of them will arrive whole at the end: some will fall without damage but humiliation, some others will remain stunned and out of the races; the unluckiest&hellip; will die. As the owner of a team (Dominus factionis) you&rsquo;ll decide the tactics of the race and sign on your register the won races, good results and injuries.<br/>The quadrigae (chariots) move along a 100 x 28 cm board reproducing the Circus Maximum. Each chariot can make two phases of advance and one phase (optional) of aggression. The movement consists in an automathic advancement of 2 steps and a bonus of 1 step depending on the strengthness of the chariot.<br/><br/>",

Helping bring History back to life.  Tali, recreates the knucklebones game of gambling as the Roman's used to play it.  Two games in one, Tali includes the historic rules played 1000 years ago as well as a micro role-playing game version with more player options and complexity.<br/><br/>Knucklebones is the ancestor to dice, before there were dice, the knuckle bones of sheep (or sometimes goats) would be used as it had a regular shape of four possible sides to land on.<br/><br/>The Romans would sometimes mark the knuckle bones with different roman numerals on each side, I,III, IV and VI.  The roman numerals would then be used to score the throw of the bones.<br/><br/>Players ante into the game similar to modern gambling games.  Once to play and then for each round.  Every round each player will get to throw the bones.  You score when getting at least one VI.  The player who achieves either a Venus or the highest total will win the round and the coins in the round pot.<br/><br/>The Venus throw will win the game pot and the round pot (each face, I, II, IV, and VI).<br/><br/>A micro role-playing game has been added to the historic base game, in which each player selects a historic character from 1000 AD to play.  Each character is given a rich background and a set of powers / capabilities to help them win in Tali.<br/><br/>Are you feeling lucky?  Are the gods with you tonight?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For decades our planet has been monitored by alien species. Worried by recent events, enormous alien spaceships are sent towards earth. Announcing they come to save us from our self-inflicted fate, people rush to get on-board the spaceships. But the aliens will only let the smart people on-board, leaving the less gifted behind. Most of the leaders get in, but some didn&rsquo;t make the cut, for more or less obvious reasons.<br/><br/>In World Dumbination you play as these five leaders that didn't make it on-board. You can choose to play as the leader of USA, Venezuela, Turkey, and Russia &ndash; or, of course, North Korea! It&rsquo;s never been easier to conquer the world. Will you make it to world domination, will you all destroy the planet in a nuclear super-shower, or will you collectively achieve world peace!<br/><br/>World Dumbination is a fun asymmetric strategy game for 2 to 5 players. The game was inspired by world leaders arguing like small children sitting in a sandpit, and that is the idea for the cover art.<br/><br/>Even if there are a lot of military leaders remaining, you need to build your military forces from scratch. Reaching your first goal makes you able to draw stronger cards. Each nation has two first goals option and the goals are different for each nation.<br/><br/>Find the best strategy to move your forces and build military bases (that decide the strength of your units). The players choose and place cards to reveal them all at the same time. Play action cards to attack your opponents to gain victory points, or play project cards to get some advantages as well as victory points.<br/><br/>You also have to constantly watch your ego and popularity levels that you can control with card actions. With too little self-esteem you don&rsquo;t dare to do any action. Too much ego makes you crazy and focused on only one target (you have to almost be crazy to use the nuclear bomb). If you get to unpopular, you as a leader can be overthrow by your own government. Getting very popular increases you income since your people work harder for you.<br/><br/>There are geniuses (those who wouldn&rsquo;t get on the spaceships) still hiding on Earth. Finding one or two of them would also help you in your quest for world domination. You can also find things that the aliens left behind.<br/><br/>In case the players get too clever, there are Dumbness cards in the mix to make sure some kind of stupidity will take place. Will anyone win the Nobel Peace Prize? Maybe some briefcases with secret codes got mix up during the last world meeting, or will the bombs fly uncontrollable around since none of the leaders have any knowledge of geography!<br/><br/>You win by having the most victory points in the end. The game ends when a player has reached 15 victory points, or when 4 nuclear bombs has been disarmed and removed from the game. Yes, this is a war game you can win by making world peace! You will also find a party alien, fake news, reality shows, abandoned spaceships and cute kittens threatening to start a nuclear war in this game!<br/><br/>There are some interesting new mechanics in the game, but the main thing in this game is the fun factor! This game is designed for a lot of interaction between players and the surprisingly events that shows up add a great deal to the silliness. And the more players, the more fun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vs System 2PCG is superficially similar to the original Vs. System collectible card game, but is a completely rebuilt game that takes some inspiration from the original. Combat has been streamlined, the turn structure is different, the resource system has been revamped, and the game is no longer collectible, with cards instead being released in a non-random format. A single box contains a full play-set of all cards.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a Main Character, such as Captain America, Iron Man, or Loki and a deck of 60 cards. During the game, you&rsquo;ll play resources and recruit Supporting Characters like Falcon, Baby Groot, or Nebula. You&rsquo;ll organize your formation between your Front and Back Rows, you&rsquo;ll make solo and team attacks against your enemies in order to stun and KO them. You&rsquo;ll play Plot Twists to enhance your team or hurt your opponent&rsquo;s. You&rsquo;ll play locations and activate your team&rsquo;s super powers. Your Main Character will earn Experience Points and Level Up to dominate the battlefield. Finally, you&rsquo;ll KO your opponent&rsquo;s Main Character (or they&rsquo;ll KO yours).<br/><br/>Each turn, you&rsquo;ll go through the following four phases in order. Then, the next player takes a turn.<br/>1. Draw Phase - Draw 2 cards from your deck<br/>2. Recovery Phase - Any stunned characters are recovered and then readied.<br/>3. Build Phase - Play a resource or Location. Then using you total resource points recruit new characters form your hand based on their cost.<br/>4. Main Phase - The longest phase consisting of multiple combats as you attack your opponents characters trying to stun and KO them.<br/><br/>The first issue of the Earth 199999 Arc, Vs System 2PCG: The MCU Battles is also the first Giant-Sized Issue of 2018. It not only creates a new Universe for vs System 2PCG is also introduces two new teams. The MCU Heroes and MCU Villains. This 200 card Giant-Sized Issue is perfect step on point for new players as this comes with a full set of cards with images straight from the movies, counters, and a full color rulebook.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

With his Uncontrolled Wrath Special Ability, he's able to roll 2 extra dice when he attacks Zone 1 (for a total of 3 dice, as each Hero is able to roll 1 die innately) - enabling him to clear many Krohns storming the walls as he bellows savagely. His Base Strength of 3 ensures that he's strong enough to deal with Elite enemies and M&ouml;lens without needing Bonus Strength. But all of his savagery comes at a price: Thorlak can't store Permanent Cards, and therefore can't equip Armor or Weapons.<br/><br/>As a veteran of many battles, Eivor, the Noble boasts a Base Strength of 2, which enables him to deal with the Elite versions of Krohns and Gargohs from the very start of the game. Eivor's Persuasion starting Special Ability grants an extra Gold when he visits the Palace - and this extra Gold may be given to another Hero if he chooses to do so. With this ability, the entire group of Heroes may benefit, as the extra Gold that's shared can make the difference, enabling a Hero to use a vital Resource Card! Lastly, as a lord of the city, Eivor can more quickly level up due to lower Food costs requirements, which will make him an even more valuable asset in the siege!<br/><br/>With his Cook Extraordinaire Special Ability, Donatto gains an extra Food everytime he visits the Barn in the Citadel, and this extra Food may be given to another Hero of his choice. Having the famous chef on the team will ease the pressure to get Food each Season for the entire team.<br/><br/>",

With his Base Strength 2, he has enough damage to kill Elite Krohns, Elite Gargohs, and Orcs right from the beginning. But more importantly, his starting Special Ability Legendary Vigor allows him to ignore up to 2 hits per round, in true tank format! It makes Viggo ideal to soak up damage where it's needed the most: be it while protecting a vital building or battling Assault Units in a side of the wall that's swarmed with enemies!<br/><br/>Growing up in a farm gave Dahlia, the Peasant not only a deal of hardships to overcome, but also a solid dedication to work and a strong will. 'Stoicism', her starting Special Ability, represents Dahlia's natural skill to overcome troubles and frees her up from the requirement of gathering food by the end of each season. That means that her actions can be better spent in other areas of the Citadel and it makes it easier for her to get new Special Abilities. Lastly, she also has a Blue Permanent Card slot, which allows her to use one piece of Weapon or Armor.<br/><br/>Astrid, the Princess is unique in the fact that she doesn't have a starting special ability. Instead, Astrid's Special Ability slots have lower Food requirements, enabling her to acquire new Special Abilities quickly and easily. Due to her military knowledge, Astrid has 2 Permanent Card slots, meaning she can don combinations of Weapons and Armor that will give her an edge in combat.<br/><br/>",

Players will roll dice, explore tiles, collect treasure and fight enemies.<br/><br/>The game comes with a deck of 35 cards, players will shuffle the deck then place all cards face down, forming 5 rows with 7 cards each. Players start on the spacecraft card. Your objective is to collect the six star rings and return to the spacecraft.<br/><br/>The first player will roll three action dice. These dice can be spent to move or attack. Flip over each card when moving to reveal any star rings or enemy encounter cards. If an encounter card is revealed, players end their movement on this card and must place the appropriate number of enemies. Roll enemy dice and place them on the furthest card in the direction of the arrows. The value rolled is the enemies health. Players can continue using any unspent action dice to move and attack as normal. At the end of either players turn, all enemy dice will move one card closer to the active player, if any enemy dice are adjacent to the player they will attack for one damage each, spin down the player die to track health. If either player&rsquo;s health is reduced to zero, game over.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Twilight of the Soldier Kings rules is a set designed to fight large historical battles on a reasonable sized table and with a reasonable number of figures in the era of Fredereick the Great (1730 to 1770). The player is the army commander seeking to marshal the full forces that their historical counterpart had to achieve victory and not some colonel or brigadier controlling a few battalions or squadrons in the fight for some sector of a battlefield. The concentration is on the 'big picture' rather on relatively unimportant details. The rules reward historic tactics and practices while making typical 'gamer' tactics obsolete. So, players will want their forces to be in at least two lines with a reserve and not strung out in a line as is commonly done in other rules.<br/><br/>The system is intuitive and easy to pick up. The units are around 2,500 infantry, around 1,200 cavalry and 12 to 20 guns and so the units are often a brigade of around 4 infantry battalions or 8 to 12 cavalry squadrons. The scale is flexible with all distances, ranges, movements based on half of the frontage of the units you use. For example, if your units have a frontage of perhaps 100mm (4 inches) the standard measurement unit in the game will be 50mm (2 inches). There is no figure removal so you can base you units as you wish, with any number or size of figures on a base, etc. As long as the units are the same frontage it does not matter and indeed neither does it if the armies involved are based differently.<br/><br/>While any unit size can be used if the frontage of a unit is in the region of 120mm then most battles can be fought on a table 1.8m by 1.2m (6 feet by 4 feet) or similar. Most standard battles should be playable in a typical afternoon or evening playing session. It is possible to play 'Manoeuvre' battles in which the attacker has extra options to attack but will usually require a larger table. In a standard battle the armies are on table in their half of the table and generally facing up to each other. While in a manoeuvre battle the defending army is in active and placed in the centre of the table with a wide area empty of troops around them. The attacking army can then attempt to march around the defending army to attack from one or more different directions. Alternatively the attacking army can arrive on table in sections from all edges of the table in a converging attack. Of course these manoeuvres might not work or can be delayed or the inactive defenders can activate and react to the situation.<br/><br/>The rules include scenarios for the battles of Mollwitz (1741), Kolin (1757), Krefeld (1758) and a generic Manoeuvre battle based on the battles of Hochkirch and Zorndorf (both 1758).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Saddam Moves South (SMS) is an operational level two player wargame covering a hypothetical Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia in 1990. The assumption here is that after the Iraqi army overran Kuwait in the first week of August 1990, Saddam Hussein continued the offensive to grab the vital oilfields of Saudi Arabia. In response, the United States leads a coalition of states to stop the Iraqis and then retake lost territories.<br/><br/>The game system is based on that of Desert One War, which models ground, air and amphibious operations. For the Coalition, the central game system is Air Transport Points (ATP) which represent strategic airlift capability. The assumption is that the scenarios cover the opening stage of an intervention, before the US can mobilize full-scale sealift. Therefore, airlift will become the primary means for moving units into the theater and providing logistical support.<br/><br/>The Iraqis are closer to their lines of communications, but their ability to conduct sustained offensives is restricted by planning and logistical considerations, modeled in the game by making the capture of certain objectives a prerequisite for sustaining their offensive. Another factor is that the decisive mobile campaign which the Coalition conducted in 1991 was in part the result of extensive preparation of the theater of operations via logistical buildup, intelligence and in-theater training during the period August 1990 to January 1991. The campaign in the game models the situation where the Coalition must build up in the face of a continuing Iraqi offensive.<br/><br/>Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #339 Mar-Apr 2023<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3-10 days<br/>Hex: 21.75 miles / 35 kilometers<br/>Units: Group to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (228 9/16&quot; counters - with 4 blank counters included)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to provide one 6-sided die for game play.<br/><br/>",

You are a band of pirates working together to follow the clues and reveal the buried treasures hidden around Shell Island.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, treasure chest cards are placed face-down beside the board with a series of secret clue cards on top. The first clue for each chest is revealed and an X-marks-the-spot token placed on the board at each clue's location.<br/><br/>On their turn, players draw a shell from a bag to determine how many spaces they can move. If a player lands on space marked with an X token, they collect that clue card. The next clue card in the hunt is revealed and the X token moved to the new clue's location. If a player collects the last clue in a hunt, they uncover the treasure chest and reveal the treasure inside. Players can also choose to give their movement shell to another player who may be closer to a clue or treasure.<br/><br/>If a player draws a ship shell, the pirate ship moves one space closer to shore. When it reaches the island, it's time to go- The hunt is over and any unfound treasure is lost.<br/><br/>Yarrr Har Hunt is designed to allow very young players with limited game experience to play side-by-side with older kids and adults.

One player is in charge of the PRC army and the other player is in charge of the Republic of China (Taiwan) army.<br/><br/>In historical fact, although the PRC army, which had gained momentum in the previous victories, landed, the lack of preparation and training for the landing operation was remarkable, and only about 9,000 people were able to actually land on Kinmen Island. On the other hand, the Taiwanese army expected the PRC army to land on Kinmen Island, and was waiting for the PRC army with 40,000 troops, including reinforcements from the 18th Army (however, most of the 18th Army arrived after the battle was over). Also, for the PRC army, which had no anti-tank equipment, the M5A1 light tanks of the Taiwanese army were a threat.<br/><br/>In this way, looking back on history, it was an inevitable landing operation, but it is not without the element of &quot;what-if&quot;. If the PRC army had more boats ready for landing, if command and control were good, if they chose a different coast for the second landing... In this game, by introducing such &quot;what-if&quot; into the game, the PRC army is also given the possibility of winning.<br/><br/>Issue game of &quot;Banzai Magazine EX&quot; #3.<br/><br/>",

A 2am consult from the Emergency Room can throw off your best plans!<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each day in the ICU, the game's engine tries to add Injury and Crisis tokens to patients and players race to remove these tokens. Each patient can sustain Injury to five different systems: brain, heart, lung, blood, and inflammation. In addition, each patient has a Crisis track representing the intangibles of being sick in the hospital: how much the patient is suffering and how close they are to death. As Crisis tokens accumulate, patients are more likely to develop complications. If all available slots for injury tokens or the Crisis Track are filled, the patient undergoes a Code Blue and the team has a chance to work together to save the patient or else the game is lost.<br/><br/>The game is played over a week: seven Days in the ICU. Each Day is broken up into several phases. First, Rounding and Complications happen simultaneously for all players; during Rounding, any cards already on the patient take effect, adding or removing Injury and Crisis. Then, Complications are drawn for each patient; the injury they have already sustained determines what Complications they get, just like in real life! After Rounding and Complications, players take individual turns called Shifts. During each Shift, a player draws and resolves a Pager card and then draws up to 7 Therapy cards and plays up to 12 hours of Therapies. Pager cards represent real life in the hospital, such as when nursing is short-staffed or the CT scanner breaks down.  Therapy cards have beneficial effects for patients, often removing Injury or Crisis tokens. Many instantly remove Injury/Crisis; tokens removed this way are added to your experience pool, which may be used for a variety of purposes including bringing in consulting Specialists in the next phase. In the Specialist Phase, players pool experience tokens to consult Specialists and bring them into the ICU. Specialists have active and passive abilities to bend the rules in your favor; for example, the Surgeon prevents complications from invasive procedures. After the Specialist phase, the Day counter is advanced and the phases repeat, starting with Rounding, until either all patients are cured &amp; discharged from the ICU (win), patients survive until the end of Day Seven (win), or any patient dies (lose).<br/><br/>Critical Care is brought to you by a diverse team of doctors, board game designers, experts in patient language &amp; graphic design, artists, and writers as well as a phenomenal team of sensitivity reviewers who bring in an additional focus on health equity and the patient &amp; family experience of the intensive care unit. We hope Critical Care gives you an immersive experience of the ICU that is fun and authentic but never disrespectful.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To execute a card, slide it up slightly to indicate it&rsquo;s been executed. Then perform the command. Each of these commands must be executed to move on but the order they&rsquo;re executed in makes all the difference.<br/><br/>All even numbered cards have alarms on them which will alert security personnel to your intrusion.

Well, they're rumored to be the owner's nephew, so you'd better not bother them. Well, unless they're the spy next door.<br/><br/>Trick Dumpling differs from the usual trick-taking game in that the highest numbered cards are discarded when the total of the numbers in each suit exceeds a certain number. The reason for this is that the steamer is very small and can only hold up to 10 dumplings, as the restaurant has saved on capital expenditure.<br/><br/>(maximum) 10 dumplings per dish!<br/>Compete with other cooks to complete the perfect dish of dumplings by reading the dynamically changing strength of the cards.

        "description": "Mitsuhama, a.k.a. 三津浜, is a game of buying and selling fish based upon the traditions in the port city of Mitsuhama. In the game, players are buying fish at auction, storing them in their warehouses, and then selling them to local restaurants.<br/><br/>On each turn, one player rolls four dice, corresponding to the four types of fish in the game, and places some or all of these up for auction. In real-time, the other players bid an amount of money they would pay for these fish. The auctioneer can choose to accept the highest bid or pay that bid themselves. Money from the auction is paid to either the auctioneer or the highest bidder, and can be paid by fixed value money cards, bartered with fish, or both. If the money card(s) paid from one player to another player are larger than the bid, no change is provided.<br/><br/>In each game, five restaurants are available for selling fish to. These are double sided and chosen randomly each game. Any players who gained fish from an auction in a turn are able to sell fish to the restaurants. Each player has a number of &quot;employee cubes&quot; used to track the amount of each type of fish in their warehouses, and when selling to a restaurant, one of these employees is removed from the warehouse and used to mark the income the player will receive from the restaurant at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game will end when a predetermined number of employee cubes have been placed on a restaurant. The player with the most money wins, and this is a combination of the money cards in hand, fish remaining in warehouses, and income received from the restaurants.<br/><br/>The designer's family lives in Matsuyama, a city with some ports including Mitsuhama, and the painting on the cover of the box is one of the port made by his grandfather.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 3 dueling cards and 9 drafting cards. Out of those nine cards, they add three to their dueling cards and distribute the rest among the other players. The process is repeated with the cards they hold afterwards. <br/>The players distribute the 12 cards they hold now into three stacks: 3 for the first round, 4 for the second and 5 for the third. During each round, players can choose to reveal some of their cards; for each revealed card, a point token is added to the pool (from the bank). Then players can choose to participate or withdraw. All participating players reveal their remaining cards and the highest total wins the pool (losing players add tokens to the pool). <br/>This is repeated through rounds two and three, then cards are distributed again. The game ends after the round when someone has gained 50 points.<br/>The strengths of the monsters are often interdependent, so holding certain combinations makes them stronger. To win, players must use these combinations cleverly.<br/><br/>",

Then the plane begins to fall... Yes, the holdup was perfect and they had anticipated everything &mdash; everything but enough parachutes to go around...<br/><br/>Play your role amongst ten characters in Bahamas and steal, lie, threaten, do everything you can to get the biggest part of the loot and land safely!<br/><br/>In more detail, each player receives a character sheet at random (each with a different special power), along with one starting card, one action card, and two cash cards. Among these starting cards are 2-5 parachutes (depending on the number of players), and you'll want one of these to survive at game's end! Use a number of dice equal to the player count minus one. Choose a starting player at random. This player rolls all the dice, uses one of them (drawing an action or cash card, stealing an action or cash card from an opponent, or using their special power), then they choose the next player who will take a turn. Once all the dice have been used, whoever didn't get to use a die becomes the starting player for the next round.<br/><br/>A &quot;Crash&quot; card is shuffled into the bottom four cards of the action deck, and when it's drawn, everyone without a parachute &mdash; or the lifeboat hiding in the action deck &mdash; plunges to their death. Whichever surviving character has the most money wins! Alternatively, if one player collects the three different FBI cards prior to the crash, this player manages to land the plane safely, bust everyone else, and win!<br/><br/>This edition includes the base game, a promo card as well as the expansion Bahamas: Trou d'air which added new playable characters, new action cards, a new turbulence module and money bags with holes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Consensus Junior is the third and newest addition to the award-winning Consensus collection. As the name implies, this one's for the kids.<br/><br/>The game follows the same, award-winning design as the other two versions. There's a large, colorful board, a deck of 200 noun cards, a deck of 75 adjective cards, a deck of voting cards (8 sets of cards, each with a unique border color, numbering 1-10) and a collection of 8 colored pawns, one for each of the sets of voting cards. The board has numbered spaces for 10 noun cards, a space for the adjective card, and a scoring track. The noun cards are drawn and placed face-up, one in each of the numbered spaces on the board. An adjective card is turned over. Players select the one noun they think most closely fits the adjective, place their vote face down on the table, and then take turns revealing their selection. The answer receiving the greatest number of votes is deemed the winning answer and the players who chose the winning answer move ahead one space. In a case where there is no clear majority, no one scores. Hence the name, Consensus.<br/><br/>The key to the difference between the Junior Edition and the other editions of Consensus is the content of the noun and adjective cards. Given, for example, the following randomly selected noun cards:<br/><br/>* Bee Hive<br/>    * Bed Bug<br/>    * My Daddy<br/>    * Nemo<br/>    * World Peace<br/><br/>Which would you vote for if the adjective were (also a random sample):<br/><br/>* Rare<br/>    * Adorable<br/>    * Unforgettable<br/><br/>If the adjective were &quot;rare,&quot; which do you think is, um, rarest: your daddy, world peace, Nemo? Which the most adorable? Which the most self-evidently unforgettable?<br/><br/>Even as the mature person you most obviously are, you'd still have a somewhat clear and more or less patently obvious choice, regardless of which adjective was chosen. And, with an &quot;opponent&quot; of the unabashed certainty of an eight-year-old, you know there will be strong opinions about everything. This is what makes the Junior Edition so appealing: everyone counts, everyone in the family finds themselves personally invited, everyone has an opinion, everyone feels equally entitled, equally correct, and, with the Junior edition, pretty much equally informed. How many family games can you say that about?<br/><br/>",

Then players have a chance to flee the battle, trying to prevent their opponents from scoring. Attacks are resolved in initiative order.

The first player to earn 5 of them wins.<br/><br/>You earn cubes using the seven unique dice. Six can go to players (it supports 2-6 players) and the seventh is used to swap dice after each player's turn. It&rsquo;s rare that you&rsquo;ll have the same die every turn.<br/><br/>Each die has its strengths and weaknesses, and physical skill at dice spinning makes a difference. It&rsquo;s surprising how easy it is to learn how to spin dice though. Some dice are more likely to earn you a cube when rolled, some are better at spinning, and you choose each turn to roll or spin. Either way you end your turn by rolling the swap die and doing what it says to swap dice with other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Ghost Hunter: Vampires players become Infernal Club investigators. In their latest adventure they have uncovered the worldwide phenomenon of vampirism. Now they risk their necks (literally) to become the best vampire hunters and end the curse.<br/><br/>Ghost Hunter: Vampires is a card game for 2-6 players that should last for 10 &ndash; 20 minutes. Players take turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on a stack then they must pick up the stack. If a player lays a set or run of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Many of the cards that can be laid have addition rules that affect the game, for instance'the next player misses ago' or 'capture the top 3 cards from an opponent's capture pile, it is using these special rules at the right time that is the real skill of the game. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game. Players count up the scores of all of the cards they have captured minus all of the cards they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>Although Ghost Hunter: Vampires is a stand alone game, it is compatible with other Ghost Hunter decks, allowing players to combine decks or just play with their favorite cards from any deck.<br/><br/>",

With Campaign of Nations, he turns his attention to the Napoleonic era, and specifically to the dramatic and turbulent 1813 Leipzig campaign. Waterloo might get the attention and the catchy pop song, but it was Leipzig that saw the emperor encircled, defeated, and forced to abdicate.<br/><br/>These are far larger, grander armies than those that marched across your plexi in Mr. Theissen's ACW games. New Zone of Control rules appropriate for this scale make it more difficult to slip by the enemy. Just before being attacked, defenders in multiple hexes may attempt to concentrate forces, leading to dramatic swings in fortune. These and other rules support a tense board situation in which the French player, occupying a central position, must contend with enemy armies marching in from all directions. Will Napoleon defeat each one in detail, or will they be able to tighten the noose?<br/><br/>",

Conscription was constant. Larger and larger armies clashed on battlefields across the Old Continent, led by noblemen, princes, aristocrats or heroes emerging from the ranks.<br/><br/>Put yourself at the head of an army and become the nobleman or hero accomplishing the mission you have been assigned. You have at your disposal enormous masses of infantry, fast-moving cavalry formations and powerful cannons, backed up by elite forces and legendary warriors. You will have to make quick and daring decisions, take advantage of the favourable positions and terrain features the battlefield has to offer, all to defeat your adversary and obey the orders sent by your superiors.<br/><br/>In Napoleon at War you command your forces, the size of a Division, and try to accomplish your assigned mission in a game played on a gaming table, with an array of magnificently painted miniatures, while a good friend at the other side of the table tries to thwart your efforts and crush your forces.<br/><br/>To play Napoleon at War you will need:<br/><br/>First of all, an army, organised according to one of the Campaign Manuals, and made up of a good number of 18mm Napoleon at War miniatures.<br/><br/>The rules.<br/><br/>An adversary, since the game is for two or more players.<br/><br/>A battlefield, consisting of a flat surface on which you can place terrain features to represent important terrain features  such as woods, villages, hills... of the type that can be found anywhere in Europe.<br/><br/>A measuring tape and a good number of dice. Typical six-sided dice or D6s as they are commonly known.<br/><br/>With Napoleon at War you can recreate important battles of the Napoleonic Wars in your own living room. You can command a terrible Division of French Cuirassiers or a firm red line of determined British infantry. Which is your favourite army?<br/><br/>",

Set the rest of tiles aside as a pool. Each player selects a colour. Take the 16 discs of your colour. Select a first player.<br/><br/>Players take turns during the game until, at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn, someone has won (whether it&rsquo;s their turn or not). On your turn, you will either stack, add, or move. If you can stack, you must stack; otherwise, you can choose whether to add or move.<br/><br/>Stack (mandatory): If at the beginning of your turn, two or more of your single discs are adjacent to one another, you must stack one of those single discs atop an adjacent single disc of yours. Your turn is done.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Featuring seven victory conditions the path to victory may shift as you gain more information about each subject&rsquo;s motives and those of the other families. Your allegiances will twist and change based on your interests. The subjects are but pawns.<br/><br/>The game is played over two phases:<br/>INTRIGUE PHASE<br/>Players will gather information, exert influence, and gather resources. Each member of the court has a role, each player may look at 1 role, place an influence token on a court member and select a Leverage card to add to their hand.<br/><br/>REBELLION PHASE<br/>After each player has taken five turns during the Intrigue phase they will keep 5 cards in their hand and set 4 cards aside in their reserve. In order of the Leverage item number, cards will be played to bribe, conspire, stab, poison, and to shift alliances.<br/><br/>SCORING PHASE<br/>One of the unique aspects of this game is the 7 different victory condition. Players may change what condition they are attempting to achieve as the game evolves. After all Leverage cards, the winning player will be determined based on the resulting court conditions (which of the following living court members they control).<br/><br/>     The Usurper will win if two other court members are disgruntled and the Usurper has not been bribed.<br/>     The King will win if the King is alive and the Usurper has not won.<br/>     The Heir will win if the King is dead, the Usurper has not won and the Heir is not disgruntled.<br/>     The Bastard will win if the King is dead, the Usurper and the Heir have not won and the Bastard is not disgruntled.<br/>     If none of the above conditions have been met, the player that controls the most undisgruntled court members will win.<br/>     If none of the above conditions have been met, the player that controls the Anarchist will win<br/>     If none of the above conditions have been met, no player wins (Anarchy).<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The team scores points for each word guessed correctly. There&rsquo;s a twist, though: in each round, you have to describe or guess the words in a particular way. For example, sometimes the describer can use just 3 words; sometimes their teammates can make just 1 guess!  Each of the 10 rounds presents a fresh challenge.<br/><br/>There are 5 categories of word to describe: people and places, adjectives(descriptions), nouns (things and ideas)      ,verbs(actions), and phrases. The words can be described in any order. However, in each round there is a key word worth 1 extra point, so it&rsquo;s often best to start with this.<br/><br/>You can play LOQ in 2 ways:<br/>Cooperatively; with everyone together against the game, or <br/>Competitively; with teams of two or more players competing against each other.  It&rsquo;s a lot of fun either way!<br/><br/>The game ends after 10 rounds and lasts about 10 minutes per team. In competitive games, the team with most points wins. If you are playing a cooperative game, check your score against the ratings card for the difficulty level you played at. Was your performance Excellent or just Ordinary?<br/><br/>DIFFICULTY LEVELS<br/>There are a staggering 6000 words and phrases to describe and guess! These are divided into four levels of difficulty: <br/>Level 1 (yellow) <br/>Level 2 (green)<br/>Level 3 (red)<br/>Level 4 (blue)<br/><br/>",

The tile that remains unchosen each round increases the value of one of the depicted animals, with the round's last player deciding which creature gets the bump.<br/><br/>At the start of play, you receive a secret tile that lets you know two of the animal types you might want to focus on while building habitats.

        "description": "Battle for Zendikar is a Magic: The Gathering expansion block consisting of the sets Battle for Zendikar and Oath of the Gatewatch. It sees the return of full-art basic lands, last seen in the Zendikar block. It is also the first block in Magic (since the Shadowmoor block) to use the new Two-Block Paradigm, wherein each block has two sets instead of the three that were previously used (the last block having three sets being the Khans of Tarkir block).<br/><br/>Battle for Zendikar revolves around the Eldrazi, ancient monstrosities that are bent on destroying the entire plane of Zendikar, within which they were once imprisoned, and their fight against the Allies defending their home plane. The creature cards are split along these lines, with most being either on the Eldrazi side or the Ally side. Eldrazi cards are generally very powerful or aid in playing them, while Ally cards give bonuses to each other whenever one comes into play.<br/><br/>As the Eldrazi are decimating the plane, six Planeswalkers each have their own role in the resistance. Jace Beleren, a logical mage, and Ugin, an ancient dragon, are working together to find a way to defeat the Eldrazi; Gideon, a human who fights for justice and honor, is rounding up the survivors; Ob Nixilis, a demon who lost his powers as a Planeswalker, is trying to regain his abilities; Kiora, a merfolk native to Zendikar, is eager to use her new discoveries on other planes to help her home plane, and Nissa Revane, an elf from Zendikar, who lost her connection to the land and regains it in a surprisingly powerful manner. In the original Zendikar block, there were three chief Eldrazi, but most now are of Ulamog's lineage.<br/><br/>As the block's story line proceeds, Jace disagrees with Ugin on how to handle the rampage of Ulamog and his brood: Ugin advises against destroying the titan, Ulamog, as the ineffable nature of the Eldrazi means it is unclear if killing their physical form will destroy them entirely, or merely free them to roam across the Blind Eternities, devouring planes unchecked. Jace, Gideon and Nissa settle on a plan with the survivors of the army that retook Sea Gate to channel the natural leylines on Zendikar in tandem with the Hedrons to encircle Ulamog, trapping the Eldrazi again. As the battle rages around the ruined city, the plan appears to initially succeed.<br/><br/>However, the demon Ob Nixilis, having survived an apparently fatal encounter with Nissa earlier, returns to face the Planeswalkers again, interrupting the hedron alignment and subverting the power involved for his own purpose - regenerating his &quot;spark&quot;, the essential power that resides within all Planeswalkers. As the hedron circle crumbles, Ob Nixilis uses his newly refound powers to raise the second of the three Eldrazi Titans - Kozilek.<br/><br/>",

The start player declares a word, which each player must place on her secret grid.  The next player then declares a word that crosses the original word, which each player places wherever she wants, crossing the original word.  For the rest of the game, each subsequent player declares a word that crosses at least one previous word, and everyone else must place the word on her grid such that it crosses at least one previous word.  Each time a player can't place a word, the game gets a strike.  Three strikes, and the game's over.<br/><br/>In the introductory game, players simply earn a point for each letter of each word placed.  In the recommended Be Fruitful and Multiply variant, when you place a word, you multiply its length by the number of other letters it crossed.  This has the nasty side-effect of encouraging players to make their grid less suitable for more words, because the players strive to cross as many words as possible.<br/><br/>Finally, Zero Tolerance, a cutthroat variant ideal for two players, proclaims that one strike ends the game.<br/><br/>Download the instructions and game sheets to print and play!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The  Bloody Fields of Mollwitz is the first game in the tactical battle series entitled The Battles of Enlightenment, representing the first battle of Frederick II, King of Prussia.<br/>Game scale:<br/>1 hex = 120 m (131 yards),<br/>1 game turn = 30 minutes<br/>1 counter = infantry battalion/cavalry squadron (hussars: 1 counter = two sqds)/artillery battery.<br/>Game description<br/><br/>The game is divided only on the activation phases, in which the players first can change the order of the commander, and then move troops belonging to the commanders of the wings or infantry line (the same are treated Hussars regiments and artillery). <br/>In each activation phase players:<br/>1) use their Commanders-in-Chief and dispatch riders to give orders to subordinate commanders;<br/>2) activate infantry / cavalry or artillery moving it first and then carrying out the combat. Inactive player may respond by performing cavalry countercharges; infantry can react with fire. Also in this phase employed to rally broken units and moving commander-in-chiefs.<br/><br/>The principle of the game is based on an order system. The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the wing/line commander manages to change it by himself.<br/>The possible orders are: STOP, MARCH, ATTACK. <br/>In the historical scenario it will be possible to give two additional orders: MARCH (IN MARCH COLUMN); DEVELOP.<br/>The game distinguishes the tactics used by the Prussian and Austrian armies, with particular emphasis on platoon fire combat used by the Prussian infantry.<br/>Zone of Control works similarly to other games with the exception that the infantry ZoC does not stop cavalry units, but allows the infantry to fire at the moving cavalry.<br/>Movement is identical as in other games in the hex-and-counter system.<br/>The game discerns fire combat and melee combat.<br/>Infantry and artillery fire combat is based on the shooting unit current morale level - it results in a loss of morale level of the fired upon opponent. <br/>Melee combat is based on morale checks: first the attacker checks his morale, if he gets a positive result he initiates the melee combat. Then the defender checks his morale and if his result is positive the attacker checks his morale again (by checking the effects of the lack of success).<br/>Cavalry (except hussars) can only attack in melee. Their attacks are resolved in the same way as infantry melee combat (with the exception resulting from the option to counterattack).<br/>The loss of morale level is indicated with special markers.<br/>When the unit loses morale is broken.<br/><br/>There will be four scenarios in this game:<br/>Initial &ndash; a training scenario,<br/>Historical - with General Roemer and his cavalry on the map - the rest of the Austrian army enters the map in the course of the game,<br/>Hypothetical 1 and 2 - two armies face themselves already developed on the battlefield.<br/><br/>",

To vanquish is our desire.&quot; - Alexi Brusilov<br/><br/>In the Trenches: 1916 is not a complete game. You must own either In the Trenches: Doughboys or In the Trenches: Devil Dogs to play 1916.<br/><br/>In the Trenches: 1916 breathes new life into Tiny Battle Publishing&rsquo;s popular In the Trenches system.  Delve into the gritty tactics of the Battle of the Somme and the Eastern Front&rsquo;s Brusilov Offensive in SIX action-packed scenarios by esteemed designer John Gorkowski, featuring British, Canadian, German, Austro-Hungarian, Russian, and Polish forces.  Lead your men through the great muddy lengths of Regina Trench, across the battle-pocked fields from La Boiselle to the Sausage Valley and through narrow lines dug in at forest&rsquo;s edge at Kostiuchnowka on three beautifully rendered maps.<br/><br/>Designed by John Gorkowski, In the Trenches enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>Note:  The six scenarios of In the Trenches: 1916 were originally published in 2009 by Grenier Games, as part of their In the Trenches: The Lost Generation expansion.  We have taken these scenarios, tweaked and polished them, and treated them to brand new artwork by Jose Ramon Faura and a full-color eight-page scenario guide.<br/><br/>&middot;         220 Unit Counters (yes, there are two full pages of counters)<br/><br/>&middot;         132 Operational Markers<br/><br/>&middot;         Three 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Maps<br/><br/>&middot;         1 Player Aid Card<br/><br/>&middot;         1 Game Turn Track<br/><br/>&middot;         1 Full-Color Scenario Book<br/><br/>&middot;         6 Scenarios<br/><br/>Game Design: John Gorkowski<br/><br/>Art: Jose Ramon Faura<br/><br/>Players: 2<br/><br/>Duration: 90-120 minutes<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>",

The expansion is compatible with both the standard and deluxe edition of the base game. These are the new modules, as depicted on the top of the box, going clockwise:<br/><br/>1 &ndash; Forts. In the base game, you have to watch out for pirates and other players while sailing, and nothing else. When you deliver your spices back on your home island, they are safe. Now, not anymore&hellip; You start with a fort on your home island with which you can defend against other players trying to steal your spices. Pirates get 2 forts on the High Seas to aid them, but if you defeat them, you could own those forts!<br/><br/>2 &ndash; Settlements. Because this expansion comes with a lot more options to spend your gold on, it&rsquo;s only fair that you also get the opportunity to earn more. You can now build settlements on wild islands with no cards left on them. The settlement will produce crates for you, and act as a harbor to protect you from attacks too!<br/><br/>3 &ndash; Treasures. Similarly to settlements, when you find a treasure, you find gold! Which aids you wih modules 1 and 6.<br/><br/>4 &ndash; Events. No longer can you only draw trade propositions at wild islands. When you least expect it, lightning strikes! Or you summon the Kraken. Or who knows, something helpful may happen. It also means you can no longer safely look at the last card at an island. It may be an event, which means then the deck is empty and you can be attacked!<br/><br/>5- Reefs. Another danger on the High Seas for you, your opponents and the pirates! Are you going to be safe and sail around them, or take the risk and hope your ship passes safely through it? Getting stuck is no fun, except for when it happens to the pirates!<br/><br/>6- Crew. When an island runs out of trade cards in the base game, they are of no interest. Not anymore! You can now build settlements, but the locals on the island are also looking for something to do! Pay a local for their services and upgrade your ship in a whole new way! Just be careful in battles not to get your crew killed!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Monocle, sketchbook, or even stuffed toys of the creatures! (But they aren't creatures, they are only stuffed toys of creatures.)<br/><br/>One deck plays up to 3 players. Combine decks to play with more (2 decks for up to 6, 3 decks for up to 9)<br/><br/>There are 2 versions of AGAQGCTATDACYRadishes (coloured in, and line art) for easy mixing and separation.<br/><br/>",

Changing one event can cause others to change, too! With planning and precision, you can change several key events by changing only one event. However, without planning or caution, you may cause the world to tumble into an even darker timeline! Remember, if anything goes wrong: This didn't happen!<br/><br/>Players travel from event to event, either by waiting for time to move them or by using the Time Machine. Players collect supply cards, which help them during random events or which can be used to change the event their character is on. Changing an event can affect future events, softening them up and making them easier to change, or changing them outright. Changing too many events may cause a change to the End of the Era, resulting in an earlier apocalypse.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Char is a three dimensional alignment game similar to the many flavors of 3D tic-tac-toe that have appeared over the years.  Its rules and production values raise it above the level of these titles, however.<br/><br/>Rules: The play space is a 4x4x4 volume.  Players alternate placing black and white pieces into the volume; the goal is to create a row of four like-colored pieces either orthogonally or diagonally within any plane of the space.  What makes the game unique is the pieces: There are &quot;whole&quot; pieces shaped like solid disks, and &quot;half&quot; pieces that are either rings or nubs that fit into the ring's center.  Discs count as either other type; a valid row contains either rings and/or disks OR nubs and/or disks.  It is allowed to place, for instance, your nub into an opponent's ring (quiet, you!).  Therefore, potential lines can intersect one another.  Furthermore, the pieces must be played in rotation, i.e. white disk, black disk, then white ring, black ring, then white nub, black nub; then again from the top.<br/><br/>Production: the board is a very nicely designed laser-cut acrylic affair, with two supports that slot into one another, and etched levels that rest on the arms of the supports.  The pieces are molded of black and white plastic.  Molded clear trays are provided to keep the pieces sorted in the proper playing order.<br/><br/>Also included is a patently ridiculous but highly amusing booklet about the game's &quot;history&quot; full of quotes from fictitious Zen masters and a bibliography of alleged texts about the game and its historical significance.<br/><br/>This was Games Magazine's &quot;Best Abstract Strategy Game&quot; for 1993 and Mensa Select for 1994.<br/><br/>",

The opposing player rotates the record in the player, looking at the back of the disc to select their defense. Once the defensive selection is in view from the defense's side, that player pushes down to start the recording.

It's at the same size and scale as the Deluxe map, with new objectives and countries to conquer.<br/><br/>There are also 80 die-cut-and-mounted playing pieces, with the Iraqi and Iranian armed forces, Russian nationalists, Irish, Latvians, British, Italian and Soviet marines, German cavalry and mountain troops, Indonesian nationalists, atomic bomb markers and much, much more!<br/><br/>David Meyler brings us variants for Iran, for Romania as a major power, and of course for more things Dutch. Jeff Adams gives us strategy tips for Operation Sea Lion, Tim McBeth makes the dismal science of economics exciting, and William Sariego looks at island-hopping strategies and the French war effort.<br/><br/>Rumors of War is not playable by itself, but instead brings more fun to your gaming table with either or both of Third Reich and The Great Pacific War: The Second World War in the Pacific 1937-1945.<br/><br/><br/>",

You jump in your T-top and head down to Record Town!<br/><br/>Vinyl is a game where players are aspiring vinyl collectors. They have some knowledge of what they would like to collect, but immediately get immersed in the experience. Players will acquire morsels of information after visiting the &ldquo;Mag Rack&rdquo;. That information will lead them to the bins where they select albums to add and expand their collection. Albums can be played at the listening booth to increase the value of a player&rsquo;s collection and their ability to collect even more albums. Unfortunately, the inventory is limited and other customers may be targeting the same vinyl gems. After the final round is concluded, players will tally their collection&rsquo;s value and determine who is the Elite Collector of Vinyl!<br/><br/>How does it differ from other Vinyl Editions?<br/><br/>In Totally Awesome 80s, we have opened up the Trade Counter. You will now be able to trade unwanted or low-value records in to gain attributes that you may use in later turns.<br/><br/>Collection rewards have been reduced to max out 4. The lower end will now be 2 albums in a small collection and this will increase the number of records that a player may retire during the game. In addition, the Extended Play format and the Long Play format have been added as attributes and these albums can provide a bonus to your collections for end-game scoring. There is still more, however.<br/><br/>We have also added 12 new Loyalty Cards which will help to bolster your end-game scoring even further. Taking all of this into account, over 150 new components added to the game!<br/><br/>We will also introduce gameplay with 5 Genres in play instead of 4. This will give players a different style of game in this expansion. There are 6 Genres added so that players can choose which 5 Genres they would like to play with.<br/><br/>- 6 New Genres:  Dance, Hip-Hop, New Wave, Glam Rock, R&amp;B, Reggae<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First Punic War 264 to 241 BC is a two-player wargame of the first great military clash between the Roman Republic and the Carthaginian Empire, spanning 24 years in the 3rd century BC. At this time, Rome controlled a federation of states in Italy, while Carthage was the major power of the Western Mediterranean. The war was centered around the island of Sicily, but also saw campaigns in Sardinia and North Africa, with the possibility for more operations elsewhere around the region.<br/><br/>Each game turn (GT) represents three years. Each hex is 40 miles across. Roman combat units represent legions plus attached cavalry (4000 to 5000 men) and groupings of auxiliaries (1000 or more men). Carthaginian units represent groups of various troop types representing 1000 to 10,000 men. Naval units represent about 50 warships each. Leaders represent an inspirational to competent commander plus a guard.<br/><br/>Components: One 22 x 34-inch game map, 176 5/8-inch counters.<br/><br/>Published in S&amp;T #336<br/><br/>",

German tanks attacked the town, but Polish 155 mm howitzers destroyed several tanks and the attackers fell back. Returning later that day, they managed to destroy 7 Polish tanks with artillery but lost just after five Panzers . After receiving several more direct hits and losing two more large Panzers, the German tank crews simply ran away. Polish 7TP tanks pursued and kept beating the rest of the tanks off. The German soldiers now met the Polish infantry and attacked, but they were repelled by the Polish tanks. <br/>Soon, all the Germans retreated and by the end of September 6, no hostile forces were in Piotrk&oacute;w Trybunalski. On September 7, Marshal Rydz-Smigly orders the Polish forces to withdraw.<br/><br/><br/>Wikipedia: Battle of Piotrków Trybunalski<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Oganika is a puzzle- and strategy game that is easy to learn but will challenge the smartest of minds! Oganika can be played in three game modes: a puzzle (single player), as a battle (puzzle against an opponent) and as a multiplayer strategy game with a board.<br/><br/>Playing Oganika is simple: place any of the 36 tiles into a given arrangement, making sure that all the lines on the surface designs of the tiles match at connection points. Each set of tiles contains two different types, left handed and right handed. Some game modes only use one type, others use a mixture of both.<br/><br/>In multiplayer mode, the goal of each round is to add as many pieces as possible to a single 36-tile hexagon. The game is played with two sets of tiles (included in the game) and players take turns to add tiles to the single hexagon in the middle of the table. Plays like blocking players, choosing the right number of new tiles or reducing your play time to pressure other players make this game fast, fun but most of all strategic.  The person who lays the most tiles, wins the round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1486, Christopher Columbus came to Spain to lobby the royal families to endorse his plan to sail west and discover a new trade route to the Indies. Columbus was not the only one with this idea, though, as during that great age of explorers there was no lack of ambitious sailors willing to risk it all on a grand adventure.<br/><br/>In Voyagers' Venture, players assume the role of Spanish sailors in 1486, working to fund their voyage for a new trade route. In order to succeed, they must win resources, prepare a sturdy fleet, entice the Spanish nobles, and even acquire the patronage of the royal family. After six years of campaigning, who will secure the royal edict of Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand to strike out towards the new world? Could you be Columbus? Perhaps you could be even greater? It all starts with one voyager's venture, but to get that permit to sail west and search for land, you need to gain the most reputation.<br/><br/>Each round plays out as below:<br/><br/><br/>     Sponsor from Royal Family:  From the common card deck and the fleet deck, draw and display a number of cards.<br/>     Dividing Sponsor: Starting with the starting player and moving along the turn order track, each player will declare what they want from the face up and face down cards on offer this year. Starting clockwise from the choosing player, each player decides if they agree or not to give the active player what they chose. There can be two results:<br/>         All the players agree: If all the players agree, the active player immediately recieves all the cards they chose and takes those cards into his or her hand.<br/>         One player disagrees: The agreeing phase stops when a player disagrees and the disagreeing player immediately makes a bid on the cards on offer smaller than the bid of the previous player.  There are 3 ways to cut a bid:<br/>             Place one of your gold dubloons on one card that the previous player did not choose.  If you do this, you may keep the bid the same size and move straight to the agree/disagree phase (2).  The gold dubloon is attached to the card it is placed on until a player takes that card, and that player also takes your dubloon.<br/>             Remove 1 or more cards from this bid.<br/>             Remove 2 or more cards from the bid, then add 1 card on display to the bid.<br/>        <br/>    <br/>     Assembling Fleets: Each player will receive one bid.  After the last player receives his or her bid, this round is over.  Check that each player has 8 or less cards in hand.  If they have more, they must discard, face-down, down to 8.  Take the turn markers from the next round track and move them to the same positions in the current round track.  Move the queen marker to the next round.  Start the next round.<br/><br/><br/>End of the Game<br/><br/>The game finishes at the end of round 6.  At this time, each player has one last chance to use the resources they have in hand to buy ships and nobles.  Then discard all remaining ship and noble cards in hands.<br/><br/>     Follow the game tip card to determine end of game bonus reputation.<br/>     Display all ships and noble reputation in front of you, calculate the total and add it to your reputation.<br/>     If a player has the fastest fleet token, add the bonus (2) to his or her reputation.<br/>     If a player has gold coins, each 2 is worth 1 reputation.<br/>     Subtract 1 reputation for each smuggled goods that player has.<br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest reputation wins the game, and the royal edict of Queen Isabella to strike out for new trade routes.  If there is a draw, the player with the most ships is the winner, if there still is a draw, the player with the most total resources is the winner, if it is still a tie check the card number on each players' ships.  The player with the lowest card number on any ship is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The twist is that the person who has the most points of each sin does not score those points, but everyone else does.<br/><br/>7Sins! has 5 decks with each card representing a sin and has a value between 1 and 7 representing the severity of the sin.  The main deck consists of 80 cards and contains Wrath, Greed, Lust, and Pride.  There are three separate decks for the remaining sins - Gluttony contains 25 cards, Envy has 20 cards, and Sloth has 20 cards.  The final deck is the Original Sins deck.  It has 28 cards and contains all seven sins in values between 2 and 4.<br/><br/>To begin, 4 Original Sins cards are dealt to each player.  Each player keeps 2 cards and passes one each to the right and left.  They are then set aside until the end of the game.  The Original Sins have no effect on basic game play but will count during scoring.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3 cards from the main deck.  Players take turns playing a card and following any instructions on the card, then drawing a card from the main deck to end their turn.  Each sin has a different thematic effect for that sin.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player has accumulated 7 or more points of Pride. Players should discard their hands (these cards are no longer needed), and then add their original sins to the sins they played during the game. Counting one sin at a time, players should announce how many points they have. Whoever has the most points in each sin is 'shunned' and must discard all those points - in case of a tie, all players discard the points. Everyone else 'gets away with' those sins and keeps those points.  Once the biggest sinner for each sin has discarded those points, each player totals up everything they 'got away with' and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

In competitive or semi-cooperative mode, dominate or destroy your opponents!<br/><br/>The game is portable and magnetic, easy, fast and different every time.<br/><br/>Game overview<br/><br/>     Players choose one of the four scenarios and a group of 15 custom pawns with the same symbol and place them on the corresponding colors. Each scenario is grid-based with a different theme and objectives. <br/>     Victory conditions: The main objective depending on the scenarios is to hold the base(s) for 3(2) turns or kill the enemy leader(s). A &quot;King of the Hill&quot; variant for three players is available in a scenario.<br/>     On every turn you can move up to five different pawns, one of which should always be the leader (black pawn). Pawns can move up to two spaces in any direction; red pawns can move up to three spaces in any direction. Blue pawns can move through clouds without penalty and use the warps.<br/>     Pawns of the same color can stack up to three pieces high. This increases the strike force value and defense value. Pawns can detach and move on their own from a stack. The bottom pawn acts as a carrier.<br/>     Every single pawn has a strike force Level 1 (L1). The black pawn (the leader) has a strike force L3 but its defense remains at L1.<br/>     To attack an opponent's pawn, you must move your pawn onto a square occupied by the antagonist. By attacking an opponent pawn with a superior level, you execute a suicide-attack; your pawn(s) is(are) sacrificed and the same number of antagonist pawns are eliminated.<br/><br/><br/>",

So the magazine format was chosen to publish the material. The material was to be published in two installments.

The time for diplomacy has long since passed. The time for advanced warmongering is upon us.<br/><br/>COMMAND CARDS:<br/><br/>One of the biggest differences from the classic game is the addition of commanders: land, naval, space, nuclear, and diplomat. These fill a number of roles with the most basic function being to act as an improved army unit, enabling players to roll eight-sided dice rather than the typical six-sided, but perhaps the most important function of the commanders is allowing the purchase and use of cards of various types. The addition of these cards, and in particular the addition of the Advanced Tech command deck, has a huge effect upon the gaming dynamics. With the addition of these cards the board is opened up making no position impregnable and no attack a certainty. With these cards in use, the game is more fluid with gaming positions and strategies needing to be constantly shifted<br/><br/>RULE VARIATIONS:<br/><br/>The Advanced Tech cards are designed for use as command cards alongside the original sets provided with the standard game. No additional commander token has been provided as it is suggested that the Advanced Tech cards be used in place of the Diplomat cards. If preferred, the Advanced Tech cards can be used in conjunction with additional tokens, representative of an additional commander, therefore allowing the use of all five of the original commanders as well.<br/><br/>Advanced Tech 2nd Edition<br/><br/>Released in its original form in the summer of 2007, this twenty card expansion deck was then re-released in January 2008 sporting some new wording and improved graphics. Like our other decks, the Advanced Tech Command Deck is designed to be used alongside the original game and can either be used in place of an existing command deck of the players choice or with the use of additional command tokens available from our online store.<br/>Second edition adds +1 Landmine and subtracts the one Subliminal Orders<br/><br/>- Landmine (Cost 1 to be played at beginning of turn before any attacks): This card allows the playing player to draw a land territory card which they then place secretly in front of them. The next time an opponent attacks the territory shown, that player loses Mods equal to half of a D6 dice roll.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/><br/>     Risk 2210 A.D.<br/><br/><br/>",

There are two piles players can play cards on: Tokkome and Maki. Each turn, you may play one or three cards on top of either pile if the cards being played can form a sequence with the top card of the pile, or take all cards from Tokkome.<br/><br/>After taking all cards from Tokkome, if you have three cards of the same number, you discard them and score victory points, but taking all cards is risky because it increases your cards in hand, which you have to get rid of. Afterwards, all cards in the Maki pile go to Tokkome.<br/><br/>When a player gets rid of all their cards in hand, each other player loses victory points for their remaining cards in hand, and the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>「捕込」は野馬を捕まえつつ手札を減らすゲームです。<br/>ただし、野馬を捕まえる際に余計な手札も増えてしまいます。<br/>いかに無駄なく野馬を捕まえられるかが悩ましいゲームです。<br/><br/>",

Some situations may require components, such as cards or dice, from the main game. Victims and Evils from the main game can also be used in this expansion. The main objective for Victim: Asylum is to find the key, go to the basement, gain access to the Professor's secret tunnel and escape the Asylum before Evil consumes you. Just like the main game, one of the players will become possessed by Evil after the 3rd round, changing their objective to eliminate the other players or sabotaging their attempt to escape.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For thousands of years all we have known is the Rift Storm. It destroyed our empire, sundered our land and severed us from the Old World we once ruled. Sheltered within the eye of the storm we fought to survive, imprisoned in our last remaining city, desperately clinging to life. As the ages passed the eye slowly grew in size enabling exploration beyond the city and a startling discovery. The storm was still connected to the Old World, its erratic rift capturing hapless Atlantic crossings and wrecking them upon Atlantis' broken shores. The age of the Storm Raider was born: Brave souls who for fame and fortune would dare the might of the Rift Storm, to save these precious offerings and bring hope to our dying world.<br/><br/>The Storm Season is upon us, all eyes look to the sky and we wonder are you the Storm Raider Atlantis has been waiting for?<br/><br/>The aim of Storm Raiders is to be the player with the most prestige at the game's end. Storm raiding is a perilous task, filled with many dangers - the most devastating being the mighty Rift Storm that encircles the many islands. Players will want to stay close to the storm, without being overcome by its immeasurable force.<br/>Prestige is gained by salvaging wreck sites, fulfilling contracts, acquiring crew, upgrading their vehicles, and earning medals. Players will be drafting dice each turn to either travel using their trike, plane, or sub, or to instead take some much-needed time to rest and repair their battered vehicles.<br/><br/>After 6 rounds of traversing the splintered landscape, players will add up their prestige points to determine who will be remembered as the greatest Storm Raider of their time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Player numbers are from one to four and playing time is about six hours.<br/><br/>G-Barbarossa covers the German offensive of 1941 and the Soviet counter attack of Winter 1941-1942. Soviet units have been treated in a unique way, in that the second step strength of a two step unit varies and is unknown to all players until the unit is reduced. For example: a 3 strength infantry unit's second step may reveal itself to be: two, one or * (annihilation!). Soviet leaders are treated in a similar way, with ratings of: 3 (Zhukov only), 2, 1, 0 and *, being revealed to all players only at the moment of battle. Leaders have combat strength and command control ability equal to their rating, and they keep units in supply up to the number of hexes equal to their rating. A leader with a rating of 1 exerts command control into adjacent hexes, a leader with 0 has no combat strength but gives supply to units in the same hex and a * leader is removed before combat, thereby having no effect. Only German panzer corps have a second turn phase, allowing them to exploit breakthroughs. The turn sequence changes in Winter for the Soviet counter attack.<br/><br/>",

You have to bring them back to Earth and sell them successfully. This is only possible if there is a supply line (i.e. an uninterrupted orbital line from the raw material world back to Earth). Robot shuttles on the planets and asteroids carry the resources to the orbiting ships/stations at a rendezvous point. From there, a transfer to Earth is only possible when a supply line is available.<br/><br/>The game is set-up as a row of cards with each representing a planet in our Solar system. Each card/planet shows orbital paths for player travel and shows available resources which can change throughout the game - ore, biomass, energy, and water.<br/><br/>Each game includes:<br/>91 playing cards<br/>7 cards to cut and use as playing pieces<br/><br/>The designers suggest using 10mm dice as playing pieces, as only three are necessary for each player.<br/><br/>",

The command system has been changed to accommodate leader character - leaders are rated as aggressive, controlled, or timid, and are likely to gravitate to an order stance that is in keeping with their character as the battle unfolds. Correct exploitation of their capability in the battle plan is important for victory.  The melee and fire combat mechanics are also quite different from the other games in the series.<br/><br/>The counters are nicely done, icons. The maps are DTP standard. Best of all, the rules are short, counters few, and you can set up and play and finish in an hour.<br/><br/>",

Game includes a selection of terrain to use on these boards to create battlefields, including six different hills, two different villages, two different farms with farm fields, hedgerows, stone walls, roads, streams, rivers, two forests and a bridge.  Roads, streams, and the forest footprint are in colored felt.  Buildings are painted and cast from resin.  Tree bases are magnetized for secure storage inside the box.<br/><br/>Boxed set includes rules, charts, two rulers, two ten-sided dice, casualty/morale caps, command/rally counters, deployment/dummy markers scaled to unit base sizes, objective/line of communication markers, and two fully painted, based and flocked Napoleonic armies.<br/><br/>Each army consists of four line, one light and one elite infantry brigade; two light and one heavy cavalry brigade; three foot and one horse artillery batteries; and one General with two separate lieutenants used for command extension functions.  Each brigade includes a flag of its nationality.<br/><br/>Infantry is mounted four to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing about 2200 men.  Cavalry is mounted two to a magnetic stand, three stands to a brigade representing around 700 men.  Guns are mounted individually, one crew member for a field/horse battery and two crew for a heavy gun.  General is mounted with a foot figure; lieutenants are mounted individuals.<br/><br/>Figures in the standard starter set are painted &quot;Risk&quot; figures from the &quot;shako&quot; edition of Risk.  Additional painted brigades representing helmeted cavalry, lancers, etc. may be ordered from the producer.  Supplemental terrain boards and terrain elements are also available.<br/><br/>The rules are playable and concentrate on command and morale.  Units out of vision distance or line of sight are initially represented by hidden deployment markers, revealed as units come within sighting range.  Units may also be assigned to off-board flanking forces and/or reserves.<br/><br/>Initiative is determined each turn, as are available command points for each army.  Command points may be used either to activate units for movement and combat, or to rally shaken or demoralized units.  Army command diminishes as brigades are demoralized or destroyed.<br/><br/>The game system allows for considerable expansion and accommodates multiple players on a side.  Entire large battles can be gamed using this system and additional unit, but an interesting game can be played with as few as four or five brigades on a side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hibiscus and Hurricane is a shrewd game of exploitation, profit seeking, and risk tasking along the coast of a fictional tropical nation.  In H and H you play a civic minded developer tasked with the goal of generating additional profits for your investors while improving the lives of the citizens along a warm, rich, tropical coast that has recently emerged from a long time dictatorship.  You score points by developing provinces along the coast, bringing tourists to your resorts, and avoiding devastating hurricanes. Tourists are fickle and don&rsquo;t take well to nasty storms and other calamities, but are comfortable in places well protected from natures fury while being furnished with amenities and goods. Players rush to fill the limited capacity of each province while placing &quot;clouds&quot; along specified tracks which will generate hurricanes that can strike their opponents cities and send their tourists packing.<br/><br/>H and H is a medium weight Euro game, similar in length to Ticket to Ride or Thurn and Taxis, with more strategic decisions than either of those games.  Its designed as a quick FUN game with plenty of strategy.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>To invest in this region, bring tourists and score the most victory points after a predetermined number of hurricane strikes.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>The Game is played over a predetermined number of rounds, signaled by the strike of a hurricane.  Typical game length is between 3-4 hurricanes (1-1.5 hours).<br/>The game is played with a deck of cards with special actions and bonuses and disasters, a game board representing a small coastal region, and wooden bits to keep track of tourists and improvements.<br/><br/>Card Management<br/>Players start with 5 cards in their hand. Players may not have more than 9 cards at the end of any turn.<br/>A turn consists of 3 actions, from one of the following combinations:<br/><br/><br/>     Play 3 actions<br/>     Draw 3 cards<br/>     Play 1 action draw 2 cards<br/>     Play 2 Actions draw 1 card<br/><br/><br/>Choice is declared before any cards are drawn or played.<br/><br/>After each hurricane has been played out that ends a season, and the deck is re-shuffled.  At the end of each season all remaining tourists score points.  Three to five hurricane seasons are played out, and the player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

It is interesting that this work pre-dates Games Workshop's Warmaster Ancients.<br/><br/>From the introduction of this title:<br/><br/><br/>These rules are meant to supplement the Warmaster fantasy miniatures rules produced by Games Workshop, and incorporate the ancient rules supplement for that system developed by Stephen Hess. Our thanks to Mr. Hess for taking the time to assemble the basic troop types for the vast majority of troops available in the ancient period, as well as providing many prepared armies lists, and for graciously allowing me to directly incorporate his work into this piece. This supplement for Renaissance gaming is heavily dependent on the work done for the ancient period. Especially useful were the basic infantry, cavalry and elephant troop types. Rules incorporated here are elite, skirmishers, phalanx, warband, and camels.

The author has successfully hosted and executed the 1809 campaign in Germany (1 day), the Invasion of Russia in 1812 (2 days), and the Leipzig campaign in 1813 (2 says) with 8-12 players. Unit size is described as division level, but it is flexible enough to represent regiments for a set piece battle as well. For example, the battle of Raab (1809) could be done as a 2 player division-level game in about 60-90 minutes, or as a 4-6 player regimental game in about 2 hours.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the ghosts are trapped there.<br/><br/>Suddenly, an opportunity arises! They discover three glimmering magical portals that they might be able to use to find freedom. Desperation sets in quickly, because they know the portals won't be open long, so the ghosts scramble and jostle one another, trying to slip through the portals while they have the chance.

Each turn one player is voted Captain and a voyage is selected from the six available.  Working together and using the tools they have purchased and their crew abilities, the crew attempts to defeat each voyage and gain reputation and doubloons!

One of the great things about this game is that no one sits on the sidelines and waits for the other players to get done. For the casual gamer, Agent Saboteur is easy to teach, fun to play, and will quickly become the game you play most often. For the hobby gamer, it will become the go-to game you get out when friends or family stop by.<br/><br/>The Story: &ldquo;Welcome, handler XXXXXXXXXX. Your reputation precedes you. That little matter you took care of in XXXXXX was quite impressive. Some believe you may be ready, so from here on your organization will only be tasked with stopping the type of incidents that end up on the front page. The last agents that got sent got themselves XXXXXX within a week and we&rsquo;re still explaining the glow in XXXXXXXXXXX. Everything you hear, see, or do from this point forward is strictly classified. Good luck. You&rsquo;ll need it.&ldquo;<br/><br/>The Gameplay: Your assignment is to use the spies and mission updates in your hand to stop the terrorists. Whichever player gathers the most points in incidents wins. To do so you'll work the source to gain more agents to your team, but if you push your luck, you may get made and lose them all. Then you'll need to send your agents on missions, traveling incognito using your fake passports. Beware, if the other agents guess where you're sending them, they can sabotage the attempt. Keep your cards close to your chest and you just might live.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and 14 others have decided to create a new life on the peninsula of Tozlandia. The land is lush and plentiful, however after settling life, a dark, secret tablet is uncovered. After years of deciphering it is revealed that the land of the unfortunates will be ravaged by disasters predicted by the Tablet of Doom and that time when these things will unfold is drawing near. It dawns on you that you and your Tozlandianites are the unfortunates! You quickly re-read the tablet and realize that you only have time to build safe houses to survive the onslaught that&rsquo;s about to happen. All of the other unfortunates are looking to you to help them get to the safe houses and avoid disaster.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game:<br/>To have more than half of the unfortunates survive the events predicted by the Tablet of Doom. Unfortunates survive by making it to a safe house, however more than half of the unfortunates must make it to win.<br/><br/>Playing The Game:<br/>Turns are broken down into a few parts, first you take your action phase and then you tempt fate and roll two 6-sided dice and do what happens on the Matrix of Doom. Finally you check to see if you have won the game.<br/><br/>Turns continue in the fashion until all unfortunates are in safe houses, all safe houses are destroyed, or no more unfortunates can move.  If you've gotten the required number of unfortunates to safe houses you've won the game, otherwise the game is lost.<br/><br/>This game was designed for the 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest placing 3rd in the Category of &quot;Best Small Game&quot; -- 2012 Solitaire Print and Play Contest Results Post<br/><br/>",

The official rulebook uses a hexagonal board of 5 hexes per side, 30 white stones and 30 black stones, as it is the recommended configuration for beginners.<br/><br/>In Quantum Leap, each player&rsquo;s stones start dispersed on the board. Your goal is to be the last player making a valid move. Stones can only move by capturing enemy stones, leaping in a special fashion. Stones get their leaping potential from the number of friendly stones that immediately surround them.<br/><br/>The rulebook includes a variant for more than 2 players.<br/><br/>Quantum Leap is the dark brother of Adaptoid.<br/><br/>Special thanks to Cameron Browne for the game name.<br/><br/>Note:<br/><br/>The latest version by the designer uses 31 black stones and no empty space at the start, and removes the swap option for the second player. This makes it more elegant and balanced.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>Nestorgames has released a 'balls edition' that includes 61 balls in 2 colours (30 white and 31 black) and 61 rings. It replaces the pie rule for an additional ball for the second player.<br/><br/>",

He will either pass to another position, kick for a field goal or try and gain ground. On the other 4 dice, there is a 1 in 6 chance of 'busting' the line of defense, at which point, your opponent has one more roll of the 'Defensive' die to try and stop the try scoring effort. <br/> If he succeeds, it is recorded as a tackle in the set of 6 and the attack continues. If he can't stop the try, the attackers then gets to roll the TRY / NO TRY dice.<br/> 3 in 6 chance of a TRY / 2 in 6 chance of NO TRY and 1 chance the VIDEO ref is called upon to review the tape - in which a re-roll of the TRY die is made.<br/> You can also kick for field goals, penalties and scrums. All of these are dependent on rolling a certain number to be successful.<br/><br/>",

About a quarter of these people are at Stage 3 of the infection, and the numbers of the &quot;Afflicted&quot; are growing by the day. Cities throughout the U.S. Midwest are emptying as healthier citizens flee for the coasts and roving gangs terrorize the highways. Rumors abound as to the cause &mdash; a madman with a chip on his shoulder, a military experiment gone wrong, and so on &mdash; but if there's any hope for turning back the tide on this illness, someone will need to find a cure. And the best bet for this cure is a small team of survivors unaffected by the virus, searching from city to city as they find and stop the Mastermind behind the Z-B13 virus.<br/><br/>The pulp-adventure cooperative game Zero Hour balances dice placement with a press-your-luck threat track and risk/reward decisions that add tension on every turn. Combined with an optimistic take on a well-loved gaming theme, Zero Hour flips the zombie genre into an epic quest to find the cure for the Z-B13 virus...all in about an hour.<br/><br/>",

The main objective of the game isn't to win, but to not be the loser.<br/><br/>The game 'turn' has 4 parts. First you will receive a call (card) from the previous player, then you can use a rune or viking, and/or pass a card to the next player, ending your turn.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to get 5 different gods in your hand. Having the call (card) of a god in your hand means that the warrior (player) has been recognised by that god. When you have the 5, you should put your cards face-up on the table. The other players should do the same thing, always in the most discreet way. The person to put their cards on their table last, is the loser.<br/><br/>",

Make the longest snake you can, picking up power-ups along the way to supercharge your snake.<br/><br/>Solo game:<br/>You will use up to 6 custom 'snake' dice to determine how your snake moves around the 11*11 grid, eating power-ups that give you powers to manipulate your dice rolls, and even using one-time actions to portal through walls or tunnel under blockades!  But be careful - every time you gain a power-up, more blockades appear on the grid.  And one of the snake dice faces is a Blockade face that can't easily be manipulated and causes more blockades to appear!<br/><br/>How much of the board can you traverse and how many power-ups can you unlock before you inevitably crash?...<br/><br/>Multiplayer game:<br/>You can now also play the game with 4 players, all manoeuvring their own snakes around the same shared board, vying for powerups and all trying to avoid the blockades AND each other!  Points are acquired similarly to the solo game, but you get additional bonuses for being the first to reach level 4 of each powerup track, and the last snake standing gains a bonus 10VP!  You can also try your luck on the larger 15*15 grid, giving more room to snake around (and a slightly longer game) - especially good with the max 4 players!<br/><br/>",

Light from the lantern shines through holes in the card panels to create a game play area of light and shadow (the board, as such) on the table surface.<br/><br/>The game system was published in 2017. Two games were available at the time of its release (Snixtrap and Wisp in the Vale), but the publisher's web site indicates they plan to develop one new game for the Larklamp system annually.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bugsies is a fast and easy game for the little ones in which you need to be quick and sharp.<br/><br/>Wooden chips representing butterflies, bees and ladybugs are sitting on the colored petals, and players are holding them by their string tails. The player who holds a wooden spider cup throws the dice, and the hunt begins!<br/><br/>The leader throws the dice in the middle of the flower field and tries to catch the bug that was shown on the dice while the bug is still sitting on the petal. The player that is holding this bug needs to quickly figure out that their bug is about to be caught and straightway pull it away from the petal. The leader throws the dice and tries to catch the right bug until they succeed. When the spider, finally, gets the bug, the player whose bug was caught passes the string tail to the leader and takes the spider cup to become the leader in the next round.<br/><br/>The game has three rule options, three different levels of difficulty. You can throw one die with colors and hunt for those who sit on the petal of the given color. It's a little harder to react to the die with the colors and shapes of the bugs. And for the advanced Bugsies, there is an option with two dice. Here the task is to combine given colors and shapes.<br/><br/>The game ends when... in fact, it doesn't have to end. You can take a break when everyone has played enough and every player got a chance to be a spider. Thank each other for the great game, rest a little, and come back to Bugsies.<br/><br/>",

There must have been something in the water where they grew up! Lucien (&lsquo;The Silver Bullet&rsquo;, according to his official merchandise) was the first to rise to fame, as team captain and star Blitzer of the Galadrieth Gladiators. Under his leadership they won Blood Bowl X and Lucien himself amassed a serious haul of awards and plaudits. His brother Valen later followed in his footsteps, captaining the Elfheim Eagles and setting them up as one of the most promising new teams in the league. In recent years, tired of competing to top the leaderboards, the twins have begun hiring out their services as a pair.<br/><br/>This multipart resin kit contains the components necessary to assemble The Swift Twins. These models are a pair of Star Players for High Elf, Dark Elf and Elven Union Blood Bowl teams &ndash; they refuse to work alone, only as a pair. This means they&rsquo;re quite expensive, but worth the gold &ndash; you won&rsquo;t find a finer Thrower and Blitzer. The rules for using the Swift Twins can be found in The Inaugural Blood Bowl Almanac.<br/><br/>This kit comes as 12 components, and is supplied with 2 32mm Blood Bowl bases.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legend has it that a long time ago, mankind was ignorant to the extent of not knowing how to count or tell the years apart. The ever-benevolent Jade Emperor wanted to help mankind out. From there, the idea of a twelve-year cycle and the naming of each year in the cycle after an animal was born.<br/><br/>But how should the Jade Emperor choose twelve animals from among so many in the living world, while remaining impartial? To resolve this equitably, the Jade Emperor decided to hold a race involving all animals on his birthday. The first twelve animals to cross the river and reach the Heavenly Palace will have a year named after them, in the order of how they finished the race. The race became known as The Great Race and the twelve-year cycle was named the Chinese Zodiac.<br/><br/>Race for the Chinese Zodiac is a board game that recreates The Great Race. Each player has a hand of eight action cards (numbered 1-8) as well as energy cards of different values and karma tokens. Each player selects one animal token and takes the corresponding animal card, which grants the player advantages during the race. All players place their animal token on the start space of the racetrack. Players assemble the dual-layered and double-sided action wheel that's used to determine the effectiveness of each action and place it in the center of the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, all players select an action card and an energy card from their hand, then they reveal these cards simultaneously. If the action card selected is one value lower than the player's previously played action card, the player must spend one karma token; if two or more values lower, they must spend two karma tokens. Players then resolve all played actions based on the orientation of the wheel, ideally gaining movement, new energy cards, and karma. Everyone places their played cards face up in front of themselves, then rotate the wheel clockwise by one space and start a new turn.<br/><br/>The first animal to complete the race earns the coveted right of having the first year of the Chinese Zodiac named after it!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All players must agree on which number to use. Place this number token on the Jungle hex.<br/><br/>The Robber begins the game on the Jungle hex.<br/><br/>- Special Rules<br/>The Jungle<br/>During the game, players may explore the Jungle and make valuable discoveries. The discoveries will aid them in developing their principalities. When the number on the token that was placed in the Jungle is rolled on the production dice, each player with settlements or cities adjacent to the Jungle will make discoveries!<br/><br/>Like other land hexes, each settlement adjacent to the Jungle will receive one discovery when the Jungle number is rolled. Likewise, each city adjacent to the Jungle will receive two discoveries.<br/><br/>-Discoveries<br/>Discoveries are not represented by cards as other resources are. Instead, they are represented by the Discovery Counters. Discovery Counters do not count against a player's hand limit of resources when a &quot;7&quot; is rolled on the production roll.<br/><br/>Discovery Counters can not be stolen by the Robber, can not be claimed by a Monopoly, can not be earned through a Year of Plenty, and may not be used in any trades.<br/><br/>Discovery Counters are used to aid the purchase of development cards. Each Discovery Counter can be used to replace any one of the three resources needed to purchase a card. Up to three Discovery Counters may be used on each card purchase.<br/><br/>Any combination of Discovery Counters and the three normal resources may be used.<br/><br/>For Example: a player may purchase a Development Card with one Ore and two Discovery Counters. Similarly, a Discovery Card could be purchased with one wool, one grain, and one discovery counter.<br/><br/>III. Components<br/>In addition to all of the normal components of the Settlers game, you will need three additional components:<br/><br/>1 Jungle Hexagon<br/>Discovery Counters (about 10 should be enough, the Victory Point Tokens from Seafarers work very well for this purpose)<br/>1 additional resource number token (valued 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, or 11)<br/><br/>",

Then you remember what happened ...<br/><br/>You had an argument with the sellers of an old submarine that you wanted to buy and renovate. When you arrived at the old port, you could see immediately that the submarine was not in the offered condition. This junk box was never worth 1.2 million euros! Before you even knew what was going on, the sellers pulled out a gun, took the money, and pushed you into the submarine ... That was the last thing you can remember.<br/><br/>An alarm suddenly sounds in the submarine, a voice drowns him out: &ldquo;The emergency mode has been initiated. Open the emergency door. &quot;A few seconds later the second instruction follows:&quot; Another 15 minutes of oxygen. Repeat, another 15 minutes of oxygen. &rdquo;At least the emergency lights have come on. A look at the clock reveals that it is just 14:17.

The values of each class type are as follows:<br/><br/>Warrior - Attack<br/>Merchant - Gold<br/>Guardian - Heal<br/>Alchemist - Poison Attack<br/>Mage - Draw a card<br/><br/>Bonus values are in the middle of each card and are activated if the fist matching side value and middle are the same class type. Use purchased cards to give you an advantage over other players.<br/><br/>The game ends and you are declared the winner when all other players are eliminated by reducing their life totals to zero.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

(When playing with three or four players, each player has only one set of spiders numbered 1-8.)<br/><br/>To start the game, neutral flies and the player pieces are placed randomly around the web. Everyone but the first player can then swap the position of two of her spiders. Each turn, a player must make a capture by moving one of her spiders onto an enemy piece (or a fly). Spiders can move over friendly spiders and empty spaces, but not enemy spiders.  A spider can capture an enemy spider that has the same number of legs or fewer legs. If a player can't capture, she passes for the turn, but take actions in the future if captures become possible.<br/><br/>The game ends when only one player has 8-legged spiders, or neither player can move. The player with most 8-legged spiders wins; in the rare case of a tie, you look at the 7-legged spiders, and so on.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Pocket Basketball has all 5 player dice on the court with the Referee die, a Defensive set die and a standard six sided dice for shot accuracy. Depending on if your player is OPEN or the defense has double teamed him, will change how easy or hard it is to score.<br/><br/>Games consist of 5 min quarters, or however long you wish to play.    There are dice for each of the five court positions, plus 1 die for defense, 1 die for referee and 1 die for shot accuracy.<br/><br/>At tip off, both players roll the D6 with the highest roll winning possession.  Every play begins with the PG being rolled first. He will either PASS to a team mate, SHOOT for 3pts or DRIBBLE<br/><br/>PASSING from the PG will be to the team mate shown by a letter. You can pass as many times before the SHOT CLOCK times out.    <br/>Each other player has a PASS option which they can CHOOSE which player to pass the ball to. The CENTRE and SMALL FORWARD have a special ability after they pass, however, it can only be used if the receiving player takes a shot on his next action.    <br/><br/>    CENTER - Pass/tip in - if the player that receives this shoots and misses, the player can roll again to try and meet the DEF level as a tip in attempt    <br/>    SMALL FORWARD - Pass/rebound - if the player that receives this shoots and misses, the player can roll again with the SF die as the rebound was made    <br/><br/><br/>If either of these two pass, and the receiving player also passes, the tip off/rebound are no longer able to be used.<br/><br/>SHOOTING - when a type of shot is shown on a player's dice, this indicates he is attempting to score. Your opponent will then roll the DEFENSE die to set his defense. Depending on the DEFENSE level, the SHOOTER must roll equivalent or above to score a basket.<br/><br/>DRIBBLE - just reroll the same dice again. If you roll DRIBBLE 3 times before you take a shot, the shot clock has timed out and it's a turnover to your opponent's PG<br/><br/>UNCONTESTED SHOT - except for your PG, all 4 other team mates have a special shot indicated with a STAR. The DEFENSE can not roll and the Shooter scores an automatic basket.<br/><br/>DRAW - when rolled on the DEFENSE, means a FOUL has occurred on the shot. If the shot is good, the player will go to the free throw line for an extra point chance.    If the shot misses, the player then goes to the line for either 2 or 3 FREE THROW attempts.<br/><br/>FOUL - when rolled on the DEFENSE, your opponent will roll the REFEREE dice to determine the infringement. Travel/Dbl dribble/Charge are all Offensive fouls and result in a TURNOVER to your opponent's PG.    Personal/Flagrant foul results in a stop in play and restart by the OFFENSIVE player's PG<br/>Ball up - both players roll their dice to see who gains possession from the jump.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Update: Toast! was not funded on Kickstarter, but the design was taken up by Horrible Games and developed into Raise Your Goblets.<br/><br/>Toast! is themed around ruthless medieval nobles trying to poison each other during the toasts at a royal function. The King has decreed a bizarre etiquette to be followed, in an attempt to discourage this behaviour. However, instead it has just turned the practice into an art and a sport, with each (surviving) noble having developed a particular expertise.<br/><br/>In a round of play, goblets are arranged in a circle in the middle of the table, one in front of each player, such that players can&rsquo;t see their contents. Players take turns to secretly place wine, poison or antidote tokens into the goblets,  switching the goblets around, or using their characters special abilities. Each player has a target, and their aim is to ensure that, when the round is ended by someone calling for the Toast and the players all &lsquo;drink&rsquo;, their target&rsquo;s goblet is poisoned and theirs is safe!<br/><br/>The game supports 2-12 players. The main rules are for 4-6 players, there are special rules to extend up to 12 players (where pairs of players play as a noble and their wine-taster), and there is a separate game mode for 2-3 players (a sort of Russian Roulette with goblets).<br/><br/>",

But while the excavation team were still busy celebrating their success in the evening, the famous archaeology professor Mary Stonerock was found dead.<br/><br/>You had expected this expedition to be nothing less than an archaeological miracle. For two months, you&rsquo;ve all been in the Peruvian rainforest looking for the remains of the Moche people, an advanced South American civilization that preceded the Incas and has hardly been studied.<br/><br/>You knew you were on the right path, as you had found countless small vases, tools and other artifacts over the past few days. Late in the afternoon, you finally found the tomb of the priestesses. This important find would have been another milestone in the career of Mary Stonerock, the US&rsquo;s youngest full professor of archaeology.<br/><br/>Mary decided to celebrate the find with a hearty feast and an evening of drinking. You raised a toast to your joint success and speculated as to what the tomb, to be opened the next day, might contain. But the evening took a tragic turn when Christian discovered Mary&rsquo;s body at around midnight in the entrance of her tent.<br/><br/>Director Gustavo Navarro has since notified the police using the camp&rsquo;s radio. They are due to arrive at the remote excavation site in a few hours. Until they are here, you are all on your own in solving the mystery. What happened? How could this expedition have ended so tragically?<br/><br/>What is a murder mystery game?<br/><br/>You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.<br/><br/>You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.<br/><br/>Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.<br/><br/>Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENT:<br/>1 Game Manual, 7 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 7 name badges, 1 support code<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After being cut off and isolated in mid-February 1945, the German garrison at Breslau, some 50,000 men, defied all odds holding onto the city for almost a week AFTER Berlin fell! Hitler had ordered the city be held at all costs, believing Soviet forces tied up there were thus not taking part in any assault on Berlin. The defending garrison finally surrendered just days before the war officially ended (with the Gauleiter in charge fleeing the city by air to escape capture).<br/><br/>Taking the city fell to the Soviet Sixth Army, comprised of some eight divisions with 80,000 men between them, plus four tank regiments and two artillery divisions. An entire Air Army, the Second, was also assigned to provide ample destructive power from the sky. The task facing the Soviets was daunting; urban warfare plus a very determined defender. Terrain too was critical - the Oder River flowing through the city sliced it up into many parts. Taking a major sector of the city could mean nothing more than occupying an &quot;island&quot; in the end.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Among them is Jupiter. According to the observations and studies, it has shown that there are significant changes in the surface, color, and size of the Great Red Spot.<br/><br/>For this reason, the SoS joined forces with space agencies from various countries and launched spacecrafts to study and record the effects on Jupiter with photos. A good photo represents performance and efficiency of your agency&rsquo;s technological advancement.

At the beginning of the game, everyone has one of each of seven role cards; over five in-game days, players will give each other votes and discard roles until only one is left, which determines who wins.<br/><br/>Each turn (&quot;day&quot;), a player may choose to either vote or destroy a vote. When you vote you give a vote token to any other player and discard your role cards for the day face down. When you destroy a vote, you discard one vote from any player, including yourself, and your discards for the day are face up. At the end of each of the first three days, all discards are shuffled and revealed in total, so you can follow approximately what cards are still in play.<br/><br/>Roles have a variety of victory conditions. The Dictator wins by collecting the most votes with no ties; the Fool wins if a Dictator wins; the Assassin wins if they have no votes and a Dictator or some other roles win; the Peasant wins if all other players are Peasants or if no other role wins, and so on.<br/><br/>Everyone can win if they just agree to be Peasants... but can you be sure nobody is secretly trying to become a Dictator?<br/><br/>Note: The game can be played with up to 12 players, but one box only supports up to 6. For more than 6 players you will need to buy a second set and combine them.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

A card management phase where you need to develop technical skills of swim, bike and run but still maintain a good level of energy and mindfulness just before the race.

        "description": "User summary<br/>In this cooperative game, players begin by selecting hero cards from among four different colors (representing the elements earth, wind, fire, and water) to form a party. Each player then receives a hand of cards drawn from a central deck, which also represents the players' hit points. The players face a series of monster cards drawn from an enemy deck.<br/><br/>The heroes begin at level one, but they earn tokens during the game that may be spent to level up their attack abilities. Each hero may only attack when the player has played a card matching its color. The card that is played must match either the color or the number of the card that was previously played, though multiple cards may be played under special circumstances.<br/><br/>Monster attacks force players to discard from the central deck, decreasing the available hit points. Leveling up the heroes helps players to reclaim these discarded hit points, essentially &quot;healing&quot; the group.<br/><br/>After facing a series of monsters, the players confront a powerful boss monster in a final battle. The players all win or lose together.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>The players choose unit cards of various spirits to form parties. Each unit card has unique effects and can be played in various combinations.<br/><br/>Holding circuit cards with numbers 0 to 4 and 4 colors as your hands, play the cards with numbers and colors matching those of the cards in the play area. If you have a unit card matching the played card in your party, that unit will attack the enemy.<br/><br/>Thus, play cards to attack and destroy the enemies that appear one after another. You can also gain magical power by card plays and use that power to<br/>activate your unit's special ability as well as raise the unit's level to lead the battle advantageously. The enemies' final boss is very powerful. The players need to cooperate and support each other for victory. In this 3rd edition, the statuses of unit cards and enemy cards have been adjusted and the easy mode has been introduced.<br/><br/>プレイヤーは様々な精霊のユニットカードを何枚か選んでパーティーを結成します。<br/>ユニットカードはそれぞれ固有の効果を持っていて、様々な組み合わせで遊べます。<br/><br/>ゲームでは、0～4の数字と４つの色が描かれた回路カードを手札に持ち、場札の数字や色と同じものをプレイします。<br/>プレイしたカードと同じ色のユニットカードが自分のパーティーにいれば、そのユニットが敵に攻撃を行います。<br/><br/>そうやってカードをプレイして、次々と現れる敵に攻撃を行って撃破していきます。 <br/>またカードプレイによって魔力を獲得でき、その魔力を使ってユニットごとの特殊能力を使ったりユニット自身のレベルを上げていくことで戦いを有利に展開できます。<br/>最後に登場する敵ボスキャラクターは非常に強力で、プレイヤー同士で協力・サポートし、力を合わせて勝利を目指してください。<br/>この第３版では、ユニットカードと敵カードのステータス調整、イージーモードの導入などが行われています。<br/><br/>",

The Trivia Deck contains 1,375 questions that span the entire history of horror cinema. The Categories Deck is used to play Slash Cards' two game modes: The Slasher and The Survivor. In The Slasher, players take turns drawing Category Cards and answering questions. The first player to collect a card from each of the game's five categories wins, but watch out! If you draw a Slash Card you forfeit all your cards and start over. In The Survivor, each player begins with a full suite of Category Cards. Each time a player answers a question incorrectly they lose one of their cards. The last player with at least one card in their hand is the winner. The trivia cards cover everything from the silent era all the way up to 2015, including questions about classics like The Exorcist and Halloween, lesser-known movies like Motel Hell and Session 9, and foreign horror films like Eyes Without A Face and REC. Horror fans of all levels will love Slash Cards.<br/><br/>",

The plague of brain-chomping quasi-dead, previously discounted and denied, have <br/>become a genuine menace in several major cities. Every government has its own notions of how to deal with it, major corporations seek to <br/>manipulate the crisis, military leaders push against the limits of civilian control, and the zombies simply&hellip;hunger.<br/><br/><br/>Zombie War is a 2-4 player game that takes the zombie threat to a global level. Each player has two hidden victory conditions and has to reach them using a rotating selection of roles, each with different powers and ways to gain victory points. In one turn you might be playing as the zombies, the next the government, the next the military, and finally the corporations. Yet, your victory conditions--for example, to infect three major capitals, or protect trade centers-- remain the same. The decisions you make as one role affect the other players, but may also affect you when you take on a different role in the next round. It is multiplayer mayhem on a strategic level.<br/><br/> <br/>Zombie War takes about 60-90 minutes to play, is recommended for two to four players ages 14 and up, and includes:<br/> <br/>        1 x 22&quot; x 17&quot; richly-colored map of the world.<br/>        70 die-cut counters representing hordes of zombies, the medical personnel assigned to contain them, and the soldiers assigned to kill them.<br/>        18 victory condition, faction, and player aid cards.<br/>        Full-color rule book.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

Players compete to stash food and weapons, and seek aid from other survivors.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a &quot;stash&quot; of four cards. Each turn you can play a card from your stash. Different cards have different Actions. After an Action resolves, replace the card played with the top card from the Draw Pile. However, most Actions allow you to Replenish your stash in several strategic ways.<br/><br/>Different cards/items have different Actions, or rather different items cause different things within the game to happen. Tools like the Compass and Shovel allow players to search the Draw Pile and Discard Pile for a card to replenish their Stash. Weapons, like the Tactical Knife and Hand Gun let you intimidate opponents into giving you cards.<br/><br/>In addition to Items, there are also other Survivors within the deck that can you help you on your quest for survival gear.

Polish forces, led by Jan Skrzynecki, defeated Russian 1st Corps, commanded by Hans Karl von Diebitsch. After the battle, Polish commander did not receive any reinforcements, so the victory was not decisive and Polish army had to move back.<br/><br/>The battle of Olszynka Grochowska was the largest battle of the November Uprising and biggest in Europe since the battle of Waterloo.[citation needed] It was fought on 25 February in the woods near Groch&oacute;w, at the eastern outskirts of Warsaw. Both sides suffered heavy losses and none of them was able to call itself victorious, but sinces Polish army managed to stop Russian advance on Warsaw, historians look at this battle as Polish tactical victory.<br/><br/>The Battle of Dębe Wielkie was fought on 31 March 1831. The Polish army, led by Jan Skrzynecki, won over Russian curtain forces commanded by General Geismar. It was first battle of the Polish ofensive planned by general Prądzyński.<br/><br/>The Battle of Iganie was fought on 10 April 1831. It was one of the last major battles of the November Uprising and the last major offensive for the Poles.<br/><br/>Game uses &quot;Napoleon&quot; brigade/regiment-based system, with typical hex and counter mechanics, along with &quot;I move - you move&quot; driven system. It has rather easy rules, prepared for most of the battles of the first half of the XIX century.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/> Groch&oacute;w 1809<br/>- Groch&oacute;w 1831<br/>- Wawer 1831<br/>- Wawer II<br/>- Iganie<br/>- Dębe Wielkie<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The successful start-up founder Max Hubbard invited his school friends on a yacht trip. Everyone was reminiscing about old memories until the evening took a tragic turn. Max&rsquo;s wife Eleanor suddenly disappeared without a trace.<br/><br/>Max&rsquo;s invitation to join him on a yacht trip came as a surprise. Your old circle from school hadn&rsquo;t met up for two years. Since then, your lives had slowly drifted in different directions. The reunions had been less and less frequent.<br/><br/>Max had rented a luxurious motor yacht, with its own captain and cook, and late in the afternoon the vessel left the harbor. Antonio, the chef, served a fantastic five-course dinner in the evening. The champagne corks popped and everybody raised a glass to good times in the past. Everyone had plenty of stories to tell.<br/><br/>But the trip took a dramatic turn in the course of the night. By the time Max went to bed at around midnight, his wife Ella had disappeared. Max alerted everyone, and you all searched the ship from stem to stern. At first everyone thought it was a prank. But when you found a pool of blood on deck, it was clear something bad must have happened.<br/><br/>Captain Steward has notified the police and Coast Guard, but there is little hope of finding Ella alive. Until the authorities arrive, you will have to solve the mystery by yourselves. What happened this evening? Has there been a murder on board?<br/><br/>What is a murder mystery game?<br/><br/>You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.<br/><br/>You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.<br/><br/>Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.<br/><br/>Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENT:<br/>1 Game Manual, 7 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 7 name badges, 1 support code<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "End of June 1866. After several months of mounting tensions, war has broken out between Austria and Prussia for preeminent control in Germany. Prussia plans for its troops to cross the Sudetes and penetrate Bohemia by 4 different passages with the objective of confronting the principal Austrian Army in a decisive Napoleonic battle. The outlet of one of these passages was here, near the towns of Nachod and Skalitz. The Prussian V Corps was in position to take control of it and allow the VI Corps to follow it before converging with the other Prussian corps on the centre of the Austrian presence. General Steinmetz is appointed commander of the Prussian 1st Army in 1870 and will have to confront the Austrian troops sent by General Benedek.<br/><br/>As a new unit of the series &ldquo;Battles in the era of Napoleon III&rdquo;, Nachod-Skalitz is the first game of a series that will cover the principal clashes of the campaign in Bohemia of 1866, concluding with the battle of Sadowa. Players will have the option of playing the battles one after another in a campaign mode, resulting perhaps in a very different situation by the time they arrive at the decisive battle of 3 July 1866.<br/><br/>Using the series &ldquo;The Great Battles of Napoleon III&rdquo; (VaeVictis # 55, # 73 and 138), the system is simple and dynamic with an accent on the engagement of the troops against deadly defensive fire.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Scale :<br/><br/>Game turn : one hour<br/>Counters : regiments and battalions<br/>Map : one hex. = 750 m<br/>Complexity : 5/10<br/>Solo playability  : 7/10<br/>Duration : 2 to 4 hours depending on the scenario<br/><br/>(sources : rulebook and description from the Publisher)<br/><br/>The second volume of the campaign of 1866 is Trautenau/Soor (<a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/372473/trautenau-and-soor-1866\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/372473/trautenau-and-soo...</a>)<br/>The third volume of the campaign of 1866 is M&uuml;nchengr&auml;tz/Gitschin (<a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/418334/munchengratz-gitschin-1866\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/418334/munchengratz-gits...</a>)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Budapest Campaign: October 1944 to February 1945 is a wargame of the Soviet offensive in Hungary in late 1944 and early 1945 which culminated in the conquest of the city of Budapest. Throughout this campaign the Axis launched successive counterattacks which regained ground but, in the end, failed to stem the Soviet tide.<br/><br/>There are two players: Axis and Soviets. Each side is divided into sub-commands. For the Axis, this includes Armee Kommando Nord, Armee Kommando Sud (these are not historical designators but are based on German operational practice by this period), and Hungarian forces. The Soviets have Second and Third Ukrainian Fronts, as well as the Romanian army.<br/><br/>Budapest Campaign ends just prior to the start of Spring Awakening (World at War #73) which covers the final German offensive on the Eastern Front. Both games use a variant of the DG Boots system to model command/control and logistics. Various command markers activate player sub-commands and launch major offensives.<br/><br/>Components: 22x34 inch map, 176 die-cut counters.<br/><br/>World at War #85 August 2022<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The definitive version of a Michael Schacht classic, Patrician: Towers of Influence features an updated presentation, new two-player rules, and two expansion modules.<br/><br/>Welcome to 13th Century Italy, a time when wealthy Patrician families build magnificent towers to represent their power and prosperity: the more influential the family, the taller the tower!  You are a master builder, ready to profit from the vanity of the Patrician families.  You take building orders, adding floor after floor, and when a tower is complete, you&rsquo;ll be there to take the credit.  At the end of the game, the builder with the most victory points wins!<br/><br/>Patrician: Towers of Influence is delightfully effortless to play.  Each turn, play a Building card, which allows you to add to a tower in the matching city.  Some cards allow you to take special actions that help you or hinder others. Next, take the face-up card from the pile next to the city where you just built a tower.  As the game goes on, players will continue to build up the various towers, and points are scored for who controls the tallest towers in each city, as well as for playing Patrician portrait card sets. In the end, the builder with the most points wins!<br/><br/>This new version of the classic game includes several expanded ways to enjoy the game.  When playing with two players, you compete against the Architetto, a wily bot opponent who thwarts your plans.  The Trade Routes and Delegates modules can optionally be added in to increase the decisions and affect final scoring.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is up to the Emergency City Reconstruction companies to do that job and guarantee that these new cities represent the glory of the winning countries over their enemies.<br/><br/>In New Eden Project, players will create projects for a glorious city, participating in the contest to be the chosen company to build the &quot;New Eden&quot;, a city that will take place of an enemy capital. By using city part cards in a tile-placement mechanic, they will have to build the project always paying attention to the Contest Requirements, sorted at the beginning of the match.<br/><br/>There are 3 game modes: Populist (using sorted Contest Requirements, one of each of the types A, B, and C), Military (using all of the D Contest Requirements), or Elite (using both previous requirements). These requirement cards are the ones that tell the player how they are going to score in that match.<br/><br/>Regardless of the game mode, the game flow is always the same: players have 1 phase to buy cards using inspiration points (always 5 at the beginning of the phase), and 1 phase to place them in their projects (put them on the table). This continues until someone projects the 10th city part card, triggering the end of the game, when players check the Contest Requirements to see which cards have scored, and how many set-collection points they have won.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Your fate is determined by how well you deal with the inherent dilemmas of the game, and the conflict.<br/><br/>1) Will you push to gain prestige at the risk of escalating the crisis to global nuclear war?<br/>2) How do you best manage your hand of cards to further your own plans while depriving your opponent of options?<br/><br/>Work out these dilemmas in order to emerge as victor of the Cuban Missile Crisis after thirteen suspenseful days.<br/><br/>13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a meaty filler utilizing the card-driven game mechanisms. Rich with history, yet accessible to gamers with no prior knowledge of the crisis. It is targeted specifically at catering to two groups of gamers: the enthusiasts that just don't have the time they used to and the curious newcomers that are scared off by the heavy commitment and long play times of the classics in the genre.<br/><br/>13 Minutes: The Cuban Missile Crisis is a card-driven microgame with tough decisions. Playing as either Kennedy or Khrushchev, your aim is to exit the Cuban Missile Crisis as the most powerful superpower. During the game you play only five strategy cards that you use to place Influence on battlegrounds to score majorities or manipulate battlegrounds. Each card you play turns into a new battleground, so the &quot;world map&quot; is ever-changing. Be careful because each decision is important and you may trigger global nuclear war!<br/><br/>",

First, players may actively switch teams during the game. This allows people who don't like being deceptive a chance to choose a different team. Second, every player has to rely on information that has been filtered through other players' memory and intention. Is someone suspicious or just forgetful?<br/><br/>Hysteria is played with a small row of cards face down in front of each player. The game has three rounds each played in two separate phases: The Information Phase and the Capture Phase. During the Information Phase, players get new cards, pass cards, and share information honestly or deceptively. During the Capture Phase, players attempt to convince others of what they have seen! The game ends after the third round is complete. Capture the Human cards to win!<br/><br/>",

There are 4 steps to each round:<br/><br/>Step 1: Reveal the item up for auction.<br/>The Auctioneer flips over the top card of the deck to reveal the item that is up for auction this round.<br/><br/>Step 2: Activate Action Item Cards. <br/>Any player that has a card labelled &ldquo;instant&rdquo; can activate its ability by flipping it over. Instant abilities are a one-time use. Any VP labelled on the card counts toward end game scoring regardless of whether the card is active or not.<br/><br/>Step 3: Bid on items.<br/>Starting to the left of the auctioneer, in a clock-wise order, players either bid on the item or they PAWS (pass). If they BID, they place one Catnip Token in the centre of the table.<br/>If that player chooses to PAWS, they place their PAW Token in front of their screen and take all Catnip Tokens from in the centre of the table. They may no longer bid on this item.<br/><br/>Once a player PAWS&rsquo; and they are the only player that still hasn't PAWSed, that player will win the item. The last player to PAWS will get the number of mice shown in the bottom right corner of that item card.<br/><br/>Step 4: A new Auctioneer<br/>After the auction item is claimed, the winner of the auction becomes the Auctioneer for the next round and receives the Auctioneer Marker.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/>Repeat steps 1 to 4 until all Auction Items are won.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monuments: Ewiger Ruhm (&quot;Eternal Glory&quot;), a promotional item given away at Spiel 2012, consists of a short scoretrack counting from 1-14, and four tokens in each color, with a set of tokens showing a helment, a ship, a scroll, and a monument. Whenever a player builds or expands a monument, he uses these tokens to track the highest levels of his holdings in these four categories. If, for example, his first monument is of five cards with three ships and two helments, he'd place the monument token on five, the ship token on three, and the helmet token on two. The scoretrack always reflects the highest value you have reached ever in a game, so your token does not go down when your monuments degenerate.<br/><br/>In each category the player with the highest token gets additional victory points at the end of the game. In case of a tie the one is better, who has reached the highest level first. The runner-up gets a smaller reward.<br/><br/>",

Anno Domini: Gesundheit contains historical events related to health, medicine, etc. Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>In Anno Domini: Gesundheit, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/><br/>If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &ndash; receives three cards. The first player with no cards remaining in hand wins.<br/><br/>Note that Anno Domini: Gesundheit &amp; Ern&auml;hrung was discontinued and split into Anno Domini: Gesundheit and Anno Domini: Essen &amp; Trinken. About half of the events in each of these new editions were previously part of Anno Domini: Gesundheit &amp; Ern&auml;hrung and half of the events are new.<br/><br/>",

Rules for ten different types  of gladiators and a great plethora of weaponry and armor are included with the game. Perhaps the most interesting are the rules included for the Andabates type gladiator, a gladiator that fought blind with a full-head helmet, sort of like Luke Skywalker in &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.&quot;<br/><br/>Hail Caesar! is a fun &quot;beer and pretzels&quot; gladiator game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a fantasy mass battle game, cousin to the skirmish game Mayhem: Warrior Heroes.<br/><br/>This is a set of rules for recreating the battles and campaigns of the mythical land of Talomir. Peopled by both heroes and monsters, Talomir is a world where battle magic thrives, but the fate of nations can be decided by the strength of one right arm. As such, it is a real departure from what you may be used to. It doesn&rsquo;t have a rigid, traditional turn sequence where players alternate moving and firing with perhaps a melee or two at the end. It is much more fluid than that with both players moving figures, firing, and fighting as a result of various reaction tests. Forget perfect plans for few prearranged plans will survive past first contact! Opportunities arise as fortune smiles on one side then the other. The victory will go to the player who learns to exploit these situations.<br/><br/>Included in the game is an innovative campaign system for the nation states of Talomir.  Both the mass battle system and campaign system are unusually solitaire friendly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In ancient times long gone by, when the veil between the world of the humans and the realm of magic was thinner, almighty wizards battled each other in epic duels to determine who was the master of sorcery and arcane wisdom. Armed with a Spellbook and with the aid of the enchanted Element-Stones, the sorcerers summoned fantastic Creatures and magical Spells. A wizard who had no more pages left in his Spellbook would eventually have lost the magical battle of wits.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent's card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he puts the top card of his or her deck on his Discard Pile (or Archive). If a player is unable to draw a card, he loses immediately.<br/><br/>Elemental Clash: The Master Set is the ultimate deal well-suited for beginners, while still interesting for the veterans. It contains 80 different cards, over 270 in total, carefully selected by the designer from all previous sets of Elemental Clash. The &quot;Master Set&quot; also features updated, state-of-the-art illustrations done by an international cast of talented artists.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ogoola Karuta is a westernized version of a 400-year-old Japanese card game called Hyakunin-isshu Karuta. The game is sometimes described as intellectual martial arts. It is about listening and being extremely focused and fast, just like the Samurai with their swords. Only here you fight with cards instead.<br/><br/>The game is comprised of two decks of cards, the Reader deck and the Player deck. Cards in the Reader deck contain short poems or poetry quotations while cards in the Player deck contain only the second part of these poems. To begin the game, a Reader is chosen (or you may opt to use the Reader app) and the players are divided into two teams sitting/standing on opposite sides of the table or play area. The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poetry quotation on the reading cards and the player that finds the matching playing card first takes that card and puts it aside. If the card taken was on your opponent's side, you must give one card from your side to your opponent. The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).<br/><br/>The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185). In order to win the war, you need a strategy. Place the cards you are familiar with close to you (in the beginning it is normal that none of the cards are familiar). If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field. Since the reader or app will always read the complete quotation, you do not need prior knowledge of the poems. Strategically place the playing cards in a way that you can find and take them quickly such as laying them alphabetically or categorize them under the same first words.<br/><br/>Ogoola Karuta Poetry Game is not a translation of the original Japanese game. In this edition, we have selected 100 quotes, new and old from well known poems written in the English language. It is the first western version of Hyakunin-isshu Karuta, which means Karuta: 100 poems by 100 poets.<br/><br/>",

If it had been two men wrestling, it would have been called a 'dog fall.' Both sides claim victory&mdash;both whipped.&quot; -&thinsp;Private Sam Watkins, 1st Tennessee Infantry<br/><br/>In September, Braxton Bragg's Army of Mississippi out-maneuvered Don Carlos Buell's Army of the Ohio and invaded Kentucky. Although victorious in two battles, Bragg found his army out of position, low on supplies, and with no more than 1,000 Kentuckians joining the ranks. Buell was forced to seek out Bragg although his army was inexperienced. Outside Perryville, the two armies blundered into each other. A short but brutal battle followed that left neither side satisfied. The Union failed to utilize their numerical advantage, while Bragg withdrew from Kentucky. The result was a narrow Union victory, although Buell was removed from command and middle Tennessee was again in Confederate hands.<br/><br/>&ldquo;This army does not retreat.&rdquo; - George Thomas when asked if the XIV Corps should retreat from Stones River<br/><br/>The next time Bragg would face the Army of the Ohio, both opponents had new names. The Rebels dubbed their force the Army of Tennessee and the Union called theirs the XIV Corps. The Union was led by William Rosecrans, one of the war's best commanders. With offensives in Virginia and Mississippi failing, Rosecrans was pressured into making a premature winter push. At Stones River near Murfreesboro the armies fought a three day battle. The Confederates nearly won, but were forced back. The defeat relinquished some of the best farmland in Tennessee and an area that was heavily pro-Confederate. More importantly, the defeat led to a series of recriminations in the Confederate high command that poisoned the army. The Union received a desperately needed morale boost. Although forgotten today, Abraham Lincoln considered Stones River one of the North's most crucial victories.<br/><br/>&quot;Rally 'Round the Flag!&quot; is a brigade grand tactical system that combines old school hex and counter maneuvers with rules for command and control, leader personalities, flexible artillery, and a CRT that favors quality and firepower over raw mass. For Perryville (Battle in the Bluegrass) there are rules for Union high command confusion and Joseph Wheeler's cavalry screen. For Stones River (Winter of Discontent) there are rules for Cheatham being drunk and Rosecrans coming under fire. Both come with multiple scenarios, including additional forces. Players can make Perryville a grand decisive battle or at Stones River bring in additional Confederate forces that could decide the battle and the war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Game Scale: Approx. 0.25 miles/hex = approx. 440 yards/hex = approx. 402 metres/hex.  1 hour/turn.<br/><br/>Perryville map: 10 inches by 15 inches. <br/>Stones River (Murfreesboro) map: 15 inches by 18 inches.<br/>The two maps are separate maps.<br/><br/>",

The marshal had time to send a message indicating his desire to attempt an exit if a rescue army arrived. But since then, there has been no news. To break the encirclement, Mac Mahon, at the head of the army of Ch&acirc;lons, receives the formal order from the government to rush at Metz to liberate its brothers in arms. The army of Ch&acirc;lons, composed of disparate elements (troops from Africa stand alongside the mobile guards of the Seine), must remain grouped and must move quickly to avoid being taken at the flank by the German troops. The Germans, commanded by Moltke himself, still believe the French to be at Paris, covering the capital. But the city of light is not his objective for the moment. His goal: the destruction of the French regular armed forces in a decisive battle.<br/><br/>Through &quot;Sedan 1870&quot;, the evolution of the &quot;Marshals of the 2nd Empire&quot; campaign series, will you be able, like Mac Mahon, to cross the Meuse in time and go to the rescue of Bazaine&rsquo;s army ?

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Yokai Quest<br/>Yokai Quest is a game where players lead a group of heroes who must face a multitude<br/>of enemies and dangers.<br/>The main enemies of the heroes are the Yokai, mythological creatures from Japanese<br/>folklore. Each Yokai has its own distinctive traits and abilities, from the evil Oni, to the<br/>funny Tengu, to the prankster Tanuki. But they are not the only enemies the heroes<br/>must face, the world of Yokai hides a multitude of hidden dangers.<br/>Throughout the campaign, the players will follow the plot of a story that will take them<br/>through different scenarios, where they will have to face all kinds of challenges. After<br/>each scenario, win or lose, the plot will continue until the story is complete.<br/>Yokai quest has been designed with simplicity in mind, so that anyone, of any age group<br/>and knowledge, can play yokai quest after just one reading of this rulebook.<br/>But let&rsquo;s not waste anymore time! We know you are itching to start, so let us go right<br/>into the world of Yokai Quest.<br/><br/>Yokai Quest Strikes Back brings with it the following changes and improvement to the original Yokai Quest!<br/><br/>Major Upgrades:<br/>1.  Major revision to the rulebook and Gameplay. We did not just fix the rulebook, we have now completely revised the game. Yokai Quest Strikes back difficulty level has been designed to be challenging for experienced players while at the same time a Little Heroes mode (Easy mode) has also been created for children and new players.<br/>2. The original Yokai Quest had 16 scenarios. Yokai Quest Strikes Back brings you +20 scenarios in a separate, new +80 pages campaign book!<br/><br/>Gameplay Tweaks:<br/><br/>Strategy<br/>    1. Hero movement : Movement is now an action. Heroes no longer have costless movement. Additionally, leaving a square adjacent to a yokai will now cost double. Players will now need to strategically plan their hero movement and placement.<br/>    2. Friendly Fire : Powerful abilities have been tweaked - in general, heroes can no longer unleash a skill without a care in the world : swinging their sword at their allies will cause significant damage! The addition of friendly fire means that hero position, skill choice and energy expenditure decision is now even more strategic!<br/>    3. Players may no longer swap items at any time during their phase. Swapping items from the inventory to the hero board can now only be done during the &quot;take a breather&quot; phase, at the end of a hero turn.<br/>    4. Energy token management : Energy tokens can now be used to recharge a skill. This adds another level of strategy to the energy token management. Do you recharge a skill, or save the energy to unleash another skill?<br/>    5. The concept of Line of Sight has been added to the game<br/>    6. Terrain elements have been properly incorporated into the game. There are more strategic decisions to be made around these elements, such as Shrubs, Magic Barriers, altars and monoliths.<br/><br/>Spawn Rate and Yokai Difficulty level<br/>    1. Yokai Spawn rate has been modified , there is now the normal mode (harder), and an easy mode.<br/>    2. Additionally, each spawn point will now spawn a yokai each turn, unless specified otherwise by the scenario conditions<br/>    3. Yokais attributes, attack and defense stats have been tweaked and modified.<br/><br/>Additional changes<br/>    1. Heroes no longer receive treasure tokens for defeating a Yokai, unless specified by scenario conditions. Treasures must be earned!<br/>    2. Skills or Abilities have been completely revamped. Each Hero now begins their adventure with a limited number of skills, and are able to purchase more powerful skills with the victory points (experience) they gained during their adventures.<br/><br/>Download the new rules here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Swi9sXRXel9ejZ9PeCtpSLnqe9udPNs?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_Swi9sXRXel9ejZ9PeCt...</a><br/><br/>New campaing on kickstarter, suscribe in:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zenitminiatures/yokai-quest-strikes-back?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/zenitminiatures/yokai-q...</a><br/><br/>",

The remaining cards are then stacked face down on the table within reach of all players. This is the Stock Pile. Each round starts at zero Space Rocks. The player sitting to the left of the dealer begins the round and play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>The first player lays down one of her cards face up next to the Stock Pile. If it is a Space Rock card, she declares the current Space Rock total. If it is an action card, she declares this instead. After she plays, she immediately draws a card from the Stock Pile. If she forgets to draw a card before the next player plays, she must play the rest of the round with only two cards. The next player then lays down a card and either states the new Space Rock total or the Action Card he is playing. There are seven different Action Cards with different impacts on game play.<br/><br/>The Space Rock total can never exceed one hundred total tons. When players have no cards to play to change the total or equal it with a Full Load, they lose. If three or four people are playing, the remaining players continue until there is only one player left in each round. After each round, the entire deck is reshuffled by the next dealer and the next round begins.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter page<br/><br/>",

Race across a vast mountain range and be the first yeti to reach the summit to win!<br/><br/>The flow of Yeti Trek is as follows:<br/>1. One player rolls all 6 dice and splits the dice into 2 groups<br/>2. The other player choose which group of dice they want. The remaining group goes to the first player.<br/>3. Use your dice to move your Yeti meeple across the mountain range. To move on the mountain range, the space that you end your movement on must match the color of the dice that you discarded. In addition, the total value of the dice discarded must be equal to or greater than the total on all the spaces that you moved through this turn.<br/><br/>Optionally utilize a rondel every turn before you move to gain bonuses to your movement.<br/><br/>Once both players have used all of their dice, the round is over and a new round starts. The game ends immediately once one players reaches one of the Summit spaces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "D&euro;mocracia is a Spanish politics game simulating a corrupt two-party democratic system.<br/><br/>Players represent political leaders of either party. They must cooperate with their party partner to win the support of the different election districts while rivaling each other to be the most popular and therefore chosen candidate for President. Candidates winning the election become President, who must avoid resignation at all costs during the entire term in order to score a victory point. The game ends after the third election, which awards a victory point to the successful candidate. If tie-breaking is necessary, the player who have secured the most retirement-plan points during the game wins.<br/><br/>If the number of players is 3, 5 or 6, some players represent smaller parties with a different goal, to become one of the two large parties by being the second most voted party at any election.<br/><br/>In D&euro;mocracia, players have &mdash;and might hire&mdash; agents, including leader, party barons, media and judges to play cards for them. These cards are placed face down, one per agent, and include funding for their political or scheme activities and the activities themselves. Cards may be legal or illegal to play. After every player has placed their cards, they start revealing and getting the effects of the cards played on a turn-by-turn basis. Each judge investigates one agent per turn, placing tokens right before anyone starts revealing cards. If the agent's card is illegal upon revelation, a trial against the agent takes place. All players having judges can influence the trial's outcome, which might involve losing the agent and the card played by them.<br/><br/>",

When the Monster grows hungry, a deep growl rumbles across the land. The town citizens know that this means trouble, for it is at these times that the Monster seeks out its favorite snack: Farmer Brown&rsquo;s sheep! A group of clever teenagers are determined to stop the Monster from reaching its goal.<br/><br/>Monster Trap is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players who work together to set traps that will discourage the Monster from eating the sheep and send it scurrying back to its cave. The players must successfully complete a number of traps that the Monster sets off before it reaches Farmer Brown&rsquo;s Farm to win the game.<br/><br/>The players grab resources from Monster Trap Corp's conveyor belts and get them out to the traps any way they can before time runs out. Monster Trap is the ultimate resource gathering and placement game.<br/><br/>Each trap card has a list of resources (colored cubes) that are needed to complete a trap. The players move their tokens to pick up the resources from the conveyor belt, carry those resources to the trap and place them. After all resources for a trap have been placed, then the trap is considered set and will trigger when the monster moves onto that space.<br/><br/>",

In the winter of 1942, his crack 11th Panzer Division fought an amazing series of battles along the Chir River in response to the Soviet surprise attacks that surrounded Stalingrad. It has been called one of the finest divisional actions of all time.<br/><br/>Bottom line, a single Panzer division, fighting one day after another (frequently after overnight marches) pretty much destroyed an entire Soviet tank army. And more.<br/><br/>But it's a virtually unknown story, as the disaster of Stalingrad and Manstein's relief effort (our own Wintergewitter game) get all the headlines. It may be hard to imagine, but minus Balck's extraordinary fire-brigade work, Stalingrad would have been much, much worse!<br/><br/>On Christmas Day (a Friday), Balck and his units were called upon once again. They had to stop a Soviet probe deep behind the porous German lines, aimed at knocking out the airfield at Tatsinkaya, which was supporting the Stalingrad Pocket. ATO spotlights Balck's amazing efforts with a new, unpublished and complete game.<br/><br/>With 100 die cut counters, a full color 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; map and just 4 pages of rules, you'll be able to quickly explore this one remarkable exploit during a very &quot;dark December&quot; for the Axis.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players assume control of one of four great clans - Uesugi, Mori, Tokugawa, or Shimazu - and attempt to defeat their opponent to become the Shogun.<br/><br/>Shoudo is a terrain-based strategy game. The board, which consists of 40 cards, is shuffled and laid out in a random 5x8 configuration at the start of each game. Each player controls 3 armies which they may use to &quot;burn&quot; enemy lands and attack enemy armies and castles. The first player to destroy their opponent's Daimyo castle wins the game.<br/><br/>To win, players must engage in combat. When attacking an enemy army or castle, combat is fought over 3 rounds.

        "description": "&quot;Winter War: Finland vs the Soviet Union 1939&quot; is an operational level two player wargame. It covers the Soviet invasion of Finland over the Winter of 1939-40. The Soviets initially expected a quick victory. However, the Finns, under the leadership of Carl Gustav Mannerheim, resisted and outmaneuvered the more ponderous Red Army forces. It was not until Marshal Timoshenko was appointed to lead the campaign, that the Soviets gained the initiative. They captured sufficient territory to bring the war to a negotiated end. The Soviet historical objectives were to seize key geographical areas and inflict sufficient Finnish casualties to force the Finns to negotiate a pro-Soviet Union peace treaty. The Finns were attempting to prevent this or prolong the war to where outside intervention would come to their aid. Each hex on the map represents circa 21 miles. Each turn of play represents ten days. Ground units represent detachments, battalions, regiments, brigades, divisions and corps. Aircraft units represent a number of sorties to accomplish a mission.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

And last but not least, each secret organisation pursues its own agenda of intrigue in the Shadows of Power.<br/><br/>The main gameplay is focussed around gaining a deck of cards, each of them representing regions on the map or powerful characters and then playing those cards to use the resources they provide - to recruit and move adventures, influence organisations and command ships. A major aspect of the game revolves around combining actions to make them more powerful and resolve them without spending too many turns - since every player has the power to dictate the remaining duration of a round!<br/><br/>At the end of each round, conflicts regarding the control of regions are resolved - an elegant majority system is used to determine the victor, but since conflicts are not resolved during the individual player's turns, everyone can react and have a small skirmish become a decisive battle for victory.<br/><br/>In addition, the game features an innovative scoring mechanism that keeps the game free of bookkeeping hassles (all scoring is performed at the end) and also allows weaker players to catch up due to relative scoring systems.<br/><br/>The game features many illustrations on the cards - dozens of characters of Dark Eye lore, organisations and regions.<br/><br/>It is playable with 2-4 players as the basic game and there is a 5-6 player expansion available at launch.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Boss suggests one final card game before you go your separate ways. It's time for... The Split.<br/><br/>Based on a modified version of the classic card game Blackjack, players will try to bluff and outwit each other to claim piles of loot cards. Collect cards and get your total value as close to 21 as possible - closest gets first pick of the stacks. Use your Bonus cards to manipulate your total, but don't play too safe... with one fewer stack on the table than there are players, you're never guaranteed a prize.<br/><br/>Each round sees one player act as the dealer, passing regular playing cards out to all players. Your initial aim is to score as close to 21 as possible without exceeding that number - special one-use Bonus cards can help you get closer to the target. Only players with the highest value scores can claim from the stacks of Loot Cards, containing different items such as gold, gems, valuable paintings and more. More loot is added each round, and the game continues until the Loot Deck is depleted. Each loot type scores in a different way, and the player with the most Loot at the end of the game will win. Play with the Disguise cards for a trickier version of the game, where you can't win without a way to escape!<br/><br/>With various difficulty modes, The Split offers an interactive, easy to learn experience that will appeal to a wide range of players. So, settle in, keep a straight face, and see how much you can walk away from the table with.<br/><br/>",

These advert cards also dictate which parts of your station guests can check out of (generating income) and what kind of tile you can build this round. But beware &ndash; playing the same advert as another station will generate interference, causing Malfunction tiles to crop up on both stations!<br/><br/>When players are done checking out tourists and buying new tiles, rockets packed with new tourists will arrive! In the Arrivals phase, players draft tourists to visit their stations, with the players whose attractions and amenities most align with current trends getting to pick first (which usually means they will also get extra tourists, as arrival numbers are rarely an exact multiple of the player count!) If a player does not have a suitable spot for the type of tourist they wish to draft, the tourist is ejected into space, negatively affecting your station&rsquo;s ratings!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most QUID &ndash; or Quantum Universal Intergalactic Denomination, the accepted currency of all space resorts. QUID is generated not only by checking out tourists, but also competing to be the highest in each of the four &lsquo;Prestige&rsquo; categories &ndash; Thrills, Entertainment, Relaxation and Inspiration!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cego, Zego or Ceco (from lat.caecus = blind) is a traditional German card game, for 3 or 4 players, played primarily in the Black Forest. Hardly a farm house which has no cego deck. The game is played mainly throughout the winter, when there is little work to do in the fields and few daylight hours.<br/><br/>A Cego deck consists of 54 cards: 22 &quot;Truck&quot;, that means trump cards, 16 &quot;Bilder&quot; or picture cards, king, queen, knight and jack in the 4 suits. and 16 &quot;Leere&quot; or empty cards, also in the 4 suits.<br/>The 22 trumps are numbered from 1 to 21, and a single picture card without suit, which would be #22, the highest trump, commonly called &quot;Gsties&quot;, sometimes &quot;Sk&uuml;s&quot; from ital. &quot;scusa&quot; = sorry (for taking the trick).<br/><br/>The game is basically a trick tacking game, you've got to follow suit, if not available you have to trump.<br/><br/>Usually one player will play against the other three, the player following the dealer will have to play if no one bids for the play.<br/><br/>Cards are dealt 11 to each player and 10 face down in the middle (the Cego or blind cards). These 10 cards will go to the highest bidder, depending on his bid either remaining face down or he discards 9 or 10 cards from his hand and takes up the Cego cards. A simple play would be a bid for Cego, discarding 9 cards from your hand, taking up 10 cards, then choosing one additional card for your pile and starting play.<br/><br/>This is the interesting and unusual part of this game. Your decision to bid depends on the cards which you will not have available for the coming game, but you will get to play with mainly unknown cards. Therefore the title &quot;Blind&quot;.<br/><br/>There are a lot of other options, available for every player or only the bidder, for example:<br/>-Solo play: when you have lots of trump in your initial play, no cards are discarded.<br/>-R&auml;uber, rubber: when no one bids, every player on his own, you try to have fewest points.<br/>-Bettel: the bidder tries to get no cards.<br/>-Piccolo: the bidder tries to make exactly one trick.<br/><br/>Scoring is done by counting out your points, only three trumps (Gstiess, 21 and 1) and all the pictures count.<br/>Points and counting method differ, but the bidder always need the majority of points, every 5 points over or under mean an additional factor.<br/><br/>",

The game can be played at different levels from simple counting and matching to problem solving and strategic play. These are mathematical skills which will support your child's learning at school.

        "description": "The Great Pond is a world of myths, mystery, political intrigue and turmoil, ageless myths and budding legends, and of course, the magically-inclined fish called whiskers! In the Whiskers universe, species of koi and catfish experienced rapid evolution many centuries ago after a world-changing magic spell was cast to return life to the world. At that time, a global catastrophe had nearly wiped away nearly all the living things in the world, but one very old wizard still lived. That wizard sacrificed himself to bring life back to the barren world, creating the whiskers and imbuing them with some of his magical powers in the process. After generations of building, the whiskers have blossomed into several different cultures, societies, and nations.<br/><br/>To begin, each player becomes an adventuring fish-person, known as a Whisker, living in the world of The Great Pond. Players represent themselves with one of several CHAMPIONS, each representing powerful, famous, infamous, or otherwise well-known whiskers of the pond.  Whiskers themselves are huge fans of the game Last Fish! and often play to settle disputes, place bets, win glory, or otherwise pass the time. The game itself is based around some of the spells, skills, items, and locations that might be encountered during one&rsquo;s travels through The Great Pond.<br/><br/>The game uses two main decks, the Draw Deck and the Encounter Deck. The cards in the Encounter Deck represent random events that a CHAMPION might face when adventuring in the world of The Great Pond. They have the unique ability to affect a myriad of players all at once, and their effects are not always good. ENCOUNTER cards include events like monster attacks, finding items, exploring locations, etc. that can drastically alter the game at any moment.<br/><br/>Each CHAMPION, all of whom start with 3 HEARTS (health points &ndash; represented by 3 HEART cards), draw from both decks at the beginning of their turns. To win, you have to reduce the HP of all other CHAMPIONS to 0.<br/><br/>To decide who goes first, play rock-paper-scissors (or whatever else you can think of)! The winner chooses their CHAMPION card first, and then the next player, and so on. Each player sets (3) HEART cards next to their CHAMPION then draws (5) cards from the Draw Deck.<br/> If either the Draw Deck or the Encounter Deck run out of cards then shuffle and flip the respective Discard Pile face down and proceed using that as the new deck to draw from. Any card mentioning the Discard Pile is referring specifically to the Draw Deck&rsquo;s Discard Pile.<br/> Note: Players cannot play ATTACK or CURSE cards on their first turn (ie: on the first player's first turn, second player's first turn, etc.).<br/><br/>Every turn, each player faces a number of choices available to them. Turns follow a clear order for actions, which must be obeyed at all times and is outlined below:<br/><br/>1) DRAW a card from the Draw Deck and add it to your hand, then&hellip;<br/><br/>2) DISCOVER a card from the Encounter Deck and follow its effect, then set it face up in the Encounter Discard Pile. Next&hellip;<br/><br/>3) The CURRENT PLAYER can choose 1 of 2 main actions per turn (after they are done following the effect of the ENCOUNTER card they drew), they can either:<br/>3a) DRAW until their hand has 5 cards in it; if they already have 5 or more cards, they DRAW (1). After drawing, they end their turn immediately OR&hellip;<br/>3b) Do any or all of the following actions in whatever order they prefer:<br/>-Use as many SPELLS as they want&hellip;<br/>-Use as many INSTANTS they want&hellip;<br/>-Play one CURSE card&hellip;<br/>-Choose between equipping an ITEM card to their CHAMPION OR playing an ATTACK card targeting an opposing player.<br/><br/>4) END YOUR TURN. Notify the other players that your turn is over. Then, the turn order moves clockwise, so next is the player to the left of the last.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "American  Civil War from Strategy and Tactics issue 310 (Decision Games) reimplements the wargame by the same name from 1974. Strategic treatment of the American Civil War.<br/>The American Civil War was by far the most destructive conflict in US history. This game gives players a chance to change the outcome. The Confederate player must maintain a viable economic and political core, while the Union player attempts to divide and conquer the southern states. Victory is checked every turn: Union progress can have political consequences or possibly end the game if either player fails to achieve expectations.<br/>During each quarterly turns, players recruit additional forces, then conduct a pair of impulses. During each impulse, each player moves forces and fight battles. Movement rates are high, but enemy forces can react by retreating, blocking further movement, or counterattacking. Battles are decided by a combination of good leaders and relative strength. The Confederacy starts with a decided advantage in leadership. Union leaders appear only after fighting battles: the Union player may have to lose a few battles to get the leaders needed to win the war.<br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The components for this game consist of 18 plastic hex tiles in each of 5 colors - each player gets 16 blank tiles, one King, and one Warrior.  In the initial phase of the game, players place these tiles on the table (there is no board) in one connected group, but are not allowed to connect more than 5 of their color together.  Once all tiles are placed, a turn generally consists of exchanging the positions of any two tiles.  The object is to unify all of one's own tiles into the same country (connected group).  The King protects the tiles in its group (another player can only remove one by swapping it with his or her own King), but can only be moved once for free - after that a penalty must be paid.  The Warrior offers additional movement abilities.<br/><br/>The game was originally published in 1975 under the name Kingdoms.  The version shown, titled The Game of Ancient Kingdoms, was published in 1976.  The rules are nearly identical, with the later version adding the penalty rule for moving the King and a rule for scoring draw games.<br/><br/>",

Cards are visible to all, who may talk and influence other players' actions. Alliances may be made, or broken. Each turn, a Lady may: (1) select an event or a necklace from the Store; (2) attend Charm School to gain Charm; (3) gift a necklace to another Lady to earn Favor; (4) teach another Lady Charm in return for a necklace; (5) use Favor to prevent another Lady from acting.<br/><br/>Events are opportunities that may be acquired in lieu of selecting a necklace and they provide special powers, like the ability to recover Discarded necklaces or to Woo a Suitor twice, acquiring him as a husband.<br/><br/>Ladies gift necklaces to others to earn Favor, which is used, along with Charm, to Woo a Suitor, of which there are four. Once a Suitor has been Wooed twice, a Lady acquires him as a husband and if she has also achieved her Ambition, she earns bonus points and ends the game. Ambitions are goals, like acquiring the most necklaces, or gaining the most Favor.<br/><br/>Points are earned for: achieving an Ambition, ending the game, capturing a husband, possessing Charm, and for owning necklaces--some of which are especially valuable! The Advanced variation, also included, adds Suitor Traits, which vary Suitors' point values and which add special abilities.<br/><br/>Throughout, each player gabs and gifts their way to success, wooing Lords and giving necklaces to each other, attempting to attain An Ideal Necklace and An Ideal Husband as each Lady quests for An Ideal Victorian Life.<br/><br/>",

After everyone have seen the Topic or Hints, players will take turns describing the Topic (or what CopyCats think may be close to the Topic) using a word or phrase. The Humans will have to give good descriptions to prove their allegiance, but vague enough as to not give CopyCats too much information. The CopyCats will have to give clever descriptions by combining the Hints with what they've heard in order to blend in with the Humans and prevent their elimination.<br/><br/>The Humans must eliminate the CopyCats before 2 rounds to win, or else the CopyCats win!<br/><br/>Things can get pretty heated, and there is limitless potential for creativity in how to strategize.<br/><br/>",

Turns represent two to three days each; the games cover the campaign from the initial landing to the breakout. Each game comes with one map covering a portion of the battlefield at 2.5 miles per hex. The playing pieces represent the regiments and special battalions taking part, plus the multitude of fire support available to them.<br/><br/>The series uses the Fire &amp; Movement system rules, with exclusive rules for each folio. The folios can be combined to display the entire American or British Commonwealth sectors, or into a single giant game on the entire campaign.<br/><br/>This game covers two landings, the British on Gold Beach and the Canadians on Juno. They face the lightest opposition but must press well forward to secure the core of the Allied lodgment: the town of Bayeux and the road from there to Caen. The German player has little to work with at first, but can expect powerful reinforcements, including the only Panzer division near the landing beaches. As the campaign progresses, both sides will use this area to secure or expose the flanks of the battles on either side.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>17&quot;x22&quot; terrain map<br/>100 die-cut counters<br/>one Eight page system rule booklet<br/>one exclusive scenario rules<br/>10x13 ziplock<br/>5x3 ziplock<br/><br/>Players: 1-3<br/>Ages: 14+<br/>Hex Scale: 2.5 miles<br/>Play Time: 1-2 hours<br/>Complexity: Low-Med<br/>Solitaire Ability: Medium<br/><br/>",

Instead of an easy victory, the Japanese were handed their first defeat when two of the attacking destroyers were sunk with all hands lost. The surprising victory immortalized this small coral atoll as the Alamo of the Pacific.<br/><br/>In this solitaire game, you as the American player must hold  out for as long as possible against the overwhelming Japanese force arrayed against you. Victory Points are gained by the number of Invasion Attempt Counters revealed and enemy ships placed Out of Action.  While it is unlikely you will be able to defeat the invasion force in full, you might be able to change the outcome of the Pacific War by making the invasion of Wake Island a very costly and tragic victory for the Japanese.<br/><br/>",

Who will be first to find the trail of the animal they are looking for?<br/><br/>In Yunka, using your map, you have to find as many footprints as you can in the expanding and sometimes changing terrain you have built together. The first to find the 3rd footprint of an animal (or the 6th footprint in the easier game mode), or the one with the most animal footprints when you run out of fresh tiles wins.<br/><br/>You can find a footprint when the terrain (that is the jungle you have built together) has a combination of lake tiles and cliff tiles that match those drawn on your map. So, your goal is to somehow build a combination of tiles in the jungle as described or notice when someone else does.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Representing the historic battle of Cannae, this war game is played between the Roman and Carthaginian forces led by Hannibal. It attempts to recreate this famous battle which is arguably Hannibal's greatest victory.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the forces is eliminated or a set period of time passes (40 turns). With over 1000 pawns, each representing 30 cavalry or 80 men, it attempts to provide a clear sense of the carnage on the battlefield. The historic battle faced an estimated 50,000 romans against 40,000 Carthaginians.<br/><br/>The game map is scaled at 1 square for each 25 meters, and each turn of the game equals 15 minutes of battle. During each turn the romans go first, then the Carthaginians, and the turns are broken into phases: movement, defensive placement, offensive placement, confrontation, recovery.<br/><br/>Units are represented by two values, strength and movement.  Movement indicates the number of spaces that a unit can advance each turn if not engaged in combat. Strength is used in battle to determine combat resolution, in combination with die rolls.<br/><br/>",

It also has counters with no ratings.  In some ways, it&rsquo;s like cardboard miniatures &hellip; with fewer rules. The game system highlights the firepower of the British Martini Henry rifle, the value of a solid defensive position, and the greatly superior numbers of the three Zulu amabutho that gave them something like forty-to-one numerical superiority.<br/><br/>Even so, each British counter represents one man, and we have identified each with his name and unit. Zulu combat counters represent about 25-30 men, but that usage is not literal, given the unusual system. The map scale is 1&rdquo; = 4 yards. The mechanics cover such facets of the engagement as Zulu fire from the Oskarberg terraces, the Hospital and its patients, the pros and cons of setting fire to that building, even possible heroics by the very men who earned Victoria Crosses for their actions during the battle.<br/><br/>The game also includes scenarios on  Isandlwana &amp; Kambula.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Famous bridge personality Ely Culbertson's attempt to create an equally popular 2-person game. Jo-Jotte is named after Josephine Culbertson his first wife and distinguished partner. Unfortunately the game flopped and the couple divorced a year later. The game is basically Belote (i.e. 2 player Klabberjass, Bela) with the addition of Notrump, a Nullo bid, Slam bid and also bridge-like scoring above and below the line.<br/><br/>THE DEAL: Using a deck of 32 cards (A,K,Q,J,10,9,8,7 in each suit) six cards are dealt to each player. The next (13th) card is turned face up.<br/><br/>THE BIDDING: First, the non-dealer may accept the turned card as trump, or pass; if he passes, then the dealer may accept the turned up trump or pass. if both pass, the non-dealer may name any other trump suit (or notrump) or pass. If he passes again, the dealer has the same choice. A trump suit once named may be overcalled by a notrump contract, but not by another suit. Any contract may be doubled, and any double may be re-doubled.<br/><br/>THE DRAW: When the trump suit (or notrump) has been selected and doubled or passed, the dealer deals three more cards to each player and turns the bottom cared of the deck face up. The defender (player who did not select the final contract) must then (a) announce his intention to play a Nullo contract; or (b) declare his honor-meld, if any, against declarer's contract; or (c) pass. Declarer must then (a) bid a Slam or (b) pass. In either case, Dealer declares his honor-meld, if any. A slam bid will void any Nullo contact. Honor-melds are first declared by their point value; and the winning meld (see table) is shown and then scored. If played at the turned trump, that card may be taken in exchange for the seven of trumps.<br/><br/>THE PLAY: Defender leads first; he may lead any card. The other player must follow suit, if able; if she cannot follow suit, she must trump, if able. A trump led must be won, if possible. After the first trick, the winner of a trick leads to the next. In the trump suit, if any, the cards rank J,9,A,10,K,Q,8,7.  In any other suit the cards rank A,10,K,Q,J, 9,8,7. A Nullo contract is always played without a trump suit.<br/><br/>THE SCORING: Any winning meld is scored to the holder's credit in his honor column (above the line). Each player adds his trick score and honor score (including bonuses if any). Each player adds his trick score and honor score. If declarer has the higher total, he scores his trick score toward game (below the line) while the defender scores his trick score above the line. If the defender has the higher total, he adds declarer's trick score to his own, and scores the total below the line. On any doubled contract, the player with the higher total receives the combined trick scores, at twice their value, below the line. A game ends when a player scores 80 points or more below the line. A rubber ends when one player has won two games. When declarer and defender have the same total; or when a Nullo contract is played, the combined trick score is held aside and awarded above the line to the player who ahs the  higher total score on the succeeding hand.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         CARD POINTS<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Jack of Trumps<br/><br/>         20<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Nine of trumps<br/><br/>         15<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any ace<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any Ten<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any King<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Any Queen<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Last Trick*<br/><br/>         10<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Jo-Jotte**<br/><br/>         20<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Except at Nullos<br/><br/><br/><br/>        Jo-Jotte is K and Q of trump suit, if any. It is scored as part of the trick score, but only if announced as follows: the holder must play the King before he plays the Queen. On playing the King he announced &quot;Jo&quot;. Later when playing the Queen she announces  &quot;Jotte&quot;.  Without these announcement it does not score.  It does not matter if the card wins the tricks in which these cards are played. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>RUBBER BONUS 300<br/>To be the first player who wins two games of 80 points each<br/><br/>SLAM BONUSES (for winning every trick)<br/>If Bid   500<br/><br/>If not Bid| 100<br/><br/>If a player bids Slam and loses a trick, he has lost the hand, even though his actual total score is greater than the defender's. In this case the Defender scores the combined trick score, but above the line (not toward game).<br/><br/>HONOR MELDS<br/><br/>Only the player with the higher ranking meld in each category may score it.

        "description": "France, 1630. The Royal Musketeers are personal guards of King Louis XIII, defending the King against the dubious plots of Cardinal Richelieu. Athos, Porthos, Aramis, d'Artagnan, Rochefort, and MiLady DiWinter move around Paris, fighting duels and completing missions to earn the favor of the King and Cardinal. Both characters and players earn Favors throughout the game and bonus points are scored at the end when players reveal their true allegiances. The winner is the player who's earned the most Favor!<br/><br/>All For One is a pickup/deliver game for 3-5 players. Players are not tied to any specific character, rather each turn you choose which character to activate and then take actions with that character. Each player is secretly assigned one of the characters whose score will be added to their own at the end of the game. Your 'secret identity' helps drive decisions during the game, but in order to win you'll have to utilize all of the characters.<br/><br/>The board is an interconnected web of streets, some of which are patrolled by Cardinal's Guards. The guards serve to hinder the musketeers' progress. There are 6 named locations where the characters begin the game, and the other 18 locations are home to 1 plot token each. 2 of the tokens are horses, which can be ridden by the characters. The rest are used to complete missions.<br/><br/>The missions are printed on Mission Cards, which detail which character must complete the mission, which Plot Tokens are necessary to complete the mission, and the location at which the mission must be completed. Completing these missions involves collecting various Plot Tokens from around the board, and bringing them to specific places. Some missions involve getting 2 of the characters to a specific place at the same time, and some missions involve a duel between two characters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Adapted from the package text:<br/><br/>Springline: simple to learn, easy to lose. Springline is a wild, fast moving and unpredictable game of skill and tactics for two, in which moves lead to chain reactions, prisoners return to the game and pieces bounce off the edge of the board.<br/><br/>The board is a hexagonal grid with five spaces along each edge, and is positioned between the players with a corner pointing toward each player. The corner spaces are return pads with the three closest pads belonging to their respective players. There are eight pieces for each player that begin on the three closest return pads, midway between them along the near edges, and two spaces forward of each of the central three pieces. Moves are one space in a straight line or in a hexagonal orbit around any other piece. Three (or more) pieces in a line form a Springline, and either end(s) must discharge before the end of a turn. Discharged pieces travel in a series of straight unobstructed lines (bouncing off the edges of the board as necessary) as far as the player wants. Capture is by replacement, and prisoners are immediately exchanged upon capture. Exchanged prisoners must be re-entered onto one of a player's own vacant return pads at the earliest opportunity. Failure to be able to do so (because they are occupied) loses the game. Alternatively, if a player holds, even for a moment, three opposing prisoners, this wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the game's website: The first player to the 100-point target wins.  Each round all players get 7 new letter cards. A die is rolled to determine the length of the word that will score points in that round. (Ex. If a 4 is rolled, only 4-letter words score points that round.) Roll a bull&rsquo;s-eye, and the roller gets to determine that round&rsquo;s word length.<br/><br/>Each letter card has a value attached to it. Some special letter cards have a range of values (Ex. 0 - 2) where a player gets to choose the value (0, 1 or 2) if that card can be used in a word. Playing at the same time, using their own cards, players have one minute to make a word of the determined length for that round.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players advance their tokens by the number of points in the word they made, starting with the player who rolled the die. Choose carefully. Your highest-scoring word isn&rsquo;t always your best choice. There are consequence targets on the board (red - always beneficial; black - take a chance) that can help you get to the final goal fastest.  Land on a target - take the consequence.  Making the best use of these targets is the key to winning.<br/><br/>",

We carefully picked out a subset of the full game that shows off Crossfire's feel and mechanisms in a small, elegant package. The demo box takes you through a shorter, tighter version of the &quot;Caught in the Crossfire&quot; mission included in the full game &mdash; it's the quickest way for new players to learn how to play.<br/><br/>Catalyst Game Labs is giving the Shadowrun: Crossfire - Demo Box to select gamers at Gen Con 2013 in mid-August.<br/><br/><br/>The shadows of the Sixth World have every kind of danger you can imagine: ultra-violent gangers, flesh-eating ghouls, mages that summon spirits from toxic waste, backstabbing corporate raiders, hard-nosed police officers, and even dragons. You don't have much &mdash; mainly your guts, your wits, and your friends &mdash; but maybe that's enough. Between you and your teammates, you can sling spells, hack the Matrix, talk a tiger out of his stripes, and bring down a charging ork from a hundred yards away. Will that be enough to face down the worst the mean streets can throw at you? You're about to find out.<br/><br/>Shadowrun: Crossfire is a cooperative deck-building card game for two to four players set in the gritty, cyberpunk fantasy world of Shadowrun. Play a shadowrunner team and take on tough jobs such as protecting a client who's marked for death, shooting your way out of downtown when a run goes sour, or facing down a dragon. In each game you'll improve your deck with a mix of strategies, while earning Karma to give your character cyber upgrades, physical augmentations, magical initiations, weapons training and Edge.<br/><br/>Shadowrun: Crossfire - Demo Box includes two obstacle decks, a black market deck, a crossfire event deck, a mission sheet, 4 role cards, and 2 product information cards.<br/><br/>Differences from Shadowrun: Crossfire<br/><br/>- The crossfire card deck &amp; obstacle decks are smaller than the full game<br/><br/>- The Demo box contains only 1 scenario (so the only way to play this version) and it is not included in the main Shadowrun: Crossfire game<br/><br/>- There are only four character cards (1 of which is the troll mage card which is not found in the base set, but was reprinted in Character Expansion Pack 1)<br/><br/>- The Demo box does not contain any tokens, and requires the players to use something of their own (coins etc.)<br/><br/>- The rulebook is shorter and does not contain all the rules listed in the base game, but contains information specific to the Demo box<br/><br/>",

Learn to manage a dojo in ten minutes then spend a lifetime mastering the martial way. Adapt your mat position and craft a deck of attack and defense skills to combat your opponent. Balancing tactics and strategy, play the player across the tables as much as the dojos.<br/><br/>Players balance the use of Stamina and Experience Points to build a deck of attack and defense cards from their dojo of skills in order to adapt to an opponent's evolving strategy. Holds create an opening for an attack and often work in combination with other moves. Stuns break an opponent's rhythm leaving her without enough stamina to pull of offensive combos. Takedowns are advanced moves that put the opponent on the mat defenseless.<br/><br/>The linear mat component allows players to control distance to avoid damage and get in range to strike their opponent providing an additional level of tactics and strategy.<br/><br/>Lasting about 30 minutes, no two fights are ever the same. With each new bout, new strategies emerge<br/><br/>",

Players win point by accurately predicting how others will vote on controversial subjects. Get ready to check your privilege with questions like, &ldquo;Is it OK to punch a Nazi?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pineapple on pizza?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is climate change an urgent priority?&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple. Each player begins with a YES and a NO card. The first player draws a card from the QUESTIONS deck and reads it out loud. All other players vote silently on the question by placing the corresponding answer card face down on the table. The first player now guesses if the majority voted yes, no or if there was a tie (if mathematically possible). If they guessed correctly, they keep the question card as a point. The turn moves clockwise to the next player. First to 5 points wins.<br/><br/>PRIVILEGE cards add a strategic element to the game. Use them to steal points, steal a turn, challenge someone to a staring contest or force someone to give you a compliment.<br/><br/>Triggers forges an environment of fun and open exchange of ideas. Players often find common ground in unlikely places and gain new perspectives on familiar topics.<br/><br/>",

Play the world countries, build renewable power plants to reduce fossil-based CO2. Carbon neutralizes countries before 5 climate disasters or 10 years ends the game. A game plays around 90-120 minutes. Are you ready to save Terra?<br/><br/>Terraternity = Terra + eternity<br/>Terra is the Latin word for earth, and eternity means the infinite time that never ends. We created Terraternity to raise awareness about the efforts needed to heal our planet and preserve it for future generations.<br/>Every day we all place more CO2 on our planet without effort living our lives. In Terraternity, we created a game mechanic placing CO2 cubes on a Terra Globe. This is easy and fun, and when the game progressed, it creates challenges, tension, and hopefully awareness.<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>Your goal is to develop renewable power plants in various countries to make them carbon neutral. You will first need to &lsquo;activate&rsquo; a country, which lets you build renewable power plants within it but adding its CO2 output - literally! - to the Terraternity globe. You&rsquo;ll need to make sure this globe stays balanced - too many CO2 cubes, and you risk a climate disaster - while also balancing that country&rsquo;s CO2 footprint. Successfully balance enough countries before time runs out or disaster strikes, and you win!<br/>Game Modes<br/>You can play Terraternity in two different game modes:<br/><br/>Competitive Game<br/>You are on your own to turn five countries carbon neutral before any other player. Keep your hand and strategy secret while you place victory points on your player board and collect green cubes from carbon neutralized countries.<br/><br/>Cooperative Game<br/>You work together with all players to turn eight countries carbon neutral.<br/>Everybody plays with an open hand &ndash; sharing strategies is highly recommended as you all play against the board and win or lose together! <br/>Progress is tracked on the CO2 scale on the Game board.<br/><br/>Solo Mode<br/>In the solo mode you play against the board and try to achieve and master the different stages. Are you able to master the MSP Stage - they heigst possible challenge which makes you the Most Sustainable Player?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blade &amp; Bow is a moderately complex game depicting combat between ancient armies with the goal of showing the evolution of infantry combat from the adoption of the Greek hoplite formation through the Roman maniple and cohort. Two players take control of historical armies to see how well they might fare as compared to their historical counterparts. In what will hopefully be the first in a series of volumes covering this evolution, four battles are included: Marathon (490 BCE), Thermopylae (480 BCE), Plataea (479 BCE), and Mycale (479 BCE). Each battle takes two to three hours to complete.<br/><br/>The game system is a departure from other ancient combat games in several key ways:<br/><br/>The game uses a square grid, rather than hexes, to regulate movement. This provides eight vectors of advance (rather than six) and allows for more realistic linear movement and combat.<br/><br/>The game uses a unique card-based activation system that provides armies with better leadership to be more flexible with regards to their actions on the battlefield. Unlike traditional &quot;IGO-UGO&quot; activations, formations may activate multiple times during their turn to provide more historically accurate outcomes.<br/><br/>The game simulates hoplite formations in a manner allowing players to allocate where their forces' strength lays, unknown to their oppoenent until combat units actually engage. This allows a player to decide where to allocate their strengths, rather than relaying upon the values printed on a combat unit. Additionally, these denser units take damage differently, allowing them to be ground down while pressing forward in a manner that does not require record keeping.<br/><br/>Finally, the deck of cards allows for special effects that can help a side turn the tide of a battle in their favor or stave off disaster at the last moment.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>Can you lead the allied Greek forces to victory over the invading Persians? Now you can find out with Blade &amp; Bow!<br/><br/>",

The game consists of four phases, each of which is divided into 22 rounds. During rounds, players perform certain actions. The first and second phase of the game reflect the regular phase of the war. The third and fourth phases  are constructed differently, because they represent a specific phase of guerrilla warfare.<br/><br/>The game uses the point to point system, six-sided dice and a deck of battle cards. The game map represents Cape Colony, Natal, Orange Free State and Republic of Transval. Each game phase corresponds to 3-9 months of real time. Military units (infantry, cavalry, artillery, tribals, machine guns, trains) are represented by abstract battle cards.<br/>During the game the players will carry out a series of operations (move, fight, events, special actions) using random actions (1 to 3 on the turn of the game).<br/>The introduced game events directly relate to historical events, directing the moves of players during the game.<br/><br/>Battle cards are used to resolve combat in situations when contact between commanders of military formations is established. In &quot;The Second Boer War 1899 - 1902&quot; the military units involved in the combat are presented on cards. Depending on the phase of the game or the commander involved the combat may be a battle or a skirmish.<br/>During the battle, players use six cards, although this number may be increased with the rules on the Boer trenches or British garrisons. Individual characteristics of commanders are also important.<br/>The British player can choose the cards that he intends to use in battle, but the Boer player draws them randomly &ndash; this describes the voluntary nature of the Boer army.<br/>The battlefield is divided into three sections - the right wing, the left wing and the center.<br/>The Defender begins the battle and places one card on each section. Then the attacker puts two cards for each section and performs troop morale checks. If the check fails, the card does not participate in the battle.<br/>Defender reveals the cards and adds one to each section, testing their morale. If players have a surplus of cards, they can use them on the sections of the battlefield, where there are less than two cards.<br/>Players compare their strength for each section. The player who achieved 2 or 3 successes, wins the battle. The opponent suffers losses - British cards goes into the reinforcements pool, and the Boer commandos cards are eliminated.<br/><br/>A skirmish is a smaller combat &ndash; the card limit is 3, but can be increased by the individual characteristics of the commander, the Boer fortifications or British garrisons. The British player can choose the cards he will use in a skirmish. The Boer player can choose one card, but he must randomly draw the other.<br/>The Defender places one card on each section of the battlefield. Then the Attacker does the same thing. For each card, he performs morale checks &ndash; a negative result means that the unit is not taking part in the skirmish, and can be replaced with a card from the surplus, if the player has it.<br/>Both players add the &ldquo;Strength&rdquo; value of their cards. The winner of the skirmish is the player, who achieved a higher score. If the loser is the Defender, he must vacate the occupied area.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBloody veld: Battle of Magersfontein, 11 December, 1899 (a tactical wargame).Game scale:<br/>1 hex = 500 yd (457 m)<br/>1 game turn = 45 minutes<br/>1 counter = British infantry half battalion or part of Boer commando/cavalry regiment/artillery battery (Boer army: 1 gun).<br/><br/>Game description<br/>The game uses the standard hex-and-counter system, and ten-sided dice. Each hex represents 500 yards or 457 metres, each game turn corresponds to 45 minutes of real time.<br/>British infantry is represented by half battalions, cavalry by regiments, artillery by batteries. One counters represents a part of a commando or one gun.<br/><br/>Each game turn is divided into phases:<br/>1) Command phase &ndash; players use their Commanders-in-Chief and dispatch riders to give orders to subordinate commanders,<br/>2) Activation phase &ndash; after determining the initiative, players, using the Activation Markers, choose the brigade to activate. Activated units, move, fire, commence melee combat (only British units) and reorganize units and recover morale. The opponent can react by firing or counterattacking (only British units),<br/>3) Reorganization phase &ndash; players reorganize broken units.<br/>The principle of the game is based on an order system, which is associated with an action vector. The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the brigade commander manages to change it by himself. The order must be associated with a target hex (i.e attack hex, defend hex). The possible orders are: ATTACK or DEFEND.<br/><br/>The game tries to present the diversity of combatants tactics mainly through unit formations. <br/>British units may perform weapon attacks and melee attacks. Boer units can only fire, but they start the game masked, moreover, some of them can benefit from the trenches. It makes it difficult for the British player who cannot shoot at masked units from a larger distance. The fieldworks allow the Boers to minimize their losses.<br/><br/>The game treats the concept of zone of control differently from other games &ndash; it gives up the obligation to stop moving the unit in the enemy ZOC. The ZOC is a phenomenon that allows to fire or initiate close combat, and it is dependent on the units formation and the range of its firearms.<br/>Unit movement doesn&rsquo;t differ from other hex-and-counter systems.<br/><br/>Fire combat takes into account the distance to the target, the firing unit morale and terrain on which the target is currently placed. Artillery performs its fire in the same way, using another fire combat chart. Distinct units are the Boer Pom-Pom automatic guns. These cannons move like artillery, but actually perform their fire according to the infantry fire chart. Each shot, however, means performing two checks and summing the results of fire. The result of fire combat can be the loss of morale, combat efficiency level or routing. Additionally also withdrawal.<br/><br/>Melee combat is also based on the unit&rsquo;s morale, strength, formation, also the terrain. The effects of melee combat are almost the same as the effects of fire combat. The exception being the possibility of forcing the enemy to flee. Cavalry combat also includes the unit&rsquo;s momentum. Cavalry may react by counter-charging.<br/>The loss of unit&rsquo;s morale endurance during the game is marked with special markers.<br/><br/>",

How hard can that be? <br/>Well, you have 1, 2, or 3 opponents with their sets of pieces trying to stop you, and take you out of the game. <br/>Your Sphere has no defense and at the center of the board there's a Red Zone where everything changes&hellip;.<br/><br/>Geometry Strategy is a strategic and tactic board game where even the element of luck is tactics. <br/>A brand new classic game, with a Red Zone.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>     Each player aims to be the first to place their Sphere on the Bullseye to win the game. <br/>     The Sphere must be protected from other players who will try to take it out and thereby put you out of the game. At the same time you must stop the other players from reaching the Bullseye with their Spheres.<br/>     For defence as well as offense, each player has 9 pieces besides the Sphere to strategically and tactically play with as the game starts. All pieces have different rankings in challenges between them; though they all are able to capture the opponents&rsquo; Spheres.<br/>     If you think this doesn't sound hard enough, add a Red Zone where any player can enter and change the conditions of the game. Completely. Now, either you get blind sided by these changes every time, or you prepare yourself and play your game tactically. <br/>     Before the game starts, all players place their pieces on their quarter of the board. The Sphere and the Helix, your trump piece, have to start at your base line but the other pieces can be placed on squares of your choice. A Red Zone card is flipped to get the conditions for the Challenges; attacks, by showing the present rankings for the pieces.<br/>     Players take turns in a clockwise order. First player starts by moving one optional piece of their own color; one or two steps in any available direction. It is then the next player&rsquo;s turn, and the game is on. Is your strategy to move your Sphere toward the Bullseye as soon as possible? Or to use your pieces to stop the other players to get there and then run for the goal in the end? <br/>     When two players&rsquo; pieces are within reach of each other it can lead to a Challenge, or attack, where a player can lose a piece. The piece with the highest ranking according to the present Red Zone condition wins the Challenge and takes the losing piece out of the game. <br/>     The players can choose to enter the Red Zone and change the conditions for the challenges. <br/>     As soon as a player enters the Red Zone, a new Red Zone card is flipped and the conditions of the challenges can be changed with new ranking orders for the pieces! It can be a good thing for one or more players, but it can also mean any advantage you&rsquo;ve enjoyed is stripped away.<br/>     If a player&rsquo;s Sphere is challenged, game is over for him/her.<br/>     Although, if you think you&rsquo;re losing many pieces, as long as you have your Sphere you can still win the game.<br/>     First player to place his/her Sphere at the Bullseye is the winner!<br/><br/><br/>",

Square tiles are place in 2&times;2 plots that are arranged on a 4&times;4 grid (except for one pair of opposite corners that start with just 3 tiles). The Builder tries to build up two-story &quot;houses&quot; (2&times;2&times;2), while the Destroyer tries completely demolish buildings in order to create empty plots (2&times;2&times;0). On each turn, the players select from a menu of five tile placement/removal options:<br/><br/>     1-1-1-1-1 (one at each of five different plots) Note: If and only if each player has claimed six plots, meaning only four plots remain unclaimed, this option becomes 1-1-1-1.<br/>     2-1-1 (two at one plot; one at each of two others)<br/>     2-2 (two at each of two plots)<br/>     3-1 (three at one plot; one at another)<br/>     4 (four at one plot)<br/><br/><br/>However, after each player has taken one turn, only three are available on any turn, because a player cannot pick a set that has been selected in the previous two turns. Once a plot is completely built or torn down, it is claimed by a player.  The first player to claim one of the following wins the game:<br/><br/>     four plots in a row (orthogonally or diagonally)<br/>     four plots in a 2&times;2 square<br/>     four more plots than his opponent<br/>     a total of seven plots<br/><br/><br/>",

If this is done correctly, you are awarded with cards from a deck of 'Fate Cards' that contain spells to help yourself progress, curses to make it harder for your opponents, and separate elements to a quest... you need these in order to win.<br/><br/>The quest elements are made up of 'WHO', 'WHAT', and 'WHERE' - once you've collected a sequence, and successfully described/guessed enough combinations of Creature, Weapon, and Armour - you enter into the victory round.<br/><br/>VICTORY ROUND:<br/>Embark upon a quickfire guessing round against a chosen opponent in order to revisit the previous creature, weapon and armour cards from the game. A third player describes this time, but can only use one word to do so - so make sure you're paying attention to everyone's description rounds throughout the game, as it may come in handy!<br/><br/>If you are the one attempting victory and get more correct quickfire guesses than your defending opponent, you have successfully Cast your Quest, and won the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Cribbage - The Board Game&rdquo; is a simple, fast game for anyone who enjoys playing the traditional cribbage card game. Unlike the traditional card game, the board game can only be played with two teams and therefore cannot be played by three players. Fortunately (and uniquely) this cribbage game can be played very well with six players forming two teams of three. Each team alternates play by placing a card on the board from their dealt hand. The board is a five by five grid with a face down card in the center revealed only after all cards are played. At the end of each round one team will score the cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; that form the &ldquo;rows&rdquo; while the other team scores the cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; that form the &ldquo;columns&rdquo;.  Every card placed will become a card in one of your cribbage &ldquo;hands&rdquo; on the board but will also be a card in one of your opponents &ldquo;hands&rdquo;. The trick therefore is to strategically place cards in such a way to help yourself but hinder your opponent. The board also has card values printed on some spots for instant scoring. Placing a queen on a spot on the board with a queen printed on it will score an instant two points - just as matching a pair during regular play would in a traditional cribbage game. Placing a five on the same queen spot would similarly score an instant two points for the fifteen. Final scoring is done after all spaces are filled using the same procedure one uses for a traditional cribbage hand. First team to 121 wins. If you like to play cribbage, especially with a group, this is a fun twist on one of the world&rsquo;s oldest card games.<br/><br/>",

Admiral Erich Raeder called this ambitious program Plan Z, and looked to complete it sometime in 1948. When war actually broke out in 1939, none of these ships had been completed or even started.<br/><br/>Plan Z is a massive expansion set for Second World War at Sea, kicking off a new alternative history setting we&rsquo;re calling The Long War. It features the ships and planes of Plan Z, pitting them against the Royal Navy and the additional ships and planes of its own building plans.<br/><br/>There are 510 brand-new die-cut (and silky-smooth) pieces. The huge H-class battleships are here, M-class cruisers, P-class battle cruisers and much more.<br/><br/>There are also over thirty new scenarios based on the battles that might have been waged in the North Atlantic in this alternate world. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Bismarck, Arctic Convoy and Sea of Iron to enjoy all of the scenarios. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Possibly translated as All Forward on the Eastern Front, this game covers the entirety of World War 1 in the East in 10 turns / about three hours. It is the companion game to the designer's take on the Western Front in WW1, All Quiet on the Western Front. The card backs in both games say Storm Over Europe, and the two games can be combined to play out the whole of WW1 in Europe.<br/><br/>A few powerful German armies face a ponderous Russian juggernaut, while their Austro-Hungarian allies are threatened on all sides by Italians, Serbs, and Rumanians. The game is on the high strategic scale with corps and army units fighting a cross a map running from Frankfurt to Moscow, from Riga to the Dardanelles. Each turn is six months, with ten turns covering the entire war.<br/><br/>The game system is a distant derivation of the &quot;area-impulse&quot; mechanic created in Storm over Arnhem. Units are activated by group in a single area, and may generally move or attack but not both before becoming &quot;spent&quot;. Spent units are more vulnerable to attack. Storm Over Europe uses a card-driven system for activation, with each side getting varying amounts of cards each turn. The cards generally allow special moves or combinations that break the standard rules of the game, or provide events that shape the strategic outlook.<br/><br/>Players choose their hand each turn from a pool of sixteen Operations cards. Special Strategic cards are added to the pool once a turn from the third turn on; these bring new countries into the war, allow special tactics like poison gas, or provide game-turning events like the Russian Revolution.<br/><br/>The rules are only seven pages, and the game is simple and fast enough to play in a short evening.<br/><br/>",

Plus a Grand Campaign game that covers the entire campaign for the Golan.<br/><br/>Each copy of No Middle Ground includes a 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo; map and two sheets of full color, die cut counters that represent brigades from the Syrian and Arab Allies&rsquo; armed forces and the battalions of the Israeli Defense Force. Air units on both sides are potent weapons but must dodge the enemy&rsquo;s AAA and SAMs. Map hexes are 4 kilometers across and each turn represents 8 hours. Plus a well illustrated rulebook and charts, complete with designer&rsquo;s notes and historical commentary.<br/><br/>Rules for No Middle Ground include, among others, Time-on-Target artillery barrages, Combined-Arms tactics, Improved Positions, Minefields, Airborne and Commando assaults, as well as optional units that could have been deployed by both sides. The interactive, chit-pull formation activation recreates the chaos of battle while still allowing players to deploy and fight their armies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "マモノレイド (Mamono Raid) is a party battle management game in which players control the attacks, healing, leveling-up, and item acquisition of their four-character parties as they battle the enemy Mamono. Each player begins with an identical party of a level-zero Warrior, Cleric, Sorceror, and Thief, but parties develop differently over time as players make skill- and item-purchasing decisions.<br/><br/>Players' parties work together to defeat the Mamono, a chimerical monster whose five-parted body changes randomly from game to game. Players compete, however, to obtain larger shares of the rewards for successfully destroying monster parts and, ultimately, more victory points then their fellow adventurers. Most games end with the Mamono's defeat, at which time the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>A player's party has a single hit point count, which is both the party's life and its available action points. Individual characters do not die, whole parties do, and incur a victory point penalty. Damage dealt to the party is based on hate markers, which accrue to players in proportion to their success against the monster. Dealing more damage to the Mamono will mean greater incoming damage to manage. Key to victory is handling increasing damage while defeating the monster to earn VPs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Defeat the opposing team by knocking out all of their players in the same turn or by getting to lucky 13 first on your SCORE CARD. Equip items and weapons to make your faction the strongest!&rdquo; (From the rule book)<br/><br/>This card game recreates the pulp themed action that takes place in the Adventures of the 19XX graphic novel series. Each player receives a character card that comes with a unique set of special abilities and determines which side they&rsquo;re on. Two factions battle to find a winner using one of two victory conditions:<br/><br/>1.    Finish a round with the entire opposing team knocked out.<br/>2.    Be the first to score thirteen hits on the enemy faction.<br/><br/>Character cards are laid face up on the table with all stats showing. A marker is used to show the player&rsquo;s current health out of a maximum possible five.  Each player has a Luck, Defense, and Attack value.  Every Character Card has a brief background description for those who have not read the graphic novels.<br/><br/>Over 100 Item and Luck cards with unique illustrations created just for this game are drawn each turn and equipped to increase your character&rsquo;s attributes.  The Item deck contains weapons and other helpful cards such as the Thompson Gun, Experimental Gas Launcher, and bandages. The luck deck contains esoteric items such as curses, lucky helmets, spells, and more. Using these cards you and your faction attack opposing players each round and attempt to get to thirteen on the scorecard. Each damage you inflict on an opposing player gets them closer to being knocked out and moves your team up one point on the scorecard.<br/><br/>The game also comes with 21 Chapter Cards. These cards are drawn each time you score a point and allow you to play through the plot of various Adventures of the 19XX books. These cards come right from the book series using the original page art.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes a turn by using a dictionary (2 are included in the game) to pick a word based on a card that the player has drawn from a card deck. He tells it out loud, without spelling it. Anyone who can spell the word correctly  wins extra points at the end of the round. The dictionary holder writes down the definition on his paper. Each player must then write the correct spelling of the word and a definition for the word.  Even if the player does not know the definition of the word, he must bluff one that will be the most believable.  All sheets are then turned over to the dictionary holder so that he can number them and mix them up. Then he will read each definition out loud. He is allowed to repeat them up to 3 times.  Then everyone votes for the definition they think is the right one!  Points are given for getting the right spelling of the word, and for every vote each player got etc. The first player to reach 40 points  is declared the winner!<br/><br/>",

It develops problem solving skills in a way that is accessible to preschoolers, enjoyable to kids, but is also challenging to parents.<br/><br/>On each card is an animal species and on each side of the square are that animal's: Classification, Diet, Conservation Status (from the IUCN) and World Region. These will be used to match cards that are played in the game. Depending on the game style chosen, a player's cards may be face-down or held. Depending on the number of cards in the final version, it could range from at most 5 to 8 players.<br/><br/>The challenge of each game style is to make connections. Only cards that have a link (a correct match) can be played off of another. When the game area begins to get larger it, playing cards may require more than one side to match. Every side of the card must match. In some games there are rewards for playing cards with 2, 3, or 4 connections (a double, triple or quadruple link).<br/><br/>The goal of each game style is to play all of your cards first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dwarves are fond of ale, but wheat sadly doesn't grow two miles underground. So, dwarves farm mushrooms. Their peculiar brand of ale has become prized the world over. When there's any left.<br/><br/>Mushroom Ale is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write farming simulation that takes place in the fantasy Legends of Dsyx setting.<br/><br/>An 8x8 grid represents an underground mushroom farm. Each turn, the player picks one row or column and rolls seven dice to determine what actions can be taken in that furrow. Some of those dice allow the soil to be tilled, seeds to be planted, and mature mushrooms to be harvested, while others allow dice to be rerolled or even indicate the growth of weeds. The better the crop, the better the ale will be!<br/><br/>But that's where the second part of the game begins: brewing. Even as farming continues, the mushrooms brew and age in casks adjacent to the farm. Many factors affect ale quality, from the original surroundings of the harvested mushroom, to master brewers (gained through dice rolls) improving the process, to the effects gained by eating other mushrooms (or drinking other casks of ale!).<br/><br/>The harvest season is short and different types of mushrooms grow at different times. Once the time track fills up completely, the game is over, so a dwarven farmer needs to be both a seasoned farmer and an expert alemaker to ensure that they will go down in the annals of Mushroom Ale!<br/><br/><br/>Released in the August 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bartok is a game similar to Crazy Eights or UNO, except that the winner of each round is permitted to announce a new rule which must be followed in all future rounds.<br/><br/>The game is played with one or more decks of cards, and can even be played with mixes of partly complete packs. Differences from standard Crazy Eights are:<br/><br/><br/>     If you only have one card left, you have to say 'Bartok'. If you don't, you get your hand made back up to maximum.<br/>     Most other rules violations require you to take one or more cards.<br/>     Players aren't allowed to ask questions during a game. Ask a question, take a card. This is most entertaining when someone comes along and asks 'What are you playing?'. They'll usually get a card, and then several more when they don't say Bartok.<br/>     This is the doozy: A player that successfully gets rid of his last card is deemed the winner for that round, and gets to make a new rule, which overrides any later rules. These can be as simple or as brain-hurty as you like. Usually the game gets harder as it progresses, as rules feed off each other and make lethal feedback loops.<br/><br/><br/>Some example rules, to give you an idea of the flavor of the game:<br/><br/><br/>    When a change of suit changes color, play direction reverses. (easy)<br/>    When a two is played, play skips a player. (easy)<br/>    Threes don't exist. (somewhat metaphysical)<br/>    When a black ace is played, each player must slap a card face down in the middle of the table. The last player to do so takes all of the other cards. (moderate, more of a wakey wakey rule)<br/>    When a black queen is played, all of the cards increment their values by one, with kings wrapping to become aces. Red queens decrement the values by one. (somewhat mind numbing)<br/>    Prime numbered cards swap to become the suit of the same colour - ie. clubs &lt;-&gt; spades, diamonds &lt;-&gt; hearts. (brain hurty, especially when combined with the rule above)<br/><br/><br/>Any rule disputes are usually settled by voting. You play until you're bored, or until someone creates a rule that would explicitly end the entire game (with or without ultimate winners), and the rule is triggered. The game can also end if further play becomes impossible, as a result of how the created rules combine.<br/><br/>SURGEON-GENERAL'S WARNING: Do not play this game with mathematicians :)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NECNON is not exactly a single game, but more accurately a constellation of games, played according to a pair of complementary protocols. If that sounds complicated, the truth is actually quite otherwise.<br/><br/>The twin protocols, NEC and NON, are acronyms for 'Not Even Close' and 'No Odd Neighbours'. The difference between them, as their names quirkily suggest, is that in NEC you may never lay a stone next to an even number of enemy stones, whereas in NON it&rsquo;s odd numbers that are off limits. Either way, a placement next to no enemy stones at all is fine.<br/><br/>NECNON is a very close cousin to the classic game of Go. Contributing stones alternately to a grid whose cells may be either hexagonal or square, the players (Black and Green) gradually fill up the playing space. The objective is to deprive enemy groups (including enemy singletons) of &lsquo;air&rsquo; &ndash; i.e., of the vacant adjacent cells which in Go would be called &lsquo;liberties&rsquo;. At the end, any groups thus &lsquo;smothered&rsquo; score points for the smotherer at the rate of one per stone, and the player with more points wins. If scores are level the game is drawn.<br/><br/>Note: NECNON is a pure placement game; no capturing occurs during play.<br/><br/>A great deal of variety stems from a series of decisions made before play begins: whether to choose hexagons or squares; what size of board to use; and whether to go for NEC, or NON, or NEC versus NON. In all cases, Black (who starts) lays one stone on the initially empty board, and thereafter both players lay two at every turn. Passing is only permitted if unavoidable, and the game ends when both players pass consecutively, or when the board is full.  That&rsquo;s it.<br/><br/>Play NECNON online against a human or a virtual opponent at Stephen Tavener&rsquo;s wonderful Ai Ai site: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mrraow.com/.index.php/aiai-home/aiai/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mrraow.com/.index.php/aiai-home/aiai/</a> .<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Great Pacific War is a two player strategic simulation of hypothetical campaigns fought between the United States and Japan in the Pacific Theater of Operations sometime in the 1920s or 1930s. Units include many forces which were planned but not built, such as US Navy battlecruisers. The game system shows the effects of various operations over the course of a scenario. Players conduct actions that encompass discrete combat, logistical, intelligence and other operations. A player can conduct one or more actions per turn, depending on control of bases. Ground units in the game represent corps or armies. Aircraft units represent six to twelve squadrons of aircraft. Ship units represent one fleet aircraft carrier, divisions of two or three battleships, four to eight cruisers, flotillas of twelve to twenty destroyers, or various numbers of other ships types. Each grid on the map is about 550 miles across. Each turn represents one month of operations.<br/><br/>Components: 22x34 inch map, 176 die-cut counters.<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The set &quot;&Ouml;sterreich&quot; contains historical events which are related to Austria. This relationship is not necessary obvious. Like all Anno Domini the Austria edition can be played as standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

Rod's Ability Chart system is used - a tried and tested method of reducing dice throwing and paperwork.<br/><br/>Serenissima is designed to be user friendly and easy to understand. The rules give an authentic result with a reasonably short time and include all the aspects of warfare at sea during the Renaissance period.<br/><br/>As was the case at the time, warfare 'under oars' predominates. However, should players wish, mechanisms exist to allow their vessels to go into action under sail or a combination of sail and oar.<br/><br/>Statistics for all the main vessels of the period, whether oared, sailed or combined, are covered, so players have a wide choice as to the composition of their fleets.<br/><br/>Serenissima is a full rule set, as opposed fast-play. However, it was felt unnecessary to give comprehensive sailing attitudes for vessels under sail. Their rudimentary sail plans meant that unless the wind was favourable (generally from the quarter or astern), they tended to anchor to await better conditions.<br/><br/>",

Cards played on following rounds can be chained by matching the halves of the icons on the sides, allowing for even more moves or gaining shells that can be spent on special actions.<br/><br/>When crabs move or are pushed into the obstacles on the board, players will need to discard the cards from their hands, forcing them to spend a turn to rest. When resting, players retrieve all their cards back, and gain one new card, with additional special actions and more options for chaining.<br/><br/>The first crab to get into safe waters of the sea wins the game!<br/><br/>",

But if you push your luck too far, you may end up creating rock falls and blocking the adventurer from reaching the exit.<br/><br/>A gamesheet is provided, but the game may also be played on squared paper. Multiple players may play simultaneously by using shared dice rolls.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The requirements for each monster is listed at the bottom of each monster card. If you have any special cards to help defeat the monsters you will play those along with your weapons to kill it. If you do not have enough to defeat the monster, you will lose 1 of 9 lives and the monster will go to the next player. Once all nine lives are lost, you will place a monster back a the bottom of the monster deck to be drawn and defeated again.<br/><br/>Be on the lookout for the &quot;Cat Fight&quot; card. This will trigger an event where all players lay down their highest card. The winner takes the cat fight card and gets 5 extra points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Have hours of fun killing the most gruesome creatures in all cat kind.

But, the assumption here is that, instead, both Moscow and Washington were drawn into the conflict and deployed combat forces to support their respective camp.<br/><br/>The game system emphasizes command control. Each side is composed of different contingents. Players activate their contingents through the use of Command markers. This models the historical command-control factors involved in multi-national operations during the 1950s. Players command ground and air forces, and there is the possibility of nuclear war breaking out. There are two players: the Allies (including France, Britain, Israel and the US); and the East Bloc (Egypt, USSR).<br/><br/><br/>Published with Modern War #32, Nov-Dec 2017<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to capture all of the opponent's pieces of either color.<br/><br/>The game is characterized by three different capture methods. By major capture, you can capture your opponent's pieces by forming a group of the same color with your opponent's pieces and your own pieces. By minor capture, you can capture an enemy piece on a square of a different color than it by replacing. By attainment capture, you can capture any opponent piece by reaching the far end of the board.<br/><br/>Your piece can be moved by jumping over friendly pieces, so the game develops quickly. You need to read the board and make good use of the three capture methods to advance the game to your advantage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If a tree is potentially in the line-of-sight, the player peers through a miniature periscope placed on the battlefield; if at least 50% of the enemy model is visible, then the unit may fire. Combat is resolved with a single six-sided die roll that is cross-referenced on a Hit Chart, that takes into account the statistics of both the offensive and defensive units.<br/><br/>Three scenarios are provided and the player my also design their own. This is the second game in the Dougram series, the first of which is called Battle of Stanrey. Japanese and English rules are provided.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Blitzkrieg is unique in the Piquet system in that it has three different game scales included.  The different game scales allow for a wide variety of scenarios, game sizes, and game types.<br/><br/>The Game Scale Rules section includes unique rules for each of the three scale games included in the The Blitzkrieg game supplement (Squad, Platoon, and Battalion).  Each game scale has its own Weapon Adjustment Table, game play reference sheet, quick rating BDV Tables, and organizational information.<br/><br/>This allows a gamers to play everything from a vicious, house-to-house skirmish combat to a multi-division, multi-day battle on the plains of Russia.  The movement, combat, and morale sections of the rules were deliberately developed to fit the &quot;zoom&quot; concept mentioned in the original Piquet rules.  By using a few unique rules, and different troop ratings, a gamer can easily move between the three scales.  The basic rule mechanics are the same, only the details change.  The Squad scale game is new with this version of the rules.  It allows for large skirmish actions, instead of the small, highly individually personalized game typical of skirmish rules.  The Squad game allows skirmish detail in games with a platoon or more of infantry on a side.   The detail players enjoy in skirmish games is still there, but it is imbedded in the game system.  As an example, it would be very easy to just add rules to the basic rule skeleton to handle unique cases.  Consider armor in a skirmish game.   Obviously, there is a difference in the combat readiness of a tank that is buttoned up compared to one which is just moving down a road.  The Squad game easily handles this difference by requiring that vehicles be in a declared status - either march or deployed.  March status indicates a tank or vehicle that is not combat ready, but is primarily intent on moving rapidly.  Deployed status indicates a tank or vehicles that is tactically aware prepared for the uncertainties of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet: Master Rules for Wargaming<br/><br/><br/>",

Build your wardrobe of classy pants, sporty pants, adventure pants, or casual pants before your opponents do.<br/><br/>But hold tight to your trousers because they can get stolen right from under your nose!<br/><br/>Each card is artfully designed with a retro-funky pants illustration. Let&rsquo;s play!<br/><br/>The cards consist of different wardrobe categories: Classy, Sporty, Casual, Adventure. There are four unique types of pants in each wardrobe category. For example, Classy Pants consists of stripey dress pants, tuxedo pants, a gown, and a kilt.<br/><br/>The object is to collect two full sets of pants from two different categories. The first player to do that wins. There are wild cards you can play to thwart your opponents' pants collection: Suspenders and gift card. Just when you're ready to lay down your winning set of pants, another player can steal your set or make you put it back. Ouch. <br/>There's also an underwear wild card you can use with three pairs of pants in a category to make a complete set. Wee!<br/><br/>Game play goes like this: Each player is dealt five cards. In a turn of play, you can:<br/>&bull; Lay down a complete set of pants <br/>&bull; Discard pants cards you don't need <br/>&bull; Pick from the discard pile to get cards you need<br/><br/>Its Kickstarter campaign failed to reach its funding goal on October 7 2011.<br/><br/>",

Set in the world of Traesparin, the setting for the novels 144: Wrath and 144: Redemption, players take on the role of Champions to expand, build, and battle their way into legend. Recruit fearless Heroes and discover powerful Artifacts as you amass your forces. Will you master arcane magic or win through the strength of steel? Champions can even join together to take on greater threats as they vie for the most Glory.<br/><br/>Players start the game with two Lands under their control. Each turn, the controlling Champion (the player whose turn it is) rolls a ten-sided die for Production. The result of the role is compared to their Lands and Resources are acquired by all players accordingly. The controlling Champion can then use acquired Resources to expand to new Lands (thereby increasing their Resource production), recruit Heroes (cards) to increase their Magic and/or Combat power, improve their land with Tower Upgrades that add to the Production roll's result, or purchase Artifacts (cards) that give Glory and additional passive or active benefits. Additionally, players may undertake secret Quests that provide Glory, primarily, at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The main source of Glory, however, is Battle. The controlling Champion will end his or her turn with the option of sending forces into Battle, challenging their choice of Rank 1-5. In Battle, Champions must choose whether they will fight with the strength of Combat or the power of Magic. The chosen Battle Rank card is turned over and the controlling Champion faces the challenge by rolling a ten-sided die and adding their chosen power. If the result exceeds the target, they win and receive both Glory and Reward (in the form of Resources). If they lose, Glory is lost.<br/><br/>Additionally, the controlling Champion may solicit aid from another player before the Battle begins. Players can combine their powers to take on greater threats (and earn greater Glory) than they could on their own.<br/><br/>End game is triggered when a player reaches 144 Glory (tracked around the edge of the game board). Points from Quest cards and remaining Resources are added in to determine the player with the most Glory, the Champion of Hope!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Endless Land is a game with modular boards that are placed in a different way each game for a new experience each time!  Some players will choose dangerous quests and heroic battles to gain victory.  Some will set up commerce and trade routes to conquer the land.  There is magic and adventure among the dwarves, elves, and humans that live in this realm. Make sure you have plenty of food for the journey and let the quest begin!<br/><br/>On a turn all players will take their actions simultaneously.  They travel to a neighboring town (move their player meeple on the board) and collect the goods which have been accumulating there. The board is modular and matches up with other board parts to form a unique terrain each game.  Also, the game expands with more 8&quot; X 10&quot; board pieces to form a playing surface as with no knowable end.  Each player uses gold, wheat, wood, iron, and many other commodities to build farms, stores, and implements of combat.<br/>Players may also take quests that send them into the lairs of diabolical monsters who are hoarding gold, rubies, and other valuable items.  Players can risk sneaking into the dark caverns and taking the loot, but if the monster awakens they are in trouble.<br/>Players can build strongholds so that even when they are not in a town, that town is building up their store of goods.<br/><br/>Players can trade each turn to turn their wheat, sheep, or cattle into food, they can also trade other commodities for food in a town where that is in demand.<br/><br/>Players can travel faster buy buying a horse or boat.<br/><br/>Players wishing to build or buy must have food to stay in a particular place longer to transact business.<br/><br/>Points are gained by building structures and conquering creatures.  The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It is recorded only from the early 18th century, though greater antiquity is suggested by its trumplessness. The name of the game, literally &quot;three Seven&quot; may refer to seven sets of three or four point possibilities when a minimum of three each (three, two, ace or all of those together in a matching suit are dealt), or to the fact that it is played up to twenty-one. There are many variants depending on the region of Italy the game is played in.<br/><br/>",

Unable to outflank its opponent, each side entrenched. A new type of warfare began that would claim the lives of many millions: trench warfare!<br/><br/>Designed by Renaud Verlaque, winner of the 2003 Charles S. Roberts award for best Pre WW2 game with Age of Napoleon (Phalanx Games, 2003, and Mayfair Games) and designer of The Price of Freedom: the American Civil War 1861-65 (Compass Games, 2008), The Big Push is a card wargame on Trench Warfare on the Western Front in World War One. One player commands the armies of the Entente and the other the armies of the German Reich (a.k.a., Germany).<br/><br/>The game plays in a maximum of five annual turns, from 1915 through 1919. In each turn, the players are given an opportunity to innovate weapons and tactics, secretly deploy armies to the six sectors of the front line (from Flanders in the north to Verdun in the south), try to gain air superiority in order to reconnoiter the enemy before deciding whether to attack or defend, and then fight to gain the upper hand sector by sector and satisfy political pressure at home to attack and win. Meanwhile the Entente player hopes to reduce the German war effort through the naval blockade while the German player hopes to do the same through U-Boote Warfare, but at the risk of bringing the United States into the war on the side of the Entente. The German player must also contend with the demands of the Eastern Front on his war effort, at least until Russia sues for peace. Victory points are awarded for successful attacks, with each additional successful attack in the same turn resulting in a larger number of victory points than its predecessor as it increases the likelihood of immediate and decisive victory in the war. If neither player has gained enough victory points by the end of the 1919 turn to achieve victory, attritional victory is awarded to the player who accumulated the most victory points throughout the game (but a tie means a draw).<br/><br/>",

Here lies a weapon of supreme destructive power, sought by armies from across the Mortal Realms. Whoever can harness its might will be gifted the power to utterly destroy their enemies. Yet claiming dominion over this war-torn land will be no simple task...<br/><br/>In The Box<br/><br/>This box contains everything you need to run a multiplayer campaign of Warhammer Age of Sigmar in the war-torn lands of the Flamescar Plateau. Whether you want to play Skirmish games, or massive, epic battles with thousands of points, this set makes it easy to organise, set up and play. It includes a large map of the Flamescar Plateau, divided into 23 regions for your campaign players to fight over &ndash; there are 256 map markers in the box, which are reusable stickers that can be peeled off and attached elsewhere as needed. Emphasis has been placed on speed when designing this box &ndash; we want your admin to be as minimal and fast as possible, so you can get on with actually playing through your campaign!<br/><br/>In the included 64-page book, you&rsquo;ll find a brief history of the Realmgate Wars, along with descriptions of important Sigmarite cities and the Flamescar Plateau itself &ndash; the expansive region of the Realm of Fire, once ruled over by a magocracy known as the Agloraxi, over which your campaigns will be fought. It also features an extensive, easy to follow guide to actually running your campaigns &ndash; challenging opponents, picking a Battleplan, using Time of War Rules, how to use the included campaign cards, building garrisons and mustering your armies in the regions you control, and some special rules. These special rules add secret objectives allowing players to use some initiative and cunning, rules for trade and negotiation, and possible sudden death victories &ndash; these rules can drastically change the flow and outcome of a campaign. There are also 9 sets of Allegiance Abilities for use in the campaign &ndash; 6 of these represent the major Sigmarite cities found on the map, with one each for the forces of Death, Destruction and Chaos. These include battle traits, command traits and artefacts of power for your armies to use.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s also a set of 131 campaign cards &ndash; some of these, the Domain cards, are used to define the size of the armies that are fighting, and provide players with resources to call upon, such as points to spend on re-rolls and Stratagems; the others are used for special rules, and for keeping track of your Glory points &ndash; acquire these in order to win!

The game presents a unique interpretation of the campaign in that the two German commanders are also simultaneously Soviet commanders. The player who runs the &ldquo;German Northern Command&rdquo; also runs the &ldquo;Soviet Sothern Command,&rdquo; and the player who runs the &ldquo;German Southern Command&rdquo; also runs the &ldquo;Soviet Northern Command.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In that way both players &ndash; when in their roles as German field marshals &ndash; are trying to win the game by using their own forces to outdo the competing German player. What matters most is not defeating the Soviets, but accomplishing more than your counterpart German field marshal. In that way you will earn the lion&rsquo;s share of the credit from the Fuehrer. Of course, since you also command the Soviet forces resisting the advance of your counterpart German field marshal&rsquo;s advance, those Red Army units are also helping you to win by frustrating him.<br/><br/>",

Over the winter the Germans keep taking the measure of their opponents and hit upon a plan was that inspired, risky, and utterly decisive. Ironic of Hitler to assume his remarkable success was simply the new template for all future campaigns. His eyes turned east....<br/><br/>But, why, exactly did France fall? Against the Odds' 2015 annual features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question. They&rsquo;ve each settled on a single overriding theme to focus on.<br/><br/>Springtime for Hitler explores the angle that the Germans at this time were quite simply indeed &quot;supermen&quot; at the top of their game. Possessing the best tactical air force, the best plans and doctrine, and well motivated by National-Socialist ideology, they were unstoppable. Or were they?<br/><br/>",

Deadly traps are to be expected...but a minotaur in a maze?<br/><br/>Dungeonrunner is a solitaire card game inspired by classic pen and paper fantasy RPGs. The player takes a hero on a quest through one of nine adventure decks. Each adventure deck is filled with danger and peril as the player guides the hero through hazardous traps, countless monsters, and dreaded curses.<br/><br/>Each deck of 54 cards make up ten separate adventures with varying difficulty. Infiltrate Emperor Zinn&rsquo;s castle with the Lowly Thief, trudge through Muck Elf Swamp with the Amazon Warrior, or if you dare, confront the Demon Queen, Lawnadynn with the Paladin of Truth!<br/><br/>Each turn, you play a card from the adventure deck. It may be a monster, trap, event, or item. Once that card is resolved by combat or your decisions, you draw the next card. If you can make it to the quest card for the given scenario, the hero completes the adventure!<br/><br/>",

This is known to history as the Battle of the Bulge. This card game provides a recreation of elements of that chaotic battle as each player simultaneously commands both US and German military forces in attempts to hold and seize major objectives. Each objective has unique capabilities that allow the player holding them to 'bend' the rules.<br/><br/>Multiple scenarios keep the game 'fresh' for repeated playings and allow players to explore various aspects of military operations. Mines, friendly fire incidents, air drops and other events can affect play in unanticipated ways. You are in command. Can YOU win amidst the snow and evergreens of the Ardennes.<br/><br/>* The Playing Deck - 128 playing cards - our cards are coated for durability<br/>    * 140 Die-Cut Markers - for marking game information.<br/>    * Objective Selection Pad - for secretly selecting objectives.<br/>    * Rules - the complete rules of play.<br/>    * Number of Players: Three to Six.<br/><br/>",

The rookie cocks his head to one side &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear anything, Sarge&rdquo;. &ldquo;Thats just it&rdquo; came the reply, &ldquo;its quiet, too damn quiet&rdquo;. THUNK! The arrow comes hurtling out of the dark and the sergeant is bowled over backwards by the impact.<br/><br/>But don&rsquo;t worry folks! The arrow is usually stopped by the sergeants pocket book/Water canteen or photograph of his mother. This is surely the stuff that the Hollywood western is made of - and we hope that this is what &lsquo;Pony Wars&rsquo; is also made of!<br/><br/>Forget Realism! Throw accuracy to the four winds! We&rsquo;re not playing &lsquo;Once Upon a Time in the West&rsquo; now! Just put on yar yellow neckerchief, mossey out in yer yellow stripped trousers, boot yer Winchester and climb into the saddle. Raise yar hand and bring it down, pointing forward, at the same time yelling;&mdash; &ldquo;Column of Two&rsquo;s &mdash; Forward, Yo!&rdquo; The entire 7th. cavalry will ride out of Fort Laramie behind you. (Probably to the strains of &lsquo;Gary Owen&rsquo;)<br/>This is Hollywood! Everyones a hero and there&rsquo;s legends to be made. The Sioux are on the warpath and theres white folks out there! As our grizzled sergeant would say:&mdash; &ldquo;The only good injuns a dead injun&rdquo;.<br/><br/>If your idea of a wargame is to spend time choosing a suitably &lsquo;rigged&rsquo; army and playing with a set of rules which you can corrupt, by pointing out the intricacies of the grammar , with the intention of winning at all costs then, please, put this volume back where you found it and go and find a nice national convention somewhere.<br/>This game is intended for &lsquo;FUN&rsquo; (remember the word? We used it quite a lot before wargaming became serious). The rules are not legally binding, merely suggestions and you won&rsquo;t find every single situation that may occur in this volume. You may have to make a few decisions yourself. If you don&rsquo;t like the result the rules are giving then change them &mdash; we don&rsquo;t mind. The idea is to enjoy yourself &mdash; do what you will.<br/>The basic concept behind the game is to allow an unspecified number of wargamers (from one upwards) to fight a battle WITH ALL THE WARGAMERS BEING ON THE SAME SIDE (as officers of the U.S. army). Your opponents, the Sioux nation, will look after themselves. The game is ideally suitable for use at a convention where experienced players can teach the rookies (either gamers or the public) the basic rules without any concealed motives &mdash; they&rsquo;re on the same side! Each new command arriving should be allocated to a person picked from the observers, that person taking the name end rank as appropriate to the command. If the character is killed then the player leaves the game. Thus a continually varying client&egrave;le is established.<br/>Alternatively, a small group of wargamers can have a great game. Each takes the name and rank of a number of officers. Any new coming commands are either given to new players (if available) or allocated to one of the existing players. There again, &lsquo;Pony Wars&rsquo; makes a great SOLO GAME! We provide suggestions &mdash; you do what you want!<br/><br/>The game is designed for an eight foot by six foot table and uses 15mm. figures. There is no reason what so ever why the game should not be adapted for a different size of table<br/><br/>",

One player will assume the role of captain and will be in charge of planning the round strategy, while the other players (the crew) will execute that strategy to try and complete four different missions: fire cannons, attack with swords, set sails and navigate away from the Kraken. As the mission unfolds, players will win and lose reputation and, if the captain's reputation is too low, crew members with high reputation will be able to declare a mutiny to nominate a new captain of the ship.<br/><br/>Aye is a dice rolling game with a high social component and push-your-luck mechanics. It has 12 custom dice which are dealt by the captain to the players, who will roll them to complete the missions. But receiving damage and losing to much reputation can make you lose those dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two containers hold 25 3 dimensional one-inch cubes each.  The cubes have pictures numbered 1-5 on all of their sides except one, which holds a large red X on it.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to to acquire five X's in a row, like a bingo game.  However, this game is much more complex in its variant forms.<br/><br/>Initially, the base setup is for each person to turn all of their picture cubes to the 1 numbered picture--the easiest items to spot.  Goal: Spot five items or a picture of each of the five items, revealing 5 X's which form a straight line.<br/><br/>Rise To The Top:  In this variant, each person does not reveal the X upon sighting a 1 numbered item.  Instead, the person will turn the number two picture to the top.  This continues until the number three item is sighted, and the X is turned up.  The first person to five X's in a row wins.<br/><br/>Go For Points:  Similar to Above.  Attach a time limit or mileage limit to the game.  At game end, total the numbers of the photos as points, scoring each X as a 10 point item.  Highest total wins.<br/><br/>This can be played as a solo variant, with a solo player trying to accomplish point goals per number of miles, or trip duration.<br/><br/>The Handicapper:  In a child versus adult game, using the base game rules, the adult would adjust their numbered pictures to a 4 or 5 starting point.<br/><br/>One Block At A Time:  Start with all X's showing.  Each person will take out the first block in their container.  As soon as either player sees one of the five items, they replace the block in their container with the picture showing of the item spotted.  They then move on to their next block, until all 25 blocks are gone through.<br/><br/>The game ends when one person is done with all 25 blocks.  Total all points of exposed pictures.<br/><br/>Get Nasty:  Each player arranges the cubes of their opponent, using the number five pictures of each number (5-5's, 5'4's, etc...) and arranges them in a way which is thought to be most difficult to achieve 5 in a row.  Same as base game otherwise.<br/><br/>Composite Game:  Start with all number 1's.  As you see each item, turn that cube over to X.  When you get five X's in a row, turn that row over to the number two pictures.  Continue with the same goals, turning five in a row over at a time until you get the five numbered pictures.  The first person to turn over five number five pictures, revealing the final X's, wins.  A complicated variant, indeed.<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The Universal Fighting System (UFS) is a collectible card game originally designed by Sabertooth Games. The themes of the cards are drawn from a multitude of licensed gaming universes, especially fighting game licenses.<br/><br/>A game in the Universal Fighting System represents a battle between two adversaries. Each player controls one of the two characters, with the objective being to defeat the opponent, typically through loss of vitality. The two characters need not be from the same universe; for example, Chun-Li from Street Fighter could battle Cassandra from Soul Calibur or Tycho from Penny Arcade.<br/><br/>Players take turns, with each turn consisting of multiple actions. With each additional action a player takes in a turn, the difficulty of successfully completing that action increases. Players can continue to take actions until they choose to stop or until they fail an attempt. The game structure typically involve players building up foundations over successive turns, which then allows a greater number of actions before failure. Management of these becomes crucial, as players must strike a balance between using their resources for offense and defense; going &quot;all out&quot; for a series of attacks can leave one vulnerable to retaliation during the opponent's turn. The system relies heavily on card combinations, where one card enhances the effect of another. The game is an advanced or expert level product (owing in large part to the fact that every card has at least one special ability), primarily aimed at older or more experienced gamers.<br/><br/>In July 2023, publisher Jasco Games announced that UFS would be renamed UniVersus, with the publisher simultaneously changing its name to UVS Games, with &quot;UVS&quot; being short for UniVersus.<br/><br/>",

It's a common habit to end a dispute with a game of Double Knot in order to decide who gets to sleep in the best bed. Unfortunately, in case of a tie, play is continued. This explains the amount of pandas.<br/><br/>The game is named after the two highest cards in the game, the Ace of Knots and the Crown of Knots.<br/><br/>In Double Knot every player bids a number of tricks. The object of the game is to win exactly the number of tricks bid and at the same time let other people fail to do the same.<br/><br/>In a hand of Double Knot, each of the Decktet cards is treated as belonging only to the top suit. The bottom suits of the first card played to a trick determines which cards can be used as trumps in that trick.<br/><br/>The rules of the game can be found at the Decktet wiki.<br/><br/>",

In 1790 a small force of militia and US Regulars under General Harmer were soundly defeated by the Miami at the Maumee River near their main settlement of Kekionga. Alarmed, the US Congress and President Washington authorized the mobilization of an even larger force, this time to be led by the Territory&rsquo;s first Governor and General of the Army, Arthur St. Clair. This would be the first full scale conflict waged by the new nation, and President Washington was very much concerned about the risks such an undertaking involved.<br/><br/>Can you do as well, or better?<br/><br/>",

She is of middle eastern origins and like the story teller of the same name in the Arabian book 'One Thousand and One Nights', she has a story for every person she has killed. <br/>Sheherazade is very quick and lethal. She specializes in taking actions out of turn. At close quarters she attacks with her sword and can keep combo attacking even when it is not her turn. She can also support other agents during their turns by throwing her deadly knives to debuff enemies. But her greatest powers are that she can teleport close to her victim or become invisible with a smokescreen to finish her work.<br/><br/>Oni, a.k.a. Masamune Senichi, is the son of a Japanese businessman who shamed his family by entering the world of organized crime. Apalled that is boss was taking orders from the LEGION's Ministry of Greed, Senichi donned a demon's mask (Oni-Mask) and began a silent hunt to eradicate Greed's organization. The Oni-Mask stem from Japanese folklore and are worn to protection against evil spirits and yokai (ogres).<br/>Oni carries a silenced pistol and through stealth is a lethal killing machine. His attacks panick surrounding enemies and his fear aura lowers their attack and defense abilities. The more he attacks, the more his fear aura grows. This makes him a great support member, since his aura makes it easier for his team members to attack and survive damage.<br/><br/>Kingpin, aka Pierce Washington, is the current leader of the Vice Kings. Pierce had successfully unified all of the gangs of Stilwater under one Vice King flag, which gave him and his lieutenants a united front to defend themselves against LEGION'S Ministry of Gluttony. He then was recruited into MAYHEM as an integral member of the Fire Squad.<br/>Kingpin carries an SMG that spews out damage, a flare gun that has an explosive area of effect, or a plasma thrower that he can charge-up and debuff enemies with. For defense, he not only relies on his speed, but also on the chest armor that he always wears. But Kingpin is not all about violence. He is a chess aficionado, loves people, and is friendly with just about everybody - kind of like a... social butterfly. (Just don't call him this to his face!) Well known for his party dance mixes, he can lay down a mean beat  during battle that will stun enemies that are in range!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle of GOG is a board game for 2-4 players set in the ancient land of Canaan. Designed by Vitali Minin, Battle of GOG challenges all family members to find 5 sacred scrolls as they battle over the land of Canaan.<br/>Game rules are simple, combining strategy and luck equally, so anyone can win.<br/>The game is easy to learn, but hard to master. Despite simple mechanics, game play involves complex strategic thinking. The map of the game can be assembled in numerous combinations, so each game session plays differently.<br/>Sometimes you need to carefully consider whether to make a move that benefits yourself or one that puts your opponent at a disadvantage. You need to weigh many different pathways to victory: conquer cities, fight enemy soldiers, obtain the scrolls, or reach all 4 corners of the map to make a winning move.<br/>With so many factors involved, even establishing 3 cities in the most abundant map areas won`t ensure your victory, as Ability Cards and Treasure Chest Cards can make the difference in a critical situation.<br/>Lastly, remember that the Oracle of the game is GOG' and that he has the power to save you from the Angel of Retribution!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All three hands are dealt to each player at the beginning, but not revealed until each round begins. In each round, the aim is get rid of all your cards first by playing combos. Each time a player &ldquo;passes&rdquo; because they are unable or unwilling to play a higher combo, that passing player purloins two cards from the previous played combo to re-use next hand--one card for them and the other for their opponent.<br/><br/>As players start each new round they combine the cards dealt at the beginning with the &ldquo;tribute&rdquo; cards chosen or allotted from the previous round.  At the end of each round players score for the number of cards left in their opponent&rsquo;s hand, and at the end of the three rounds the winner is the player with the highest total points.<br/><br/>",

The council is made up of 7 members, each representing a day of the week, including the governor, Sunday, and the secret police, Thursday, whose identities are completely veiled. Over the course of two months, you'll have to maneuver various agents to further your faction's goals, either unleashing a world-shattering uprising or subduing chaotic madness.<br/><br/>Players combine action dice and agents to solve missions across London, and control a total of 7 regions according to the results. The game ends after 2 months, or after the 3rd round. At the end of the game, the player who controls the most regions wins the game. In the event of a tie, the player with the lowest surveillance value of their agent wins. For victory, you'll need to solve puzzles and guess your opponent's identity.<br/><br/>Now the time has come for the showdown, you have to cross London on a tight balance of power.<br/><br/>&quot;Thy hand, great Anarch! lets the curtain fall, And universal Darkness buries All.&quot; -Alexander Pope<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Market Garden was a military operation fought in the Netherlands from 17 to 25 September 1944. It was planned by Field Marshal Montgomery as combined land - airborne operation. The airborne operation was undertaken by the First Allied Airborne Army with the land operation by XXX Corps of the British Second Army.<br/><br/>The operation's objective was to create a 103 km long corridor into Germany with a bridgehead over the River Rhine, creating an Allied invasion route into northern Germany. This was to be achieved by seizing a series of nine bridges with airborne forces, with land forces swiftly following over the bridges. Despite this ambitious plans, operation turned out to be a fiasco.<br/><br/>Game covers the entire Market Garden operation. It comes with four scenarios, picturing the parts of the battle and the whole battle itself. It uses battalion scale.<br/><br/>&quot;Market Garden&quot; uses WB-95 system, with some modifications that were necessary due to a scale change.<br/><br/>",

All you need to do is knock out your opponents by playing better cards than they do. The catch? Your cards start facing outward, so only your foes know what cards you have!  Will you outsmart your ninja rivals and see through their trickery?<br/><br/>In Shadow Strike Melee, Players hold numbered cards face out so other players can see them. On a player's turn, he chooses an opponent to fight. Whoever reveals the lower card loses a life point, but also gets more information about their hand. For each wound received, players turn one card around permanently in their hand.<br/><br/>Players may also use special items Like Shuriken and Candy Bars to turn battles in their favor.<br/><br/>Whoever is the last ninja standing is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Published in the form of a magazine, all you need is a pen and a brain to play it!<br/><br/>Inspired by the famous Sudoku, the objective of the game in Acrylogic is to solve puzzles in the form of 3x3 or 4x4 grids. Acrylogic can be played solo as well as with others in cooperation or competition. Using only numbers and colors, it is a universal game, without text.<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>Find the color and the amount of paint used in each of the 16 white squares. In each white square, write a number between 1 and 4, along with one of the following colors: yellow, blue, red or white (colorless). Each square is unique: there cannot be two identical squares with the same number and the same color.<br/><br/>The paint marks, made up of a number or of a color, located between the white squares, are clues that provide multiple information. If a paint mark indicates &ldquo;5&rdquo;, it means that one of the two white squares is a 2 and the other is a 3.<br/>If a paint mark indicates &ldquo;green&rdquo;, it means that one of the two white squares is yellow and the other is blue.<br/>Note: the color white is colorless. Consider it the same as the color of the adjacent square.<br/><br/>RELAX PAINTING: For 1 player<br/>If you want to play Acrylogic in solo or in co-op with other players, you only need one Acrylogic magazine. Solve the grids at your own pace, in the order of your choice.<br/><br/>SPEED PAINTING: For 2 or more players<br/>If you want to play Acrylogic with multiple players in competitive mode, each player will need their own Acrylogic magazine. In competitive play, players attempt to solve the same grid as quickly as possible, all at once. You must play all the grids in one magazine, one after the other, from the first to the last (in multiple rounds), with the same group of players. When a player completes their grid, they earn as many points as the number of players who haven't finished their grids yet. A player who announces the completion of their grid can no longer add modifications to it. When there is only one player left who hasn't finished their grid, all players verify the accuracy of the completed grids. In case of an error on their grid, the player loses 1 point. When all the grids in the magazine have been completed, establish a ranking of players based on the number of points earned by each player.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cam is a small but not tiny game of sudden death. This little abstract ends as soon as one player gets any one piece to the single goal space at the opposite end of the board. To do so, one has to get past the opponent's pieces.<br/><br/>Each player has two types of pieces which mostly move similarly. One can jump one's own pieces or jump to capture an opponent's. Multiple jumps in any direction are allowed. So, sudden reversals and leaps to victory are not uncommon. Since only one piece in the goal is needed to win, this game can be unforgiving. Still it's quick and many games can be played in one sitting.<br/><br/>Cam, released by Parker Brothers in 1949, is a down-sized version of Camelot.<br/><br/>Cam is different than Camelot in the following ways:<br/><br/>    The Cam board has 67 squares.  The Camelot board has 160 squares.<br/>    Each side in Cam has two Knights and five Men.  Each side in Camelot has four Knights and ten Men.  <br/>    The object of Cam is to get one piece into the opponent's Castle.  The object of Camelot is to get two pieces into the opponent's Castle.  <br/>    Victory in Cam also occurs if one side, even with only one remaining piece, captures all of the opposing pieces.  In Camelot, if the side capturing all of the opposing pieces has only one remaining piece, the game is a draw.  Victory in Camelot by capture of all of the opposing pieces occurs only if the victorious side has two or more remaining pieces.    <br/>    Stalemate in Cam is impossible.  Stalemate in Camelot is possible, and is a victory for the stalemating side if it has two or more pieces.  <br/>    In Cam, if both sides have only one remaining piece, the game continues until one piece captures the other, or one piece enters the opposing Castle.  In Camelot, if both sides have only one remaining piece, the game is a draw.<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Chivalry<br/>    Camelot<br/><br/><br/>",

We decided on a deck of Fast Action Cards to provide the smooth flow, and we rejected a playing pitch [board] as being unnecessary.

        "description": "THE GAME<br/><br/>In the universe of Fallen Frontiers different factions fight for control of both planets and their strategic resources in order to proliferate in a galaxy that holds lots of secrets. The players assume control of an army faction that can be shaped by choosing troops, characters, and cards that best adapt to their game style.<br/><br/>Fallen Frontiers is a battle game based on combat squads. The squads offer protection and firepower to the characters. Characters that are the ones that define the game style because their attributes change the characteristics of their squad. In this way, each squad acts differently depending on the character that leads them. However in Fallen Frontiers characters are not superheroes, they are weak and easy to eliminate when they are not with their squad.<br/><br/>Besides the miniatures that represent their army, players will also have a deck of cards assembled by them. Strategy is not revealed at the beginning of the game, as a player can secretly set up the deck of cards allowing them to change the game style in such a way that opponents will not be able to guess their strategy at first sight.<br/><br/>The factions and the cards use up resources to carry out certain actions. The main resources are moral and Krithium. Players gain moral by achieving targets and causing losses to their opponent's army while their army suffers as little as possible. Using moral points will make an army more powerful but will exhaust it in the process. Krithium is a resource that must be collected during the game. It is the source of energy that enhances a team's weapons and cards. The player will have an armory, a separate deck where the player purchases equipment, that can be used during the game and consumes Krithium. The contents of the armory is also set up by the player just like the deck of cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Let's take a look into East German History and the end of the former socialist state, the GDR. November 1989. Under pressure from the civil rights movement, the GDR leadership has to retreat. The dictatorship is in an overt crisis, from which it will not recover. This affects the Ministry for State Security as well. On November 6th, a few days before the Wall came down, Minister Erich Mielke orders the destruction of documents.<br/><br/>For the card game Stasi: Over and Out players change their usual perspective and work for the Stasi. The goal of the game is to destroy as many documents as possible. Every destroyed document earns points. At the end, the player with the most points wins the game. Civil rights activists will try to stop the players. The game ends when five or more citzen cards are revealed. Players have to choose between distracting the citizens or destroying more documents. Like during the original events in 1989/90, the Stasi will lose the game to the citizens.<br/><br/>Players take turns. Every turn they have to draw and reveal three cards from a draw pile. These cards represents documents of different values (0 - +4), citizens of differnet values (-1 - -4), and special actions, representing historical artifacts, events and a way to break the games symmetry. Players can then play two actions, two different ones or the same one twice: Destroy one document, distract one citizen, take one special action. Destroyed documents are placed face down in front of the players, citizens that were distracted come back face-down underneath the draw pile, special actions are discarded and maybe shuffled back in the draw pile later.<br/><br/>The rules of the game are explained during the course of the game. Cards with rules text are sorted into the draw pile. Players learn the rules as the game proceeds. Cards are numbered, so the order of the cards can be restored. In addition to this there are cards, that explain the historical background. There is no booklet. The game starts the moment the box is being opened.<br/><br/>Stasi: Over and Out was developed by Playing History, a company that is specialized in creating games with historical background, games that are educational. This game was designed to be played not only in educational environments, but also at home, by smaller play groups and by people who are not used to learn game rules and play games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is a quick paced game involving strategic combat. Outwit and outmuscle your opponents to become the Ultimate Soldier. &nbsp;<br/><br/>To begin each player will start with 1 Soldier card, a Reference card, and eight Common cards. The first player to draw a Common card begins. They can make one of three moves during their turn.<br/>Play a Training Academy card (When the equivalent of  four Training Academies is met, they earn another Soldier card).<br/>Mount an assault against another soldier, which can include enhancements from Weapons and Intensity cards (If your soldier dies and you do not have another one trained, you cannot mount an assault).<br/>Discard because they are unable to make another move.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds; the first player to either earn or have four soldiers alive, or win in three separate combats, wins the round.&nbsp;Players then get to draw Victory cards for winning the round or surviving the round with a Soldier card. The first player to earn seven Victory cards wins. If a player loses three or more battles during a round, they must surrender a Victory card.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The game is designed to keep everyone involved throughout the game even if it is not their turn. For instance, during combat, a player can use a Deflection card to send the assault to someone else. During combat, if a player doesn't have cards to retaliate, but has a Radio for Help card, they get to draw two cards from anyone not in combat.&nbsp;There are also plenty of surprises, so don't leave the table for anything: &nbsp;<br/><br/>The Sniper: a card that can be played at any time even when it is not that player's turn. The sniper takes out a soldier without recourse. However, if the player being shot by the sniper holds a Mirror card, they can use it to reflect the light into the sniper's eyes and survive.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The Bomb: a card that can be played at any time, even when it is not that player's turn. The bomb kills one soldier in every player's hand, unless they hold a Dud or Super Dud card. The Dud card saves the soldier of the player that holds it. The Super Dud saves all the soldiers on the table. If you are on the way to victory, you might want to just hold onto the Super Dud and watch your foes explode.&nbsp;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Donetsk: The Battle for the Airport is the feature magazine game included in Yaah! #9 by Flying Pig Games.<br/><br/>Donetsk is not like most tactical level games on the market. First, it differs in scale - while units are relatively small (squads,individual teams and vehicles) the hexes are relatively large(approx. 150m). This was done to simulate the relative emptiness of the modern battlefield as compared to earlier conflicts. Modern combat units move slower and more cautiously due to the increased range and lethality of modern weapons. These factors explain why leg unit movement factors are low and there are no &lsquo;close assault&rsquo; rules like earlier conflict period tactical simulations.<br/><br/>Second, even though the battle was called Little Stalingrad, unlike the forces involved in that pivotal WW2 battle, the forces in these battles were very brittle. It did not take many setbacks and casualties before a side lost their aggressive spirit and will to fight. The central game mechanic that depicts this, which the player needs to manage, is initiative /Hesitation. Protecting your Initiative Level is critical to keeping your tactical options and chances for victory open. Initially the player with the highest initiative normally gets to activate first - especially if in a close quarters battle in the Terminals the ability to fire first or withdraw from a bad situation before the other side can fire can be critical. Later, if your initiative level drops to your Hesitation Level then your options become very limited. If on the Offensive, the player is left with ranged fire hoping to attrition the defender to victory. If on the Defensive, then the other player can be more aggressive and it becomes very hard to hold important objectives in the face of a determined assault. Therefore,being sensitive to casualties is critical to winning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Two Civil War Campaigns to take Richmond&rdquo;<br/><br/>In the spring of 1861, Richmond, Virginia became the capital of the Confederacy.  Being a manufacturing powerhouse only 120 miles from Washington DC and the Confederate capital, it became the focus of Union attention. The threat of capture by Federal forces was constant.<br/><br/>The Late Unpleasantness covers the two major attempts to capture the Confederate Capital City. Gates of Richmond covers the Seven Days Battles with Robert E Lee facing down George McClellan. If It Takes All Summer is Ulysses S Grant&rsquo;s overland campaign of 1864, which added the names of Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse and Cold Harbor to Civil War history.<br/><br/>Each game stands alone, but share the majority of rules. Simple enough to learn and play in an evening, but enough twists and turns to make you want to replay it until it is worn.<br/><br/>The maps use a point to point movement system, rather than hexes to simulate the campaigning over the road networks and river crossings, rather than mass movements cross country. Combat is integrated into the movement, making coordination of large bodies of troops difficult.<br/><br/>The Gates of Richmond map covers the area from Richmond in the west to the White House on the Pamunkey, and from Mechanicsville south to Harrison&rsquo;s Landing. Key features such as Malvern Hill, Beaver Dam Creek, and the bridges over White Oak swamp and the Chickahominy are highlighted. Will the Union army fail to attack the Richmond works as a result of &ldquo;Prince John&rdquo; Magruder&rsquo;s antics?<br/><br/>If It Takes All Summer covers most of Central Virginia, from Brandy Station and Culpeper to the Cold Harbor north east of Richmond. The Wilderness features prominently in the campaign with a special table to create some of the confusion as a result of fighting in this tangle.<br/><br/>The basic units are divisions (a bit larger than usual for Civil War, but right in this case). Each unit is listed for strength and overall leadership/morale quality.  Stacks are hidden for limited intelligence. Corps and Army leaders are available to modify the die roll in an attack as well as to help coordinate attacks from more than a single stack.<br/><br/>Sequence of play is straight forward with supply first.  Units out of supply suffer movement and combat penalties and those with a continued lack of supply will suffer attrition.  Confederate supply is a simple trace to either Richmond or a railroad, while the Union needs to relocate his base to keep his offensive moving.<br/><br/>Units move, then attack as a part of the stack&rsquo;s movement. Terrain, strength and leadership are all die roll modifiers, in combat. Combat losses are in terms of strength points, but a third die is rolled to determine if the combat ends in a retreat or continues. If it continues, you count it up and do it again. (and possibly again) If your leaders are good enough, they may be able to break off a losing battle.<br/><br/>Thrown into the mix are random events cards, but the game is not card driven. Each player can hold a hand of up to 10 cards, which can be played in nearly any combination and at any time (except during combat continuation). You use the cards to enhance your units or mess with the other player (ie. Grant steals a march - all Union units +2 MP this turn, or Rain - 1 left shift on all attacks) Others are one time events (Sedwick gets killed, Jackson falls asleep) that will ruin your perfect plan.<br/><br/>Each game can be picked up and learned in under 30 minutes, and played entirely through in 4 hours or less. The cards, leaders and Wilderness/Magruder tables add a level of chrome and history to the games without making them difficult. Combined with the hidden strengths and dummy counters, no two games are ever the same.<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 days (IITAS)<br/>            1 turn = 1/2 day(GOR)<br/>Map Scale: Point to point movement<br/>Unit Scale:  Divisions<br/>Players: 2 players<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Two 22 X 34 inch maps- One for each game<br/>Three Countersheets<br/>Two decks of 55 playing cards (1 for each game)<br/>Two Rulebooks (1 for each game) with examples of play<br/>Player Aid cards with Charts and Tables<br/>Three 6-sided dice<br/>One Box and Lid set<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game takes place in the medieval Europe where the players lead their estates as landlords. They must hurry with afforestation, regulation of rivers, and cultivating the fields to build a nicer and richer manor.<br/><br/>Each player rolls his 6 dice, then chooses one of them and draws the area corresponding to his number/colour on the map, then passes the other dice to the left neighbour using the dice holder and chooses one of the 5 dice he has, then passes this one and so on. When you run out of dice, the round is over and the next round begins in the same way. The game ends when all players have completed their map, i.e. filled in all the squares.<br/><br/>The player who scores the most points from building ponds, plough, forest, river, house wins. Each area has a different scoring system.<br/><br/>There are 2 variants of the game, one is a more tactical while the other one is faster. During the game common and hidden goal cards can be used optionally.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "4x4 (aka Vier mal Vier) is an abstract 4-in-a-row variant in which 2 players use 16 grooved cubes to erect a wall between them, aiming to be the first one to create a sequence of 4 identical shapes in their own side of a wall, or of all 4 different ones. This row can be horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The cubical building bricks are all unique, come in 4 colours, and the only placement restriction is that each colour is only allowed once in each level or column. When the last brick is added, the completed wall will be 4x4.<br/><br/>On 2 opposing faces of each cube, a groove has been carved out. There are 4 distinct grooves, and the twist is that these grooves rarely mirror each other on either side of a cube. Therefor the wall face will look completely different to each player. The grooves are paired in such a way that within each group of 4 identically coloured cubes, only one cube has an identical shape on both sides (a different one for each colour). The other combinations are unique for that colour, and each combo occurs only one other time within the entire set.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the cubes are placed on coloured supply strips which show the 4 'footprints' of all the blocks that exist for each colour. The wall is build on the table surface between the players. Players can only see the top cube of each column and the shape of the groove on their side of the wall of the cubes below it. Forward planning, memory skills and deduction all come into play to some extent, as players above all need to prevent that the opponent gets the sequence of 4 first. The supply strips serve as gentle reminders of what is out there.<br/><br/>The pro-version introduces the rule that an opponent can force a player to take back the last played cube if it would prevent the wall from completion, and instead insist on the placement of a cube that would result in a wall with the maximum amount of bricks. It also suggest the removal of the reminder strips.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the second promo tile for Lagoon: Land of Druids, introducing a new site type (Totem) with special rules given below.<br/><br/>Mytreia's Glory (Side Numbered 2A)<br/>Site type - Totem<br/>Energy - Elemeen/Vowelon/Deonin*<br/>If Mytreia's Glory is in play at the end of the game, seeds of the dominant energy are worth 2 Destiny Points instead of 1.<br/>- The infinity action type is new. It mean that the tile has end of game effects.<br/><br/>Cosmic Vault (Side Numbered 2B)<br/>Site type - Totem<br/>Energy - Astral*<br/>If the invoking druid's site is not a haven, gain 1 seed of that site's energy and move the invoking druid to any haven.<br/><br/>Triple Energy Rules<br/><br/>A site with all 3 energies provides 1 energy of your choice for unraveling. A site with all 3 energies can be unraveled using 3 of any other single energy &mdash; either 3 yellow, 3 red, or 3 blue.<br/><br/>Astral Energy Rules<br/><br/>Cosmic Vault is a site of the astral energy, identified by purple seed icons having a crystalline shape as well as a purple tile border. The astral energy is cosmic in nature &mdash; powerful, mysterious, and beyond human understanding.<br/><br/>The energy provided by occupying an astral site cannot be used to unravel any other site. However, an astral site can be unraveled. The required energy to unravel an astral site is three of any other single energy &mdash; either three yellow, three red, or three blue.<br/><br/>Astral sites also have the Astral keyword appearing in italics at the bottom of their text boxes. Whenever a player summons a druid, if any sites with the Astral keyword are on the board, they may choose for the summoned druid to enter play on a site with the Astral keyword instead of on a haven site. Sites with the Astral keyword do not count as havens in any way, however.<br/><br/>Totem Site Type Rules<br/><br/>When a totem site is unraveled, its tile is not removed from play like all other sites. Instead, when a totem site is unraveled, flip that site tile over to the site on the other side. The new site occupies the same position on the board as the original site. Additionally, all druids on the original site, including the unraveling druid, are transferred to the new site exhausted. The unraveling druid is not returned to its owner&rsquo;s supply.<br/><br/>Note that, like any locked site, a locked totem site cannot be unraveled.<br/><br/>Promo Tile Setup Rules<br/><br/>To use the promo tile in a game of Lagoon, setup the game in the normal way. Then add the promo tile to the starting tile setup, adjacent to the two non-haven sites. Either side of the promo tile can begin face up.<br/><br/>",

Bound by the code of neighbourly conduct, the actions you take will also help your opponent but at the end of the season, there can only be one Master of Maple Syrup.<br/><br/>In Masters of Maple Syrup, players develop their property tableaus by adding trees to harvest sap from and utilities to improve their syrup production. On their turn, the active player determines the action both players will take, with a slight advantage in their favour.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of a round where any player has placed 10 cards on their property (tableau). Scores are tallied from the value of cards on each players&rsquo; properties and any additional scoring bonuses the cards offer. The player with the highest value on their property wins.<br/><br/>Time your actions and develop a property to best benefit from your neighbour's actions in a cozy cabin game for two.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Panzers East Solitaire&quot; is a simulation wargame that covers the advance of Germany&rsquo;s Army Group Center, starting on the first day of Operation Barbarossa and potentially extending to the last day of August later that same summer. The design supports both strict historical and alternative history explorations. That is, at the end of July, when the AGC offensive was historically shut down in favor of supporting extended drives by the flanking army groups, it&rsquo;s possible that, if you&rsquo;ve done better up to then than your historical counterpart, Hitler may authorize a continued and immediate advance on Moscow. You command the German forces while the system directs the handling of Soviet forces. You win or lose based on the timely seizure of key areas on the map.<br/><br/>Each game turn equals one-third of a month. Each hexagon represents 16 miles (24 km) from side to opposite side.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>World at War Magazine #45, DEC 2015 &ndash; JAN 2016<br/><br/>",
