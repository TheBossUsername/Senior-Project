Here are the differences from Khet:<br/><br/>     In Khet, the laser is always moving orthogonally.  In Laser Battle, the laser must be bounced at the proper angle off pieces which can be rotated to 16 different angles (22&frac12;&deg; increments: 0&deg;, 22&frac12;&deg;, 45&deg;, and so forth), which reflects the laser orthogonally and/or diagonally, at the players' discretion (or error!).<br/>     In Khet, the laser is fired from the walls of the game board.  In Laser Battle, the laser is being fired by a unit, which you may rotate for very surprising victory.<br/>     In Khet, each player must fire the laser after her move.  In Laser Battle, firing the laser is optional, allowing both sloppier play and stealthier play.<br/>     Khet has a fixed game board (and a moveable / roteable mirrored second-floor with the Khet 3D: Tower of Kadesh expansion).  The board in Laser Battle is modular (single-floor), allowing for numerous configurations.<br/>     A Laser Battle set comes with extra headdresses for the pieces so you can buy a second identical set, and play with up to four players.  Also, it is available in two color schemes, which could allow for an eight-player laser frenzy!<br/>     There are only three types of pieces in Laser Battle.  Khet has four types in the basic game, and a fifth (Khet: Eye of Horus Beam Splitter) in an expansion.<br/><br/><br/>The Tower has 6 light sensors &ndash; and when hit by the laser it flashes red lights and makes an explosion sound, which signals the end of a game.<br/><br/>This game was the subject of a lawsuit in which the designer of Khet: The Laser Game brought suit against MGA Entertainment and the court found Laser Battle as infringing.<br/><br/>",

You'll never outrun it!&quot; yells the guy who is still moving. &quot;I don't need to outrun the bear,&quot; replies the first (who by now has rapidly overtaken his friend). &quot;I just need to outrun YOU.&quot;<br/><br/>Between three and eight players will be able to force and fight their way to the front of the pack, leaving their friends behind as The Bear gets ever closer. Each player has a rapidly diminishing hand of cards and one must be played every turn. Roll a die to see how fast you're going, but don't forget the modifier on the card you've put down! Some cards allow you to get more in your hand, keeping you in the game longer. Others will let you attack your opponents, pushing them ever closer to that ever-chasing bear.

Each turn players have the chance to expand their city by zoning vacant land as residential, commercial or industrial.  Money allows players to buy roads to connect their zones. Points are earned by growing your city's population and by employing them with jobs - commercial banker, farmer, forester, miner, or driller. As the population and job opportunities expand, players have the opportunity to upgrade their zones and earn money, both of which earn players even more points. Soon after the game starts, new skyscrapers begin to sprout up across the region, players' zones begin to compete for resources and space, and strategic playing becomes an engaging and critical element to each city's success!<br/><br/>As each player's city grows, resources and purchase power becomes limited. No city can grow unchecked forever! When the resources from one sector are used up, they are gone forever. Strategic players will develop a diverse and thriving city and amass wealth, and maybe even collaborate with a neighboring city.... Game ends when all resources have been used up. Points are awarded based on number of jobs, number of skyscrapers and amount of saved money.<br/><br/>Players will enjoy the uniqueness of every new game of CITY that they play! Change in board layout and zoning options means each game of CITY is completely different and guaranteed to be awesome!<br/><br/>",

If you're the only one to swat a card, you claim it; if multiple people swat a card, then whoever &quot;rolled&quot; the highest number with the die in their flyswatter wins the card. The only exception: If you rolled a number that matches the number on the card, then the bug is killed and removed from play!<br/><br/>You continue taking turns until someone has collected five cards, then you see who has the largest collection of cards all in the same color, all with the same number, or with none of the cards having the same number or color. Whoever has this largest collection wins the round and collects a fly-hunter token. You then shuffle all the cards to begin a new round, and whoever first collects three fly-hunter tokens wins!<br/><br/>",

Who can clean up the cards the fastest, while also lining up cards that match one another?<br/><br/>In Connect the Thoughts &ndash; first released as Kuddelmuddel, which is German for &quot;hodgepodge&quot; &ndash; players try to put together chains of cards in order to score points. To set up the game, the players scatter the 80 cards in the deck face down on the table and place the bell within reach of all players. Everyone then simultaneously starts looking at face-down cards one by one. You can place the first card you see face up to start a row in front of you. To place another card next to this first one, whether on the left or right, the newly placed card must have at least one image in common with the card already in place.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has seven matching cards in a row, she rings the bell. If she goofed up, she sits out the round until another player creates a row; if she did everything correctly, she scoops up those cards and places them in a pile beside her while all other players reshuffle their cards into those that remain on the table.<br/><br/>The game ends whenever the last card is taken from the center of the table. Whoever has collected the most cards (i.e., rows) wins!<br/><br/>",

During that time, we have ended up in many hotel room parties, hanging with tons of different types of people from all walks of geek culture. (Hey, it's not a really great convention if you don't try to drink a Klingon under the table. Protip: you can't drink a Klingon under the table.)<br/><br/>The idea of Room Party is to take what makes those weird shindigs either awesome or horrifying, and turn it into a hilarious interactive experience for your next soir&eacute;e.<br/><br/>The goal is simple: Build the most awesome room party at the convention.<br/><br/>It's fun, easy to play and different every time you do. You can play with 2+ people, the more the merrier. There are different variations for more competitive play, or you can relax and just have a good laugh with your friends as you build your parties and sabotage one another!<br/><br/>",

Two tiles of each colour are 'triples' and have three spots the same.  The remaining tiles are all unique, and each colour has exactly 33 spots.<br/><br/>Each player picks three tiles and a player is chosen to start the game.  Play is simple, place a tile to the table on either side of an already placed tile.  Once a row of 11 tiles is formed, a new row must be started.  The player then draws to refill his hand to three.<br/><br/>Whenever three or more spots of a colour exist, a player scores one point for each spot, diagonal lines count double.   A player who plays a 'triple' automatically gains at least three points.<br/><br/>The game ends when four rows have been completed... all 44 tiles are played.  The player who scored the highest total wins.<br/><br/>In the German/Dutch/French/Nordic versions of Domingo (published by Ravensburger), there are 48 tiles, but the game otherwise appears to be identical.<br/><br/>",

Players try to get the most valuable cards while avoiding a visit from the Big Bad Wolf! On a player's turn, they may choose to (1) offer a hand card to the opponent (who may refuse), or (2) play a card and execute the ability. Players alternate turns until no one has any cards in hand, and the round scoring takes place. The game is played for a number of rounds until one player has scored 11 or more points to become the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Assassin's Creed: Arena &ndash; based on the Assassin's Creed video game series from Ubisoft &ndash; players compete to uncover the best targets for assassination, but before you can go in for the kill, sometimes you have to deal with pesky guards as well as your opponents. Players will collect cards and treasure, move guards, and hide within the city of Constantinople until they find their time to strike. Combat is handled through cardplay, and the player who best manages his cards will have the best chance at victory.<br/><br/>At the start of each player's turn, he draws an Event card, which can spawn new targets in the outer city, move guards, or allow you to find a tunnel to another section of the city. Moving guards is a great way to get them away from you and place them near your opponents. Targets cannot be assassinated while a guard is nearby, but fortunately the guards can be dispatched if need be.<br/><br/>Cards in hand drive the action, but they are also your hit points. If you run out of cards in hand, you die &mdash; but just like in a video game, you will soon respawn at your starting area. Moving and attacking targets (or your fellow players) requires playing cards, so doing too much all at once can be risky. Couple that with trying to avoid the guards and you are in for a tension-filled game of cat-and-mouse. To replenish your hand, complete objectives on your movement cards or hide. Hiding in the outer city is easy and grants you lots of extra cards. When you enter the merchant district or the area around the palace, there just aren&rsquo;t as many places to hide and you will not draw many cards.<br/><br/>Combat is handled through cardplay. No dice are required, although a six-sided die is included to resolve some guard movement. Do you save your best cards for movement or to go in for the kill? He who risks the most has the chance for the most reward!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Become a witch and enter the medieval world of Wickersby in this worker placement, resource management game with spellcasting! Make villagers fall in love, turn them into frogs, or teleport them to different locations. Use your familiars to gather ingredients and cast spells on the villagers to achieve goals and score victory points as you vie to be named the village crone.<br/><br/>All the players are witches who have come upon a medieval village without a crone. They send out familiars to gather ingredients they can use in spells to complete Witch's Scheme cards. Each of the cards is worth 1, 2, or 3 points, which also indicates how difficult the scheme is to complete. The witch who scores 13 points wins.<br/><br/>The village consists of 6 location game boards: village green, lord's manor, farm, mill, forge, and tithe barn. The locations are modular and can be placed in any order or configuration as long as the gridlines line up. (The easiest way to play is with a 3x2 retangular configuration.)<br/><br/>The villagers, who are the most frequent targets of the Witch's Schemes, have starting locations. The peasant begins in the village green, the lord in the lord's manor, the farmer in the farm, the miller in the mill, the blacksmith in the forge, and the priest in the tithe barn.<br/><br/>The ingredients can be found at 4 of the 6 locations. Silver is in the lord's manor, soil in the farm, flour in the mill, and fire in the forge. There are also 3 eye of newt cards in each stack of ingredients and can be used as wild cards in spells.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt 1 of each of the 3 levels of Witch's Scheme cards. Consulting their Books of Spells (which are the same for each witch) to determine which ingredients will be needed to cast the spells on their Witch's Scheme cards, they put 1 familiar in the village green, take turns placing 2 additional familiars in other locations, and draw 2 ingredients from those locations.<br/><br/>The first step in the order of play is to tithe. As soon as each player knows which ingredient they will sacrifice, they place it facedown in the tithe barn. This seeds the tithe barn with ingredients that can be gleaned with the Fortune spell (which allows a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn). However, any player who placed a familiar in the tithe barn does not have to tithe.<br/><br/>Then, in turn order, players may move their own familiars and/or villagers and cast spells. (Spells may be cast for strategic or tactical purposes as well as to complete Witch's Schemes.) The movement is limited to a total of 6 spaces, and the number of spells is limited only by the ingredients the player has. The movement and spellcasting can be in any order on a player's turn. A player can even intersperse movement and spellcasting. If a player completes a Witch's Scheme, the card is turned over so that the other players can clearly see how many points that player has. After he/she is finished moving and casting spells, he/she draws 1 of each of the 3 levels of cards, reads them, and decides which one(s) to add to his/her hand as replacements.<br/><br/>When all players have finished moving and casting spells, the players harvest 2 ingredients for each familiar in a location, and the broom (which indicates the first player) is moved clockwise.<br/><br/>The spells are Conjuring (to add up to 2 more familiars into play), Love (to join the fates of 2 villagers, meaning spells cast on one affect the other and movement of one moves the other), Transformation (to turn a villager into a frog or vice versa), Binding (to lock a location down and prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving a location), Switching (to change the place of 2 familiars and/or villagers), Summoning (to cause a villager to move to a location containing one of the player's familiars), Fortune (to allow a player to draw any 3 ingredients from the tithe barn), and Protection (to block a spell cast by another player). 1 silver can also be used to complete a Scheme out of turn or to discard and draw a new Witch's Scheme card. Each spell requires not only ingredients but also an incantation, which is provided in the Book of Spells. Alternatively, players can make up their own incantations. If a player is caught trying to complete a spell without speaking the incantation, the spell does not work.<br/><br/>Each witch has access to the same number of starting familiars, the same ingredients, the same spells, and 3 Schemes of the same level. But the witch who most cleverly uses these resources to reach 13 points is named the village crone.<br/><br/>The Village Crone also includes rules for solitaire play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epic Seven Arise is the tabletop adaptation of the Epic Seven mobile game that depicts heroes attempting to save the seventh world from destruction.<br/><br/>In the game, each player takes the role of a hero heir &mdash; a being created by the Goddess of Life, Diche &mdash; to protect the world of Orbis from the Archdemon and the Acolytes. Each hero comes with a skill deck representing their unique set of skills. During play, heroes must manage their actions and coordinate with the team, moving to the locations under the most threat and doing battle with enemies, ideally finding time to recover and purchase items between engagements as they prepare to defeat the monsters and enemies.<br/><br/>The game has multiple chapters, and each of them has a similar structure of main plot and side quests. If any hero dies during the round, they suffer a penalty, but can be revived in the next round. As long as one of you is still alive, you still have a chance to win. The chapters are all standalone and not contingent on being played in a certain order or with the same players.<br/><br/>The board game significantly broadens the original game's universe and emphasizes the depth of the plot, yet its main focus is on interaction driven by game stories and decision making.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game features a flat, 2-D board with a plastic, 3D inner ring and catwalk that are raised off of the regular board.  The rebels and R2 units look like the Rebel Commandos from the Endor assault and R2-D2 from Return of the Jedi.  The stormtrooper is a larger plastic mini, and used during the game when you roll a 1 (a stormtrooper helmet on the die).  The game is played in real-time, and the typical game lasts about 45-60 minutes.  The video tape is 60 minutes long.  Darth Vader does speak to you from time to time on the video tape (yes, you'll have to have a VCR for this game), and it's fairly cool to watch the video just by itself.  The video also has some elements of gameplay in them, as well as original music, video clips and the ending sequence of the destruction of the planet (in case you fail) is of the original Death Star blowing up Alderaan (from Ep4).<br/><br/>When setting up, you choose a color for your rebel and R2 unit.  Then, you put your R2 unit in the droid control center and the rebel in the hanger bay.  Then place the stormtrooper in the Stormtrooper control center.  You then take 6 explosives and place them near you.  You also shuffle and deal out the Rebel Mission Card.  This tells you the rooms you need to plant explosives in and the key cards you need to obtain to enter the inner level.  You then start the VHS tape.  Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) will come on and goad you.  You then begin play.  As stated above, play is in real-time, so you have to play quickly.  The objective is to plant your explosives and disable the Death Star II (turn off the VHS tape) before it reaches D'rinba IV.  The video is 60 minutes long, with movie scenes from the original trilogy and good music.  If you get caught by the stormtrooper, you get put into the detention block, and either have to have a card that gets you out or wait for the video to play &quot;detention block escape.&quot;  After 30 minutes or so, the player with the most amount of dark side points becomes Vader's &quot;pupil.&quot;  The Pupil is just like the stormtrooper, only you get to search rooms, attack your fellow rebels and foil their plans.  If there is a tie, then the youngest player gets to be the pupil.  It's a fast-paced fun board game that is sorely lacking these days.  This should be re-released with the movie on DVD.<br/><br/>",

Fly High is a quick-playing memory game of flying high and low and pushing the luck to score the most points.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you lay out a 3x3 grid of cards face down which are valued 10-60 (jumping up by tens). On your turn, you roll dice to determine a minimum number of cards you must turn face up. Now try to fly high by finding the right cards to go up in ascending order. If you flip a card that has the same value or lower, then all cards are turned face down again and it is the next player's turn. Try to push your luck and flip more cards than the dice tells you, and maybe you can even earn a set of three cards of the same color for bonus points.<br/><br/>When you score, you remove cards, then fill the gaps in the grid. When the deck runs out, the game ends, and whoever has earned the most cards wins!<br/><br/>",

Players will race to the top of the galactic corporate ladder.<br/><br/>Each player uses their spaceship token to hyper jump around the section of space to make their mark in the most powerful corporation in the galaxy.  The section of space is comprised of 80 cards setup in an 8 x 10 grid. When a player lands on an unexplored card, they flip it over to reveal what is there. Before the game begins, each player is given 5 Career Goal cards they must complete.<br/><br/>The progression of game play is divided into Fiscal Periods and each fiscal period is done in steps:<br/>Step 1. Solar Jellies Move and Spawn<br/>Step 2. Players receive their budgets<br/>Step 3. Players spend 1 photon to File Paperwork to the corporation.<br/>Step 4. Players choose ** to do an action or enter a coordinate on their dual dials. Then, dials are revealed. Actions happen before movements.<br/>Step 5. Players repeat by Filing Paperwork and moving/doing actions (Step 3-4) until all players run out of Photons or choose not to File Paperwork.<br/><br/>Players File Paperwork in order to complete Career Goals that allow them to influence five departments. When a player completes a goal, they flip that card over next to their Player Board and put in the appropriate amount of influence cards to the Department Heads Board.<br/><br/>The players use what they find as they reveal the section of space (grid of cards) to fulfill career goal conditions:<br/>1. Destroy 1 space pirate<br/>2. Upgrade your spaceship to level 3 (if you have 2 of this goal, the second goal is completed by upgrading to a level 4)<br/>3. Find 2 relics (to complete the goal subsequent times, you only need 1 relic for each Career Goal card)<br/>4. Give 3 photons to the Accounting Department<br/>5. Destroy 5 Space Jellies (to complete the goal subsequent times, you only need to destroy 2 more Space Jellies for each Career Goal card)<br/><br/>When one player completes their fifth and final Career Goal, a vote is triggered. The player that completes their final Career Goal stops playing and all other players are allowed to spend their remaining Photons for that fiscal period (unless they also complete their final career goal, at which point they stop as well).<br/><br/>Each of the five department piles of influence cards are shuffled separately.  One card is drawn from each department pile.  A player wins by having a majority (3 out of 5 departments) of their cards drawn.  If no hard majority exists, the player who gets 2 soft majorities (2 out of 5 departments, twice) wins.  The player with the most votes wins the job of Galactic CEO!<br/><br/>",

The longer trains you manage to build, the more points you earn for the transported people and goods. Try to make your train arrive to the finish line!<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they roll dice with train cars and locomotives on them. After each roll, the player has to put aside one type of the car, to build the train. At the end of the turn, the player must meet the following conditions: at least one locomotive at the beginning, at least one passenger car, and at least one boxcar. Boxcars may not be in front of the passenger. After the train is ready to go, the player advances their corresponding score tokens depending on cars in the train - different for passengers, three types of goods and locomotives. When one player reaches the end of the score track, all players score points depending on the order in which the tokens are, and the corresponding tokens get reset. When the locomotives go back and forth the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Action is fast paced and tension-filled as characters exchange blows, fire spells, and even attempt to backstab. It is the fantasy battle at its best. <br/>More than simply hack and slash, strategy IS the key to victory, with cunning and skill playmg a central role in your success. Game play is an exercise in diplomacy and subterfuge, as ﻿treaties and trickery can make all the difference between victory and defeat. <br/>While The Challenge is easy to learn (start playing in less than 15 minutes), it has a depth far beyond that of the typical card game. With its excitment filled, strategy oriented, fullthrottled action, The Challenge is sure to become a classic. If you always loved combat the best ... take The Challenge.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play:<br/><br/>The player who rolled the high die goes first. Play moves clockwise around the table. The player can either challenge an opponent, pass, or declare a defensive turn.<br/><br/>﻿1) Challenge another character by using a Weapon Action Card, casting a spell (Advanced), using a magic item (Advanced) or using a thief skill (Advanced) from one of your characters against another character in another party. Both Character Cards involved are turned face-up (if they are not already). Then the defending player may retaliate with any appropriate card or pass. The challenging player may then continue by playing an appropriate Action Card or passing, followed by the defending player, etc., until both players have passed or one of the two characters involved in the challenge has died. After the challenge is resolved, the player whose tum it is can move one of his characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw from the Action Deck(s) until he has seven cards. The player that was defending in the challenge cannot discard, but can refill his hand up to seven. It is then the next player's tum.<br/><br/>﻿2) Pass - Do no actions, moving of characters, or discarding of cards.<br/><br/>﻿3) Defensive turn - You can't play any Action Card that directly affects another party. Play party Defensive Cards (Advanced), allocate Magic Cards (Advanced) to characters, move any number of characters from one rank to another, discard any number of Action Cards, and draw up to seven cards from either the Weapon Action deck or the Mystic Action deck (Advanced). Remember, you can't do two defensive turns back-to- back.<br/><br/>",

Played in a zero-G court, the two six-man teams try to score with a five-kilogram steel playing ball.  Anything can happen in the meantime!  Legal actions include body, hand, and foot checks, passes, and actual goal shots.  Illegal actions, or actions requiring a penalty check, include striking with the ball or elbow, shooting the player with the ball, and all-out assaults.  The usual result of such body contact is a high player turnover rate.  The player's body armor does not guarantee physical safety from opposing players or from the ball itself.  If the game gets too rough or a fight occurs, Heartless Huey is released.  This invulnerable robot will incapacitate the nearest player.

For example, if an Owl 4 card is led, the next player may play an Owl 3 below it, an Owl 5 above it, or a 4 card from a different patrol (say a Wolf 4) adjacent to it (thus allowing Wolf cards to be played). The lead card designates the number that all other patrols must start on (in this example number 4). If a player has no legal play he must pass. The first player to play his last card scores points equal to the numbers on all the cards still in the other players hands. A Patrol Leader card counts as 15 points for scoring. The first player to score 250 points wins.<br/><br/>According to the Dutch rules from publisher Goliath Games, the number of Patrols used in a game is equal to the number of players (e.g. only use 3 Patrols in a three player game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TRANGLAR (pronounced &quot;Tr&agrave;nglar&quot;) is an abstract strategy game for 2 players with various, multi shaped, colored pieces that players are trying to play onto the board. It is a straightforward yet intelligent game, created to challenge both new and experienced gamers. It plays in around 15-25 minutes, ideal for a quick and challenging gaming experience. Each piece is made up of triangles and has a different color on each side, one for each player, while neutral pieces have the same color on both sides.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Tranglar Game Board<br/>42 game pieces (17 for each player, 8 neutral)<br/><br/>Goal of the Game:<br/><br/>Each player has to place as many of their pieces on the board in order to take over as much space on it as possible. To achieve this they must place their pieces on the board in such a way that they are protected and as to take over their opponents&rsquo; pieces by encircling them and flipping them to their color.<br/><br/>Turn Overview:<br/><br/>During their turn each player can take one of the four following actions:<br/><br/>1. Place a new piece of your color on the board in a valid position. Valid positions are the ones that are unoccupied on the board, and not encircled by the opponents&rsquo; pieces. The board is divided in small triangle slots. The piece you place, must take up the total area of the triangles they cover.<br/><br/>2. Replace a piece that is already on the board with other/s of yours. This action allows you to replace one of your pieces which is already placed on the board with more pieces that take up the exact same area, and you have available outside the board, or two or more adjacent pieces you own, which are already placed on the board, with one piece that takes up the exact same area.<br/><br/>3. Attack an opponent&rsquo;s piece (stealing a piece). This action allows you to steal any one of the opponents' pieces which is already on the board: flip it to your color side and place it outside the board with the rest of your pieces. Then you are obliged to cover that space with at least two of your own pieces which equal in size to the area of the piece you took.<br/><br/>4. You can pass your turn. It is probably not a frequent case, but if it is not possible to do any of the above-described actions or for any reason you wish, you can forfeit your turn.<br/><br/>End of Game:<br/><br/>The player with the most with the most triangular slots on the board with their color, wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The time of the sympathy strike and negotiations of the 21 Demands with the government delegation, completed by signing the August Agreements and the emergence of Solidarność (the Solidarity movement), is the period when Lech Wałęsa scaled the shipyard fence and became not only the leader of the opposition, but also a front-page public figure. Because of the strike, he became the head of Solidarity, received the Nobel Peace Prize, and was elected President of the Republic of Poland.<br/><br/>You begin the game with only your quick wit and gift of the gab. Everybody in turn controls the actions of Lech Wałęsa, gaining support for the strike in the shipyard. You use walking and running cards to move Wałęsa around the board. You use speech cards to win over the workers and residents of Gdańsk. With them on his side, Wałęsa draws the attention of foreign correspondents. Press interviews inform the entire country of the shipbuilders&rsquo; struggle, which causes other groups to join the strike, and the shipyard is visited by delegates of MKS (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy: the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee) and the MKS Committee of Experts under Tadeusz Mazowiecki. Being certain of support from the delegates and experts, you can attempt to negotiate the strike demands. The winner is the person who, as Lech Wałęsa, is the first to gain 2 demand cards.<br/><br/>Will you be able to win over the crowd, gain favor in the eyes of the world, and lead the strike to victory?<br/><br/>",

During the game if you sell a good of that type you remove the corresponding good card from one of your compartments.<br/><br/>The game is divided into moving rounds (2 in between each station) and selling rounds (when the train is at a station). During a moving round a player can move one of his mobsters, steal an item from another player, seek protection money from another player which may lead to a duel, or attack another player's mobster (the loser in a duel or attack is removed from the train).<br/>During a selling round, a player may sell items from a train car that contains one of his mobsters. Sold good cards are removed from the game and protection money is paid if owed.<br/><br/>The game ends when the train reaches Moscow and the final selling round is done.

        "description": "Sparta vs. Athens is a strategic level wargame of the Peloponnesian War in it's entirety, spanning twenty-eight years, from 431 B.C. to 404 B.C. The map is a point-to-point map, using city-states and the common land and navigable sea routes as the conduits that defined the Grecian Mediterranean. The game is designed for simple movement and combat mechanics to resolve battles and sieges, all centered upon the predominance of famous and historic leaders (e.g., Alcibiades). The game is richly historic, and keeps players within historic parameters in such a way that alliances and politics can shift, depending on how the war is going, but only within the limits of historic possibilities. Some city-states of the Delos Confederation may ally with Athens, while others may ally with Sparta, for example. Athens vs Sparta includes four scenarios: The Archidamian War (431 - 422), The Peace of Nicias and the Sicilian Expedition (421 &ndash; 413), The Ionian War (412 &ndash; 404), and the campaign scenario covering the entire war.<br/><br/>The game includes one 22x34&quot; map of the Grecian Mediterranean, including Sicily and southern Italy, and as far east as the Persian empire, 280 counters of all participants in the Peloponnesian War. Each game turn is played as four seasons of one year. Each inch equals ~18 miles. One naval strength point represents 5 galleys of the era (Triremes), and one land strength point represents 350 to 450 heavy infantry (Hoplites) or 500 to 600 light infantry or 200 to 300 cavalry.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters.<br/><br/>",

No one knows which ships you're betting on to bring in the biggest haul, but at the same time, you're in the dark as to what the other fishermen are doing, too.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives seven cards from a deck of 28, with each color appearing four times. Players simultaneously pass one card to the left. The four colors of cards match the colors of ships that start in the harbor. Six cards are shuffled and laid in a row from the harbor, with each card having 0-3 fish. Each player starts with one resource cube, and 15 journey tiles are shuffled and laid face down.<br/><br/>On a turn, you announce that you're revealing 1-3 journey tiles &mdash; gaining a resource cube if you say 1 and paying one if you say 3. You then reveal those tiles, then move one of the ships depicted on one tile one space forward. (Alternatively, if you reveal the pirate tile, all other players must discard a resource cube.) Instead of revealing tile, you can discard one of your cards in hand face down to move one ship forward or backward one space. You cannot move a ship to the final space this way. If fewer than four tiles are face down at the start of your turn, place them all face down, shuffle them, then continue.<br/><br/>When a ship reaches the final space, the game ends. Each player then reveals their cards, and each card is worth as many fish as the space occupied by the ship of the same color. Whoever has caught the most total fish wins!<br/><br/>",

Players could prepare their own circuits with use of supplied segments with curves and straights. In the 2007/2012 game editions arrangement of the track spaces has changed for better determining the order of the moves in the turn.<br/><br/>In every turn the players set the speed of their cars and try to drive through curves without an accident to reach the finish line before opponents.<br/><br/>When safe speed for the curve is exceeded, the player has to roll the dice specified number of times to check if the car would stay on the track after breaking or if the accident (and some damage to the tyres) would happen.<br/><br/>The cars are equipped with some amount of tyres tokens, which are used during the game when players brake hard, or accelerate to indicate the tyres wear. In 2007/2012 game editions there are only tyre tokens - in the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; there were cards (&quot;Tyres&quot; and &quot;Brakes&quot;) to indicate damage points after hard breaking. Tyre wear is regulated by penalty charts. Set of tyres could be changed (supplemented) in the pit stop during the race.<br/><br/>The game box contains:<br/><br/>     16 double-sided track segments (8 squares, 8 triangles) with straights and curves with different safe speeds<br/>     6 plastic race cars<br/>     6 speedometers (dashboards) with movable speed indicator<br/>     174 tire counters<br/>     1 dice<br/>     polish instruction<br/><br/><br/>Publisher/Game website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.granna.pl/produkt,wielki-wyscig\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.granna.pl/produkt,wielki-wyscig</a><br/><br/>",

Each card can block, and be blocked by, certain cards, and each card you play will generally find itself into your opponent's hand. When you play a card that your opponent cannot block, you win the round and score points according to the winning card. The game is played over multiple rounds until one player scores at least fifteen points, winning the game.<br/><br/>This is a game about forcing your opponent to react, so as to maneuver them into a position where they cannot do so. As such, good play is about enforcing deadlock until you are able to break it in your favor. If the mandatory reactions in the same designer's Table Battles get on your nerves, then this one probably isn't for you, because that is in effect the entirety of the game.<br/><br/>This is the third of Hollandspiele's annual holiday mini-games, packed in as a free promotional item on any order of at least two games during their 2018 December sale. Afterward, it will be made available for purchase as a downloadable PNP game.<br/><br/>",

But when it formed, it instantly became an exit point &ndash; a extra focus &ndash; for every wormhole in the entire galactic octant; the same wormholes used for interstellar travel by every starfaring species. Soon, a human starship found the Nexus, by the simple process of noticing the alternate exit point while traversing one of those wormholes. The commercial and navigational value of the nexus was obvious, and the humans began exploiting the asteroid field surrounding the exit point. They hollowed out the largest asteroid creating the core module in preparation for building a full-blown space station.<br/><br/>Led by those same wormholes, other starships soon showed up. Then more. Now all alien civilizations want access to the Nexus. Rather than see bloodshed, the humans, ensconced in place, offered to let all share the Nexus peacefully. The humans would build the space station modules, ensuring compatibility, but the aliens would purchase and own the modules themselves. In effect, the aliens became outside investors &ndash; potentially controlling investors &ndash; thus Startropolis was born!<br/><br/>You are the alien CEO of one of these galactic corporations, and your masters have given you seed money. What will you purchase? A solar power monopoly? Luxury habitats? Will you outperform your competition, and prove your dominance?<br/><br/>Startropolis is a modular 3-D space station game for 2-4 people. Each turn, players buy modules and connect them to the existing space station. This creates revenue, and allows them to purchase more modules. The player with the most credits at game end wins.<br/><br/>",

Components: A 80x64 cms board, 144 counters, rules book and one six sided die.<br/><br/>It is part of a series of simple wargames edited in Spain by NAC in the 80s. This one covers the whole European theater of WW2, and while being the one that simplifies the most the combat mechanics (counters have just the nationality symbol, no movement/combat factors), it delivers many of the choices that were taken during the conflict: the Axis has an initial superiority, though not enough to fight a blitzkrieg on all fronts, and has to choose between a conservative approach on the East to try and take the Western powers out of the game before the US enters the war, or attack the USSR earlier than 41 before it is ready to battle back, and prepare an &quot;Atlantic Wall&quot;... without neglecting the North African shores!<br/><br/>A simple game that allows you and your friends to reenact the European WW2 in less than 2h.<br/><br/>",

Once a player has claimed dice, this player rerolls all the remaining dice. If no match can be found, the first player to yell &quot;Nada!&quot; and cover the dice with her hand claims all the remaining dice. Players tally their scores &ndash; one point for each die collected &ndash; then play another round. Whoever has the highest score after three rounds wins!<br/><br/>Nada! includes variant rules for two other games. In one, the players use all 36 dice at once, playing as above but most likely scoring more points each time since more dice will be in play. The round ends after all dice of one color have been claimed, and the player who collects the most dice wins.<br/><br/>In the other variant, players start the game by secretly drawing 8, 12 or 16 dice from the bag (with the number based on the number of players). On a turn, each player chooses 2-4 dice from his stock, then all players roll their dice simultaneously, claiming dice as explained above. The players take back any unclaimed dice, then choose 2-4 dice again for the next turn. Once a player has no more dice in hand, the game ends, and the player who has collected the most dice wins.<br/><br/>",

Victory points (VPs) can be won by collecting creatures, completing missions, building your research lab, and smacking down your enemies! Creature College is played in three university terms: Spring, Autumn and Winter. Each term consists of three bidding rounds and one battle round. At the end of twelve rounds the game ends and the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>To start the game, every player takes a player mat, a set of bidding tokens, and playing pieces in their color. Three ability cards are then dealt to each player from which they can choose one. The ability cards allow them to personalize their player a little. The ability card sits face up in the space provided on the player mat. They then take three missions and again choose one. The missions come in 15, 20 and 25 VP types and show a set of cards the player must collect to complete the mission. The mission card sits face down in the space provided on the player mat.<br/><br/>In the bidding round, a number of creature cards are laid face up in the play area (determined by number of players). The players bid in player order (determined by who bid highest in the previous bidding round) if someone is outbid they have to move to a different creature card. Once all bidding has been completed, the players roll two dice and either take research lab cards to fill their research lab slots or battle cards to help them in battle. If Kevin the Giga-Pig has turned up during the bidding phase, all players must now try and battle Kevin. After three bidding rounds, there is a battle round. In player order, players now fight the players either side of them by choosing one or more cards in a single suit, tapping the card (by turning it 90&ordm;) and choosing to fight right or left players first. Battle cards may be added in each battle separately, and if the attacking player wins, they get green gems; if they lose, red gems.<br/><br/>",

The stone pillars of fate are falling apart while your carpenters and shipwrights toil ceaselessly building new ships for your people to escape from the mythical island before it is swallowed completely by the hungry ocean &mdash; and yet the senators and political factions still bicker for power, heedless of the tragedy of their nation. It is your sole responsibility to manipulate their decisions for the good of your vassals. You will have to evacuate as many as you can to the New Land using different fantastic vessels, hoping that the Atlaneans will recover and their legacy will endure for millennia to come.<br/><br/>End of Atlantis: Revised Edition, created by the acclaimed Polish game designer Marcin Wełnicki, is an upgraded and reinvented version of a great and masterfully illustrated game of strategy based on a unique action execution and resource management system. Each player will use various methods to achieve victory: senate factions that provide different abilities, politics cards with different actions, and special cards that change the flow of the game. You should also keep in mind that as the game progresses, global events will unfold - if used to your advantage, they may push you ahead or completely hamper your doings... and that's on top of other players plotting against you!<br/><br/>In comparison to the first edition of End of Atlantis, some major changes have been made. Firstly, the game is shorter and more dynamic thanks to completely new event cards which now affect the game from the very first round. At the same time, it's also more strategic as you can see future event cards and plan accordingly. Secondly, the mechanism used for choosing senate factions has been simplified and the factions themselves have many new, exciting functions and abilities. Thirdly, many politics cards have wider applications, allowing players to affect the game flow in more profound ways and giving them more flexibility in adjusting to the current in-game situation. Finally, the game and its rules have been generally streamlined and clarified with long card descriptions gone - &quot;End of Atlantis: Revised Edition&quot; is now fully language independent; you just need to master a few intuitive icons and keep on playing!<br/><br/>Think, scheme and manipulate, and use every trick and tool at your disposal to secure your place among the survivors of the New Land &mdash; and whatever you do, remember that every alliance is easily broken in the face of the apocalyptic disaster that awaits just beyond the horizon!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In a galaxy far far away, there is a planetary system composed of a great big sun and nine minor planets, four of which have been developed as mercantile planets more or less under the control of politicians and guilds. On each of these planets are a merchant guild, a guild of smugglers, a bazaar and the galactic government, and players can take special actions on each of these planets.<br/><br/>In RYŪ, a game of negotiation, bluffing and cube-drafting, players each represent one of the other five planets in this star system, with each planet having a different type of humanoid &ndash; such as sharks, amazons and meka goblins &ndash; and its own unique influences. These planets are open to prospecting, and with the proper financing players will be able to dig the resources they need to build their own RYŪ, a mother ship composed of &quot;Rare Metal&quot;, &quot;Memory Stone&quot;, and &quot;Amber Magic&quot;. Players will need to cooperate with one another to raise the necessary resources, but they must also work for themselves in order to maintain an advantage over other players. Once assembled, the RYŪ comes to life as a living spaceship, and its owner wins the game.<br/><br/>Probable update from game box on publisher website:<br/><br/>Several centuries ago, a celestial Leviathan cried on Titan, our planet. Its tears flooded our cities and our land. The people of the Dragons did their utmost to save as many of us as they could: Goblins, Shibuke, Reptilians, Sharks, and Amazons. The survivors of this deluge were brought to Dala, the highest mountain range of our celestial body, with its 9 majestic summits. Nine summits that soon became nine islands.<br/><br/>",

However, only the one who catches the biggest fish may keep it. When sharks show up, the big fish are in danger, so whoever then fishes for the small fish fishes best. If the species happen to match, a big catch of many fish is possible.<br/><br/>Hi Fisch! starts with 36 cards face down around a large sandbank tile. On ten of the cards, a shell token is placed. Each round the players flip over a card one by one. If a shark is revealed, a player has to turn another card until a numbered fish is revealed. Shell tokens are moved to the sandbank tile.<br/><br/>If after revealing the cards a shark card is face up, the shark eats the highest numbered fish (both cards are discarded). The player who turned over the highest numbered fish collects all shell tokens, the fish card, and all cards of the same species (if present). The remaining fish cards are turned face down again, then a new round starts.<br/><br/>When only six or fewer face-down fish cards are present, the game ends and the final score is calculated. Each shell or fish is one point, except for the small, hard-to-catch green fish, which are worth two. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Bookmaker, players bet on horses in a series of races. They're not concerned about which horse wins, however, so much as making as much money as possible from the bets they place based on which race cards they hold in hand.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into two phases: the bidding and the race. During each race two players will be the bookmakers, the ones who set the odds on the four horses. At the start of the race, four race cards from the deck of 80 cards are turned face-up, while each player (including each bookmaker) is dealt four race cards face down. Players look at these cards to determine which cards are out of play &ndash; that is, which horses are less likely to move during the race. The bookmakers secretly exchange two cards each to give them extra information.<br/><br/>Then the bookmakers individually set odds on the four horses (1:1, 1:2, and so on, with the total of the second numbers adding to at least ten). They reveal these odds to the other players, who must then place at least one bet with one bookmaker. They can place more bets if desired, even with both bookmakers. Each bookmaker records the amount bet and the odds for that horse, and he can then lower the odds on that horse if desired (but if the total of the odds would drop below ten, he must raise the payoff on another horse. Players continue placing bets as long as they want.<br/><br/>Once all bets are finished, players remove all cards from play, then reveal cards from the top of the deck one-by-one, moving the appropriately colored horse forward one space for each card revealed. Whichever horse reaches the #10 spot on the track first wins. All players who bet on this horse are paid off in the appropriate amount from the bookmakers. During the race, the betters can ask for credit from the bank to spend and win more money &ndash; but of course in the end, they will be forced to pay the money back to the bank with interest!<br/><br/>After an agreed upon number of races, with each player being bookmaker the same number of times, whoever has the most money wins!<br/><br/>Variant rules in Bookmaker add wild race cards that move the horse which moved on the previous turn, a bet on which horse is the nag, and a harness option in which horses can break from the track and be disqualified.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>The Blue &amp; Gray classics are being updated with a slight change in scale to 352 yards per hex, an updated game system that treats unit differences more accurately, and a combat system that includes step losses.<br/><br/>Once again the Union Army of the Cumberland was in pursuit of Gen. Bragg's Army of the Tennessee, after the Confederate withdrawal from Chattanooga. Bragg's actual intention was to stand and fight. In fact, this time &mdash; indeed, for the first time &mdash; his army, heavily reinforced, actually outnumbered his pursuers. As the dispersed Federals deployed along the Chickamauga River, large numbers of Confederates assembled to strike the counter-blow. The Battle of Chickamauga would be the Confederates' last opportunity to annihilate an entire Union Army.<br/>     <br/>Chickamauga utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized battle during the Civil War while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.<br/><br/>In Chickamauga a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Netzwerk is a revision of Morisi.  The object of the game is for the players to connect city areas (black) via trade routes. These trade routes will pass through the various areas: farmland (yellow), hills (orange), mountains (red), timberland (green) and water (blue). Before trade routes can be built, the players must gain knowledge about these various region types by traveling through them with their pawn. As cities are connected by trade, the players&rsquo; success is represented by the size and number of their trading houses in the connected cities.<br/><br/>The games of Netzwerk and Morisi have many similarities, but each uses different tile components and have different scoring mechanisms.  Netzwerk introduces two new elements: wasteland and different city values.<br/><br/>",

Powered by Lucca comics &amp; Games and dV Giochi, the contest aims to identify the best new card game design from all prototypes received and to reward it by publishing the game in a fully professional and high-quality format, overseen directly by dV Giochi. All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published.<br/>For more information:<br/>giocoinedito@luccacomicsandgames.com<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.luccacomicsandgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.luccacomicsandgames.com</a><br/><br/>&quot;In the forest of Kalesia, the Centaurs and the Mermaids compete for the perfect place for a new temple. But can they overcome the spells of the Queen of Kalesia, who wants to exile all of them from the woods?&quot;<br/><br/>In Kalesia you are secretly part of a mystic alliance. Use your magical weapons to conquer areas of the forest, securing the perfect temple site for your Alliance. But be careful! The weapons you don't use are passed to your rivals, so that good fortune (and information!) will spread around...<br/><br/>Players all hold cards for all three factions competing over the forest (a grid of cards) and must play cards each turn. The faction with the highest total from the played cards wins the section currently being bid for. A faction wins by getting three sections in arow. The first twist is that players' factions are secret. The second is that players pass unplayed cards to the next player after a few turns and take back the cards they played.<br/><br/>",

Each round, reveal a topic card from the deck; the color of the card on the top of the deck reveals which topic is chosen for the round. Each player then draws three images as quickly as possible, with the round ending as soon as the next-to-last player has finished his drawings.<br/><br/>Everyone then compares their images to see who's drawn what. Real artists score one point for each image they drew that no one else drew, while fakes score one point for each image drawn by at least one real artist (and zero points for everything else). After the role cards have circled the table once, the game ends and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

One player controls the evil demon, Molasar, while the others have twelve turns to find the Hilt, the only weapon that can destroy him. It can be hidden in one of six rooms near the heart of a labyrinth. There are intriguing elements to the game; Molasar starts with twelve servants but actually has to &quot;eat&quot; one per turn, reducing his options in terms of blocking the searchers. Combat is handled by the attacked searcher nominating another searcher to play a combat card, which is compared against Molasar's; the loser is forced to &quot;retreat&quot; by the difference in values. If the searcher wins, they pick up a bonus (non-combat) card. All the searchers have (minor) special powers and Molasar has a number of one-off special cards he can play in trying to delay them.<br/><br/>You can think of it, almost, as a very early, much simpler version of Lord of the Rings - except that in this one, one of the players gets to be Sauron!<br/><br/>",

In doing so players use some of the 90 cards representing real beer ingredients.<br/> After producing beer players place chips (representing crowds) onto the laminated game board (so that it can be played on a bar table). As the game continues players try to make better beer and steal crowds from each other.<br/><br/>The game is heavily influenced by event cards, which are drawn after players brew beer. The event deck represents some of the real triumphs/tragedies that have taken place in the craft beer world, such as the brewer who loses his green scrubie in the heat exchanger and loses a turn. The event deck also contains beer festivals and the dreaded Big Breweries card.<br/><br/>The player with the most beer festival trophies and crowd markers wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is good for game fans as well as experienced and novice beer lovers and their friends.<br/><br/>",

Powered by Lucca comics &amp; Games and dV Giochi, the contest aims to identify the best new card game design from all prototypes received and to reward it by publishing the game in a fully professional and high-quality format, overseen directly by dV Giochi. All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published.

To set up each of the three cities in the game, draw five gangster cards at random, then place them in a row in numerical order (with a range of 1-80). Even and odd cards belong to different gangs and are color-coded. Each player has a hand of four gangster cards and a random special action card.<br/><br/>On a turn, each player chooses one gangster and one city card/one special card, then they reveal them simultaneously. Players place cards in ascending order from lowest to highest. If a gangster was played with a city card, it's placed in that city in the proper numerical spot; if it was played with a special card, it can be placed in any city, with the special card being placed in the same city before or after the gangster. If the card you placed is one of two gangsters surrounding at least two gangsters of the other color, then you capture the surrounded gangsters and remove them from play. Special cards let you play on the end of a row, switch a gangster from even to odd (or vice versa), or move a gangster from one row to another.<br/><br/>After four rounds, players discard their special card (if it hasn't been played), then receive a new hand of four gangsters and a special card. Any rows with fewer than five cards are filled to five cards. The game continues until not enough cards remain to fill players' hands and the rows; when this happens, the game ends immediately and players count the revolvers on the gangsters they've captured. The player with the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "By the beginning of 1954, both the French and Viet Minh realized that the war in Indochina was nearing an end. Ho Chi Minh had requested cease fire negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland, and the French government was looking for a way out that would give them peace with honor. Both sides felt that a &quot;big win&quot; on the battlefield would finally secure at the peace table what they had been unable to obtain in six and a half years of war.<br/><br/>The site of this battle would be near a village called, in Vietnamese, &quot;Seat of the Border County Prefecture&quot; located in a distant valley of north western Vietnam near the Laotian border. The French high command, under General Henri Navarre, reasoned that such a remote location could not be successfully attacked. General Vo Nguyen Giap thought the position was nearly impossible to defend. The siege of Dien Bien Phu would be the result.<br/><br/>La vall&eacute;e de la mort (&quot;Death Valley&quot;) is a simulation of this epic siege that ended the French colonial presence in Asia and marked the beginning of a 21 year struggle for national unification. The game is designed for 2 players, one taking the role of the French commander of the fortress complex at Dien Bien Phu, the other of General Giap, commanding the Viet Minh forces laying siege. The game and scenarios are small enough to be played solitaire, however.<br/><br/>Each turn of the game represents one week. Each assault impulse represents one day. A point of combat strength represents 150 to 200 men, 6 aircraft, 5 or 6 guns, or a single tank. An inch on the map corresponds to 700 yards.<br/><br/>",

The last player left in the game wins.<br/><br/>Go Fish Yourself is more than just one deck of cards.  It comes with a series of expansions that will allow players to keep the nonsense going.  Each expansion comes with 52 new cards and challenges.  These expansions (or editions) can be played as standalone games or combined with the original.  Players are able to mix and match their favorite pairs from all or any of the expansions to create customized decks.<br/><br/>",

Each player plays one of four semi-fictional TV networks, and the goal is to end up with the most money when the game ends (which is either when only one network is left on the air, or when certain tiles run out).<br/>Players move pawns around a standard square-track board, with spaces that trigger various events -- drawing an event card, auctioning off a new TV show or star or academy award movie, or triggering a ratings war.<br/>During a ratings war, players lay out the tiles representing their prime-time line-up of shows and movies, along with bonuses for stars and reviews.  Shows with the lowest ratings in their time slot are cancelled, and when a network has no shows left, it goes off the air and the player is out of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "They fought tooth and claw for 160 million years... let the battles begin again.<br/><br/>Jurassic Wars is a dinosaur combat game with computer-generated images and an unusual game mechanism.<br/><br/>During the game players must carefully play Dinocards from their hand and must judge when to play a Combat card, which can alter the outcome of the combat. Timeline cards can also affect combat. There are two types of dice - green and red - and they vary in their effectiveness in scoring a hit. Green dice are used by herbivores and red by carnivores.<br/><br/>Play consists of combats between pairs of players. During combat players take the appropriate number of combat dice, which vary according to a few simple conditions, and start rolling. The aim is to score hits against the opposing dinosaur. Jurassic Wars features an interesting game mechanism where the combat dice also serve as the number of hit points that each dinosaur can sustain in combat. After a series of rolls, one player will be left with no dice to throw and his or her dinosaur is defeated. With every combat, another dinosaur is removed from play. As the game progresses some players will lose all their dinocards and be eliminated until only one player is left standing and is the winner.<br/><br/>The simple, probability-based game mechanism is flexible allowing for basic game parameters to be changed and also lending itself to many different variations, such as Jurassic Wars Whist, a points scoring game that involves greater skill and judgement, and Jurassic Wars Casino, a Craps-style gambling game. Details are available from the publisher&rsquo;s website. Expansion sets are in development.<br/><br/>",

The dungeon is formed out of a circle of dungeon wall tiles, with dungeon cards filling most of those spaces and heroes filling the rest.<br/><br/>A day lasts three turns, and on a turn, you play an action card from your hand, normally moving your hero around the circle of cards (skipping over other heroes) and claiming the card on which you land, which could be treasure, a monster (which wounds you before you defeat it), a trap, or even a magic item. Cards are worth various amounts of awesomeness, and you want to be the most awesome hero at the end of the third day.<br/><br/>Awesome Kingdom: Mines &amp; Labyrinths is both a standalone game and an expansion for Awesome Kingdom: The Tower of Hateskull, with two new dungeons for heroes to explore: Cretin's Labyrinth and the Mines of Murray.<br/><br/>",

Keep making 'em, racing 'em, and smashing 'em until somebody makes it out of the city to win!&quot;<br/><br/>Players use play-doh to create cars, tanks, and airplanes that they race to the finish line.  Constructible buildings, track colors and cards decide which cars get crushed on each turn.  With each crushed car the distance to the finish is shortened, guaranteeing a reasonable play time.<br/><br/>A simple game that is larger than life, and a lot of fun with the young crowd.  Adding your own colors of play-doh allow you to play as many players as you like.  Just don't get too attached to your cars -- the Incredible Hulk doesn't let very many of them get away!<br/><br/>",

Before recorded history, songs tell of a chieftain named Odif who led Clan Black to many victories and in time chiseled out the land of Blackwallen. He declared himself king and established laws for a royal bloodline. Descendents of Odif occupied the throne through centuries of in-fighting, war, and famine. To many, Blackwallen&rsquo;s constant instability meant it was cursed. To others, it was just home.<br/><br/>One hundred years ago a new age dawned. Adjacent kingdoms were uninterested in conquering the land, and peace at home meant security in Blackwallen for perhaps the first time. With security came cultural and scientific pursuits and the king himself declared an &ldquo;Age of Peace&rdquo;.<br/><br/>King Leopold is the third king of the Age of Peace. He has levied trade agreements with neighbors into alliances. He is a young king, but already the people talk of his wisdom.<br/><br/>When he dies, a very real void will be left. His queen will no longer have a doting husband. His children will be without a loving father. The Orbly Street Tavern will no doubt miss its masked late night musician known only as &ldquo;The Night Singer&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The Kingdom of Blackwallen will no longer have their beloved monarch.<br/><br/>Blood Royals is a game about two relatives trying to claim the throne from a dying king. Secretly choose your action, reveal and then use your skills (and a bit of luck) to conquer lands and gain the favor of influential people with powerful abilities.<br/><br/>This is a roll and write game. All you need to play is the perforated game sheets in this book, some pencils, and some dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A continuation of the series of VHS and DVD Nightmare/Atmosfear board games.<br/><br/>The aim of Atmosfear is to collect a key from each of the six regions of the board before heading to the &quot;Well of Fears&quot; in the centre and attempting to draw your fear from among those of your opponents in order to win the game. This must be done before the clock counts down to zero, or all players lose automatically.<br/><br/>Like all previous games in the Nightmare/Atmosfear series, Atmosfear makes for stressful play. Players rush to take their turn and pass on the dice as quickly as possible before the Gatekeeper appears and calls on them, and are encouraged to work competitively against each other.<br/><br/>Atmosfear 2019 uses an App - for apple and android devices - which acts as a timer, constantly ticking away toward the end of the game. It is also a channel for The Gatekeeper, who frequently appears on screen and causes problems for any or all of the players. As in the previous DVD version, the Gatekeeper&rsquo;s appearances are randomised so you cannot predict when he will turn up next or what he&rsquo;ll say. But unlike its predecessor, the game length is also randomised, varying between about 40 and 50 minutes. Where there was only one screen in all the previous versions, the App can run on multiple devices, so the Gatekeeper can sometimes pop on a player&rsquo;s own personal phone.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scriba is yet another Scrabble clone. Quite popular on Polish market due to much lower price.<br/><br/>Scriba is an extended version of Scriba Travel, because it provides two variants of gameplay. The first variant is exactly the same, but the second is quite insane.<br/><br/>The first variant is similar to Scrabble (but there are some differences). Players use their 6/7/8 (this is up to the players) drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. The differences between Scriba (1st variant) and Scrabble are:<br/>- If you play all but one letter from your rack you get 20 points bonus.<br/>- You can stack the letters on top of the already played (like in Upwords), but only two levels of letters are allowed<br/>- There are negative bonuses on the board.<br/>- The player that ends the game receive 50 points bonus (because he played all his letters, we don't mind if he had one or two).<br/>- If a player passes, he receives minus 5 points.<br/>- The are tiles with no letter but with a black spot. This can be placed anywhere adjacent to already played tiles and is usually used to prevent from extending a particular word.<br/>- The are tiles with a curved arrow (wich looks like 'enter key') which allows to play a word half vertically and half horizontally.<br/><br/>The second variant uses every rule from first variant with some additional rules:<br/>- The players use chips in four colors to place all the bonuses on the board wherever they want.<br/>- Whenever a player uses the bonus, he takes the chip from the board and places it in front of him. Every chip is worth 1 point during the final scoring.<br/>- The start player does not have to place his first word in the middle of the board.<br/>- After every move the player roll a d6 and draws that number of letter-tiles.<br/>- There are 12 big yellow chips which at the start of the game are distributed to the players in equal shares. Every chip is worth 10 points at the end of the game. Whenever a player plays exactly four letter-tiles from is rack, he can take one big chip from a chosen opponent.<br/><br/>",

Game variations include the option of using a Klingon frigate in place of the Bird of Prey, or playing a solitaire game against a &quot;computer controlled&quot; drone ship.<br/><br/>See also Starship Duel II<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Ogre Cheerleaders, each player represents a recruitment officer trying to recruit new cheerleaders to Ogreton University.  You may start the game with some high hopes of finding some spectacular cheerleaders, but you&rsquo;ll quickly realize that although the ogres are very enthusiastic, their cheerleading skill are quite lacking.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will play an ogre card onto the field where its effect will be resolved.  Each card&rsquo;s effect will in some way manipulate the order of the cards on the field, or add or remove cards from the field with the goal of arranging the ogres into various formations that can be scored.  Each card has a point value, and the player that scores the most points by the end of the game has recruited the best team of ogre cheerleaders, and wins the game.  Although your goal is to score formations, you also need to worry about what you&rsquo;re leaving available on the field for your opponent to score.<br/><br/>Ogre Cheerleaders is a quick, light hearted game that can fit in your pocket and be played anywhere.  It&rsquo;s meant to be funny and easily accessible to anyone.  The simple game mechanics were designed for 2 players, but can accommodate a few extra players.  Adding an extra player or two doesn&rsquo;t change the mechanics, but it does increase the amount of luck involved.<br/><br/>",

Don't we all deserve a memorable vacation once or twice in our lifetime? Of course we do!<br/><br/>Well, pack your bags because the trip we are longing for is happening! In Jalan-Jalan, everyone gathers to create the most perfect list of vacation plans, with all the destinations to visit. Each destination is categorized differently: some water-related, some cultural places, adventurous choices, and so on. Each player has two random interests, one hidden from the other players. Thus, while one player would prefer to go to cultural places, another wants more adventurous options.<br/><br/>Gather points by convincing the group to add your favorite destination to the list! It won't be easy because in Jalan-Jalan everybody has an equal voice to vote where to go, but with action cards you can (possibly) shift the outcome in your favor. Remember that this is your vacation, too, so make sure you enjoy it the most!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These fine fighters could feasibly face their finish in this forbidding fortification, whose fearsome floors even now flow frighteningly from beneath their feet as the famished Furunkulus forages the fringes, fixing to feast on the foreigners&rsquo; flesh.  Forthwith, must our fighters fashion their flight from this foulest of fates!  But what&rsquo;s this?  By the light of their fallow and flickering flares, our friends find the depths fraught with the most furious of fiends and the fiercest of freaks!  With fleet feet, the fearless foreigners follow these ferocious fellows through the fortress, with its multifarious footpaths and their frustrating forks, forging fervently forward toward freedom and fame.  Our fighters must not falter from whatever feud or fracas would foil their function: to finally furnish the forlorn Faerie Fabula her freedom from feckless Fieso&rsquo;s fists!<br/><br/>Theme<br/>Formidable Foes is a light-hearted dungeon crawl. The players all take the role of heroes competing with each other to amass the greatest hoard of treasure. They do this by exploring the dungeon and fighting monsters.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal is to collect as much gold as possible. The winner is the richest player.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On each turn, a player either moves twice; moves once and fights a monster; or collects 'power tokens' which allow a player to improve their dice rolls in subsequent turns. In the early part of the game, the monsters are fairly weak and easily defeated. Defeating a monster increases a character's 'wisdom' which allows them to fight and defeat ever-harder monsters. Fighting monsters involves rolling a dice and then adding power tokens to improve the roll if required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>Technically speaking, the Korean War has remained active since the cease-fire agreement of 1953: the belligerents have never actually ratified a final peace accord. Since 1953, the Korean peninsula has remained devoid of open war, though only South Korea has prospered during that time. In contrast, North Korea has become isolated, bankrupt and confrontational. Indeed, as the North Korean economy continues to implode, and more starvation ensues, it's conceivable a desperate North Korea could resort to war to try to avoid its own final collapse.<br/><br/>DMZ utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turns. From artillery to helicopter gunships, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single armor brigade, for example &mdash; perhaps with close air support &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry corps defending an airbase. As that attack gets underway, that armor brigade may find itself under fire from rocket batteries; more support fire will be necessary to take the airbase, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In DMZ, the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of modern warfare. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses likely to be sustained by both sides during another Korean War. Winning a battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    DMZ: The Battle for South Korea, late 1970s<br/><br/><br/>",

It covers the first month of the war that could result if Putin decides to abandon the &quot;opaque war&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;gray war&quot;) approach and go for it big time.<br/><br/>The idea being to take advantage of the West's (particularly the &quot;old NATO&quot; countries') distraction with the jihad to try to win back all or some of the &quot;Near Abroad&quot; on Russia's European flank.<br/><br/>Before you ask: the difference between this game and &quot;Putin's War,&quot; which will be appearing in an upcoming issue of Modern War, is that &quot;Putin's War&quot; is a strategic (army-corps at 55 miles (90km) per hex) treatment with operational undertones, whereas the present game &quot;Putin Strikes&quot; is an operational-level treatment with strategic overtones.<br/><br/>The system will be a further-evolved version of the one I used in NNN2, but better adapted to modern real-world military circumstances. In particular, I'm crafting the combat sub-system to emphasize the growing debate on the appropriateness of the &quot;brigading of everything.&quot;<br/><br/>The growing complaints are that brigades, BCTs, etc., are too small and weak to last long in an eyeball-to-eyeball First World conventional war, while also being too big to be nimble enough to properly prosecute an urban counterinsurgency war.<br/><br/>",

Banqi is a social game, usually played for fun rather than serious competition. Because it has a significant element of chance, some people consider it a child's game, but Banqi often has remarkable depth of strategy.<br/><br/>The 32 pieces are shuffled and randomly allocated face-down to squares on the board.  The first player turns up a piece to begin the game.  The color of the piece he turns up is the color he will play in the game.  The second player then makes a move, and the two alternate until the game is finished.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player cannot move; the player who cannot move loses.  Most often, the game is lost because all of a player&rsquo;s pieces have been captured and so he has no pieces to move.  However, it is possible for one player to surround all of the other player&rsquo;s pieces in a manner that makes it impossible for them to move.<br/><br/>",

Of course, having possession of the singular Blue Amulet allows a player to ignore many of these obstacles without needing the appropriate card.  Players can also maneuver their pawns (through the use of movement cards) in such a way as to bump their opponents onto a path going in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>The board is beautifully illustrated and the game won the Spiel des Jahres award for Most Beautiful Game in 1986.<br/><br/>Das Blaue Amulett is the second game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Der Feuersalamander being the first and third.<br/><br/>",

I, as for experts strategists, the new T.E.G. proposes a different way of playing, lots of action and rapid development.<br/><br/>Each player represents one of the great powers of the world: U.S.A., U.S.S.R., China, Japan, Eastern Europe and Western Europe.<br/><br/>At the beginning each player chooses, according to their strategic thinking, several military targets: Control, Intervention and Non-Intervention in the various regions of the world. Each target has a value in points. All targets are placed in the Objectives Table.<br/><br/>After the incorporations are done comes the fighting. The fighting is between ships that occupie the same region, to which reinforcements can be added, brought in from neighboring regions. The battles are resolved without dice, using a Command of Battle. Apart from the armies, ships and planes, there are other elements of exceptional strength: the nuclear missile and the special unit. They are obtained when the player gets certain levels of war potential. At the end of the game, each player sums the points of the objectives achieved. The winner is the one who got the highest score.<br/><br/>",

In addition to the standard numbers and suits the cards also contain a letter of the alphabet.<br/><br/>The players are attempting to create &quot;runs&quot;, &quot;groups&quot; and &quot;words&quot;. A Run is four or more cards in the same suit in sequence. A Group is three or more of a kind. A Word is formed using the letters on the cards and can be any non-proper word found in a standard dictionary. A game consists of seven rounds, and in each round a player must form a specific number of Runs, Groups and Words.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a number of cards, the exact number of which varies depending on the round in play. Each turn the player draws the top card from the deck or from the discard pile then plays as many cards as possible (either by forming new Runs, Groups or Words or by adding them onto cards which have already been played, either by themselves or by other players). Finally, they discard one of their remaining cards. The round ends when one player manages to empty their hand.<br/><br/>Players gain points by forming the number of Groups, Runs and Words specified for the round and for the cards in the melds they created. They lose points for cards left in their hand when the round ends. The player with the highest total after all seven rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>An interesting variation of Rummy, Tryce adds an element of strategy to that game.<br/><br/>Belongs to the 3M Gamette Series.

        "description": "Round the World is a real-time card game played simultaneously. The players are travel agents creating &quot;trips&quot; around the world for their customers. Each &quot;flight card&quot; shows two continents (each continent has its own color): a &quot;departure&quot; and a &quot;destination&quot; connected by an airplane/arrow. You try to get rid of your own 30-card deck within a period of exactly five minutes by creating &quot;trips&quot; card by card with matching colors from card to card until the trip is complete and can be &quot;booked&quot; (saved for scoring).<br/><br/>All players play at the same time, everybody to their own speed and rhythm. Holding your deck in one hand, you draw the top card as your sole &quot;hand card&quot; and add it to the ones you already placed in front of you to create &quot;trips&quot; &mdash; or you put it under the deck again. When you add a card, you may pick up the card from the other end of the trip and continue using this as your &quot;hand card&quot;. You may also add cards to your opponents' trips and take cards (you desperately need) from them. All cards not &quot;booked&quot; (i.e., still in the deck or in incomplete trips) score against you, so if you empty your deck too soon, your opponents are able to lengthen your trips without completing them...<br/><br/>A game consists of two rounds of five minutes, plus two simple scoring phases. The focus of the game is on your perfect timing within the five minutes, keep an eye on cards with landmarks (better for scoring!), and on your opponents &quot;offers&quot;. There are variants included shifting the focus and making the game more challenging.<br/><br/>",

It is played on a board with 24 nodes joined by lines; each player has twelve pieces. The game proceeds in three phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Players alternately place one piece on a node in each move. If a player makes three in a row, he or she can capture one of the opponent's pieces.<br/>     Once all the pieces are placed, players take turns moving the pieces to adjacent nodes. Again, whenever a player forms three in a row, one of the opponent's pieces may be captured.<br/>     When one player is down to just three pieces, the remaining pieces may &quot;fly&quot; to anywhere on the board (not just adjacent nodes).<br/><br/><br/>You win when you reduce your opponent to two pieces, or when he or she can't move.<br/><br/>Two possible boards exist.<br/>One has three concentric squares marked with the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked and also the adjacent corners linked. This is known as &quot;small board Twelve Men's Morris&quot;.<br/><br/>The other board has four concentric squares marked, and similar to Nine Men's Morris, has only the mid-points of the adjacent sides of the the squares linked. This is known as &quot;large board Twelve Men's Morris&quot;.<br/><br/>",

From the ashes of a devastating third World War, a precious few golden cities emerge offering hope to those who struggle for survival in the wastelands. Players explore the ruins of the modern world completing quests, honing their skills and maneuvering for social status in order to claim a precious spot as a citizen with a Golden City. To enter the golden city you must:<br/><br/><br/>    Become an expert: Reach 20 skill points.<br/>    Serve the city: Fulfill three secret quests.<br/>    Become a nobleman: Get the most possible character points.<br/><br/><br/>In each turn, the players can spend action points to do several actions such as moving through the city, raiding buildings, attacking other players, and more. Each player has a specific skill &mdash; mechanic, trader, electrician, bodyguard and medic &mdash; and has his own unique items to build; those items can be traded off against other items or resources.<br/><br/>The board of the game is modular so that in every game you have a new map to discover. All over the map, the players find different buildings which they can raid. Each time a player raids a building, a raid card of this type of building is taken and read, which leads to specific circumstances taking place. The player will be made to make various decisions including important moral decisions! Upon resolving the various decisions, you will receive character points. The choices you make, for good or for bad, will lead to specific perks and advantages (or disadvantages) during the progress of the game. When raiding a building, you get resources (tools, scraps, mechanics, electronics, etc.). By combining these resources, you can craft items with special abilities. By doing so, you will advance your skill points.<br/><br/>Every player also gets secret quests of the golden city. To fulfill these quests, the players have to spend the resources mentioned on the card. To fulfill a quest will not only lead the players closer to victory but also give them advantages for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most astronauts in the area gets the points; in case of a tie, the points are divided between the players.

        "description": "Rifle &amp; Saber is a tactical (company level) simulation of warfare in &quot;the age of the rifle,&quot; roughly from 1850 to 1900. The period was marked by a tremendous increase in the firepower of infantry units which far outstripped advances in tactics.<br/><br/>The game simulates battles or portions of battles from some of the most significant wars of this period. Seventeen scenarios are drawn from battles in the American Civil War (1st Bull Run, Shiloh, Gettysburg), the Franco-Prussian War (Worth, Mars-la-Tour), the Spanish-American War, and the Boer Wars. There are also battles from minor wars in Europe, South America, and India.<br/><br/>Included in the game are a 22&quot; by 28&quot; mapsheet  (50 meters per hex), 400 counters (muzzle-, early breech-, and late breech-loading infantry; muzzle- and breech-loading artillery; cavalry; various game markers), a 10-page, accordion-style rules booklet, a sheet of historical notes, and various play aids. Cavalry and infantry units represent about 100-150 men, artillery units about 4-6 guns, game turns about five minutes real time.<br/><br/>",

This variation of Sabacc known in Star Wars lore as &quot;Corellian Spike&quot; is the version that was played in the legendary match between Han Solo and Lando Calrissian when Han gambled to win the Millennium Falcon.<br/><br/>The deck includes 30 green positive cards with values of 1 through 10 (3 each), 30 red negative cards with values of -1 through -10 (3 each), and two black cards with values of 0.<br/><br/>Each game is played in three rounds. Players receive two random cards at the beginning of the game and on each turn players can either gain an additional card (optionally discarding it to draw again), swap a card in the player's hand with the top card of the discard pile, stand (take no cards), or junk (fold). Players do this in turn, and at the end of each round the dice are rolled. If the symbols match then everyone's hand is discarded, players are dealt the same amount of new cards that they discarded, and play continues.<br/><br/>At the end of three rounds, the player whose score is closest to 0 wins the game. There are several winning hands ranked in a hierarchy that can be assembled similar to poker. For example, Pure Sabacc (both zero cards and no other cards) or Full Sabacc (a hand of +10, +10, -10, -10, and 0).<br/><br/>",

Can you tell when there's a match on stage and react faster than anyone else?<br/><br/>To set up, deal the deck evenly among all players, with the cards showing musical strawberries, bananas and limes in different colors: yellow, green or red, with the fruits playing guitar, saxophone or drums. Taking turns, players flip one card from their deck face up in front of themselves. Whenever two face-up cards match in two properties, e.g., a yellow lime and a yellow strawberry both playing guitar, players race to ring the bell. Players also need to ring in quickly when the star of the Halli Galli band &mdash; the singing plum &mdash; takes the stage. Whoever rings in quickest takes all the face-up cards and places them under their deck; if someone rings at the wrong time, they must give one card from their deck to each other player.<br/><br/>As soon as only two players remain, the game ends after the next ringing of the bell, and whoever has the most cards wins!<br/><br/>",

Great are the rewards, but great also are the dangers to be face along the way. In the Expanded Game, the warriors are joined by other heroic adventurers - magic-users, rogues, clerics and dwarves - as each player now pits a group of Heroes against the perils of the dungeon.

Also, the rules state that it's for 2-4 players, but I see no reason why one person couldn't play solo with it.<br/><br/>The Goofy Golf Machine is almost more a toy than a game.  Like Mousetrap, the gameboard is dominated (in fact, consists of) a large Rube Goldberg-ish contraption.  Players use a plastic &quot;putter&quot; to flick a small (about 1cm in diameter) ball around a nine-hole miniature golf course.  Some holes require the ball to roll into an elevator which carries it up and dumps it into a spiral track leading to the hole.  Others require the ball to be hit up a ramp into a basketball hoop or rebounded off bumpers.  One hole even consists of a dangling plastic chicken that swings back and forth pendulum-style (a little oil might be useful for this one as there's too much friction as-is for the chicken to swing freely.)  Players have three chances to play each hole.  Whoever sinks their putt in the fewest shots is awarded a token--no tokens awarded for ties.  The ninth hole has two holes, one harder to reach than the other.  Players are awarded one token for sinking their putt into the easy hole, or two for the hard one.  The player with the most tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players control the East and the West factions. Either East or West can win by military or by magic forces. Armies of mounted and foot soldiers and fleets of ships contest victory by capturing key places. But even a military victory depends upon control of magic. As magic releases powers of earth, air, water, light, and fire, the wizards grow in strength, volcanoes erupt, storms sweep the mountains and seas, and the creatures of magic join the struggle for both sides. When all five charms are assembled, the completed Pentantastar is a dangerous weapon. If carried to Lug Balor, the East wins, if carried to the Wizard Council, the West wins. Victory depends upon taking advantage of military and magic opportunities, and surviving immediate threats, disasters, and treachery.<br/><br/>",

As a travel agent, players will try to bring their own groups of passengers (1, 2, 3 and 4 travellers) from to their respective departure cities to their destinations.<br/><br/>The game board shows the world map with all departure/arrival cities, the different connections between them with their fuel cost, the chartered airplane with ten available seats, a fuel indicator and a customs area. Each player is randomly dealt a departure and destination card for each of their four traveller groups and also receives a number of customs cards. The plane is placed on a randomly chosen starting location. If this happens to be the departure location for any of the players' passengers, these may immediately board the plane and all is clear for take-off.<br/><br/>A players' turn consists of the following actions:<br/><br/>     First, two six-sided dice are rolled and the result is added to the fuel indicator. After that, the player may move the plane using one or more connections, as far as the fuel reserve will allow. <br/>     If the plane lands at the destination airport for any of the passengers that are on the plane, these are moved to the customs area. When enough seats are available in the plane, new passengers may board the plane at the current location.<br/>     Players may now play matching customs cards for the current location, thereby sending passengers from the customs area and/or the plane back home. Any passengers that are still in the customs area after this phase have successfully completed the trip and count towards victory.<br/>     If previously unavailable seats have opened up during the customs phase, the remaining passengers departing from the current airport may board the plane now.<br/><br/><br/>Play then passes clockwise and continuous until all passengers from a player have made for to their destinations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Triple Alliance War (TAW) is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity, strategic-level simulation of the second-largest war ever fought in the New World (the largest having been the American Civil War). The Paraguayan player is attempting to hold off the onslaught of three allied nations: Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. The Allied player is generally on the offensive, attempting to win the game by invading Paraguay and seizing key areas on map within that country. The Paraguayan player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also allows for his prosecution of offensives, particularly in the early stage of the war.<br/><br/>Game play encompasses the period that began historically in 1865 with the Paraguayans launching a preemptive strike into Argentine territory. The game ends during the first half of 1868 when, historically, the Allies broke through the Paraguayan river forts and went on to seize their capital. That advance signaled the ultimate doom of the Paraguayan cause and, though the war officially went on for another year and a half, that portion of it was more a rebellion-and-occupation struggle than an actual war.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 15.5 miles (25 km) from side to opposite side. The ground units of maneuver for both sides are primarily battalions, along with some nominal &quot;brigades&quot; and &quot;divisions,&quot; which are actually all really battalion-equivalents themselves. Each riverine unit represents on naval combat vessel or several armed rafts or transport ships. Game Turn 1 represents three months, while each one after that represents half a year.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Goal of this French pirate themed game is to gather the highest reputation after 3 or 4 expeditions.<br/><br/>Each round consists of 2 phases. The first one is the expedition where the players resolve tasks from event cards and try to amass as much as possible of gold. The second phase is about &quot;The Tavern&quot; where you try to defend your gold or steal it from other players.<br/><br/>During the game you may hire pirates or one of your fellow pirates may become captain. When embarking you try to get the best places for your mates. Maybe there is a mutiny or even the destruction of the ship. Lucky you are when a port is near to save your life and repair your ship.<br/><br/>Event cards offer tasks for the crew and if they succeed they gain gold or reputation, but if they fail they may also lose it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Krash Karts is a table top game in which players race to a finish line that's ever changing. This is because you design the very track you're racing on, while you're racing on it. How it comes together is up to those playing, and manipulating the track to your advantage or against your opponent's advantage plays a large factor in determining the victor. You can even design your own short-cut.<br/><br/>Coupled with this unique game mechanic, players during the race also gain items, such as the Booster, which lets you jet ahead of the competition; The Dodge Ball, which whacks your friends and slows them down; The Squirrel, which creates a roadblock forcing players to change course; Or the Bomb which decimates the track and all on it. Some items are left right on the track to benefit or to hinder your friends, and other items can even be used to defend yourself, making each game unique and strategic.<br/><br/>Changes from Mad Rush Rally (Source: Sean McDonald on Krashin' Karts)<br/><br/>Krash Karts resolves some strategic issues players had with the game where lagging behind intentionally during the race was one of the better strategies. This has been fixed by giving the last player better chances to get better items, but have less control over how the track lays out. Further, the Track has been reduced to 3 lanes, rather then the 4 of Mad Rush Rally, but players are allowed to occupy the same space now. The track has also now been laid out in a staggered pattern ala Formula D, rather than a grid, and also now accompanies a max of 6 players, rather then 4. Further, the rally car pieces have been changed to go-karts, and items can now be used not only offensively, but defensively.<br/><br/>",

The game is played between two competing teams in a deceptively simple word guessing game. Clever communication is the key as Password players must rely on one-word clues to guess the secret word. Played just like the TV game show, Million Dollar Password is a modern twist on the original word association classic!<br/><br/>brought into the 21st Century, both on television and as a home game, by being composed of nothing but Lightning Rounds. Mm-hm.<br/><br/>Two teams of two players play four rounds. Each round consists of each team getting 30 seconds (measured by an electronic timer that plays the think music from the series) to score as many of the five passwords as possible.<br/><br/>The team that scores the most points then plays a bonus round where the object is to get five words out of a specific number within the time limit. This part has six tiers, each worth a different amount of money, with Tier 1 having ten words and Tier 6 having just five. Winning all six awards $1,000,000.<br/><br/>There is a variation for three players, with one player giving the clues for the other two. Games with five or more players can be done as a tournament.<br/><br/>The show itself aired on CBS, hosted by Regis Philbin, from 2008 until 2009.<br/><br/>",

Further, you must possess a Badge Card before revealing the solution, and another player can stop you that turn by giving up their Badge Card.

(Ex: You can&rsquo;t say the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; and you can&rsquo;t refer to anyone by their first name.) Draw a card and follow the instructions. Start a story, rhyme a word, test your memory, name a celebrity, point left, answer a question with a question, and many more.<br/><br/>The player whose turn it is, draws the top card from the MOOSE MASTER deck and places it face up on the table so that all players may read it.<br/><br/>The player reads the card, performing the action immediately or following the instructions.<br/><br/>Every player must keep a watchful eye and attentive ear on all other players. Here&rsquo;s why, when a card from the MOOSE MASTER deck is turned over, the last player to perform the action shown or the first player to incorrectly perform the described task receives a penalty. Penalties are recorded by taking a Penalty card and placing it face up in front of the offending player.<br/><br/>There are two ways to play:<br/>ELIMINATION: Playing with the elimination rules, once a player accumulates 7 Penalty cards, they are eliminated from the game. The last two players remaining win.<br/><br/>FEWEST PENALTIES: Play through the whole deck and the player with the fewest Penalty cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Moose Master is a great ice breaker and turns any gathering into a great party. It&rsquo;s a must have for your college dorm, cabin and your family game library.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 1952 game Stadium Checkers was the most complex and the liveliest version of this gravity-based, logic-puzzle race game. A special concentric 'stadium' is required, along with 5 marbles or balls beginning at the start quadrants on the stadium's uppermost and outermost ring. The earliest version of the game had 7 internal stepped rings, while later versions changed the rules and subtracted rings to simplify and slow down the game.<br/><br/>A player designates a particular marble to be moved around into a particular slot, OR a particular slot to be moved over to a specific marble of their color, and as they slide the ring or marble as described, other marbles may fall down into lower slots before the slide is completed.<br/><br/>According to Winning Moves Games (2007), the objective of Stadium Checkers (formerly marketed as Roller Bowl) is to get your marbles to the center of the stadium at their matching colored quadrant hole by selecting and moving a single ring and sliding it in a selected direction until a marble falls into a vacant slot due to the force of gravity. A single marble falling into a slot terminates the movement for the turn. Marbles falling into incorrectly colored holes are re-introduced at the rim of the stadium by the player of the corresponding color as the marble.<br/><br/>This game is usually called Stadium Checkers or Intrigue. The reduction in the number of rings seriously affected the strategic complexity of the game in redesign, and reducing its overall size made it more likely that mishaps with the smaller, plastic balls might occur and cause illegal moves.<br/><br/>Variants: restricting ring selection to that in contact with one's marbles makes the game more strategically challenging, and designating the ring-mover as the re-introducer of incorrectly finishing marbles, rather than their owning player, would complicate re-entry and reward key ring movement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players in Crowns want to gain as many crowns as they can, and they do so by rolling dice, then covering spaces on their grids based on what they roll and how they manipulate what they roll.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player starts with 18 tokens and a player board that shows a 5x5 grid surrounded by a border on two sides that effectively makes a larger 6x6 grid. Next to the left column of the grid are die faces 1-6 from bottom to top, and above the top row are the numbers 1-6 from left to right.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the half-dozen six-sided dice once. If she wishes, she can change any die face to a lower number as long as that number is one that she rolled. If she wishes, she then places tokens on the grid to match the die combinations rolled. For example, if she rolls 5-4-4-3-3-2, she could change all the dice to 2, then cover the six 2s space on her grid; she could also change the 5 to a 4 and the 3s to 2s, then cover the three 4s space and the three 2s space. A player doesn't have to place tokens on her turn.<br/><br/>Once someone places her 18th token on her grid, the game ends after everyone has had the same number of turns, then players score points. Each token in the outer border is worth 1-6 crowns, depending on where it's located; each token in the inner grid is worth points only if it's part of a complete row of five tokens, and you score points (3-20, depending on the row) only for those completed rows, not for each covered space in the grid. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Land of Clans is a confrontational pattern building and hand management game, set in the medieval Scottish highlands. All players try to build castles on land they claim, and the game ends when someone has built four of them. Castles of different sizes score differently, and the winner is the player with the highest total score. Often the winner is the player with four castles, but not always.<br/><br/>The game is played with cards, where each card shows a land symbol matching a space on the board. Further some of the cards show a sword that can be used for attacking castles, some show a shield that can be used for defending the same castles, and some show both a sword and a shield symbol. The players only hold five cards each, so hand management is required.<br/><br/>The game play can be divided into two parts: the peaceful claiming of land and building of castles, and the aggressive conquering of castles built by the opponents. The claiming is very straightforward: at any point in the game, four separate castle patterns are available. On your turn, play a card from your hand and claim a matching space on the game board. You try to claim spaces that create the available patterns. As soon as one of the patterns is built, the player can place a castle tile over those spaces. By claiming spaces next to an opponent's castle tile, you open the possibility of attacking it for yourself. To attack a castle you also play one or more cards from your hand. But now the only thing that matters is whether the cards you hold show the attacker's sword symbol or not. Play and discard as many sword cards as you want, and hope the defender is not holding enough shields to stop your attack. If the attack is successful, the castle's ownership changes. May the most cunning clan chief win!<br/><br/>",

Only 1 card is up for bid  and the remaining face-up card is put aside.<br/><br/>Final score<br/>First the red cards are totaled, then the green in the same manner.

The better the skeleton buried, the more you score!<br/><br/>The first roll of a player's turn is the &quot;pre-op&quot; roll, with the player launching all 18 dice onto the table. The player then builds as complete a skeleton as he can with no gaps. For each subsequent &quot;post-op&quot; roll &ndash; if a player chooses to roll or is forced to roll &ndash; the player must first set aside a number of dice equal to the number of rolls already made: one die for the first post-op roll, two more dice for the second post-op roll, and so on.<br/><br/>The player must add at least one die to the skeleton after each roll. If a player can't place a bone correctly, he must add an incorrect bone in the wrong location, e.g., a foot on the end of the spine.<br/><br/>Whenever a player has a gravestone showing, the player can choose to end his turn, scoring for his skeleton. Each complete section (arm, leg or thorax) is worth five points, with each incomplete section worth one point per die in it. Each incorrectly placed die costs the player five points. If a player's skeleton wears a hat (which naturally goes only on top of the skull), double the score for that round. If a player has no gravestone and cannot pay for another reroll, he ends his turn scoring nothing.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 100 points (or some other agreed upon total) wins Rolling Bones.<br/><br/>",

To make matters worse, the plane is in such disrepair that the instrumentation is broken, the compass demagnetized, and the windshield is covered in cracks, duct tape, and the remains of a few unfortunate seagulls, so the pilot might as well be flying blind...<br/><br/>Each day in Island Hopper, players auction off the Captain's seat; the player who becomes the Captain is in charge of flying the plane for the day, but cannot make any deliveries of their own. To make their deliveries, the other players bribe the Captain to fly to the islands to which they need to go, thereby earning themselves cash. When it's time for the Captain to fly, the Captain must close his eyes, pick up their goods tokens, and attempt to land them in an island's harbor.

The player then may roll up to two more times, setting aside any dice they won't want to roll again. At the end of the turn, the player enters the score into one of the rectangles on the score sheet.

        "description": "In this new Jungle Speed version for kids, be the first to catch the totem when two identical tiles appear. The goal of the game is to collect the most tiles by game's end.  This version differs from standard Jungle Speed by mixing in elements from the classic children's game Memory which makes it perfect for younger children to enter the world of Jungle Speed.  The game consists of 36 animal tiles and the Jungle Speed totem.  The tiles are comprised of 8 each of a monkey, elephant, giraffe, and zebra along with 4 lions.  All the tiles are placed face-down in a grid just like &quot;Memory&quot; with the totem placed at the center of the grid.  Each player takes turns flipping over one tile in the grid making sure each player has seen it and then replacing it face-down in its original place.  As soon as a flipped tile matches one that has previously been flipped (not including the lions), the players race to grab the totem.  The player who is fastest to the totem now has to turn over the correct matching tile hopefully remembering where it is.  If they are successful they collect both tiles and put it in a pile in front of them.  If they do not flip over the correct tile, they are frozen and can not grab for the totem until they use their next turn to become unfrozen.  When a player flips over a lion tile , the tile is removed from the grid and placed on the side of the grid.  When the fourth lion tile is flipped, the game immediately ends and the player with the most tiles wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a simulation of American football which is played over 40 plays split in four quarters. A play is registered after each down or when a team scores.<br/><br/>From scrimmage, players line up their formations. The offensive team lines up first and the ball is placed on top of the Center. The first down marker is placed 10 yards forward. On his turn, the offensive player gets three moves with which he can move one man three spaces, one man two spaces and another one space or three men one space each. The defensive player makes his three moves after the offensive player. Once the defensive player has made his three moves, the offensive player moves once again. Play continues until the ball carrier is tackled, a team scores or an incomplete pass is thrown. In order to tackle the ball carrier, the defensive player must land one of his men on the square occupied by the ball carrier. Dice rolls are used to resolve passing.<br/><br/>The team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Description from rulebook<br/>The N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL GAME is the closest thing to real football ever devised! Every play possible on the real gridiron can occur in N.F.L. ALL PRO FOOTBALL! Now, for the first time, you control your entire team . . . not with cards, dice or spinners&mdash;but by actually moving the players. You see every play unfold in front of you and victory or defeat is determined entirely by your skill as offensive quarterback or defensive captain. Since this is the first time you will be moving an entire team on the playing field, study the layout of the playing field and the way each man moves.

        "description": "This game was originally published by the designer as Bin'Fa under the company name Taoist Arts, Inc. It was released a few years later as Hexagony by Avalon Hill, and then again as Bin'Fa by the designer under the company name Kenterprises. The Avalon Hill version has slightly different rules. Alan Moon is credited with development of this version. Bin'Fa will be re-released February 2015 after undergoing numerous alterations and rule changes from its previous incarnations.<br/><br/>Bin'Fa/2015 Edition is described by the Publisher/Designer:<br/><br/>Bin&rsquo;Fa is a game of strategy for 2 to 6 players, each of whom controls an army of twelve units, a general and a supply pawn. In multiple army games, each player controls either two or three armies. The object of the game is to capture the opposing army units by surrounding them, thereby removing them from play.<br/><br/>The game board is divided into six separate triangles, which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game. Each player places his armies at the start of the game in his home battle sector. The board also contains terrain markers and vortex markers, which the armies can use to jump around and appear unexpectedly behind enemy lines, presenting a sudden and unforeseen threat to the rear.<br/><br/>The terrain transforms what would otherwise be a featureless playing area into one that more closely resembles the terrain over which actual battles are fought. With an almost incalculably large number of possible different terrain configurations, strategy cannot be decided in advance. The beginner always stands a chance against the experienced player.<br/><br/>Bin&acute;Fa armies use up supplies when they move just as real armies do. On taking possession of the dice, players must choose between moving their army units on the battle sector (which uses up supplies) or using their turn to move the supply marker in hope of obtaining fresh supplies.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting aspects of Bin&acute;Fa is the &quot;cavalry charge.&quot; As long as a player has sufficient supplies and is lucky enough to avoid rolling a double, it is possible to send a force dashing across the board to attack enemy units and (hopefully) return.<br/><br/>The game of Bin&acute;Fa brings together two strands whose origins go back to very ancient times. Sun Tzu was a famous Chinese general and student of warfare. Bin&acute;Fa is based on the precepts contained in his classic work on the subject, &quot;The Art of War,&quot; written 2,300 years ago. They provide the structural framework for the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sushi Draft is a fast little card game that looks good enough to eat! Over three rounds, players draft plates of sushi and collect sushi points, which are drawn randomly. The player with the most diverse menu gets dessert!<br/><br/>Sushi Draft includes a deck of 32 sushi cards (8 ikura, 7 ebi, 6 maguro, 5 tamago, 4 kappa and 2 &quot;wild&quot; triples) and 18 point tokens (three each for the five types of sushi and three for dessert); the point tokens range in value from 1-5, with the more plentiful sushi dishes being worth more points. At the start of each round, players shuffle the cards and receive a hand of six cards. Players simultaneously draft a card from their hand and reveal it, placing it on the table. They then keep one card, pass the remainder to a neighbor, and draft and play again. Once everyone has five cards in front of them, players receive point tokens. Whoever has the most sushi of each type draws a point token of that type at random; if players tie for the most of a type, however, then the player with the secondmost of that type draws the token instead. If all players are tied, then no one scores for that type of sushi. The player with the most types of sushi scores a dessert token at random.<br/><br/>After three rounds, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inspired by the traditional Italian game of Scopa, Shokoba is a card game in which two to four players play cards from their hands to collect jewel cards from the table. (With four players, Shokoba is typically played in teams.) The forty-card deck consists of 27 sapphires, 9 rubies, 3 emeralds and 1 diamond.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player receives three cards in hand, and four cards are placed face-up on the table. On a turn, a player must play one card. If the value of this card equals a card on the table or is the sum of two or more cards on the table, that player must collect these cards, along with the card played; if not, the card is placed face-up on the table. If a player takes all the cards on the table, he receives a gem as a bonus point.<br/><br/>After all players have played their three cards, they receive three more cards from the deck but no new cards are added to the table. Once players have gone through the entire deck, the game ends and five points (gems) are handed out: One to the player who collected the diamond; one each to the player who collected the most sapphires, emeralds or rubies; and one to the player who collected the most cards. In the event of ties, no one collects a point. The first player to collect eleven gems wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pollyanna is a race/pursuit game published by Parker Brothers between 1915 and 1967.  During those years, several editions appeared with differing artwork and game pieces.  Some of these editions are entitled Dixie or Dixie-Pollyanna and some are subtitled &quot;The Great Home Game,&quot; &quot;The Glad Game,&quot; or &quot;Parker Brothers Track Pursuit Game.&quot; In 1917 it was completely rethemed as The Popular Game of Broadway, with artwork of New York scenes featuring famous buildings of the time.  Pollyanna itself gets its name from the title of the 1913 children's novel by Eleanor H. Porter.  Each piece color in the game is associated with one of the characters in the novel.  In the original 1915 edition blue was Aunt Polly; green was Nancy; red was Jimmy; and yellow was John Pendleton.  These color associations changed in future editions.<br/><br/>The game is widely recognized as a variant of Parcheesi, which is itself derived from Pachisi, a classic game of India.  The object of Pollyanna, as in all games of the Pachisi family, is to be the first player to move his or her four men from the start space around the board to the home space.  During the course of the game, players may also land on single opposing pieces and send them back to start.  Two or three opposing pieces on the same space can neither be captured nor passed.<br/><br/>Pollyanna differs from Parcheesi in several important ways.<br/><br/><br/>     The track is laid out as a square and is 62 spaces long between start and home (in Parcheesi it is laid out as a cross and is 72 spaces long); furthermore Pollyanna employs four turnouts&mdash;short semi-circular paths off the main path (known as the broadway).  Only single pieces may occupy a turnout space, but pieces there may not be passed and are invulnerable to capture.  Turnouts are the most important difference between Pollyanna and Parcheesi.  They make the two games play quite differently.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The bonus move for capturing an opponent's piece is only 10 spaces, and there is no bonus for a piece reaching home (in Parcheesi these pay a 20-space and 10-space bonus respectively).  <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Doubles are handled differently. In Pollyanna each double earns the right to another roll, provided that the player was able to use both dice. (In Parcheesi, on the third consecutive roll of doubles a player loses his/her turn and must return one of his pieces to start.) In addition, only the obverse faces of dice are counted in doubles.  (In Parcheesi, both the obverse faces and reverse faces of the dice are counted.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Up to three pieces of the same color may occupy a space on the broadway.  This effectively means that a player can pass his or her own blockade, by first landing exactly on the blockade and joining it, and then moving on.  This is not possible in Parcheesi.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pieces are started on a roll of six (on either of the two dice or as the sum of the two dice).  In Parcheesi, the roll required is a five.  This means that starting a piece in Pollyanna is somewhat easier than in Parcheesi.   <br/><br/><br/><br/>     There are safe spaces for each color; there are no general safe spaces.  If a pawn is on a safe space of its own color no other player's pawn may land there, but it may pass through.  <br/><br/><br/>",

You put on your jacket, lace up your boots and set out.<br/><br/>The leaves rustle on the trees, and the sunlight shines through the branches. A gentle breeze blows as you take a deep breath of forest air. Lost in your thoughts, you turn once here and then again there, sometimes going left and sometimes turning right... Suddenly you hear something rustling behind you in the bushes. You take a few cautious steps towards the noise and discover...a goose?! And it's talking to a goblin? Then all of a sudden, your friends are standing next to you in the forest...<br/><br/>Umm. You decide it might best to head home quickly. There seems to be something wrong with this forest...<br/><br/>Which is the shortest way back? You're in luck as the fairy tale characters decide to show you, but your friends are constantly changing the path in Memorinth in their own attempts to get home the quickest. However, with a bit of luck and memory, you'll be the first to get out of the labyrinth!<br/><br/>To set up, place the clearing tile on the table, then place all of the player pieces on this card, then lay out the other tile to form a 5x5 grid with the clearing tile at the center; alternate the light and dark sides of the tiles, with the clearing tile starting on the light side. Place two of the eight fairy tale characters on each side of the grid.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player flips over an unoccupied tile that matches the light/dark status of the clearing tile. If the revealed side of the tile has one of the eight fairy tail characters on it, you must move your player piece one space toward the side of the grid where this character is located &mdash; but only if a path connects the tile you current occupy and the tile to which you must move. If no path exists, you don't move. Starting with the second round, the clearing tile will flip from light to dark and back again, challenging you to remember which characters are where so that you can move in the direction that helps you best.<br/><br/>Memorinth also has a &quot;master mode&quot; in which you place four of the fairy tail characters around a special double-sided action tile. On one side of this tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll remove a tile from the grid, then add it back on the opposite side of the grid, sliding everything in that row or column. On the other side of the action tile, when you reveal one of the characters next to it, you'll swap two tiles, swap two fairy tail characters, look at the bottom of a tile, or receive a lucky clover token, which you'll need in order to walk on a path with goblins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You know that they will pretend to be one of yours and lie as much as necessary to prevent you from achieving your goal.<br/><br/>The Cadets win the game if they achieve all the missions before the main deck runs out.<br/>The Zarkians win the game if the main deck of cards runs out and  there are still missions that are not achieved.<br/><br/>",

Trumping can be done with anywhere between 1-5 friends, so long as each friend is essential to the trump.  Scoring is based upon the number of friends used in the trump. (Example, 1-friend trump, gain attributes of 1 friend. 3-friend trump, gain attributes of all 3 friends MINUS the attributes of the LOSE card. 5-friend trump, automatically win the game, but is very rare.)<br/><br/>Players also have a FAMILY in which they score points at the beginning of the game and then periodically, depending on the number of FAMILY REUNION cards (a type of GAIN card) played.

        "description": "Galatune is an anime battle tabletop card game set on the fantasy planet of Lyra. The United World Government maintains peace and prosperity through the monopoly of advanced ancient technologies, but utopia comes at a steep cost. Will you join with the government to protect unity, or will you join the rebels and fight for freedom and independence?<br/><br/>2-5 players each lead a Champion warrior into battle and earn a Victory Point each time an opponent is defeated. You win the game by being the first to earn 3 Victory Points by defeating 3 opponents. BUT there's a twist! The game doesn't end for you when your Champion falls in battle. Instead, you just get back up on your feet, respawn your Champion, and continue fighting! Think of it as a sort of card-based battle-royal, like a Battle Arena game, where you play for KOs.<br/><br/>Unlike other battle card games where players take their turns one-at-a-time, in Galatune everyone attacks simultaneously! It's an exciting formula that keeps the game moving and encourages players to predict and react to each other in real time.<br/><br/>Great game for first-time gamers or serious pros! Easy-to-Learn, impossible to master!<br/><br/>",

(The goal card is played during the game as an animal card.) Each kind of animal has a power when played: the meerkat allows the player to draw an additional card; the lion returns a card next to him face down; the elephant returns a card next to him face up; and the rhino moves a card. Some animal cards depict ponds, and animals next to ponds score two points instead of one.<br/><br/>",

The Aliens attacked the Earth and destroyed 99% of humanity using orbital death rays. However, the weapon interacted strangely with human DNA and caused an unforeseen mutation! Within 24 hours of death, the recently dead arose and slowly shambled aimlessly with purpose in the general direction of the Alien attackers to take their revenge.<br/><br/>Aliens vs. Zombies is a small, low-complexity wargame for beginners, children and light-hearted fans of aliens and/or zombies. The aliens are invading a small town. A side effect of their weapons used to conquer humanity is the reanimation of the newly dead, who are out for revenge!<br/><br/>The alien player has fewer units but has the advantage of superior weaponry and armor. Zombies are plentiful and are divided into different types: rotting, tough and fast. Both sides can move or attack during their turn. Each side has one unique action: aliens can blast away with exploding dice and zombies can chomp their opponents to create new allies.<br/><br/>Each turn a tile is revealed with a number of zombie spawns and special events. After the 8th turn, the zombie dead (those deader than usual) are counted to determine the victor.<br/><br/>Which side will you choose? Choose wisely and conquer, in Aliens vs. Zombies!<br/><br/>Complexity: 2 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 6 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cubilete is an old and very traditional game in Cuba that is second in popularity only to Cuban dominoes. Similar cubilete games are played in other Latin American countries, but the rules vary all over the map, with many cultures playing a version that is very much like the card game Poker/Poker Dice. The Cuban game however is unique!<br/><br/>There are five Dice in the traditional Cubilete set. Each dice has six sides, and each side has one of the following characters on it: Ace, King, Queen (also known as &quot;Cundangas&quot;), Jack (Jevas, or Mujeres), 10 (Los Gallegos), 9 (Los Negros).<br/><br/>The object of the game is to roll five dice of the same kind. A hand with less than five of a kind has absolutely no value.<br/><br/>To win a round, you need to get the highest hand. The winner of each round (and only the winner) wins points based on the value of their hand. A game is played to a total score of 10 patas (points). Whoever gets 10 points first wins the game, even if all of the players have not had a turn.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the game is to score &quot;Carabinas.&quot; If you roll any Carabina during the game you immediately win the round and get to keep rolling for another round.<br/><br/>There are three types of Carabina, listed in order of value.<br/><br/>Carabina de Aces -- is worth ten points and is very difficult to obtain. To get Carabina de Aces, you need to get a complete set of five aces within the three-roll limit. If you get Carabina de Aces, you are awarded 10 points. The game is over. You have eliminated everyone else in the game. You are the winner of the game, even if no one else had a chance to roll! If you get Carabina de Aces, then you are always the first roller in the next game.<br/><br/>Carabina de Ks (Kings) Naturales -- you need to have five Kings within your three allotted rolls. If you get this type of Carabina, you get five points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.<br/><br/>Carabina de Ks (Kings) No Naturales -- the only way to obtain this is by pairing the Aces with the Kings. (The Ace can be paired with any of the other dice because it is wild.) If you obtain this type of carabina, you get two points. You win the round, the round ends and you keep on rolling on to the next round.<br/><br/>If nobody gets a Carabina after everyone has had their turn, one point is awarded to the person with the highest hand:<br/><br/>&middot; Five Queens<br/>&middot; Five Jevas (Jacks)<br/>&middot; Five Gallegos<br/>&middot; Five Negros<br/><br/>The strategy in Cubilete is knowing what to play for and when, depending on what your opponents score. Obviously, luck is the dominant factor. Cubilete is often played as a drinking game, with several scoring variations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In society, whenever a crime has been committed, no matter how small, there is always evidence left behind. The evidence usually points to certain suspects. In this game, the players are all &quot;simply suspects.&quot; What is unusual is that the suspects each have the opportunity to tamper with the evidence so that it points to other suspects.<br/><br/>If the evidence points to you when you meet the Grand Jury, you are eliminated from the game. While moving the evidence around, players must also try to hide their own identity - so other players don&rsquo;t figure out which suspect they are. If a player discovers another player&rsquo;s identity, they may point the finger at that player and eliminate them from the game.<br/><br/>Simply Suspects is a fast-action game of suspicion and finger pointing. Much like Spy Alley, Simply Suspects is deceptively simple yet surprisingly intense. The advantage that one player may appear to have can change with a single move. You are never sure which suspect will escape the Grand Jury and win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts the game with a number of cylinders based on the player count.<br/><br/>On a turn, you look at the wood beam on the end of the spiral &mdash; without touching it or measuring it &mdash; then identify which two cylinders you want to place this beam on. You want to place the beam so that its endpoints are contained (and not hanging over) the faces of these cylinders, and each cylinder can have at most two beams resting on it. After you identify these cylinders, each other player has a chance to steal your turn by identifying cylinders on a higher level where this beam could be placed.<br/><br/>If you &mdash; or the turn stealer &mdash; have correctly estimated the length of the beam and can make the connection, you then place one or more cylinders from your supply onto the playing area, with one cylinder on the newly placed beam and additional cylinders on beams at lower levels. The higher the beam, the more cylinders you can place! If you can't place the beam, then you return it to the end of the line, and if you had tried to steal someone's turn, they get to hand over the number of cylinders they would have placed.<br/><br/>Whoever first places all of their own cylinders wins.<br/><br/>",

It should be easy for Prince Charming to defeat a young boy, except that Hansel has an equally sinister sister, Gretel, and together they form an eerily unstoppable duo. It will take all of their tricks to win control of the Kingdom, but who will be victorious?&quot;<br/><br/>The setting for Scary Tales is a kingdom, where a battle awaits as the king has died, leaving no heir. While the enchanted forest is feared and the castle is covered in dark clouds, corruption has affected the town and only those with the utmost abilities in Strength, Wisdom, Magic and Luck will be able to collect enough relics from the stories of long ago to prove themselves worthy of being the new leader. The challengers are sharp, indomitable, and devious - and with each match-up, it is uncertain who will win the crown.<br/><br/>Each character comes with its own unique ability which may be used once per game and a color coded set of dice. A set of power cards and fortune cards, a fairy card and a die associated with said fairy comprise the contents of the game. To win, a player needs to obtain seven points worth of relics, and hold on to them until the beginning of their next turn.<br/><br/>",

Beginners can start playing with few hexagons, while experienced players can use the complete set of 36 tiles. The dimension of the &ldquo;battlefield&rdquo; determines also the number of dice used by the players. In this game, dice are used as a sort of &ldquo;soldiers&rdquo; who will &ldquo;fight&rdquo; to conquer &ldquo;Diceland&rdquo;, although the game is definitely not a war game. Rules are very simple, and although the players have to roll a lot of dice during the game, only a good strategy can lead to a winning position. DICELAND can be played at different levels: the basic one will take only few minutes to be completed, while the most advanced can offer up to 45 minutes of entertainment, introducing the special terrain rules. The rulebook comes in 5 languages, full of pictures and with many game variants.<br/><br/>",

He realizes he has been robbed and enlists the help of some other children, &quot;the detectives&quot;, to help find the man who stole his money.<br/><br/>The game consists of a two-piece board, which joins together like a puzzle, and 31 tiles depicting city scenery that stick vertically into the board. There are 34 places on the board on which the players can move. Each one is covered by a wooden cylinder. The picture of the criminal is under one of the cylinders. One player will move this cylinder around the board.<br/><br/>One player plays the role of the criminal, Herr Grundeis, and the other players are the detectives. Herr Grundeis needs to try to cross the board from the station to the park before the detectives, played by the other players, find him. If Herr Grundeis reaches the park, he wins. If one of the detectives finds him, the detectives win. Herr Grundeis moves first. He roles the black die. The detectives now put on their blindfolds. Herr Grundeis now moves up to the number of spaces indicated on the die. He cannot move more than the number of spaces indicated on the die, but he can move less. The detectives see the die so they know how many spaces the criminal may have moved. The detectives remove their blindfolds and are given a clue that partially describes the tile in front of the criminal. The detectives role the white die in turn and move up to the number of spaces indicated, hopefully stopping in front of a tile that meets the criteria mentioned in the clue. The player checks bottom of the cylinder he has landed on to see if Herr Grundeis is hiding there. Each detective roles the die and moves before Herr Grundeis moves again.<br/><br/>",

A clever mechanism helps the other players to generate a range of stories in little time. When the story is over, each player attempts to deduce and guess the mood of the protagonist player: Secretly, players choose a specific mood on their mood wheels, then everybody reveals their choice. Points are scored depending on how close your choice is to the protagonist's chosen mood. The protagonist-player scores victory points depending on how close the other players get to his chosen mood.<br/><br/>When everybody has scored points, the role of the protagonist passes clockwise, and a new turn starts. The first player to reach 24 victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns revealing one card, and as soon as four instances of a color are visible &mdash; whether in the center of the card, in the color of the word, or in the word itself &mdash; the first player to slap the correct color card claims all cards bearing this color. When all of the cards are face up, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.<br/><br/>In &quot;Antipode&quot;, you place all of the cards face up, then everyone races simultaneously to grab (with one hand) pairs of cards in which the color of the word on one card matches the written word on the other and vice versa.

But while navigating through the lab to get back to the monkeys, one of your friends knocks over a beaker of The Competitive Edge. Due to the current side effect, everyone is now under the impression that this is a competition and whomever frees the most monkeys wins.<br/><br/>Monkeys Need Love Too is a fast paced, action card game where you compete to free as many monkeys as possible while at the same time preventing your opponents from doing the same.<br/><br/>Game play is divided into two phases. In the main phase, Flinging Poo, players take turns around the table. A player's turn starts off by drawing your hand to reload back up to 5 cards. If you draw banana cards, they are set aside and you keep drawing. Next the player has the option to play one monkey card and one action card.  Afterwards they must feed their monkeys using the bananas they have stored. If a monkey can't be fed, he/she is discarded. And lastly, the player may discard any cards out of their hand in the hopes of drawing better ones or more bananas next turn.<br/><br/>The game is over when some plays the action card &quot;No Coco, No!!&quot;.  If successful, this ends the Flinging Poo phase and triggers the To the Trees phase. Everyone must now draw for their end fate. Do they escape?  Must they sacrifice some of their monkeys to do so? Do they find new monkeys while on the way out? In the end, the person who freed the most monkeys without being caught is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

The game board features six tracks, 6-10 spaces long worth 2-4 points, with a food space at the end of each track.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls six dice, then can reroll a number of dice equal to his total of active ants on the board. After rerolling, if the player has achieved a straight of at least four dice, he can attack another player's ant(s), pushing them back on the tracks. Longer straights equal more attacks, and two attacks are needed to dislodge an ant in the valuable food spaces.<br/><br/>After attacking, the player chooses all dice of one value and moves an ant forward on the track of that number equal to the number of dice chosen. Land on another ant, and it's trapped beneath you. Land on the food space, and you have earned the points shown there &ndash; points you can lose if someone attacks you later.<br/><br/>If you don't like what you rolled (and rerolled), you can skip the attack and movement phase to take a Queen token. On a later turn, you can hand in a Queen to make an extra attack, gain an additional reroll, or move two ants on different tracks. A player can hold only one Queen token.<br/><br/>As soon as one player holds 6-9 food points, with the total depending on the number of players, that player instantly wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An early abstract 2 player game from Alex Randolph, players move a pipe of chips across the board, which fall into the available spaces. The board is a plastic table with 6x6 depressions, but the 4 corners are blocked so there are only 32 playing spaces. One player seeds the board with 11 grey discs.<br/><br/>Then each player fills a plastic tube with wooden discs, one with blue, the other with yellow discs. One player starts in the corner and moves the tube. If it goes over an empty space, the disc falls and occupies the place. The other player can choose to then take this tube, or start with the other, so removing the starting advantage. The players then continue to move their tubes around, until one gets 11 discs down for the win. The tubes can be moved orthogonally or diagonally any distance, but not jump or turn corners.<br/><br/>Reportedly a good abstract game and a clever physical mechanism.<br/><br/>",

Three battle maps on a 34x22&quot; sheet, a rather unusual treatment from S&amp;T lately.<br/><br/>TLG2 presents low-complexity simulations of three important battles fought during the later stages of the War of 1812, when the Americans re-secured their control of the Old Northwest and then attempted to win the war by invading and conquering Canada. TLG2 is a follow-on to the original TLG, which was published in S&amp;T #184 (Mar/Apr 1997) and covered the battles of Bladensburg, North Point and New Orleans.<br/><br/>Each of the three battle games included in TLG2 is a two-player contest. One player commands the American forces, while the other commands the Anglo-Canadian opposition. The American player is generally on the offensive in all three games, but the Anglo-Canadian player will also have ample opportunity for counterattack.<br/><br/>",

You have three lifelines, 50-50, Ask the Audience and even Phone A Friend, but once they're gone you're on your own. The questions in this new version have been updated, so even addicted players of the first edition will have plenty to go at.<br/><br/>Cards replace Chris Tarrant and a board replaces the TV studio, but otherwise the atmosphere can be every bit as electric as the real thing. So go on, give it a try. You may just be the next paper Millionaire! --Sophie Lowe<br/><br/>Each of these games contains a &quot;golden ticket&quot;, giving the holder a chance to win a visit to the &quot;Who Wants to be a Millionaire&quot; studio to meet Chris Tarrant and play the game for real.<br/><br/>",

You have to use a magnet to learn if the totem is a good one or a trap. If the totem moves away from the magnet, it is a trap. If it pulls towards you it is one of the 8 good ones. Players check the totems individually and place it on the middle of the appropriate adventure square. This means the nature of this totem is known to one of the players. He must memorize all the totems he checked. In the second part (when all totems are known by one or more players), when a player starts an the adventure players have to tell the other players what status the totem has, if he is right he gets the totem. If he gets it wrong he loses a research point.<br/><br/>When all 8 good totems are found the golden Rastapopoulos totem is placed for the final adventure. When players cross Rastapopoulos himself they have to fight him (by a throw of the dice).<br/><br/>When a player loses all his points he has to start at the beginning of the board and receives 4 new points to re-enter the race until the golden totem is reached.<br/><br/>",

Each player at their turn draws one card from the deck and one card from the market. After that the player has to play those cards instantly in any order in any city.<br/><br/>Some cards may have negative winning points worth or carry negative immediate effects - this is the reason to put those cards in opponents' towns.<br/><br/>Apart from three types of citizen cards: knights, priests and commoners players may draw a disease card and play it to start an epidemic. Epidemic goes from one city to another killing inhabitants with weakest immune system. At the same time, some diseases like leprosy prefer to start with priests, others with commoners or knights.<br/><br/>In addition to easy and pleasant mechanics and fun &quot;Take that!&quot; effect the games offer hilarious and well-designed cards based on &quot;Medieval suffering&quot; memes - excerpts from medieval paintings with comic quotes<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Жизнь средневековых людей тяжела и полна страданий.

        "description": "Welcome to the ghost competition at the old turret clock! As they do every night, the ghosts are coming together to play their fun game on the clock. When the clock strikes midnight, the clock arm will start moving. Left, right, left, right, there's something wrong with the clock! The players need to place their ghosts on the wicked clock, but the clock arm will try to swipe the ghosts off the clock. Once the arm stops, the round is over and each player counts, how many of his ghosts could hang on to the clock. Whoever has the most, wins the round and gets to place one of the ghosts on to the winner podium. The first player to win three rounds will be the new champion - but only for one day, when the challenge will start again!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This latest version of Bin'Fa: The Tao of War has many changes from those familiar with its previous incarnations (Hexagony, Bin'Fa), such as the addition of the General; Vortexes that allow you to traverse the board in one move, appearing where least expected; rule changes governing the gathering of supplies, and the separation of the original hexagon shaped game board into six separate game board sections which offer almost limitless possibilities for new terrain each game.<br/><br/>In Bin-Fa, armies move over a landscape that is different each game. A player controls at least one but can control up to three armies per game. You can use the board sections to create inlets, peninsulas, isthmuses, lakes, and more. Adding vortex and terrain markers allows you even more control over the layout of the game board and how it will be traversed. Your ability to take advantage of the layout of the battlefield is crucial to victory and defeat.<br/><br/>Each army is made up of 12 Army Units, one General, and one Supply Pawn. At the start of your turn, you must decide if you are going for supplies or moving your army.  On taking possession of the dice: first see if any of your Army Units are in danger and if so, respond defensively; second, see if any of your opponent's Army Units are vulnerable and, if possible, attack; third, if neither of these choices applies, go for supplies. Sun Tzu says: &quot;Do not move without considering all the possibilities. Move always with a clear purpose.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules for movement of your army allow you to simulate many strategies from the ancient battlefield. Even &ldquo;cavalry charges&rdquo; are possible&mdash;where a unit dashes across the board to attack an enemy position. Your mission is to surround and eliminate enemy Army Units until only your Army is left, leaving you the victor.<br/>Deals and alliances can be made in the open or in secret. But only one commander can emerge victorious: knowing when and with whom to form alliances and when to break them can sometimes determine who wins and who loses.<br/><br/>",

Empires at War simulates four of these battles.<br/><br/>The Basic Game allows beginners to learn quickly, while providing experienced players an exciting evening of action. The Advanced Game fully simulates grand tactics of this period. Rules include provisions for light infantry (jaegers and chasseurs), command control, morale, fog of war, and mitrailleuse (early machine guns).<br/><br/>- Inkerman, 5 November 1854 <br/>At the height of the Crimean War, the Russians made a determined attempt to break out of Sevastopol. After a desperate day of fighting in rough terrain and fog, the Russians nearly broke the outnumbered Allies, but fell back with severe losses.<br/><br/>- Solferino, 24 June 1859 <br/>A decisive clash between the French/Sardinian and the Austrians came at the town of Solferino. The narrow French/Sardinian victory over Austria was due to the intrepid leadership of individual French corps commanders.<br/><br/>- Koniggratz, 3 July 1866 <br/>The decisive battle of the &quot;Six Weeks War&quot; came after a month of preliminary maneuvering. After a day of bloody see-saw fighting, the Prussian Second Army suddenly appeared on the northern flank, rolling up the Austrian line.<br/> - Gravelotte-St. Privat, 18 August 1870 <br/>The decisive action occurred near the great fortress of Metz. The situation might have turned in favor of the French, but hesitation allowed Von Moltke to regroup and prepare a flanking maneuver that assured a German victory.<br/><br/>Components: <br/><br/>    400 counters<br/>    16-page rule book<br/>    4 maps on (2) 22&quot; x 34&quot; mapsheets<br/>    1 inch box<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)<br/><br/>Quad game depicting 4 battles fought during the 19th century: Inkerman (1854), Solferino (1859), K&ouml;niggratz (1866) and Gravelotte (1870).<br/><br/>Lots of chrome rules, including command control,different weapon types and morale.  Nato style counters.  Four maps (3 large and 1 small). Inkerman,whilst fought on the smallest map due to the small battlefield, is a standout.

        "description": "The Forever War is a science fiction board game, based on the novel &quot;Forever War&quot; by Joe Haldeman. It features squad-level combat in the third millennium. Combat occurs on airless portal planets, where small infantry ground units vie with each other for victory among the frozen wastes. A player can never be sure of whom or what he will find when his troops near the battlefield.<br/><br/>Units are equipped with weapons of the latest technology, and embark on their starships. Only weeks or months pass for them, traveling at near-light speeds, but decades pass in the universe surrounding them. The enemy these units meet on the battlefield could be technologically decades ahead or behind them when the battle is joined.<br/><br/>",

Will you recover all eight shards and win your way home or will you ever roam among the dark trees of Wyr?<br/><br/>A solitaire game using a one page board, 9 markers, 1 deck of playing cards and 1 six sided die.<br/><br/>To Win: You must free each of the 8 Ravens, reclaiming their spellshards of magic before the remaining ravens reduce your health to 0. <br/>Each Raven you free will allow you to draw a Recovered Spellshard card from its deck.<br/><br/>To Play: Each round of the game has 3 phases which are played in cycles until all Ravens are freed or your health is lost:<br/><br/>Phase 1. Raven Flight - Draw 1 card from the Raven Flight deck and discard it face up to the bottom of the game board. The card drawn equals the number of spaces 1 or more Ravens will fly (i.e. move) this turn.<br/><br/>Phase 2. Raven Attack - Each Raven that ends its flight on a space your marker occupies will attack you in turn. For each Raven draw 1 Raven Strength card plus 1 additional card for each freed Raven.<br/><br/>Then, play cards from your hand into a discard pile in front of you, adding the values of each card together for your defense strength. If your defense strength is greater than the Raven&rsquo;s attack strength you have freed the Spellshard.<br/><br/>Phase 3. Wanderer Movement/Freeing -<br/>The cards in your hand are used both for defense and movement. Each card you play will go in a discard pile in front of you.<br/><br/>Recovered Spellshards Deck -<br/>When Ravens are freed they become Spellshards you have recovered. You may use a Spellshard at any time during a round, playing them from your hand, but once a Spellshard is played it is removed from the game.<br/><br/>This game is part of a series: The other two games are Seeker in the Forest of Wyr and Land of Enin<br/><br/>",

Little did you know that you weren&rsquo;t the only Senator with such lofty goals, as there are other Senators with a similar agenda.  Players secretly plot to gain the most supporters within the city of Rome to help bring their plan to fruition, and to bring about the fall of Caesar, or at the very least, posture themselves in a position of greater power.<br/><br/>The game takes place over a series of rounds.  During each round, a new Supporter is revealed and players secretly choose what Tactic they will choose for the round, either to Persuade Supporters of the current type, or to Manipulate the game to their favor.  The game ends immediately if any player manages to have 13 or more Supporters, with at least 1 supporter of each type.  Otherwise, the game ends after the round when the last Supporter card is revealed, and players are awarded points for the Supporters they have left at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Politico: The Fall of Caesar is not an expansion for Politico.  It is a stand alone game that borrows mechanics from the original game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As Marshal of the interstellar fleet, it is your duty to oversee the colonization of nearby regions of the galaxy and thereby ensure the perpetuation of your people at any cost. But your race is not alone in its aspirations for dominance of the cosmos, or in having the power to realize that goal. Races hailing from various star systems venture out in all directions. Many paths are dead ends, but some sectors have sizable deposits of rare minerals that can be refined into the precious fuel crystals that drive your space fleets onward. Soon, a trail of colonies leads out from your homeworld, and soon the races venture into the same cosmic regions. Don&rsquo;t get too attached to your fleets or interstellar empire, because tides can and will turn quickly. Only you can determine the fate of your people: interstellar conquest or infinite servitude.<br/><br/>StelCon: Infinity is a light strategy war game on a galactic scale. 2-6 players can expect around 30-45 minutes per player, so 2 players can often power through a game in about an hour. The 6 player game is kept short by combining into 3 teams of 2 where the teammates execute their turns simultaneously.<br/><br/>Variable game board. There are 6 races to choose from, each with its own strengths. Although the jump lanes that connect the sectors forming the galactic map are printed on the game boards, each sector location is covered by a different card from the sector deck each game.<br/><br/>Sectors are drawn from the deck and placed as the players explore the galaxy, so you never know what you're going to get...unless you do some scouting with your fighter squads or happen to have some telepaths on board your ship (telepaths are handy that way). Some of the sector cards are identical and therefore also create a &quot;bridge&quot; which is a unique adjacency in addition to the normal jump lanes. All this makes for a very different board every time.<br/><br/>Moving your space fleet around is straight forward. Each ship can move 1 sector per turn, plus 1 extra sector per turn per engine MOD. Your space ships are modular in design, both from a gameplay and a literal perspective. You physically insert engines, extra guns, and fighter squads into holes in the space ships. We call these MODs.<br/><br/>Combat is simple but tense. Add up your firepower present at the battle site and then toss in a d6 roll. The opponent does the same. Compare the two totals, and the winner keeps the sector in question while the loser retreats and loses a ship from his fleet.<br/><br/>While the game is a conquest type game, it ends immediately when one player conquers any homeworld, so there's no eliminated player stuck waiting around for the game to finish.<br/><br/>Conquest cards are the soul of the game. The deck of 120 cards gives tons of gotcha moments, and serious replay value. They allow you to do all sorts of fun things:<br/><br/><br/>     Modify the firepower of your sector or your ship<br/>     Boost fuel crystal production (the economy of the game)<br/>     Steal or stop opponent's cards<br/>     Cheat the dice<br/>     Wipe out a whole sector<br/>     Even influence battles your forces are not involved in, adding an element of table-talking diplomacy to the game<br/><br/><br/>",

The board simulates an old map and is divided into four trading regions, each with multiple ports.  Each region sells a different spice and the market price is controlled by card play.  However, an &quot;expert price&quot; can be obtained by guessing the identity of a mystery spice.  The game actually comes with around twenty small containers of real spices that get thrown into a bag.  If a player is trying to get an expert price, he picks one container  at random, opens it, sniffs it, and guesses what it is from a list of common and not so common spices.<br/><br/>This is not the main aspect of gameplay, but it does spice it up, so to speak.  It is mostly a commodity speculation game; not only do the players need to get good prices on the spices that they are bringing back to Europe, they also need to lay in supplies in order to keep their ship on the move.  Obtaining the money to buy  supplies requires selling spices to regions other than the spice's region of origin; and in this case, a player wants the spice price to be high.<br/><br/>Event cards add a random aspect to the game and there are pirates prowling the waters who are out to ruin a captain's best laid plans.<br/><br/>Title translates to &quot;The Spice Route&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Every time you turn the dice, and perhaps use a special ability first, you can cross off a square on your block that corresponds to the colour and number of the dice square. There are row and colour combos. To do this, you must either have 5 crosses in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row, or have 5 crossed squares of the same colour. You must announce each DREBO aloud and cross it off on your game board. It is common to show more enthusiasm with each additional DREBO, to shout louder and even to jump up at the end!<br/><br/>DREBO is an entertaining dice game for the whole family. With 8 different playing sheets and 2 game boards, it can be combined again and again. Due to high interactivity, there is no waiting time during the moves of the others.<br/><br/>",

Behind them lay Romania and the wreckage of the German 6th and 8th Armies. Ahead of them lay Budapest and Vienna and the battered lines of German and Hungarian defenders. The men of the Red Army were confident of a quick and easy victory. Appearances were deceiving, however.<br/><br/>Near the city of Debrecen the Russian Advanced Guard encountered, not the remnants of an already defeated force, but four full-strength panzer divisions, eager for revenge. They would clash in one the great battles of the Second World War. The result would be the last real victory for the Germans in the East, the last time that the Wehrmacht could slug it out toe to toe with a full strength German force. The victory, however, was close and might well have gone the other way.<br/><br/>It is this situation that The Last Panzer Victory seeks to simulate with a fast paced, mobile, hard hitting game of operational warfare on the Eastern Front. The elegant game system realistically portrays armored combat in World War II. The effects of weather, supply, artillery, air power, and headquarters are represented through accurate yet playable rules, whose design features include: An interactive turn sequence - Special stacking and zones of control rules to reflect the unique conditions of the Eastern Front &ndash; Extensive unit specialization rules to simulate the unique unit capabilities and liabilities.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day <br/>Hex: 1.2 miles / 2 kilometers <br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; 8-color mapsheet<br/>Four dual-side printed countersheets (600 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page The Last Panzer Victory rulebook<br/>Two single-side printed Player Aid charts<br/>One Plastic storage tray<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-6 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lorrein is published by Sensalot in 2011. The Duces of Lorrein is a family game with a nice mix of existing and new game elements. It contains a new invented alternative to dice.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to complete you mission card which states to build 4 specified workshops (Mill, Saw Mill, Stone Mill, Tannery (leather)). You start with just 1.<br/><br/>Turn sequence:<br/>1) Each player throws the chancebowl and gets raw materials (Wood, rock, animal, grain, lavender)(wooden pieces). <br/>2)The raw material has to be processed in a workshop in order to become a useful product (product cards). Because the other players have the other workshops you'll have to negotiate with them to get you material processed. This makes players dependent of each other. With the product card a player can build a workshop, farm, castle, big castle or a witchery.<br/>3)The final step is paying food for each castle. If a player doesn't have enough food, a game piece has to be taken away.<br/><br/>The winner is the player that completes his turn and mission card.<br/><br/>What makes the game interesting is the dilemma of being mutually dependent of your co player. Meanwhile each player wants to become independent by building your own workshops. For this you first need to negotiate with your co players. Becoming independent is often not on the road to completing you mission. So should you remain dependent and try to reach you goal asap, while running the risk of being blocked in the end, or should you try to become independent first and strong en your influence.<br/>Another element of influence in the game is the Mill. There is only one mill in the game. If someone else builds the mill, you lose it. Having the mill means controlling the food. You can use this position to get extra income or by starving and deterioration you opponents. Partner or Compete.<br/><br/>Another element is the game of positioning:  <br/>A workshop has to border a Castle. A small castle can have 2 workshops and a big castle can have 4 workshops. The castle has to be positioned between the 4 8-sided landscapes. Getting a good position with the correct landscapes around your castle is important. However, you opponents can block you by building farms, witchery or a workshop adjacent to your castle.<br/><br/>As an extra the game contains two additions in the manual which will strongly change the game. The first addition is the option to steal a farm if it isn't protected by an own castle or witchery. The second addition is to steal workshop by building a stronger castle.<br/><br/>All in all a very good balanced game, with a lot of dynamic and a great replayability.<br/><br/>",

If you decide to fight, roll the dice; if the result is equal or higher to the difficulty of the dinosaur, you can take it as a prize. The easier-to-catch dinosaurs give fewer points than the more difficult ones. If you fail, you lose some &quot;explorations points&quot;.

A start set of tiles are laid such that no color touches itself on an adjacent tile.  Through the game, tiles are added to the board by the players with this same restriction.<br/><br/>On your turn, you add a marker to claim one of the colored spots on the board; up to two markers can be placed on a space.  When you have four adjacent markers that are all on different colors, you can place a tower. Once the tower is placed, this spot is no longer usable for any other marker connections. The game ends when no more towers can be placed or when someone manages to place all 10 of their towers.  The player with the most placed towers wins.<br/><br/>Tile placement and marker placement are both critical, as is where to place your tower so that you don't shut off further growth options.  It is possible to end up with a bunch of uselessly placed markers once all four colors will not be available to any of them.

        "description": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer CCG is a collectible card game that translates the world of Sunnydale into elegant cards and cunning game mechanics. You can play as Buffy, Spike, Faith, and other characters from the series inside a gaming experience that is never the same twice.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to reach 10 destiny points or control Sunnydale park for 6 turns.<br/><br/>Decks<br/>The game revolves around competing players pre-prepare a deck of cards which is designed to provide a balanced array of different features which appear in the &quot;hand&quot; - a selection cards which each player holds visible to themselves but not - unless otherwise instructed - to the other player.<br/><br/>The cards are organised within a particular framework, which gives structure to the game.<br/><br/>Each player has as &quot;essence&quot; card which has a notch which when placed on the playmate indicates the number of Destiny points gained. If you gain 10 Destiny points you win the game. The other way to win the game is to control of Sunnydale Park (in the centre of the play mats) for six consecutive turns. This means having your characters - and no body else's characters in Sunnydale Park at the end of each of those turns.<br/><br/>Each player controls 4 spaces in which they can place their locations. Then challenges can be placed in these locations. You can get Destiny points by fighting your opponent(s) or by completing challenges. Destiny points can also help you ascend characters, making them stronger.<br/><br/>There are also Action cards, Skill cards and Item cards. These can be played or used in conflict (Challenges and fights).<br/><br/>",

Handicapping can be achieved by reducing a player's number of baffles.  When the race starts, you use a magnetic controller to nudge your steel ball (on the opponent side) through the maze, toward the exit hole.  When you hit a baffle, your ball fails to follow the controller and drops to the bottom, where you must grab it anew.<br/><br/>",

Players try to find out which item was stolen by which person and where. For this you take over the role of the three investigators and their friends - Aunt Mathilda, Inspector Cotta and Uncle Titus. Every character has a special ability which can be used once per game (e.g. move a second time). Just like in the original version, players move on the board. As soon as they enter a room/place, they can ask questions about the crime. Each player has a certain amount of cards in his hand, 3 cards have been put to the side - they say where the crime took place, who the thief is and which item was stolen. It's the players' goal to solve the crime. With the help of questions and your cards, you try to find out as much as possible about the case so that you will be the one to solve the mystery in the end and predict which cards have been set aside.<br/>All items, characters and places are based on the adventures of the three investigators. The place where you can solve the mystery, for example, is the old house trainer in Uncle Titus' salvage yard. Amongst the criminals players can find the investigators' arch enemy Skinny Norris, for example.<br/><br/>",

First book to be released in spring 2016 by Planeta (publisher in Spain of the comics Game of Thrones, Star Wars and The Walking Dead Chronicles).<br/><br/>Developed by board game designer Delphin Druelle at Eclosion Games, &lsquo;Make a Mess&rsquo; features the comic&rsquo;s perfectly irreverent cat making an uncontrollable mess in the house &ndash; while trying not to get caught.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY :<br/><br/>Players begin with 8 Cat Prank cards and 3 Bonus cards.<br/><br/>Each player has to make 3 actions during is turn: <br/>1. Roll the dice to move the Parents from one room to another. <br/>2. Move the Cat where you want (or stay in the same room). <br/>3. Play a Cat Prank card in the room where the Cat is located. Use your Bonus cards whenever you want to change the rules of the game and play tricks against your opponents.<br/><br/>Each Cat Prank card has a level of nastiness from 1 to 5. If a player reach 10 points or above in a room, he has to take responsibility for the mess and put a Cat Paw Pawn.<br/><br/>If the Parents go to the room where your Cat Paw Pawn is, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>To win: be the first to play all your Cat Prank cards or last cat standing!<br/><br/>TESTED AND APPROVED :<br/><br/>Here are the top 5 game features that the gamers have liked the most:<br/><br/>1. The players&rsquo; jokes triggered thanks to the Catsass comic art illustrations <br/>2. The level of adrenaline which quickly grows exponentially during the game <br/>3. The possibility to play tricks at the worst possible timing (for the opponent) <br/>4. The duration (15min max) which allows for successive games (revenge!) <br/>5.

When you win, you get rewards; if you lose you get a &quot;skull&quot; token.<br/>You can also fight other players if you move to their location, to try and take one of their items.<br/>If at any point you accumulate 4 skulls, you lose the next turn (and start again without skulls).<br/>Whoever is first to reach the center of the board and correctly uncover their target precious stones wins!<br/><br/>",

It is meant to be simple and in no way is comparable to Arkham Horror or Trail of the Brotherhood, but in it's own right is fun and there is a strategy to playing the game.

        "description": "Individual aircraft and small group combat during WWII. <br/>Bomber and air superiority missions.<br/>255 Counters<br/><br/>Planes represented are from the early war in the European theatre. The game's namesake, for example, appears in the Mark 1 and Mark V versions only.<br/>It uses a simplified system for maneuver and combat that emphasizes game play over realism, and is very playable. Realism buffs will want to modify the rules or look for a different game.  Changes in a plane's status are recorded by moving counters rather than using a pencil and paper.  Changes in elevation, for example, are indicated by moving a counter along a looped Climb Progress track (different in length for each plane) until passing the 'top', which means the plane has climbed to the next level. At this point the counter on the board representing the plane is replaced with one showing its new level (numbered 1 - 20). Hits are noted on the speed track, such that the plane's maximum speed is reduced as it takes more hits, until the stall speed is reached, when the plane is considered shot down. Each plane uses a unique firing table printed on its record card.<br/>A plane's maneuverability is characterized by its ratings for turns, barrel rolls, wing-overs, and diving costs, as well as its acceleration.<br/>Play set scenarios, or simply pit your favourite planes against each other in a dog fight!<br/><br/>",

Out of these grow snakes, consisting of alternating neutral and coloured wooden segments.<br/>In the beginning of the game, each player draws randomly one of five colours. On his turn, each player takes one neutral and one coloured segment of his choice and puts them on one of the three snakes.<br/>Aim of the game is to have the highest score in the end - having the most elements of your colour in the &quot;best counting&quot; snake, depending on the basket and the snake`s head. This can pe put on the top of any snake by any player before his regular move, but before this, the others have the chance to make a guess about his colour. If they are right, he MUST discover his colour, thus giving the others an advantage, and is not allowed to move the head. If the guess is wrong, he may put the head on the top of a snake or move it on top of another one.<br/>The game ends, when all players pass or if one of the snakes topples down - the score for the player causing this is zero.<br/>Best to be played in several rounds, adding the scores.<br/><br/>",

In a round, each player plays each card one by one by (1) adding it as a new separate animal, (2) adding it to a pile as another animal of an existing type, or (3) flipping the card to reveal its property, then placing it under an existing animal stack to grant its power (or drawback) to the animals in that stack.<br/><br/>In the climate phase that follows, the first player lays out colored cubes to represent how much food is available in this round (red chips), how many refugees are present (green chips), and how many parasites appeared (black chips). Players then distribute chips, placing red and green chips on their own creatures to support them and placing black chips on opponents' creatures or on predators that want to feed on their animals. During the extinction phase that follows, unfed animals die as do animals attacked by parasites or predators.<br/><br/>Players then get a new deck of cards and the game continues with a new round. When the deck runs out and the final round ends, players scores two points for each of their living animals, one point for each property, and any bonuses from card combinations. Whoever has bred the most successful species in a constantly changing and dangerous world wins!<br/><br/>",

It's up to you to determine under which sheet the real spirit is hiding as well as which color candle it's holding. To do this, players must make use of the mirrors in the castle surrounding the figures as everyone knows that true spirits don't cast a reflection...<br/><br/>To set up for the game, each player receives a search tile showing a symbol, and 16 candle chips (each showing one of four colors and one of four symbols) are mixed and placed facedown on the spaces on the circular track. The mechanical doohickey in the game board &ndash; which lowers mirrors out of sight when one of the ghosts is used to crank a gear in the board &ndash; is set up. You secretly place one of the four colored candles in each ghost, then set them on the game board.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the die. If you roll a number, you move a ghost of your choice the number of spaces indicated to try to land on a candle chip. If you do land on one, you reveal it, keeping the chip if it shows your symbol and leaving it faceup on the board otherwise. If you roll a ghost, you can conduct a mirror test, take a joker move, or do both. For the mirror test, you take one of the ghosts, place it in the center of the game board, then crank the gear (as each ghost has a coglike thing beneath it). If the mirrors disappear, you've found the real ghost! If not, you'll see the ghost reflected in a mirror and the angle of the mirror allows you to see the candle color; announce this color to all players. For a joker move, you move a ghost to any space of your choice to try to collect the chip on it.<br/><br/>Once you have all four of your chips, you immediately test a ghost of your choice to see whether the mirrors fall. If they do, you need to then name the color of candle it holds. If you fail either test, you're out of the game and play continues until the next player tests a ghost. If you succeed, you've revealed the real ghost and win!<br/><br/>",

In each round every player tries to collect a precise set of cards, called a phase, by drawing cards from the deck and discarding unneeded ones. When a player collects the phase, he lies it down on the table. After that he tries to discard all of his remaining cards by adding them to any of the phases that are already on the table. When the first player discards all of his cards, the round ends. The players who have lied down their phases get to the next phase. And those, who didn't manage to complete the Phase remain in it and in the next round try to collect and lie down the same phase. The game ends with the round in which some player completes the 10th phase.<br/><br/>The phases consists of sets (two or more cards with the same number showing on their face), runs (three or more cards numbered in order), cards of the same color and runs of cards of the same color. The phases are:<br/> 1. 4 pairs (sets of two cards)<br/> 2. 6 cards of the same color<br/> 3. 1 set of four cards and 1 run of four cards<br/> 4. 1 run of eight cards<br/> 5. 7 cards of the same color<br/> 6. 1 run of nine cards<br/> 7. 2 sets of four cards<br/> 8. 1 run of for cards of the same color and 1 set of three cards<br/> 9. 1 set of five cards and 1 set of three cards<br/>10. 1 set of four cards and 1 run of three cards of the same color<br/><br/>Main differences from Phase 10:<br/>Different more challenging phases.<br/>Different sort of wild cards.<br/>More action cards.<br/>Different calculation of points.<br/><br/>Description on the box: The long awaited game is finally here! Phase 10 with new, more demanding phases. Moreover, with over twenty action cards, which make the game even more diverse and exciting. Who will be the fastest to collect the various combinations of the same cards, or the sequence of cards? Who will be the first to master the 10 Phases? Who will be the Phase 10 Master?<br/><br/>",

The heroes do not know which villain is being played, and their object is to discover this.  Each villain needs a different set of 10 items, so by arresting the minions carrying the items the heroes can eventually determine who is the mastermind behind the crime wave.  A handy &quot;Bat-computer&quot; is provided which shows you who the possible villains are when the item cards are inserted.<br/><br/>The gameplay involves rolling a die and moving your character (or multiple minions for the villain player) around the streets of Gotham, entering buildings to steal things or arresting people, depending on which side you're on.  A small deck of action cards spices things up a bit and allows for a bit more planning.<br/><br/>",

Who knew that someday a couple of game designers would move the farts from inside the box to the front cover?<br/><br/>Yes, PRRRT... &ndash; from the designing duo of Ludovic Maublanc and Bruno Cathala &ndash; is all about the rip-roarers and pants-busters that emerge from one's nether regions, more specifically about determining who dealt it (while thankfully avoiding the &quot;who smelt it&quot; end of the equation).<br/><br/>Each round a situation card is revealed, such as a small crowd in an elevator, and a number of people cards equal to the crowd depicted on the card are turned face up. People cards are valued from 1 to 10 based on the amount of shame that person would have towards you should you be revealed as the culprit. Grannies are merciless...<br/><br/>Each player receives a hand of five odor cards, ranging in value from 0 to 7, with one 7, two 6s and so on to eight 0s. Going once around the table, each player in turn asks his neighbor, &quot;So how about it? Are you the one contributing to climate change? Are you the one making more methane?&quot; And so on. That neighbor can either fess up &ndash; in which case he scores all the people cards in play &ndash; or he can deny the charge, in which case the active player randomly draws a card from his hand and lays it on the table in front of the neighbor, revealing some of the smell that others have detected.<br/><br/>If you make it once around the table without anyone confessing, add another person card to the crowd of sniffers, then go around the table again. Repeat this process up to three times, at which point most people will have three cards in front of them. Everyone then simultaneously points to the person who they think created the ruckus (that is, who has the largest total of odor cards), abstaining if they are that person. Everyone then sums their stink, with the &quot;winner&quot; claiming the person cards in play and a card for each person blaming him; anyone who accuses a player incorrectly is penalized. Smallest score after a number of rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Being dealt a hand of high numbers doesn't automatically presage your coronation as a gas god as high numbers typically have a special power that comes into play when someone reveals the card from your hand. The 7, for example, removes all other cards in your hand from play, while the 6 lets you exchange up to three cards from your hand with an opponent. With odor comes power!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MetaZoo: Cryptid Nation is a TCG rooted in creatures, spells, and artifacts. For this first set, the creatures, or Beasties as we call them, are USA based cryptids (i.e. Bigfoot, Mothman, Jersey Devil, etc...).<br/><br/>What sets MetaZoo: Cryptid Nation apart is its core mechanic of breaking the 4th wall, or &quot;meta&quot;. From a gameplay perspective, this means that the strength of your Beasties and Spells are impacted by the environment you play in. Playing on a rainy day? Your water Beasties and Spells get a power boost. Playing near an open fire while trying to keep warm as it snows outside? Your Flame spells are now twice as powerful, but watch out... the Snow outside not only boosts the strength of your opponent's Snow Beasties, but also makes some of them invisible (unable to be directly attacked).<br/><br/>This added level of meta means choosing your battleground to best suit your deck build, or rapidly building decks to suit your environment, is a key feature of the game. Imagine playing a friend, but deftly convincing them to play next to a patch of trees to gain additional power boosts for your Forest Beasties!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The easiest way to describe the first edition is to contrast it with the more widely known second and third (p)e(r)ditions, as only thirty (30) copies of the first edition were printed.<br/><br/>One of the most significant differences is that the cards each have only one use in first edition, and so are divided into types:  Circle cards, Rail cards, Passenger cards, and Damnations (one-use special powers).  All cards are shuffled together at the start of the game, so the Circles are not laid out to begin as they are in later editions.  The board is formed throughout the game by placing Rail and Circle cards.<br/><br/>Another big difference is the fact that Circle cards have no special powers in first edition.  Special game effects are only available to players fortunate enough to draw the Damnation cards.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     80 cards, Bridge-size (rectangular), full-color fronts, black &amp; white backs, many miscut<br/>     4 engine tokens, cold-cast resin (poorly cast, as no vacuum table was used), unpainted (so all are white, distinguishable only by shape... spider, serpent, demon, and skull)<br/><br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    HellRail: Second Perdition<br/>    HellRail: Third Perdition<br/><br/><br/>",

Depending on what side you're on, you'll be playing a very different game - The Cryptozoologist is laying traps and attempting to trick the Bigfoot who must deduce and work out what's the best option...<br/><br/>One player plays the Cryptozoologist who is hunting for Bigfoot, played by the other player. Each round, the Cryptozoologist will lay out a series of cards in two &lsquo;paths&rsquo;, which will contain sensing equipment and special actions. Then, Bigfoot must choose which path to go on, triggering any sensing equipment and giving the Cryptozoologist a few more clues about his Lair. The Cryptozoologist wins by pinning Bigfoot in one of his Lairs, while Bigfoot wins by eluding the Cryptozoologist for six rounds. Capturing this beast won't be easy...!<br/><br/>By slowly eliminating the various potential lairs, the Cryptozoologist will slowly whittle down the places where Bigfoot could actually be hiding. However, if this isn't done by the end of the sixth round the beast will escape the clutches of 'science'!<br/><br/>",

The gallant but weary soldiers of the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) now prepared a daring invasion of Syria that could put them in artillery range of the enemy capital in a matter of days. Somehow, the IDF reformed the battered 7th Armored Brigade and the 21st Tank Division and sent them forward with the 20th Brigade's old Super Sherman tanks in support. Brilliant flanking maneuvers, a spirit of improvisation, and further reinforcements created a miniature blitzkrieg. Syrian troops and leaders alike panicked. The call went out for help from brother Arab nations. Only the timely arrival of the Iraqi 3rd Tank Division halted the advance of near Damascus. At that point, the United States put its forces on global nuclear alert to head off a Soviet para drop into Syria, and both superpowers proceeded to clamp down on their clients, ending the operation and with it the &quot;Yom Kippur War.&quot;&quot;<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1-2 days (variable)<br/>Hex: 1.5 miles / 2.4 km<br/>Unit: Company to Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet<br/>One countersheet (240 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12 page rules booklet<br/><br/>5 replacement counters were issued in S&amp;T 171.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gambling your fortunes in the Old West for 3 to 6 players.<br/><br/>In Austin Poker, you will be playing four hands of five-card stud poker simultaneously out of your own deck of cards. Your initial draw is 11 cards. Out of these cards, you will choose your four hole cards and place them face down on your player mat. You will then choose your first show card for each hand and place them face down on the hole cards, leaving you with a hand of three. Each hand's show card is revealed and bid on separately. After all hands have been bid upon, players draw one card for each hand they have not folded. The next show cards are placed with their respective hands, face down. This play continues until all hands have been played to five cards. The winners receive the pots. Then, all players have the opportunity to purchase Bonus cards in the order they finished the poker phase. The bonus cards count toward the victory points required to win the game, as well as having abilities that help you on subsequent turns. At the tend of each turn, the money spent buying Bonus cards is divided equally among all of the players and the next turn begins.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s an inter-dimensional mystery!<br/><br/>It plays exactly like Clue with a few additional rules and slight changes. First off, you use two dice to get around the board because of the way the board is shaped. Second, none of the character models are possible murderers in the game, instead they have been replaced by six random characters from the series on cardboard tokens. Third, there&rsquo;s an added Contraption Card pile that you can get by landing on a &ldquo;?&rdquo; spot. Lastly, all of the characters have a Personality Card that gives them an added ability in the game like the ability to travel to a different part of the board without rolling dice, or getting the chance to see the same card someone just revealed to someone else.<br/><br/>Contraption cards will do things such as adding an extra six to your dice, taking an extra turn, or asking a bonus question.<br/><br/>",

They dream of conquering the world but suffer from internal conflicts that prevent their great project from taking shape: the reds are convinced that it is up to them to lead the troops. Same for the blues. And the greens. Not to mention the yellows. It was therefore inevitable that they come to blows. Wormlord tells their story.<br/><br/>Wormlord is a game that is played simultaneously, without a turn, and consists of conquering spaces by placing knots.

        "description": "&quot;Cemetery Hill is a wargame simulation, on an operational level, of the battle between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia at the town of Gettysburg, PA. The game covers the period from 1 July to 4 July, 1863, when these two armies fought the bloodiest battle in American history to that point. The game system is an adaption fo the popular Napoleon at Waterloo system. Various special and optional rules allow the Players to recreate a picture of an historical event.&quot; (from the rules folder.}<br/><br/>Cemetery Hill is one of four games included in the Blue &amp; Gray Quadrigame set. The game includes a 17&quot; x 22&quot; three-color map, 100 counters and an Exclusive rules folder. A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.<br/><br/>Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn. Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control. Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.<br/><br/>A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games. Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day. This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs. This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.<br/><br/>",

As a demigod, a player initially has access to 24 heroes from which he can choose his army. With his choice he then faces his opponent(s) on sacred battleground.<br/><br/>There are different game modes regarding picking heroes (chieftain, random, mirror, free pick mode), and regarding conditions on which victory is achieved (skirmish, tactics). It is the game that relies heavy on tactics, that is fairly simple to learn but hard to master and that has a great replayability.<br/><br/>In time of Chaos, the God of War was supreme ruler over all other gods. But Time of Peace came, and lasted so long that God of War started to lose his power. He grew weaker as the years went by and was pushed to the side by other gods. When his power faded so much that he felt that the end was near he gave the task to his four sons, the demigods, to try to prove themselves as best commanders in the field of battle. The one who can emerge victorious should become the new God of War and bring back the former glory to their name.<br/><br/>Gather your heroes, challenge your friends, become the God of War!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chainmail is a medieval miniatures wargame created by Gary Gygax and fellow Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association (LGTSA) member Jeff Perren, a hobby-shop owner with whom Gygax had become friendly. The game was first published in 1971 by Guidon Games. That first edition also included a fantasy supplement, and is one of the oldest sets of rules for fantasy miniature wargaming.<br/><br/>In 1975, Tactical Studies Rules (TSR) acquired the rights to publish Chainmail and the game may have been the basis for the earliest Dungeons & Dragons game and campaigns (Dave Arneson, co-author of the original D&amp;D game, apparently disputes this). In the original boxed set of D&amp;D one is directed to Chainmail for the combat system but it offered an &quot;optional&quot; combat system involving 20 sided dice -- a system that eventually became the D&amp;D standard.<br/><br/>Regardless of who you believe, the Chainmail fantasy supplement contained spells and monsters that reappeared in Dungeons & Dragons and most certainly influenced Gary Gygax and his thinking about Fantasy games in that era.<br/><br/>",

Six cards are lying in the middle of the table, each representing a continent, as well as six cards depicting typical spy tools. Before the start of the game, a spy-chip is placed beside each card.<br/><br/>Each player holds three cards in his hand and places one openly in front of him during each round. The cards always show two symbols: a continent and a tool. Players can &ldquo;report&rdquo; two or more cards with the same symbol when it is their turn. For this purpose, he or she can use hand cards, those in front of him or both. One may then lay down the difference of one&rsquo;s cards and the already displayed chips as spy chips. If a player lays down three South America cards for instance, and there is only one spy attached to that continent card, he may lay down the difference (2 spies) out of his supply.<br/><br/>As the game continues, it becomes increasingly difficult to lay down spies. For example, if there are already 4 spies at the &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo;, a player needs to report at least 5 cards with &ldquo;fountain pens&rdquo; in order to get rid of a spy. One also has to catch the right moment for reporting, because reporting too early means one might only get rid of very few spies. If one waits too long, others might be quicker. The player who gets rid of his spies first wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Play either card type on any player, including yourself. Playing one of these cards completes the player&rsquo;s turn unless they want to play an Instant card.<br/>     Instant Cards can be played at any time according to the function on the card. Play them quickly before another card is played or a player moves.<br/><br/><br/>If a player lands exactly on a space with an arrow, move to the space indicated. Landing on the same space as another player bumps the player who was there first ahead one space. Use Trigger and Defuse cards strategically to find safer routes for yourself and move opponents faster!<br/><br/>Red and Orange split paths may have certain advantages and disadvantages, choose wisely!<br/><br/>Landing on a Panic Room or Retreat space for the first time sends a player to a safe haven. For the next round, that player may not play nor can they be played on. After their next turn they are sent out according to the arrow, where they will be vulnerable to play. If all opponents are in safe havens a remaining player MUST play a card on themself.<br/><br/>The first player to be sent to the Anxiety Spiral loses. But they are not out of the game because misery LOVES company! The losing player may now move one space in either direction EVERY TIME a card is played. If the losing player lands on the same space as a remaining player, the remaining player is sent directly to the Anxiety Spiral and then begins to go after other players in the same fashion until there is only one active player.<br/><br/>The last person to be sent to the Anxiety Spiral is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Reveal the Juror cards one by one.<br/>When the Jury is ready to vote, the final vote takes place.

Turns (the ship turn of 1/6 of hexagon).<br/>2. Every ship advances one hex (except if he chooses to brake).<br/>3. All previously fired missiles advance 3 hexes.<br/>4. Mine Layout. <br/>5. New missiles are fired and advance 3 hexes.<br/><br/>All used action counters are then discarded and cannot be used again in the game.<br/>The &quot;shield&quot; points are won by the players via a missile hit or the explosion of player's mines. Some can be lost also in the case of collisions.<br/>If a player's ship goes off the board because he has no turn or brake left, he's eliminated but still can get points if the mines he had laid out explode.<br/><br/>The winner is the one who has the most points when only one ship is left on the board.<br/><br/><br/>",

On your turn you roll a die to determine how many actions you must take. Actions consist of Drawing a card from the deck or playing a card from your hand and following the actions.<br/><br/>Playing cards may result in forcing other players to draw cards, peeking at other player's cards, swapping hands with a player, attacking an individual player or forcing every player to take extra actions.<br/><br/>When drawing you may draw a card that will instantly kill one of your Beans.<br/><br/>If a player is attacked or if you draw a Kill card, you may defend against that attack or death by playing an accident card with a corresponding icon. If you're able to play the matching card type, you have cheated death and live another round. If you can't play the required card, one of your Beans is killed.<br/><br/>Once all three of your Beans are killed, you are out of the game.

The daily Running of the Bulls, so dear to Hemingway, is its highest profile event. With is simple yet refined mechanics, Pamplona - Viva San Ferm&iacute;n! Faithfully reproduces the run in all its aspects: bravery, euphoria, adrenaline, but also tactics and management. Players must run all of the 4 sectors of the race, escaping from the opponents&rsquo; bulls and steers, while trying to gore or trample the opponents using their own. Pamplona - Viva San Ferm&iacute;n! is not a common race. The winner is not necessarily the first runner to cross the finishing line, but the one show shows the most courage.<br/><br/>",

Sorcerers specialize in types of magic represented by 7 different colors. Sorcerer adds a twist to the old &quot;combat differential&quot; system (attack strength minus defense strength) by adding a circular system of combat bonuses based upon what colors of magic are attacking each other; Blue/Green/Yellow/Grey/Orange/Red/Purple with each color having a strong advantage over it's neighbor to the right (with Purple circling around to have power over Blue) and a disadvantage against it's neighbor to the left, with lessening combat bonuses the further away the color is from itself. Combat bonuses are also given based on map position as the hexes alternate colors of magic instead of representing physical terrain. Attacking from one's own color is good.<br/><br/>Several different scenarios are included in the rulebook that range from 1 to 6 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take charge of your clan from the Scottish high country. In each round, a player first builds up his clan and landholdings, and then optionally conducts a raid on an opponent.<br/><br/>You start by pulling six cubes from a bag. With green cubes you increase your ministers and potential to gain VPs at the end of a round. Yellow cubes attract warriors and permit you to hold more battle cards. The blue cubes are &quot;pipers&quot; used for combat support or possible VP generation. A blue cube can also be played as a &quot;bard&quot; to lure away opponents' followers. Finally, there are the red cubes, which represent cattle and generate VPs. You also use cubes to create new estates, where you can deposit cattle and groups of cubes (which are safer than those not on an estate).<br/><br/>Raids are resolved simply. In three battle-rounds a card of value one to four is played by the two opponents; this value can be increased by a single blue cube. The one who wins the most battle-rounds wins the fight. The loser will then lose cubes while the victor gains a VP or two.<br/><br/>After each round there is a valuation, in which the VPs are determined based on number of cubes. For example, the player with the most green cubes gets 3 VPs, while second most gets 2 VPs; if two players are tied for most, each gets only 1 VP. Another example: each red cattle tile is worth a VP, but if one player has the most he gets a 2 VP bonus.<br/><br/>The estate tiles contain a number on the back. After each round a panel is turned. If the leading player has at least as many points as the number of the tile, the game ends.<br/><br/>Bottom line: a fast game offering something for everyone: luck, tactics, and lots of interaction with your fellow players.<br/><br/>",

Curing patients is great as long as you can claim the glory for yourself! Every patient you see takes precious time and resources as you struggle to keep them alive. Sometimes you have to leave the sickest patients for the next shift and pass the blame to someone else. If patients die on your watch, you risk being forever shamed as a bad doctor!<br/><br/>In more detail, Bad Doctor is a light tile-laying game in which doctors compete for the glory of being the best doctor by treating and curing patients. Treat patients by laying treatment tiles with matching malady symbols. Place your doctor marker on that malady to show you helped cure that patient. You place complication cubes on patients who are not visited during your shift (or turn), but if that patient has no spaces left for complication cubes then that means the patient has died on your shift!<br/><br/>Patients are completely cured when there are no open malady spaces on the patient or any connected treatment tiles.  The player who cured the final malady on the patient during their shift collects their doctor markers and places them in the score pile on their doctor board. All other doctor markers on the patient go back into the other doctors' reserves.<br/><br/>The game ends when one doctor has collected eight or more doctor markers in their score pile.

In the card game Стой На Своем (&quot;Stick to Colours&quot;), you collect sets of cards with figures by making bets with the cards you... don&rsquo;t need! It&rsquo;s the first auction where you can turn down offered bids in order to get what you need! A simple and compact game for adults and kids alike!<br/><br/>Each round first player picks a card from the market. This is the card he probably wants to get, and this is the card the players will start bidding for. After the card has been chosen, the players start bidding on it or they can pass and not take part in the auction. To place a bet a player puts a special token on a card he refuses, which means, that during the game he can never get this card. The one, whose bid is the highest, gets the card and leaves his refusal tokens on the cards he has refused during the round. All the other players take their tokens back. Then the game proceeds till the deck of cards and the market are empty. In the end of the game players score victory points for different sets (by colour or by value) on their hands.<br/><br/>",

However, only few people will have the opportunity to&hellip; change the course of history!<br/><br/>On the occasion of the 600th Anniversary of the Battle of Grunwald, the National Centre for Culture, in order to promote the celebrations, has published a two-players' history illustrated card game  &quot;Grunwald &ndash; the Greatest Battle of 600 years&rdquo;. One of the player is the leader of the Polish-Lithuanian army and the other leads the Teutonic Order. Each of them has a separate deck of 55-cards. The fight is a dynamic 20-30 minutes game.<br/><br/>The players use the figures of military leaders, historical divisions and unconventional tactics enabling to tilt the scales of victory in one of the players' favour. The rules are simple and easy to learn even for the beginners, and the possibility of applying diverse tactics and strategies makes the game quick and dynamic, each time with a different scenario.<br/><br/>The game consists of a series of successive clashes between subsequent military leaders and their divisions. The game is won by the player who is the first to gain six banners of the enemy.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to familirise young people with history, that is why it includes educational elements such as real historical figures, battle formations and real medieval weapons. It features a description of the battle. The card illustrations were verified for their historical fidelity by a military historian, Tomasz Mleczek. The game was created by Michał Stachyra and Maciej Zasowski from the publishing house Kuźnia Gier, and Piotr Foksowicz and Krzysztof Rogulski are the authors of the illustrations in the form of comic-book-like drawings.<br/><br/>In the box there are 110 cards (2 decks) together with an instruction including educational elements.<br/><br/>The game is not for sale and was distributed free of charge, among others, during &quot;The Grunwald Days&quot; on 15-17 July 2010 on the Fields of Grunwald.<br/><br/>Source - nck.pl<br/><br/>",

Six other cards are placed face down on the table. On a turn, a player chooses one card from her hand, places it face down next to the others, then chooses any other card, reveals it, and adds it to her worm. The first card is placed directly next to the worm head; each additional section is placed on the marking stick of the previously card.<br/><br/>Once the deck of cards runs out, each player makes three further plays, then they compare worms to see which one bests the rest!<br/><br/>",

Advisors use up the easy, sensible solutions and force Kim Jong-un into ridiculous extremes of problem solving, and while making themselves as troublesome as possible they must be acting as helpful and servile as possible, pleasing the Leader while frustrating him.<br/><br/>Each round begins with the draw of a Policy Card that one player reads aloud. The Policy Card describes a threat to North Korea which upon which Kim Jong-un must render a decision. After each advisor has suggested their own unique solution to the issue at hand, Kim must come up with his own completely novel answer to prove he's smarter than everyone in the room and always knows best. And this, of course, is the correct answer.<br/><br/>The advisors clap with delight over this display of wisdom, whether they like it or not, and then take turns extrapolating Kim&rsquo;s solution to make it grander and grander. Kim then insults each offering for suggesting that it improves on his wisest of decisions.<br/><br/>Throughout the round Kim continually issues demerits to punish advisors for infractions real and imagined. Demerits have no hard mechanical function in the game but enable Kim Jong-un to harass the other players and create more fun.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, Kim Jong-un awards the Policy Card to whomever pleased him the most for whatever reason. That player becomes the new Kim Jong-un and a new round begins. At the end of the game players read grim factoids off the backs of the Policy Cards they've won, letting them know about the horrors in the real Hermit Kingdom.  This is a simple, fun game which tries to use the play of the game to lay bare the real world human rights abuses in North Korea.<br/><br/>",

Plushies, buckets of water, other fangirls, you name it!  You choose cards through a simple continuous draft mechanic to build an arsenal of items. Items are used both to throw at the catgirl (to score points!) and to use as bait to lure her over.  Players go through the entire deck of cards once, and whoever has the most points at the end is the Champion of Everything.  And you want that.<br/><br/>All cards feature humorous flavor text, and anime-style art.  Each copy of Whack a Catgirl also comes with a 2-card mini expansion for Gold Thief (2 copies of the new Pirate card).<br/><br/>",

To make things tricky, however, each player has his own task that's hidden from others, so sometimes it's useful to bluff in order to give false information to other players as to which aircraft are yours.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, all ten aircraft wait next to the ariports in order to depart. Each player receives a task card, which shows four (out of ten) aircraft that you have to guide to the opposing airport. Players keep their task card hidden from opponents. On a turn, a player draws an action card, moves two aircraft (not necessarily those on his task card), and plays up to two action cards; these cards give extra movement to some aircraft or block other aircraft. When all four aircraft on a player's task card are landed, he can reveal his task card on his turn and win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player has the same combination of cubes, but the letters are randomized by rolling prior to each turn.

Otherwise, players simply finish their grids before the minute is over and then everyone totals their score.<br/><br/>Bonus points are given for capitalized words, longer words (6+ letters), and intersecting letters in the grid.

Games include Craps, Blackjack, and Roulette. The game was endorsed by Jerry Lewis (box features his photo and signature).<br/><br/>Another version of the game, not endorsed by Jerry Lewis, comes in more conventionally sized box.<br/><br/>Although the game uses Las Vegas as a setting, the game uses the French Roulette wheel instead of the American wheel. The American wheel has an added space: the double zero. Someone noticed this when designing the box and placed a die strategically to cover up the zero in a photograph of the game!<br/><br/>",

It uses a n&times;n set of stacking spheres in 2 colors (4&times;4 or 5&times;5 are recommended, but larger sets can be used).<br/><br/>A 4&times;4 set, for example, is a pyramid of 30 marbles:<br/><br/><br/>     4&times;4=16 on the first layer<br/>     3&times;3=9 on the second layer<br/>     2&times;2=4 on the third layer<br/>     1&times;1=1 on the fourth layer<br/><br/><br/>The board (n&times;n) starts empty.<br/><br/>Starting with white, each player places a marble on an empty space or platform (2&times;2 arrangement of marbles).<br/><br/>The first player making a full line of his color on any layer wins. Lines may be diagonal.<br/><br/>This is, for a 4&times;4 set, a 4-in-a-row on the first layer, or a 3-in-a-row on the 2nd layer, or a 2-in-a-row on the 3rd layer.<br/><br/>SPLine was born when researching on stacking spheres.

Take on the role of the Heroes or the Villains and prepare to throw down!<br/><br/>Each character card can be played in three different ways (deployed to your Party's Front Row, deployed to your Support Row, or used for a one-time game effect). Hero Brigade also offers unique twists on conventional deck-building mechanisms. Drawing extra cards and eliminating your starting cards can hurt you in the long term as you permanently lose cards from your deck each time you reshuffle and each time one of your characters is defeated. Running out of cards loses you the game!<br/><br/>",

You do not have to purchase boxes of cards to play.  You buy a character pack and a story pack then find someone else who has done the same and play.<br/><br/>In the character pack you will get a character who stands up and all the cards you need to make him unique.  Each character has stats for might, resolve, savvy and combat.  You can add 5 points to spend upgrading your character.  You upgrade with 5 types of cards called merits with varying costs.  Abilities generally boost one of your 4 attributes.  Advantages are special skills available to the character. Allies are friends that travel with you and add their skills to help you.  Arts are magic abilities that help you in various ways.  Treasures are items that you can carry to help you or you can find them in your journeys.  If you want to add more then 5 points to your character you can add flaws which are worth negative points.  If you add 2 points of flaws then you would have seven points of merits you could add.  These come in three flavors.  Curses represent special liabilities of your character.  Enemies represent individuals or races with great hatred for you which if met fight with an advantage.  Weakness usually affect your stats.  Once you have created your character you can go on an adventure.<br/><br/>In your story pack you will find leagues which are put together to create a map. Each league has a terrain type or types, cost to enter or leave, special affects and what attribute you may recover if resting there.  In your story pack you will also find quest cards.  The quest card tells you what you are trying to achieve.  Each quest has four attributes.  These are Experience points received when the quest is achieved, Total points of waylays allowed against the quest, total points in treasures that can be seeded and the victory conditions required to complete the quest.  You will also find waylay cards in your story pack.  These will have indicators on them to tell you in what terrain you are allowed to play them in.  There is a point rating that is applied against the quests waylay rating.  Each waylay also has a test that must be passed.  Failing a waylay can have dire consequences or it may just delay you by one turn.<br/><br/>It is a very simple game that never plays the same way twice as long as you have a few boosters around to mix things up.<br/><br/>",

When the moon reaches the inner ring it is sucked into the void and exchanged for a solar system.  The solar systems are the most powerful stellar which every player is aiming to get.  The planets are defending pieces which can only move in arcs around the board.  <br/>A great strategy game for 2 or 4 players or 2 teams of two.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You&rsquo;re a busy group of pandas planning your escape from the zoo but you&rsquo;ll need supplies. You have been rummaging and pilfering unwanted food from all the other animals but now the Zoo Keeper is on to you. You must quickly trade all the goods you have collected so you can get the supplies you need and make your escape before you get caught. But be careful, certain actions will raise the Zoo Keeper&rsquo;s suspicion more than others.<br/><br/>Pilfering Pandas is a reinvention of a classic card game but we've made a huge number of changes, not least creating a cooperative and solo mode. Pilfering Pandas is the third game from Wren Games who aim to bring back gaming to busy people. Pilfering Pandas therefore have a short playtime but we maintain depth of decisions and intuitive gameplay to give a game with some bite.<br/><br/>Pilfering Pandas has similarities to Rummy as you are making number sets and runs but it also has this really interesting discard pile mechanism and this was the thing that we most wanted to bring to modern-day gaming.<br/><br/>The Hideout is where you 'discard' a card but unlike traditional discard piles, the Hideout is not a pile, it's a spread of cards visible to all players and, for a fee, you can pick up as many cards as you want from it and make huge plays of sets in a single turn (there's only a hand limit in solo games).<br/><br/>Players must collect sets and trade them with the Meerkats to earn points to increase their chance of escaping from the zoo. However, they must always stay at least one step ahead of the zoo keeper so they don't get caught by playing and picking up cards wisely and efficiently.<br/><br/>But didn't want Pilfering Pandas to be just another set collection game so we also introduced a whole new level to set collecting whereby the previous sets you play directly effects what sets you can play in the future, making it much more strategic than traditional set collecting games.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

If correct, you receive a green token; if not, a red token, which cancels out one green token in your possession. After all cards in a category have been resolved, whoever has the most green tokens (which might be more than one player) receives a gold token, and whoever first collects three gold tokens wins!<br/><br/>As you finish the cards in a category, you slide the cards into the card shoe so that the cards will be reversed, after playing through the first 18 (blue) categories, you'll start drawing cards from the red categories.<br/><br/>",

After three rounds, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The rules include a solo variant in which you're challenged to score as many points as possible.<br/><br/>BITS Mitbringspiel differs from BITS as it includes fewer tiles, lasts only three rounds instead of four, and the tiles are cardboard instead of plastic.<br/><br/>",

There are a variety of ethnic dishes represented (English, Chinese, Italian, French or Indian), a few of which are also vegetarian. Players get bonuses for specializing in a certain ethnic cuisine and must be mindful to prepare at least one<br/>vegetarian dish lest they be penalized by the growing veggie-lover contingent.<br/><br/>A number of recipes are played face-up to the table (onto a well designed board), with each recipe listing the ingredients it requires.<br/> Players begin the game with only one ingredient and must acquire new ingredients either through auction (the most common method) or random draw (costly and a crap-shoot). When a player acquires new ingredients, whether it is on his turn or not, he immediately has the opportunity to<br/>prepare one of the dishes depicted on the face-up recipe cards. If he can supply all of the necessary ingredients, he takes the corresponding recipe card and acquires money (beans ... actual beans!) to increase his coffers. Players may also cook recipes which were previously cooked by other players, but they only receive a portion of the monetary amount the original cook received.<br/><br/>",

The game is a typical family game in which everyone participates with equal enthusiasm. Two persons play at a time. Also, you can play alone, trying to solve the code with as few moves as possible.<br/><br/>Underneath the gameboard at the top you will find four sheets of different colours. These sheets are called code boards. The game is supplied with the green side A at the top. Place the pegs corresponding to this patten. Before playing you must turn the green board so that the reverse side B faces up. A pattern now appears with the colours arranged in vertical rows. Try - with the fewest possible moves - to place the pegs so that they coincide with this pattern.<br/><br/>Unrelated to Othello.<br/><br/>",

It is a game about collecting presents and it is built upon easygoing mechanisms.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to collect as many gift as possible, but watch out, because not all the gifts the players could collect are worth of keeping them, since everyone has a Gift List and they need to stick to it. Since then, the first action for every player will be to withdraw a card from the deck. This card should have five different gifts represented and, as you already deduced, it is our Gift List.<br/><br/>To acquire different presents from the table, every player should roll the die. When the present is collected, the players could perform different actions with their gifts (open &amp; keep them, exchange them with other players or even steal gifts from another player's reserve). Some gifts will also let you perform extra actions during your turn.<br/><br/>Every player should make an effort to collect the gifts represented in their Gift List, since only the gifts that appeared in this card will push them closer to the victory. They will try to hide which ones are part of their list and, at the same time, they need to ditch all the gifts that there are worthless, according to their list.<br/><br/>Once there are no more presents on the table, every player will count how many of their gifts match the ones represented in their Gift List.  The player who came closest to fulfill their Gift List will be appointed the winner.<br/><br/>",

Enough said.<br/><br/>Hitman Holiday is game of deduction and strategy where as many as up to ten players take on the roles of ten of the deadliest assassins mankind has ever known. Gathered at the world's most beautiful resort, otherwise known as Paradise, they are out to play a game of death in a bid to eliminate competition in business as well as claim the much coveted title of Number One.<br/><br/>A truly unique game, one may say it is what happens when Cluedo meets Battlestar Galactica meets Werewolf. The game begins with each player having a secret target to assassinate. The fun part is that the targets do not know yet which player is targeting them. This means that while you are trying to find a way to secretly kill off your assigned target, somewhere out there among the players is also someone trying to kill you, and it is up to you to find out who before it is too late! This is all done at the resort, which provides a ton of ways to kill someone, such as shoving them off a balcony, or dropping that accidental flower pot from three stories above. The game also takes on a different angle from the generic James Bond killer image, presenting its killers from all walks of life, even including old women and innocent looking young ladies. Instead of purely guns, they also use almost anything around the resort, turning innocent objects into lethal weapons.<br/><br/>There are hidden actions, and the need to deduce who is killing who based on clues that drop now and then. Observing how each player behaves on the board also gives away clues sometimes as to whether or not they are your assigned killer. This is and will always remain the very FIRST game from Medieval Lords, and one that has taught the studio a ton in terms of experience and execution.<br/><br/>WARNING: Due to the large number of players the game can go up to, you might have to expect a longer downtime than the average game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Inoka, you are your village's representative to the once-a-generation Achkai tournament to determine the next Nature's Emissary. Each player starts with a set of nine tactic cards (three of each tactic: Attack, Block, and Taunt). At the beginning of each round, you set your hand by selecting five of your nine tactics, setting aside the remaining cards until the next round.<br/><br/>In the two-player game, players engage in a series of clashes, using each card only once. (Tactic cards are discarded after use.) They secretly select their tactics, then simultaneously reveal them and resolve the clash: Attach beats Taunt, Taunt beats Block, Block beats Attack. The winner of a clash takes possession of the Leaf Totem, and whoever possesses the Leaf Totem at the end of the round scores a point. The first player to 3 points wins.<br/><br/>In a three- or four-player game, the first clash is a free-for-all clash for the Leaf Totem. After that, play proceeds around the table in a king-of-the-hill style. Each challenger clashes against the current totem holder. If you can defeat all challengers consecutively without losing the totem, you score a point. As in the two-player game, first to 3 points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only by casting the Ring of Power into the fires of Mount Doom can it be destroyed and the Dark Lord's evil be brought to an end. To thwart Sauron's evil, brave heroes from across Middle-earth have formed The Fellowship of the Ring &ndash; champions such as Frodo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn and Legolas. Each of these stands ready to seek out The One Ring and deliver it to its destruction. Choose which member of the Fellowship you will be, and race against your friends to uncover The One Ring and carry it to Mount Doom! Middle-earth needs heroes like never before! Will you be the one to defeat the Dark Lord?<br/><br/>In The Lord of the Rings: Quest to Mount Doom, 2-5 players race to locate The One Ring somewhere in the depths of Middle-earth and be the one to take it to Mount Doom &ndash; the one place it can be destroyed. Venture into all corners of Middle-earth in your hunt for The One Ring, avoiding the dreaded gaze of the Dark Lord Sauron and the tricks and schemes of your fellow players. Use the wide array of item and event cards to foil your opponents' plans or boost your own chances, and achieve the ultimate goal, claiming victory at the fires of Mount Doom!<br/><br/>Players roll a movement die on their turn and use the movement points generated to move along paths of varying difficulty to reach locations across Middle-Earth. Each location begins with one item card available but only one of the forty locations contains The One Ring. Once a player finds The One Ring they must try to keep it secret while moving towards Mount Doom.<br/><br/>Players can use the Items they gain during the search to help their own quest or to hinder the other players. If you finish a move in a location with another player you can take a card from them. Each turn players also draw an Event card which can trigger immediately or they may be able to keep it in hand for use when the time is right.<br/><br/>Every turn an Eye of Sauron card is also revealed, moving the Eye marker. If the marker ever lands on a player's location they must discard The One Ring or another Item if they are not the Ring Bearer. The player is also forced to return to Hobbiton or Rivendell. The player who gets The Ring to Mount Doom will be the winner.<br/><br/>Contains 9 highly detailed Fellowship plastic miniatures, instructions booklet, 1 gaming board, 1 dice, 40 item cards, 35 event cards, 42 Eye of Sauron Cards, 9 character cards and 1 Eye of Sauron Marker.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, soon after this union is sadden due to the death of the King. The belief is that the King was killed by Berengario II, Marquis of Ivrea, hungry to reign the Kingdom. Adelaide, indignant, opposes this new regency, as Berengario II tries to force her to marry his own son, Adalbert of Ivrea. She runs away to seek refuge in the Canossa Castle, strategic in its position, owned and governed by Azzo Adalbert. Here comes the siege of the castle, and this is what we are going to recall: on one side Berengario II and his son, Adalbert, are besieging, and on the other Adelaide of Burgundy and Azzo Adalbert are under siege; in defense of them comes Otho I, Emperor of Germany, with his knights. Each courageous player will guide 2 of the Emperor&rsquo;s knights, to try to free Adelaide, allowing Otho I to marry her in 952, and thus becoming the new King of Italy.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to achieve a higher score than your opponents. Points are achieved by either taking enemy tiles or creating a way out of the Canossa Castle (3 points).<br/>Enemy tiles, like all other tiles, are captured when you place one of your knight-pawn on one of them. Captured tiles must always be perfectly visible to all other players.<br/>The game ends when a player creates a way out of the Canossa Castle (that means to seize the Canossa Castle tile).<br/>In order to seize the Canossa Castle tile or any other enemy tile players must create a way out that enables that tile, on which there&rsquo;s the knight-pawn, to be moved off of the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this card game, players propose holiday destinations/types of holidays and then try to win the most points by sending the highest scoring group of people on those holidays. The basic mechanism is trick-taking with an element of bluffing.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of cards in the game. Each player has five holiday destination cards. They are also dealt 6 traveler cards, which may be men, women or children with a value of from 3 to 8 points.<br/><br/>There are five kinds of holidays that may be proposed:<br/>A romantic trip to Venice for a couple (one man, one woman)<br/>Night-life holidays in Mykonos with any number of men and women<br/>Trips to an amusement park for any number of children accompanied by one adult (man or woman)<br/>A restful family holiday at Berghotel (one man, one woman and one child exactly)<br/>Fantastic cruises (any number of men or women, but only men or only women)<br/><br/>The starting player proposes a holiday by placing the card in the center. Three traveler cards are dealt to the centre of the table, one of which is face up - this is the value of the holiday. The other players, in turn, may agree to this destination, or change it by paying one traveler card (and augmenting the value of the holiday). This goes round, players changing destinations as long as they want to and can afford to, until everyone finally agrees on the destination.<br/><br/>Players then play cards that match the criteria for that destination and the player who plays travelers with the highest score wins the holiday. This is scored as the value from the initial 3 cards plus any extra cards played to change the destination, divided by ten. Points that don't make up to ten exactly don't contribute to the score.<br/><br/>The player to first score 10 points wins.<br/><br/>The game has a nice element of bluffing as a player could propose holiday destinations they have no interest in so that after other players change the destination, they can change it to the real place they'd prefer to go.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns removing flowers from the supply and planting them in their garden. These flowers then attract the ten butterflies in the game. Some butterflies match the color of a flower, and these fly to the garden with the biggest connected flower bed of this color. Other butterflies match two flower colors, and these are attracted to the biggest combined flower bed of these two colors. All butterflies prefer fresh flowers, so creating a flower patch equal in size to an opponent's garden is enough to lure the butterfly from that other garden to yours.<br/><br/>Having butterflies in your garden brings you points at the end of each round. New butterflies score one point at the end of round one, two points in round two, etc. Butterflies which remain in your garden throughout a round score only half as many points.

Bury a treasure with a value known only to you, or play a pirate card to find out what the others are plotting...<br/>2. Lay you beach towels to cover the most valuable treasures while you wait for nightfall...<br/>3. Then recover the treasures you've captured! But watch out for surprises!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pennant Race is a baseball game that concentrates not on individual games and the pitcher/batter confrontation but on roster management and trading over an entire season.  Real-life players are rated according to their batting average, power, speed and defense over the previous season and those ratings are used to simulate the outcome of a game on a single dice roll.  Over the course of the season, the standings of each club in the league is tracked to see who wins the championship.  Provisions are included in the game for injuries and star performances to occur, and mechanics are included for rookie players to be created.  The game is designed for solitaire play as well as multiple players, and can be used to simulate the background games of a league in tandem with whatever detailed baseball simulation the user prefers.<br/><br/>",

However, judge not! In this game you have to take the right tricks at strategic times to get yourself into the best position each round. With a double-edged-sword resource collection element, Gone Viking elevates itself as a uniquely competitive game, and one that reminds players of what it was like to be a viking raider.<br/><br/>In more detail, each round players receive a hand of cards, with the leader then swapping up to four cards for free. After trump is declared, all players can pay to swap cards. As players win tricks, they can plunder resource tokens that are used to win the game. During the trick-taking phase, players can add multiple cards together to increase their total and play viking god cards to use those special powers. The last standing viking god in a round provides an additional benefit to its owner, and the richest player in a round will find half his wealth taken by Jarl &mdash; so aim for second place in order to keep your goods.<br/><br/>",

Once under the Snandergrab (Snits who survive 9 game turns but didn't make it there are placed under anyway), Snits reproduce (3 more counters are added per survivor), and they all race back to the sea, imperiled by the Bolotomus again. A second reproductive run follows, then the winner is judged by the greatest number of surviving Snits.<br/><br/>Published in The Dragon Magazine #10.

A fifth species, the Metamorphs (a grey-colored suit), has the ability to take on the characteristics of the other races and tip the scales. The game is played in two phases. In the first, players bid for the right to name trump (determine which race, or suit, has &quot;the power&quot; for that round) and to decide whether scoring will be positive or negative (whether players will receive points for tricks taken or for taking the least number of tricks). In the second round, cards are played out in a series of tricks and power points awarded based on which type of scoring has been selected.<br/><br/>",

Use of special abilities, general cards and battle cards will influence the outcome.<br/><br/>The game map covers the United States from the Indian Territory to the Atlantic and from Pennsylvania to the Gulf of Mexico. The armies you build, strengthened by corps and generals, range across these wide spaces by executing Area Movement. <br/>Navies, including ironclads and blockade runners, increase your strategic choices.<br/><br/>Victory will depend on the pace of battle and vital supplies. The North must deal with a battle track winding ever down-ward in her effort to conquer the Confederacy. A full campaign game and two shorter scenarios let you select the period of the War.<br/><br/>Grand Army of the Republic provides hours of fun and insight into America's bloodiest conflict, the War Between the States. <br/>Discover the War as it was or could have been.<br/><br/>",

Gameplay involves hand management, dice mitigation, and an elegant control point system that lets players gain the advantage over their foes.<br/><br/>Gameplay utilizes the highly acclaimed MDS (modular deck system) from Street Masters, Brook City, and Altar Quest, by Blacklist Games, LLC. This allows a player to pick a commando&rsquo;s unique deck, select a stage, then select an enemy to create a unique scenario that gives players a multitude of combinations and re-playability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Subsequent pieces get placed in the space indicated by the preceding piece.  The object of the game is to be the last player able to move.

If only you had known that that one tiny detail would make all the difference. If only you could do it again, everything would be different now. But if you WERE given the chance to rewrite history, would be brave enough to take it? Could you face the unknown and its unforeseen consequences? Could you fight fate to create the perfect moment?<br/><br/>In The Perfect Moment, players race to rewrite history in their favor using a deck of only 18 cards. Players use equipment, exploit paradoxes in the time-space continuum, and author their own revision of the past. Featuring a clever multi-sided card system, every card is used by both players based on what they can see. Equipping that card for yourself may just give your opponent the ability they were looking for. Every turn, players activate up to two revealed cards, which each have special effects. After the effects are resolved, the player can optionally score a card to earn up to 3 points depending on how closely they match it. The first player to 16 points wins. It takes careful planning and a bit of luck to avoid failing like you have so many times before. This time will be different.<br/><br/>This time...<br/><br/><br/>Includes the first 3 sets of the series, and the solo mode rule set:<br/><br/>     1994: A Relationship Gone Wrong<br/>     1981: A Bank Robbery Gone Wrong<br/>     2005: A Big Event Gone Wrong<br/>     The Perfect Moment: Echoes (1st version)<br/><br/><br/>",

While the sheep struggle on the  dyke for the best positions, Hallbert is hiding and intends to scare the slowest sheep so that it flops off the dyke.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sheep are no angels and are hustling for positions, with all of them wanting to shove their fellow racers onto slippry ground. Those who have a lifesaver are the lucky ones that can continue the race. Without a lifesaver, any sheep sliding down the dyke is doomed to watch the race from a distance. When only two sheep remain on the dyke, the race ends and an award ceremony takes place; according to East Frisian tradition, the most fearless sheep that has not aimlessly rushed forward wins the race - thus, the runner-up is really the winner!<br/><br/>Ostfriesisches Schafe-Schubsen, which will appear in an edition of 500 copies, is being sold on a non-profit basis, with neither the game designers nor the graphic designers earning money from the game.<br/><br/>",

Then they must evade the dangerous &quot;nanuq&quot; and return safely home with their catch!

Sometimes the targets are different for each of the players in the same scenario.<br/><br/>There are up to 6 different factions, Robin Hood, Sheriff of Nottingham, Guy of Gisbourne, Sheriff of Lincoln, Sir Richard of Leigh and The Church.<br/><br/>Each faction has men and leaders with different combat values. Each faction has also a secret agent.<br/><br/>Each event card can be used in two ways. Either you move a group (number of footprints on the cards) or you do the event which is shown on the card. You may play cards up to a value of 5 action points. Each turn when two or more players pass (voluntarily or not), everyone fills up their hand to 6 cards again.<br/><br/>Different cards:<br/>- Objects: Pick up or drop objects.<br/>- Group: Regrouping of men and leaders.<br/>- Direct target: Start automatic move of a group up to 10 spaces.<br/>- Discard target: Inhibit an automatic move.<br/>- Ambush: Attack a nearby opponent group.<br/>- Threat: Let a weaker group give up an object without battle.<br/>- Disguise: Protect a group from some of the other events.<br/>- Fast march: Move up to 4 squares.<br/>- Attack: Start a battle.<br/>- Lost: Out of turn card which can displace a group that has just moved one square.<br/>- Trust: Out of turn card to stop an attack.<br/><br/>Originally the game is from England.<br/><br/>",

The German player is on the offensive, attempting to win the game by rapidly seizing key cities. The Soviet player is primarily on the defensive, but the situation also requires he prosecute counterattacks throughout much of the game.<br/><br/>Game play encompasses the period that began with the Germans launching their attack on 22 June 1941, and ends on 7 December of the same year. By that time it had become clear the invaders had shot their bolt without achieving their objectives. The game may end sooner than the historic termination time if the German player is able to advance so quickly he causes the overall political, socio-economic and military collapse of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents approximately 20 miles (32 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver for both sides are primarily divisions, along with Axis-satellite and Soviet corps (and one army) of various types. The effects of the general air superiority enjoyed by the Germans throughout the campaign are built into the movement and combat rules. Each game turn represents one week.<br/><br/>Players familiar with other strategic-level east front designs will note the unique aspects of LWE lie in its rules governing the treatment of supply, the capture of Moscow, and the Stalin line.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     Rules booklet<br/>     Player Aid cards<br/>     700 Die cut counters<br/>     1 34&quot; x 22&quot; Map<br/>     1 Die<br/>     Storage bags<br/><br/><br/>",

As you arrive, you discover you are not alone. Some people are family you recognize, others you don't. The door opens and you all enter. The door locks behind you. A spectral form of Alphie greets you and informs you he is stuck in an interplanar portal. He needs your help to be saved. All you have to do is make your way through his mansion to his laboratory and pull him out. He promises to share his wealth and knowledge with whomever among you can reach him first.<br/><br/>The Mansion of Mana is a sequential set collection, unique power, engine building light-strategic game with a modular game board. In the Mansion of Mana, each player represents a distant relative of Uncle Alphie who are attempting to earn their fortune and knowledge by helping to save him. Players navigate the mansion- collecting runic elements, playing them sequentially to acquire keys, to enter new rooms in the mansion. With each room entered, a new ability is gained allowing each player to become quicker at acquiring the runes to enter more rooms or to slow others down who would beat you to the objective of saving Uncle Alphie.<br/><br/>The Mansion of Mana gives players a medium to light weight strategic game in a small box. Player's seek to get through the mansion as quickly as possible while engine-building their special abilities to gain more cards, hold more cards, add more options, steal from other players, or allow them to bend the rules in their favor. The Mansion of Mana is strongly strategic with the only elements of luck in the cards available to draw from (similar to Ticket to Ride). However, every player has a hand limit, so you cannot save up your cards, but you can play them on the table, partially completed, and add to them. However, watch out! Someone could steal from your partially completed set.<br/><br/>Will you efficiently navigate the Mansion? or will you prey off of those who would be so careless to leave their runes in the open? Or perhaps you will Unlock the secrets of the mansion to find your way to Uncle Alphie and achieve victory!<br/><br/>",

Despite the release dates, the board game was actually designed prior to the computer game.<br/><br/>The turn-based computer game's origin began with fighting mechanics that were meant to have a similar flavor to Avalon Hill's Titan, but the program lacked a story-line and theme. Meanwhile, development of the King's Bounty board game was wrapping up under the working title of &quot;Bounty Hunter.&quot; New World Computing, which owned Task Force Games at the time, decided to have the computer game adopt a storyline and theme similar to that of the board game.<br/><br/>The computer game, designed by Jon Van Caneghem, is notably considered the forerunner of the Heroes of Might and Magic series of computer and video games. A sequel to the original computer game, called King's Bounty: The Legend, was released in 2008.<br/><br/>New World Computing transferred ownership of Task Force Games  prior to the production of the board game, which delayed the board game's release. The major remaining component that had to be completed was final production and layout of the rule book, which is why rules artwork changed from that produced for other game components. However, the box cover art, originally contracted and completed for the board game and then adopted by the computer game, remained unchanged upon the board game's release.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Desert War: Tactical Warfare in North Africa, 1940-43, is an historical simulation of the tactical Combat in North Africa from 1941 to 1943.  The scenarios show several common situations involving German, British and Italian Units.  The combination of situations with varying forces allow an almost innumerable amount of different scenarios to be played.<br/><br/>Desert War is basically a two-Player game. It is played in sequenced turns, during which the Players use a new &amp; unique simultaneous plotting and moving system to move their units on the map, have combat and attempt to achieve certain objectives. The game is played in Scenarios which are various mixtures of forces and objectives.<br/><br/>The Western Desert, stretching 1,400 miles between Tripoli and Alexandria, was described by one German general as &quot;a tactician's paradise and a quartermaster's hell.&quot; Between March 1941, when Rommel's Afrika Korps arrived in Tripoli, and May 1943, when the last Axis troops surrendered in Tunisia, the conduct of the Desert War furnished the proof for that general's impression.<br/><br/>Desert War is a tactical simulation designed to recreate the mechanized struggles which took place in the &quot;perfect&quot; tactical terrain of North Africa during World War II. The 22&quot; x 34&quot; two-color mapsheet depicts a composite desert battlefield on which the flat sands are sparsely interrupted by patches of rocky cover or slight differences of elevation. Each mapsheet hex represents a hundred meters of distance and each Game-Turn represents three and a half minutes of actual time. Four hundred die-cut units represent the Allied, German and Italian combat units that contest the differing Desert War situations and scenarios. Opposing infantry companies, supported by tank platoons and anti-tank and artillery batteries engage each other within the tactical game scale of Desen War.<br/><br/>Desert War is a tactician's simulation tool. Those of you who have been following this series from PanzerBlitz and Combat Command: Tactical Armored Warfare, France 1944 through Red Star/White Star: Tactical Combat in Europe in the 1970's,  know that Desert War is a development of game you won't want to miss.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 3.5 minutes<br/>Hex: 109 yards / 100 meters<br/>Units: Platoon to Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; two-color map<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 10-page folded rulebook<br/>One Simultaneous Movement Plot pad<br/>Two Scenario &amp; Tables players aid sheet<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Low<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>",

Players must provide their OWN 6-sided DIE prior to play.<br/><br/>On the Mapsheet are the Turn Record Track, a Terrain Key, and the set-up locations for the Units of both the 'Campaign' &amp; 'Sidi Rezegh' games. Overall, the COLOR of the Mapsheet is WHITE with BLUE-(Water/Sea, Allied 'Fortified Box', Minefield Hex-sides), BROWN-(Rough), Light GRAY-(Broken), &amp; Dark BROWN-(Roads, Trails). The Area encompassed by this Mapsheet is the coastal road and areas south centered on El Alamein, and Alam Halfa Ridge.<br/><br/>The game counters are TAN-with BLACK print for Germans, TAN-with GREEN print for Italians, GREEN with BLACK print for British. Game scale is given as 1.7 Miles across each hex, each Turn represents 1-Day, and Units range in size from Battalion up to Brigade level.<br/><br/>One unique thing of Supercharge is that the supply rules in the standard rules game are ignored completely.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a hand of five tribe cards (from a set of eight), and going clockwise from the chief, each player lays down a tribe card in front of one of the solo challenges. If two players play on the same solo challenge, their tribe cards are moved to the duel challenge, then all other tribe cards are placed on solo challenges.<br/><br/>Starting with the chief, each player attempts to perform the trick shown on the challenge, with the value of the tribe card played showing how many jacks on the table must be used in the challenge. A challenge might have you setting jacks on edge, throwing a jack over a wall formed by your other hand, move jacks from the table into your other hand, and so on. If at any time, you fail to catch your jack, your turn ends &mdash; although you can twice discard a tribe card from your hand to replay the challenge. If you succeed, you keep the tribe card you played.<br/><br/>In a duel, the first player to complete the duel keeps one of the two tribe cards played.<br/><br/>After all solo and duel challenges are complete, everyone participates in a final challenge to determine who will be chief for the next round. After four rounds, players tally the points on the challenge and tribe cards they collected, and the player with the high score wins.<br/><br/>Reimplements: Knucklebones<br/>Reimplements: Jacks<br/><br/>",

But if the players overexploit the resources and develop too quickly, they impoverish the land, the water will rise and the play area will get smaller.

The decision to play a stronger set or pass the turn is critical: passing allows to flip a card to change its value or draw a new one from the deck, further increasing strategic possibilities.<br/><br/>Furthermore, QU4TO cards are key pieces in the game, which can be played alone or in combination with others to form powerful sets, offering extra points and the chance to turn the game around. Strategy is crucial, as every move counts, and the right time to use your QU4TO cards can be the difference between winning or losing.<br/><br/>At the end of three rounds, the player with the highest score is declared the winner. QU4TO is a game that balances simplicity and strategic depth, making it accessible and appealing to both newcomers and veterans in the world of card games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Balance the disc on the it, silvery side up, so that the point of the pyramid goes through the hole in the center of the disc, and the disc is level.  Take turns placing one piece on the disc. You may not touch the disc or any pieces other than the one you are playing. You should not move any of the pieces that have already been placed. Play all pieces upright. You may not place a piece so that it is resting on or covering any pieces that have already been played. You may not place a piece over the tip of the piece that supports the disc.  If you place a piece and &quot;the ice does not crack&quot;, play passes to the next player. &quot;The ice cracks&quot; if the edge of the disc touches the table, any piece on the disc touches the table, or any piece falls or slides off the disc onto the table.  If you place a piece and the ice cracks, you have lost the round. Take back all of the pieces you have placed this round. Remove the other players' pieces from play.<br/><br/>",

Defenders, as the name implies, cannot capture but are used to block or confound one's opponent.  Pieces are captured in a Checkers-like fashion of being jumped over, with special rules for corner captures, and piece substitution.

        "description": "A spinoff of the original 1935 Hasbro game, this 2011 Klingon edition (released November 17th) follows the same format.  There is a &quot;Go&quot; square in one corner, and players roll dice to travel around the squares lining the edge of the board in circles trying to acquire properties.<br/><br/>What seems like the biggest difference between the editions (i.e. the fact that you are trying to take over the galaxy) actually involves no changes from the original edition other than name changes.  &quot;Properties&quot; are &quot;galaxy systems&quot; such as Qo'noS, Romulus or Earth (home base of the enemy Federation), and they are &quot;conquered&quot; instead of &quot;owned&quot;.  The most ultimately valuable &quot;property&quot; (equivalent to Boardwalk in the original game), is now called Kronos, and the equivalent of Park Place is Khitomer.  The equivalents of the valuable green properties in the original are Boreth, Ty&rsquo;Gokor and Krios Prime, and so on. The standard money is replaced by &quot;Klingon Force&quot; scrip. &quot;Houses&quot; are renamed &quot;Outposts&quot; (and redone as small yellow dome-shaped constructs) and &quot;Hotels&quot; are renamed &quot;Capitals&quot; (miniature red versions of the Klingon High Council Building). &quot;Railroads&quot; are &quot;Starships&quot;: the Raptor, the Negh'Var, the Vor'Cha and the K'T'inga; and the &quot;Utilities&quot; are now the Rura Penthe Mines and the Praxis Energy Facility.<br/><br/>The REAL differences lie in the facts that, for one, &quot;Combat&quot; cards replace &quot;Chance&quot; cards.  Furthermore, the element of &quot;Honor&quot; replaces the &quot;Community Chest&quot;.  The penalty of the &quot;Luxury Tax&quot; is replaced by a penalty of losing a battle against Starfleet.<br/><br/>Another difference which does not affect gameplay, but which does add a lot to the feel of the game is that the board, cards, and rules are all bi-lingual: written in both Klingon and English.<br/><br/>In order to attain victory and &quot;preserve the glory of the Klingon Empire&quot;, players must conquer all of the systems in the galaxy.<br/><br/>Two editions were released, a standard &quot;Collector's Edition&quot; and a 1701-unit-released &quot;Limited Edition&quot; that includes a miniature replica of Chancellor Gorkon's bone cane from STAR TREK VI: THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY.<br/><br/>Both versions include as standard equipment: the gameboard, 6 Collectible tokens, 28 Title Deed Cards, 16 COMBAT cards, 16 HONOR cards, 2 Dice, 32 Outposts, 12 Capitals, 1 Pack of Klingon Forces, and Rules.<br/><br/>Like most of their MONOPOLY releases, this does not include the &quot;Speed Die&quot;, although the rules mention both classic &quot;speed-up game&quot; options.<br/><br/>",

The mission is to make a  successful marriage proposal, but to do so you must overcome every opposition along the way. Good luck with your fight for true love! - From the manual<br/><br/>In Love and War is a rummy-style card game for 2-5 players. Each turn players draw a card and discard a card representing romantic acts, aiming to fill their hand with two sets of three and one pair. If another player discards a card that completes your set, you may interject &quot;Meow!&quot;  to interrupt the normal turn order and steal it. When you finish all three sets, say &quot;Meow Meow Meow!&quot; to trigger a marriage proposal. Shuffle a special &quot;Yes, I do&quot; card into your hand and draw a card randomly. If you draw the &quot;I do&quot; card, you win! But other players with the same cards may add them to your shuffled hand to reduce your chance of success. If you fail, the game continues but you may take an extra &quot;I do&quot; card during your next proposal attempt.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally published in one of GW's magazines in June 2000, these are revised rules for using titans (combat mechs) in an &quot;Epic 40,000&quot; SF-miniatures battle. However, although they occasionally refer to the Epic 40K rules, this is only if you want to use the titans with infantry or tanks in combined armies. By themselves, these rules constitute a playable game pitting titans against titans (an &quot;Epic 40K Lite,&quot; if you will). The concepts and mechanisms will be familiar to anyone who has played any of GW's miniatures games.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained by damaging and destroying enemy titans, as well as by meeting the objectives of the chosen scenario. The player with the most VPs when the battle is decided is the winner. Playing time is completely arbitrary and will depend on the base point costs of the armies and the scenario being played.<br/><br/>The rules WERE available on GW's Web site as a free downloadable PDF. However, the PDF doesn't include the objective cards that were printed on the back of the magazine where the rules first appeared, so unless this is fixed, players who have only the PDF will be limited to basic straight-ahead attack scenarios.<br/><br/>",

This game combines bluffing, hand management, and your ability to be a jerk in one tidy package. In a round, each player starts with a hand of five cards, with the cards being similar to a Pairs deck (one 1, two 2s, up to ten 10s), but with some of the cards from 1-5 being labeled &quot;low&quot; and some from 6-10 being labeled &quot;high&quot;; if a card isn't labeled, then it can be anything from 1-10.<br/><br/>Each player reveals one card simultaneously, and whoever reveals the highest card starts. On a turn, the player choose one card from hand, places it face down with 1-3 honey chips on it, then draw a new card. The next player can either place the same number of chips on it to pass the card to the next player or take the card and chips; if the card matches a number the player already has, they are out of the round and must ante a number of chips equal to the card number to the pot. If no one takes the card, then whoever first played the card must take it, scoring lots of chips but killing themselves if they played a number they already had.<br/><br/>The round continues until a player has cards that sum to at least 35, they have three cards valued 1-5 in front of them, or they're the only one still in the round. That player wins the pot, then everyone scores points equal to the number of honey chips they have. After a certain number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

To win, you will need to observe the actions of others, remember obtained insights, and strategically use powerful abilities.<br/><br/>Watch carefully though! Crops and their values can change when you least expect it. Adapt to changes and alter your strategy to come out the victor. With only 3 seeds in hand, where will you sow?<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player is given a deck of 6 Seed cards consisting of 2 time, 2 money, and 2 labor cards. During your turn, you will draw the top 3 Seed cards from your deck. You will try gain insight into one of the return/harvest values assigned to the crops in play. With that information and the seeds you have in-hand, you will play 2 of the 3 seeds in your hand on any of the crops in play. Special earned event cards may also be played during your turn to further your success.<br/><br/>The seeds you play on crops will be returned to you once the crop receives enough seeds on it to be completed/harvested. Once a crop is completed, players will receive points equal to the crop's harvest number multiplied by the number of seeds they played on that crop. Once a crop is complete, a new Harvest and Crop card is drawn.<br/><br/>Game ends when the a crop is completed and there are no more Crop cards in the deck.

Plays a lot like Trivial Pursuit but with some differences. Players move on the board and answer questions in ten different topics. On the board are ten `topic rooms&acute; where players receive a plastic `book&acute; if they answer the question correctly. The winner is the first player to collect all ten books and return to the spot in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>To spice things up a little players may use cards. These come in three types: One gives you a clue for your current question, one lets you steal a book from another player, and the third kind lets you choose which book to get when you answer correctly in a topic room. Thus, if you know that History is not for you, than you may win two books in the Biology room and exchange one of them for a History book.<br/><br/>The game comes with 8,000 questions on 800 cards.<br/><br/>This game is related to Det store norske spillet.<br/><br/>Reimplemented as Kunskapsjakten.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ares Magazine #9. Delta Vee is a tactical simulation of combat among spaceships in the 24th Century. The game is intended for two players, although more may participate in scenarios devised by the players. Each hex on the Delta Vee game maps represents a volume 20,000 kilometers in diameter. The game uses a two-dimensional movement system; the &ldquo;plane&rdquo; of the playing area represents the ecliptic of the star system in which each battle occurs. Each Game-Turn represents 15 minutes.<br/><br/>During play, each player moves one or more spaceships about the game-map using a maneuver system that abstractly simulates the laws of Newtonian motion. Each spaceship is composed of a hull with a varying number of attached pods. Each pod represents a system that improves the ship&rsquo;s capabilities in combat, movement, and/or some other aspect of spaceship operations.<br/><br/>Each player controls his spaceships by issuing Maneuver Commands (so that the ship may alter its velocity or direction of movement) and Battle Commands (so that weapons and other systems aboard the ship may be prepared for use). A spaceship&rsquo;s combat abilities include laser fire, particle fire, four types of missiles, and battle craft (two man fighter craft launched from larger ships). The attributes of each spaceship are recorded on a Spaceship Log before beginning play. During the game, energy expended, missiles launched, and damage incurred by the ship are recorded on the ship&rsquo;s log.<br/><br/>Delta Vee is the tactical space combat system for SPI&rsquo;s science fiction role-playing game, Universe. Although there is little open warfare in the vast human interstellar empire of the 24th Century (contact with another space-faring race has yet to be established), there are many types of illegal ship traffic and disputes among self-governing worlds. These types of small conflicts form the background for the scenarios in Delta Vee.<br/><br/>",

Seega persists today in parts of North Africa. It is played on a 5x5 board (a &quot;Knights&quot; solitaire board is ideal for this) with each player having 12 pieces (usually marbles).  Players alternately place two of their pieces on the board until all spaces except one are occupied. No captures are made during this deployment phase. The player who placed the last pieces then moves one piece one space orthogonally, attempting to take opponent's pieces by custodial capture (i.e. &quot;sandwiching&quot;). A piece on the central square - usually marked with a cross - is safe from capture. If a player cannot make a legal move, their opponent continues to play until an opening appears. To win, reduce your opponent to one piece (or none). Draws often occur.   Variants are played on larger boards (8 x 8 etc.) and/or with different capturing conditions, such as jumping, as in draughts/checkers.<br/><br/>",

It started before the birth of Christ (B.C.) and lasted, in the East, until year 476 A.D. (anno domini) and, in the West, until 1453 A.D. Let us go back to year 140 D.C., when this Empire reached its greatest extension and dominated practically all Europe, part of Asia and northern Africa. Times that were not completely peaceful, for enemies threatened the borders of the empire and the conquered people insurrected against domination, seeking freedom. Go back in time with War: Roman Empire and feel the thrill of defending your borders and advancing your legions, conquering provinces of the roman world in 140 A.D.! Observe, though, that the political division of the provinces adopted in the board objectives to ease the game mechanics, and not portrait the reality of that age. All province and sea names are written in latin. Only the region names are in portuguese. Each players is dealt an objective, that will only be known by himself. The knowledge of this objective by other players will make your conquest harder. It is important for the player to, when reading the rules, try some practical plays, simulating, inclusively, the mentioned examples. This way it will be much easier to understand the mechanisms of WAR.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    War<br/><br/><br/>",

Why would they do this for you? Because you're the king of one of these races, that's why!<br/><br/>Each card in the 80-card deck is double-sided; one side depicts a creature from one of the four races and a numerical value (0-9), while the other side depicts a mine with a defense value, a size value, and a point value. To start the game, shuffle the deck, lay out four mines, deal each player a hand of six cards, then lay out four cards creature-side-up to form the Camp; group like creatures on top of one another. Each player also receives a King card to show which race he represents.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he must play a creature on (1) a mine currently up for grabs or (2) a mine that he's previously claimed. In both cases, the creature being played must have a higher number than the creature currently on top of the stack &mdash; except for a 0, which can be played on a 9. In the former case, you can play a card of any race, while in the latter case you can't play a card of your own race! When the number of cards on an available mine matches that mine's defense value, the King of the race on the card last played claims the mine. (If that race isn't in the game, whoever played the card claims the mine.) Move all of the cards played into the Camp.<br/><br/>When the number of cards on a claimed mine matches that mine's size, discard all of the creature cards to the Camp, then place the mine under your King &mdash; unless the mine bears an overseer symbol, in which case you need to first play a creature of your own race on top of the creatures developing the mine (following the rule for how to play cards) before you can score the mine and place it under your King.<br/><br/>To end your turn, you refill your hand to six cards by drawing the top card from the deck or from one of the four race piles in the Camp. When the deck runs out, the game ends. Players score points for all of the mine cards that they've fully developed (that is, mine cards under their King), then lose points for mines claimed but not yet developed. The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

If you connect tunnels, then you'll be able to try to steal another player's bomb before he brings it home.<br/>The basic turn goes like this:<br/>First, you move your pawn to another tunnel tile.<br/>Second, if you ended up or started on a bomb, test (with a special die) to see if it blows up.<br/>Third, draw a tunnel tile (you have a hand of four) and play one.<br/>Finally, if you get a bomb home safely, read its message.<br/>In addition to the tunnel tiles, there are white, black and grey spy tiles.  They are used to block tunnel tiles (each tunnel tile has a little black or white spy drawn in its middle, so you can play a White Spy only on black tunnel tiles and vice-versa; the Grey Spy can be played on either).<br/>Spy vs Spy is not be to be confused with Spion & Spion, an entirely different game by the same publisher and credited to Alex Randolph .<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Release! is a light card game about software and the people who  make it. The game is simple: manage cooperation and competition with other players across five releases to score the most points. Each round of Release! is played the same way, but the scoring rules change as you reveal new tools and methods. Your team needs to continuously respond to these strategic shifts in order to produce the best release possible.<br/><br/>Release's core mechanics are modeled after classic trick trump games. Rounds, or releases, are played by each player contributing a card to a trick, generally the highest card thrown takes the trick. This continues until the players are out of cards, at which point in time they score the release.<br/><br/>Scoring rules are where it gets tricky.  Every release the players will reveal a new scoring methodology. These scoring rules award or subtract points for taking; various combinations of cards, lump sums of suits, or a specific number of tricks.  This means that some rounds you want may want to lose as many tricks as possible, win as many as possible, or fish for specific cards.<br/><br/>The face cards lend further complexity, these cards all have special bonus powers that do things like: affect their rank, steal previously won cards, award instant points, and much more.<br/><br/>The game itself is themed to evoke certain trends of software development. Themeing elements include naming conventions, fun copy, and the face cards are all modeled after famous 'faces' of the development community.<br/><br/>",

In SET, players want to create sets of three cards, with each card in the set having the same feature as each other card in the set or a different feature. For example, all three cards have green symbols on them, but they have 1, 2 and 3 symbols and the symbols are all different shapes (oval, squiggle and diamond).<br/><br/>One side of the double-sided game board in SET Junior features three 3x3 squares, with each line in a square forming a set. Players take turns drawing a tile from the stack &mdash; with each tile featuring 1-3 symbols in one of three colors and in one of three shapes &mdash; and placing that tile on the game board. Each time a player completes a set by placing a tile, she claims a point chip and whoever collects the most chips wins.<br/><br/>On the other side of the game board, a dealer lays out up to ten tiles one by one and whenever any player sees a set among the face-up tiles, she shouts &quot;Set!&quot; and claims the tiles that form the set. The dealer then replaces these tiles and the game continues until no more sets can be claimed. Whoever claims the most sets wins.<br/><br/>",

You can play it anywhere as a stand-alone game using the special die or add questions to your standard Trivial Pursuit! Includes questions on Star Wars characters, vehicles, weapons, droids, geography and more!<br/><br/>This is another in the &quot;Bite-Size&quot; range of Trivial Pursuit games. It is intended as a portable travel game. The game is packaged in a wedge (&quot;piece-of-pie&quot;) shaped box.<br/><br/>The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.<br/><br/>",

Your object as the Lord of the Dead is to fight your way through the village and reach the cemetery, where you can raise an undead army. Your object as the townsfolk is to stop the villain from defiling your ancestral burial grounds and raising up his horrifying army.<br/><br/>",

However, as people started to disappear, they began to gather in castles and become more independent, fearful, and competitive. They believed they could exist separately from each other.  They will soon learn they are stronger together, and their cooperation will be essential to beat this evil once and for all<br/><br/>The goal of Lawklivya: Vengeance is to survive the ongoing assault of your castles by different enemies. This is accomplished through gathering resources, using those resources to create weapons, upgrade walls, and train workers into warriors, scouts, and a warrior hero! When an enemy attacks your castle, the other castles can send warriors to assist in the battle. When the castles have defeated a certain number of enemies, they must confront the biggest and most powerful enemy. This victory will come at a cost, and will only be accomplished with all of the castle's warriors working together!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Rotten Fish: The first game is about fish in a barrel. Round by round the fish moves toward the rotten bottom of the barrel. The players play one card from their hand. Depending on how many players have chosen a card, fish can be taken from the barrel. <br/>The game ends when a player has five fish on the bottom of the barrel.<br/><br/>2. Fresh Fish: The card playing mechanism in this variant is similar to the one in Rotten Fish. In this game players try to buy fish from the different &quot;displays&quot; in the barrel.<br/><br/>3. Fish in the Barrel: By playing their cards players try to sell their fish to the market (the barrel). Depending on the cards the other players played a player can place 1 - 4 fish in the barrel.<br/><br/>",

Whoever manages to uncover the sought after dinos and reach the end of the dinosaur footprint path first wins the game.<br/><br/>Each player takes a wooden dinosaur token and places it at the start of a four-tile track. Five dinosaur tiles are shuffled and placed face down in a row on the table. Then in turn, players turn over one of 26 search tiles. If the search tile shows a &quot;trade symbol,&quot; the player exchanges two dinosaur tiles without looking at them. If the search tile shows a picture of two or three dinosaurs, the player must turn over an equivalent number of dinosaur tiles. If they match exactly, that player's dinosaur advances on the track. The first player to reach the end of the track wins.<br/><br/>In the &quot;expert&quot; variant, a sixth, blank tile is shuffled in along with the five dinosaur tiles.<br/><br/>",

Money to build is earned by creating a rail network to cities, towns and mines, with the mining being rather abstract(mines open and close as random events). Players must worry about the details of track types, passes and tunnels. In addition, there is an events deck which has a large effect on play. As there are really only about three good ways through the mountains, this is the optimal number of players.<br/><br/>In 1995 Winsome Games released Rocky Mountain Rails as an expansion kit to the game.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Rocky Mountain Rails<br/><br/><br/>",

The large energy companies can hardly find new planets with the raw material, and heavy-duty surface scanners are employed to search for a worthwhile volume of the energy source in the few Ranium mines already known.<br/><br/>Now the Mega Group Troll Factory Unlimited has found some on planet GH-328. Several rival mine crews have been sent to the mine to find the White Ranium and transport it to the space loader &mdash; but the material isn't secure until it arrives at the space loader. Until then it can be intercepted by the other mine crews.<br/><br/>In TF22 Mine, each player takes the part of one mine crew, collects White Ranium in the mine, and transports it to the space loader. Each space loader can load up to two units of White Ranium. The mine crew must then return to the base camp in the middle of the mine to recharge their equipment. After that, they can send more units of White Ranium to the space loader. The crew then uses the molecular transporter of the space loader for transport to the base camp.<br/><br/>The player who first transports three units of White Ranium to the space loader wins.<br/><br/>",

For instance, a bid of &ldquo;four 5&rsquo;s&rdquo; means the bidder believes that there are at least four fives being held by all players as a group. The next player must either make a higher bid or challenge the previous bid. Once a bid is challenged, the cards are revealed. If the bid was too high, the bidder loses a card. If not, the challenger loses a card. Players try to figure out each other&rsquo;s hands by their bids, but remember, bluffing is not only legal, it&rsquo;s sometimes quite effective (unless you get challenged!)<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;re very sure that your opponent&rsquo;s bid was too high, why not bid &ldquo;double&rdquo; and put the loss of 2 cards on the line? Of course, the bidder may turn the tables on you and &ldquo;redouble&rdquo;. Or if you think that your opponent&rsquo;s bid was exactly right, take a chance and bid &ldquo;Perfecto!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Includes 110 cards and instructions in a colorful metal tin.<br/><br/>Inspired by Perudo<br/><br/>",

Only then can they safely scurry past Cora and fill their pantry with the best tidbits &ndash; but Cora has a sharp ear! Who will manage to get hold of the most treats?<br/><br/>In Miau!, the player mice want to be the first to collect ten tidbits of food without all members of their household falling prey to Cora. To set up the game, lay out 6-18 tidbit tiles (1-3 each of six types), the single cat tile, and 1-3 mouse holes (one fewer than the number of players). Each player has four mouse tokens and a score marker that moves along a track to mark the number of tidbits collected.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the animal die and the tidbit die, giving one of three results:<br/><br/><br/>    The cat's asleep: Time to get food! The first player to slap a tidbit tile matching that die scores one point.<br/>    The cat's awake: Ignore the tidbits and head home! The player who fails to slap a mouse hole flips one of his mouse tokens to the cat side.<br/>    The dog barges in: Either slap the tidbit showing on that die or slap the cat tile. Whoever slaps something first receives either one point (in the former case) or the flipping of one of his mouse tokens to the mouse side.<br/><br/><br/>If all of your mouse tokens are flipped to the cat side, you're out of the game. (Remove a mouse hole to keep players scrambling.) If all but one player are eliminated, that player wins; otherwise, the first player to collect ten tidbits wins!<br/><br/>",

You have $1,000,000 cash, $2,000,000 in debt and 2000 oz. of gold to begin. There are several different businesses, and you can buy parts of them for anywhere from $100,000 each for Residentials, to $600,000 for Casinos.  When someone lands on a property you own, you get $50,000 per property of the same kind you own.  But the big money comes when you collect a full set of property.  Land on a Drive-in Realtor and you can collect multiple millions for selling your set.  There are also Options, which allow you to buy lots from your opponents at nauseatingly low prices, and gold is bought for $600,000 a brick (or in that area) and sells for over $1 million.  Gold seems to be the fast way to money, but you must have the appropriate card, or you'll get fined $100,000.  As players get out of debt (or deeper in it), they will find themselves in a die-rolling race to land on the Bank, or square 17, which allows you to go anywhere you want.  A good finance game, but it was only printed for a year in America. Copies do pop up on eBay (where I got mine).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Similar to Black Jack and &quot;vingt-et-un&quot;, Las siete y media is a more simple and familiar game.<br/><br/>You need a Spanish deck, take away the 8, 9 and 10. The value of the face or court cards: The King (rey), The Knight (caballo) and Jack (sota)is half point and the rest the same value as shown on the cards. Ace is 1 point, 2 two points, etc...<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the player who is nearest to, or who has scored exactly seven and a half points with his cards.   Exceeding this value busts your hand.<br/><br/>One player takes the role of the dealer, and the other players play  against him. The dealer deals one face down card to each player, include himself. Then, by turns, each player makes a bet and the dealer deals one card to him, this card can be face up, if the player doesn't show his dealt card, or face down if he does reveal  his dealt card. The player may stand if he has seven and a half points   or lower.<br/><br/>Once each player takes his turn and makes his bet, the dealer plays his cards trying to beat the hands of each player. When the dealer stands his hand, the other players reveal their cards and the dealer must pay the bet or take it from each player depending the value of his hand.<br/><br/>If one player has seven and a half points  then he becomes the dealer. If more than one player has the same points then the player to the right of the dealer becomes the new dealer.<br/><br/>",

Two designers have utilized the same components and come up with two different games.<br/><br/>Germanica by Hartmut Witt deals with the crumbling of the Roman Empire with the invasion of the German barbarians.  Kind of a cross between Britannia and Civilization, players play a series of tribes that flow through the region.  The aim of the game is to gain the most cultural advances by creating as much stability in a region as possible.<br/><br/>Huns, Romans, and Germans by Gerhard H. Kuhlmann follows a similar theme although the game is broken down into basic and advanced rules and scenarios.<br/><br/>The game comes with wood tokens as the playing pieces.  Detailed stickers are applied to the tokens to represent various types of units.  A deck of cards also accompanies the game which drives the invasions and advancements.  Lastly the game board itself is a beautifully painted map of Europe detailed in Latin.<br/><br/>",

Then he'll use any one of the two remaining until they suffer the same fate, upon which he'll use his last character.<br/><br/>The turn is divided in 4 segments. All players undertake a segment before any begins the following segment.<br/><br/>The 4 segments are:<br/>- &quot;D&eacute;pensez vos butins&quot; (expense your loot) where you can buy some of the &quot;big&quot; weapons cards and add them to your hand (the small ones are ALWAYS in your hand)<br/>- &quot;Pr&eacute;parez vos esquives&quot; (prepare your dodges) where you put on your character, face up, any of the weapons you bought, up to the prestige (fame) value of your character<br/>- &quot;Attaquez&quot; (attack) where each player chooses a weapon in hand and say who he attacks (players at his side for contact weapons, other players with ranged weapons)<br/>- &quot;Videz vos querelles&quot; (end your quarrels) where attacks are resolved. An attack is dodged if the defensive player has correctly found the value of the attack coming. A successful attack make the defensive character lose some of his HP, and the attacking character win prestige or loot.<br/><br/>In plus of the weapons card, there are other cards that players can use to affect the game.<br/><br/>If a player arrives at 5 in prestige, he can call the militia that will end the game. If a character becomes KO by losing all his Hit Points, its player takes his next character.<br/><br/>A player can come in the game, or leave, at any moment.

Class cards come in two suits &mdash; stars and planets &mdash; and to win, you must have the highest difference in points between these two suits when someone's chain reaches seven cards.

The problem is that there's a waterfall nearby and the crates are getting closer and closer to it. The treasures are represented by several, differently coloured wooden blocks set up on differently sized blue water-chips. You must carefully push them back, because if you fail and the crate falls down, your fellow players get the victory point. The players are river pirates waiting at the foot of a waterfall (represented by a plastic ramp in connection with the game box) for the treasures of a capsized treasure ship.<br/><br/>In her/his turn the player rolls a die to see if and how many water-chips she/he has to add at the far end of the ramp. Than the player must push the newly set water-chips up the river/ramp with a tree trunk for a given length. So every turn some water-chips are dropping off the ramp - that's the waterfall. When treasure blocks are on the water-chips they are dropping with them down the waterfall and the player, whose turn it was before the active player's receives the treasures.<br/><br/>Ages 5 and up<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The fantasy world of Graxia is a shattered world of floating continents high in the sky. Each continent is connected by portals, the primary gateways between city-states that reside on these continents. Warlords command Guardians to lead armies through the portals on quests to conquer and control each other's lands.<br/><br/>The many continents are filled with races of all types, from Orcs, Goblins, Dwarves, Skeletons, Elves, Humans, as well as new races, such as the Celethreals and Boneshadows. While once in harmony with each other, the peace of the countryside has since been destroyed as portals open with armies pouring in from unknown continents.<br/><br/>What Guardians will protect your lands?<br/><br/>Guardians of Graxia will be released this summer as both a board game and a PC online-downloadable version. The game features dynamic strategic gameplay using more than 240 unique and spell cards, figurines, and map tiles in a fantasy-based environment. Heroes of Graxia is being released at the same time and is a Deck-Building Card Game version of the Graxia world.<br/><br/>Guardians of Graxia will support both single and multiplayer gameplay as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Devils &amp; Black Sheep  is a tabletop nanogame: small, light, quick, and easy. Turns last about 1 minute, and a game lasts 30-45 minutes. It is designed as a two-player experience, but it scales well and could be played with 3-4 players if you combine two games.<br/><br/>Players control outlaw crews zooming from battle site to battle site in deep space. The goal is to be the first to arrive, pick through the flotsam and derelicts to find the salvageable wreckage, and escape back to the nearest planet. There are shady deals and scams to be run on the side, too.<br/><br/>Navy patrols wander the area, intent on keeping pirates, bandits, and smugglers in line. The patrols monitor each player's &quot;wanted level.&quot; When a player has a high enough bounty or is caught with contraband too many times, the patrols will chase them down and exact revenge. Sometimes a ship's own activities will make them more wanted; sometimes a reliable tip off from a rival crew will do the trick.<br/><br/>This game consists of three components:<br/><br/>Cover &amp; Rules - 80# text paper;<br/>Board - 16 pt cover stock;<br/>Counter Sheets - 38 pt die cut chipboard.<br/><br/>Devils &amp; Black Sheep has a simple 3-part turn sequence.<br/><br/>1. Place New Wrecks: This is accomplished by rolling the die and following a placement matrix to determine where rumors of wreckage will lead you.<br/><br/>2. Navy Patrols Act: This will be a tame part of the game early on, but as your Wanted Levels increase from all your shady activities, it could get nasty.<br/><br/>3. Players Act: Choose one of the following actions:<br/><br/>Bribe: donate to an election campaign in exchange for a reduction in wanted level<br/>Bounty: place a bounty on a ship to increase its wanted level<br/>Fence: sell some of your loot to the local chop shop<br/>Raid: attack an opponent and steal some of their stuff<br/>Salvage: explore nearby flotsam for something of value<br/>Move: pretty self explanatory<br/>Smuggle: sell dark energy on the black market ... VERY illegal stuff<br/><br/>Degrees of Success - After choosing an action, players roll to see how well their action succeeded. The roll determines how successful your action was. This game specifically avoids the polarized success/failure result that commonly turns choices into all-or-nothing deals, and instead replaces it with a gambling mechanic.<br/><br/>Players roll the dice at the beginning of each turn to determine whether new reports of a recent battle reach the rumor mill of the local cantina. The rolls determine how much wreckage is rumored (some battles are larger than others, of course ... just as some rumors are more outlandish than others), and the sector and distance from the planet. These wrecks are derelict ships abandoned or destroyed in a recent battle. Every wreck has the potential to be salvaged for valuable (ish) flotsam, but the actual amount of salvageable junk won't be known until you arrive and check it out.<br/><br/>The local Navy Patrols then roll to see whether they are ordered to bring any of the outlaw crews to justice. Sometimes the patrols will simply move around and harass players. Sometimes they will bring the full might of their patrol to bear.<br/><br/>The higher the player's &quot;wanted level,&quot; the more likely a patrol will take notice and give chase. Wanted levels can increase by getting caught in your illegal activity, and can also be increased by other players placing bounties on your ship. Your wanted level decreases by either being attacked by the local patrol, or by bribing officials to reduce it.<br/><br/>",

With the confusion surrounding the surrender of Italy, seizing those islands struck Churchill as easy pickings, with a vast potential for future Allied operations. A single British brigade, the 234th, began a bold island hopping campaign. In time, the Germans countered and checked the advance, first at the island of Kos, and then later at Leros. The war in the Aegean highlighted a clash of weapons systems, with the Luftwaffe controlling the air while the Royal Navy dominated the seas.<br/><br/>Each Game Turn represents one week. Each Impulse of a Game Turn can represent a variable amount of time within that week. A hex is approximately six and one half kilometers across. Ground units range in size from companies to regiments. Naval units represent a single vessel, although Torpedo Boats and MFP counters represent 2-3 vessels each. Each air counter represents approximately six aircraft.<br/><br/>Design - Perry Moore<br/>Development - Paul Rohrbaugh<br/>Graphic Design - Craig Grando<br/><br/>",

With acquisition and tracking ranges measured in tens of thousands of kilometers, to human eyes the people that are trying to kill you are not even a speck.  But they can hurt you, even though you can't see them.  Precise laster arrays and big particle accelerators, honed by centuries of engineering, can reach out without warning to slit your hull like the belly of a fish, spilling life--oxygen, heat, and fuel--into the hard vacuum.  That's why space combat is a game of cat and mouse.  Keep yourself wrapped in the mantle of space--cold, dark, silent.  Keep your thrust burns to a minimum--they blaze like miniature suns for all to detect.  Rig your passive sensors to greedily absorb data, but remain quiet yourself--give nothing away.  Keep your weapons ready, in case&hellip; There!  A faint trace of mid-wavelength infrared betrays a meneuver drive.  Bring up the ladar dishes while the big passive array builds up a targeting solution.  The moments seem endless while every crewmember shares the same thought: &quot;Have they seen us?&quot; It is the unseen enemy at this moment doing the same thing that you are?  You might never know the answer.  If you beat him, maybe you'll find out.  But what if you hadn't seen him first?  Some questions must remain unasnwered when death, unbidden, comes scorching toward you as silent, brilliant lances.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/>Brilliant Lances - Traveller Starship Combat<br/>Brilliant Lances includes:<br/>-Vector-based movement<br/>-Detailed hit location and damage resolution<br/>-Lasers, particle accelerators, meson guns, detonation laser missiles, and the systems that defend against them<br/>-Extensive ship ratings, including New Era and pre-Collapse warships, from the swift Rampart fighter up to large naval and merchant vessels<br/>-Complete starship design rules, usable both with this game and with Traveller: The New Era roleplaying game<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Breaking news! A lost world has been discovered, and clues leading to its secret entrance have been disseminated all around the world. Your goal? Find them! Driven only by your courage, you decide to follow in the footsteps of those first explorers and launch a worldwide expedition, but you're not the only one on this quest...<br/><br/>In Lost Explorers, each player starts with five figures on their research team: two leaders to track your discoveries, and three members to gain equipment and go on expeditions. On your turn, you can place members on one or both equipment areas to gain tokens; placing one figure means you retrieve the first token from the pile, two figures the second token, etc. The visible side of a token represents a vehicle &mdash; a train (red), a car (yellow), a boat (blue), or an airship (green) &mdash; while the hidden side depicts two or three locations on the world map. For each token you take, choose whether to keep the vehicle side face up or flip it over to reveal the mission side of the token. Once you choose, the token is locked, and you place it in front of you with your other vehicle and mission tokens.<br/><br/>Alternatively, instead of collecting equipment you can place members on map locations. Each location shows 2-3 vehicle tiles, and you must have all depicted tiles in front of you to place a member on a location. Each time you place a member, choose one of the vehicle tokens used, then place it in the discard pile next to the box. (If you travel to the location of another player's member, you instead give them the discarded token.)<br/><br/>After you either collect vehicle/mission tokens or send members on expeditions, you can complete one or more missions if you have a member on each of the 2-3 locations depicted on that mission. For each mission, remove one of your members just used from the board, then advance the appropriate leader on the discovery track for the color of the mission and the number of members used. (Each game, 2-4 locations are marked as &quot;validated&quot;, and a validated location is always completed automatically for missions, but you score no points for it.) If you advanced your leader who was behind on the discovery track, take a vehicle token from the discard pile and add it to your collection.<br/><br/>When one of your leaders reaches a &quot;clue&quot; spot on a discovery track, you collect a clue token. If you collect four clue tokens first, you win! Alternatively, the game ends once all the vehicle tokens have been claimed, at which point the player who has advanced the farthest on the discovery track with their slower leader wins.<br/><br/>",

Each card in a pair shows a word that is a similar-sounding anagram of the other card's word, each accompanied by its own illustration.<br/><br/>Here is an example of two cards that form a pair: Gartenkunst - Kartengunst. An English version of the game might have you hunting for a Bad Salad to match the Sad Ballad you just found.<br/><br/>The format originates in &quot;the world's shortest column&quot; (two words ... plus two pictures) from the weekly S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung Magazin. The juxtaposition of incongruous concepts, the odd but perfectly understandable expressions for familiar concepts that often result on at least one side of the anagram, and the deadpan stock photography illustrations are all played for absurd humour.<br/><br/>This sort of memory based on playing with words is more difficult than the usual one. The funny images displaying these words add to the fun.<br/><br/>",

To advance your hidden agenda, and enrich the lives of your friends and associates, you will use your horde of minions to corrupt and subvert the assembly of the realm. Use the right kinds of &quot;persuasion&quot;, increase your own power, and push backroom deals through the assembly, all while looting the kingdom and its people of all its worth.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player will choose a fantasy corporation to play as (Dragons, Sorcerers, Giants, Witches, Vampires or Orcs), a Hidden Agenda which will guide their evil plan, and some starting minions (Zombies, Demons, Goblins, or Golems).<br/><br/>Over the course of the game players will influence the assembly of the realm (Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Gnomes) using their minions and influence. Propose bills through lobbying efforts, buy useless and pretty luxuries, and get the politicians who represent the (ahem) &quot;people&quot; to push their nefarious legislation into law.<br/><br/>",

You have been hired to conserve these hamsters and keep them safe from their natural predator: the badger.<br/><br/>Tricky Badger is a set-collection, trick-taking card game. The game lasts five rounds, and each player starts the round with a hand of nine cards, with pink always being trump. Ten collection cards are placed face up from the deck.<br/><br/>At the start of each trick, the active player (a position that rotates) chooses a collection card that the winner of the trick will add to their collection; each collection card has an arrow to indicate whether the highest or lowest card in the trick will win. The active player leads a card, and players must follow this color, if possible. Some cards trample others, and a trampled card is removed from consideration in the trick. If a trump is played in the trick, then the highest or lowest non-trampled trump wins the trick; otherwise the highest or lowest non-trampled card of the suit led wins the trick.<br/><br/>After nine tricks, the round ends. Discard the remaining collection card, deal out nine cards to each player, and lay out ten new collection cards.<br/><br/>After five rounds, players score points for their collection cards, which can be independent or connected to other cards. Every female hamster and every male hamster is worth 1 point, for example, but a female and male hamster that are connected are worth 3 points. Get a second male hamster, however, and they fight, eliminating all of your hamsters. Similarly, a 3-point badger in your collection will eat all hamsters present unless you connect it with a bone to slake its hunger. You can feed wheat and weevils to hamsters to earn bonus points, but weevils on their own will eat your wheat. Magpies can steal cards from opponents, but cages and buckets can protect your animals from theft.<br/><br/>Whoever ends up with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Rules at the back, map front and 16 (mostly) double sided counters along the sides. <br/>The game is a hex and counter game where troops are activated though a standard deck of cards: black activates French units, red Allied. How many and all is determined by the specific card. <br/>Combat is resolved by comparing combat strengths of the units and drawing cards from that same deck. Whenever a joker is drawn, the turn is over, the deck is reshuffled and a new turn begins.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to get the French units off the north side of the map (breaking through Allied lines at Waterloo) while the Allies win by preventing that.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, players take turns laying out program instructions with &quot;ownership bits&quot; on the cards they play, creating a long line of interrelating program instructions that become more complicated as the program builds. Finally, a player will play a RUN card and set the program running. Who will survive the convolutions of the program? That's anyone's guess; each player decides if and how their own program instructions will function!<br/><br/>There is a &quot;Version 2&quot; of the game in the rules; the program is dealt out at random in a loop, the players take turns claiming instructions that they think will let them win the game. Much of this game's strategy is based upon the initial selection of Program Instructions. Version two involves much more strategy and less luck.<br/><br/>",

Siren blare, airlocks slam shut, emergency lights flash and it quickly dawns on the crew (not an IQ under 120 among'em) that something has gone horribly wrong.  They quickly realize that the whole station is losing oxygen and that it isn't going to be long before they're all so much unrecoverable salvage.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The space station is a disaster.  Equipment is strewn about after years of neglect.  Nobody knows what to do.  But then it dawns on them (sharp lads they are) - there is only one escape pod and six of them.  It doesn't take an astrophysicist with a PhD from M.I.T. to figure out that only two of them are going home, and the rest are going to end up Sucking Vacuum.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Sucking Vacuum is an easy to learn, fast action strategy game for 3 to 6 players.  Players assume the role of the doomed astronauts searching for equipment and struggling to escape the doomed space station.  They must make their way through a randomly assembled map of the International Space Station while fighting off attacks of other players who are trying to escape themselves.&quot;<br/><br/>Sucking Vacuum 2nd Edition (titled Ultimate Sucking Vacuum) is an updated version of the Origins Award-nominated game.  Now in full color with a sturdy box, the game features new artwork on the 18 map tiles and 73 die-cut counters.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to the original, but the rules have been re-written and revised in a number of areas.  Additionally, the game now includes Tournament Rules and the Alien Incursion variant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview:<br/>A game of Lawless Empire transports you to the seedy underworld, where you walk in the shoes of a Mafioso, vices and all.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>Using the unique dice mechanics of the game, you will scheme, bribe, extort, recruit, and command syndicates in order to fulfil your persona agenda, winning only if you meet more conditions stated on your hidden Mafioso card than other players by the end of 5 rounds.<br/><br/>There are many paths to victory; strategise by building your empire with filthy lucre, or recruit&nbsp;various soldati to carry out your dirty jobs and dominate the syndicates early. To emerge triumphant, you must learn to negotiate and manipulate your opponents ruthlessly.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player is dealt a hidden mafioso identity (E.g. Godfather, Don, Informant) at the start of the game. Scoring conditions are specific to each identity, and the score for each player will be tallied after 5 rounds of gameplay.<br/><br/>Much of Lawless Empire revolves around dice placements. Dice are tactically allocated to the various plans in the fight for bribery tokens, lucre tokens, new soldati, and control of syndicates.<br/><br/>Players can ask for assistance from other players after they gain control of a syndicate. Controlling or assisting a syndicate will allow players to give hidden orders to the syndicate. There are 2 types of orders with varying strengths: to secure or to sabotage. Orders given to syndicates will be revealed at the end of 5 rounds to determine if each syndicate is secured or sabotaged. Depending on your mafioso, you will score based on how many syndicates are secured or sabotaged, and/or whether you control or assist the syndicates.<br/><br/>The distinctive feature of Lawless Empire shines through its workings of dice control and interactions, abetted by soldati power and scheme cards. Concealed scheme cards are played on each plan by the players, sneakily altering how each individual plan is won. For&nbsp;example, a plan is normally won by the player with the highest total value of dice allocated to it, but the &ldquo;Underhand Attacks&rdquo; scheme card dictates that the player with the lowest total value wins instead. On the other hand, your soldati will grant you the ability to control the dice (including your opponent&rsquo;s) after their placement (e.g. to move or exchange dice around plans, or even rotate a dice to any value). This combination of allocation, scheme cards, and soldato abilities presents a fresh take on the otherwise luck-dependent dice mechanics, thus ensuring a thrilling and compelling game without repetition.<br/><br/>The hidden elements in the game (mafioso, scheme cards, syndicate orders) provide a good setting for players to bluff, negotiate, persuade, and trash talk. However, players who are intimidated by such interactions can be assured that the game can be won by outwitting everyone.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kombat Kittens Game Rules<br/><br/>THE GOAL<br/>Collect the most treasure by battling your kitten compadres and taking their treasure. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure wins!<br/> THE DECK<br/>80 Kitten Cards: Ten each of ranks 1-7 and ten of rank 9 (There is no rank 8 in Kombat Kittens.) Each card has treasure value from 1 to 4.<br/>Five Dog Cards: Each Dog card has a treasure value of 5. Dogs do not have a rank.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Remove all Dog cards from the deck and deal each player five Kitten cards.<br/> For two players: Deal out three Kitten cards face up in the center of the table - these are the Recruit cards. Add three Dog cards to the remaining deck, each ⅓ of the way through the deck, with the last on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.<br/> For three to five Players: Deal out one Kitten card face up in the center of the table - this is the Recruit card. Add two Dog cards to the remaining deck, one at the center, and one on the bottom. This is the Draw pile. Place it in the center of the table.<br/> The player with the most realistic &ldquo;meow&rdquo; goes first.<br/><br/>TAKING TURNS<br/>On each turn, the player can either:<br/>1) Draw a card from the Draw pile. (If they have less than seven cards in their hand.)<br/>or<br/>2) Take a Recruit card and replace it with a card from their hand.<br/>or<br/>3) Battle another player: do this by declaring which player you wish to battle.<br/> We recommend passing a turn token (coin, salt shaker, stuffed mouse, etc.) around the table as you play this game. It is always okay to ask how many cards another player has.<br/><br/>Battles<br/>In a battle, both players attempt to make the best three card set from the cards in their hand.  <br/> To indicate they are ready to battle, each player holds their first card face down over the table. When both players are ready, they reveal their cards simultaneously. They repeat this process until three cards have been played (unless a player forfeits, as described below.) After the third card, the best hand is determined and the winner chooses their treasure (see below).<br/><br/>DETERMINING THE WINNER OF A BATTLE<br/>The winner is the player with the best hand based on the hierarchy below, from high to low. If two hands of the same type are played, the one with the highest rank wins.<br/>Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank. Example: 4,4,4 beats 2,2,2 and all straights, pairs and high card hands.<br/>Three Card Straight: Three cards of adjacent rank. Example: 4,5,6 beats 2,3,4 and all pairs and high card hands.<br/>Pair: Two cards of matching rank, plus one other card. For matching pairs, the one with the highest 3rd card wins. Example: 6,6,5 beats 6,6,3 or 4,4,7 and any high card hand.<br/>High Card Hand: A hand without a straight and no pairs. Example: 7,4,3 beats 6,5,2.<br/><br/>TIES<br/>If there is a tie, all players involved in the tied battle discard the played cards and take the number of cards they played from the draw pile instead of drawing up to five cards. No treasure is taken in a tied battle.<br/><br/>CAPTURING TREASURE<br/>At the end of battle, the winning player captures Treasure from the losing player(s) as follows:<br/> Three to Five Player Game: The winner may now take either one card from the losing player&rsquo;s played cards or the lowest value treasure from the losing player&rsquo;s captured treasure. If there are multiple lowest value cards, the winner chooses whichever of these they want.<br/> Two Player Game: The winner takes one of the loser&rsquo;s played cards - they cannot take captured treasure.<br/><br/>AFTER A BATTLE<br/>Once battle is resolved, all uncaptured cards that were played are put into a discard pile, which we call the Litter Box. Then,  all players who participated who have fewer than five cards left, draw new cards until they have a total of five in their hand.<br/> All captured cards are placed face up in front of the player who captured them, so that their treasure value and suit are visible to all. Additionally, if a player forfeited (see below), they draw an extra card now. If a battle ended in a tie, then each of the players in the battle (primary and helper) draw the number of cards they played (three or one).<br/><br/>HELPING<br/>Once a battle has been announced, but before the first card is played, each player involved in the battle may ask for help. If Player B agrees to help Player A, then Player B will play a single card at the end of the battle, after Player A has played their three cards. In a four or five person game, each side in a battle may ask for and receive help. If both sides have a helper, then each helper reveals their card simultaneously after the two main combatants have shown all three cards.<br/><br/>After all cards are played, each side makes their best three card hand out of the four cards available.<br/><br/>Taking treasure: In a helper battle, two cards are taken from the loser. The main combatant on the winning side chooses one card from the played cards (all four cards, if the losing side had a helper) and one card from the main losing combatant&rsquo;s captured treasure. If the main combatant on the losing side has no captured treasure, then the winning side takes two cards from the cards played. Once they&rsquo;ve taken treasure, the winner can choose to give one of those cards to the player who helped them.<br/> Example: Kim announces she will battle Josh. Josh and Kim both ask for help. Mike agrees to help Kim, and Vivian agrees to help Josh. Kim and Josh then simultaneously reveal three cards from their hand in sequence. Mike and Vivian then both reveal a card from their hand. Kim&rsquo;s side ends up with 5,5,5,7 and Josh&rsquo;s side ends with 4,5,6,7. Kim&rsquo;s side wins, because she has three 5&rsquo;s which beats Josh&rsquo;s hand of 5,6,7.<br/> Kim then takes one card from Josh&rsquo;s captured treasure, and one of the four cards played (one of the 4,5, 6 or 7).  Although she could add both cards to her own treasure, she gives Mike one of the two as a reward for helping her.<br/><br/>FORFEITING<br/>Either of the main combatants in a battle may forfeit after playing their first or second card. Players who are receiving help can forfeit as well, but even if they do, the helper must play a card. Cards played by the forfeiting player or their helper are subject to being taken by the winner, just as in any other battle.<br/> If a player forfeits, they are allowed to take an additional card from the Draw Pile after the battle. If they are left with fewer than five cards at the end of battle, they first draw until they have five cards then take their additional card. Helpers on the forfeiting side may not take an additional card. They only take new cards if they have less than five in their hand at the end of battle.<br/><br/>DOGFIGHTS<br/>If at any point during play a player draws a Dog card from the deck, they immediately place it face up in the center of the table and a Dogfight commences. (Before the Dogfight, the player who drew the Dog draws a new card and any other players who were in mid-draw should finish drawing.)<br/> Players must play at least one card in the Dogfight, but they may forfeit after playing their first or second card. The winner of the Dogfight takes the Dog card and places it face up in front of them in their captured treasure. As in normal battle, all players select a card and hold it face down over the table, then reveal their cards at once. Unlike a normal battle, players may not ask for help.<br/> The Dogfight ends when either a) all players but one have forfeited, or b) all players who are still in the Dogfight have played three cards. In the case of Ties, the Dog is discarded, and all players who played three cards take three cards from the draw pile.<br/> As with normal battle, any players who forfeit the Dogfight battle draw an extra card at the end of the battle and all players who have fewer than five cards draw until they have five.<br/><br/>REACHING THE END OF THE DECK<br/>Two Players: At the end of the first deck, there will be a single Dogfight (the bottom card is always a Dog) and then the game is over.<br/> Three to Five Players: At the end of the first deck, after the Dogfight, take all the discarded cards from the Litter Box and reshuffle them. Then add the last three Dogs to this deck, each card roughly ⅓ of the way through the deck with the last Dog on the bottom of the deck. When you reach the end of the second deck there will be one final Dogfight and then the game is over.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>Two players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the first deck.<br/>Three to Five players: The game ends after the Dogfight at the end of the second deck.<br/> Note: If any player has fewer than five cards or needs to draw cards due to a previous battle, then shuffle the discards from the Litter Box and draw cards before the final Dogfight.<br/><br/>DETERMINING A WINNER<br/>At the end of the game, each player adds up the treasure value of all cards in their captured treasure (the ones face up in front of them) and adds any Suit Bonuses (as described below). The player with the highest total wins! They should be patted on the head and given a treat.<br/><br/>SUIT BONUSES<br/>A player who has four or more treasure cards of the same suit receives a 10 point bonus at the end of the game. Players receive this bonus once per suit of which they have four or more cards.<br/> Example: If a player has four captured Samurai kittens, they get 10 bonus points. If they have eight captured Samurai, they still get just 10 bonus points. However, if they have four captured Samurai and four captured Mechs, they get a 20 point bonus (10 for each suit).<br/> If two or more players tie for the the highest treasure score, the tied players play a three-card hand after first drawing to make sure have at least five cards in their hands. The player with the best hand is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The Standard Game is provided for a quick way of resolving large scale combats between two opposing forces in a minimum amount of time. The Standard Game doesn't require a Gamemaster or Referee; instead, the rules provide a set of guidelines that make a GM unnecessary for resolving movement and combat. The Standard Game is an abstracted method for simulating large scale battles without a GM. In that sense, it is more like a military simulation board game than a role playing game.&quot;<br/><br/>War Law covers morale rules, maneuver rules, ferocity rules, leaders, formations, siege weapons, and historical and tactical considerations. The scale is 50-100 combatants per unit. Each unit has an Offensive Bonus, a Defensive Bonus, an Armor Type, a level, and a shield bonus. In addition, units also have a movement point total and a morale rating. Combat is resolved using percentile dice and an extensive collections of charts. Counters and hexmaps (5/8&quot; hex = 100ft.) are provided, but miniatures can also be used. The turn length is 120 seconds per turn.<br/><br/>",

It can be played by two or more and includes a total of 164 different cards in three different rarities. Tank Commander is very simple to learn yet not simplistic to play. The Eastern Front Edition includes over 80 different tank models!<br/><br/>The game is sold in Playing decks of 60 cards each. One Display Box contains 12 Tank Commander Playing Decks.<br/><br/>The game is a simple tactical level card game of warfare with each card representing an individual tank, squad, gun and gun team, etc.  There are terrain cards representing all forms of terrain that can be used to build custom scenarios.  Also in the mix are special cards like minefields, Panzerfausts, Flank Shots, Snipers, Mine Dogs, Artillery barrages and counter barrages, air strikes, etc.  Even though this is a CCG, it plays well with a few starter decks.  Deck building is point based with a value assigned to each card so it's not necessarily to one's advantage to have a bunch of high value cards.  Also, the rarity mix in the set was supposedly based on the availability of the actual equipment in WWII on the East Front.  There are plenty of good common and uncommon cards that are best used to build a deck.<br/><br/>A player's guide is also available with comprehensive rules, errata, advanced rules, optional rules, card lists and more scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thrown is a trick-taking game with a new way to play into a trick, namely by using dice! The colors of the dice represent the suits. The lead player rolls 1-3 dice of a color (the suit), then the other players try to roll in-suit to get the highest value on the table. If you do not have the right suit, then you can roll for trump; rolling a natural 6 on one of your dice in an off-suit will beat the highest value in-suit.<br/><br/>Winning a trick gives you gold. The game ends following a number of rounds played equal to the number of players, at which time whoever has the most gold wins.<br/><br/>But wait, there are cards in the game, too! These cards give special abilities which are paid for, or activated with, dice of particular colors. Some of the effects include flipping your dice or an opponent's dice to their opposite sides, removing dice, re-rolling dice, and automatically winning with a particular roll!<br/><br/>",

The player who causes the Tower to collapse is out of the game.<br/><br/>The tower is a series of layers of plastic balls, separated by ring plates. The tower is protected by a clear plastic cylinder with an indicator built into the top to show when the tower has been placed on a level surface. The protecting cylinder is removed and the whole thing becomes distinctly unstable. The centre of the tower is hollow and sticks provided are used to tap balls from the tower ring into the centre well, where they fall to the bottom and roll out of an aperture in the base.<br/><br/>Roll the dice to see what color ball you have to knock out, and from what level. Using the cue stick, carefully try to remove it - but watch out! The player who makes the WobBally tower collapse is out of the game! Dramatic sways and increasing instability keeps the suspense and action growing. The winner is the last player left after all the other players have made the balls spill.<br/><br/>The rules give 3 ways to play. Can be played solitaire.<br/><br/>",

The &quot;mortal powers&quot; of Armenia automatically pursue the magicians whose major defense is their ability to conjure fearsome demons.<br/><br/>(paraphrased from the Historical Notes section of the instruction manual)<br/><br/>The basic story of the key of Solomon holds that when Solomon was building the first temple in Jerusalem, one of his workers was seized by an evil spirit.  The archangel Michael appeared and delivered to Solomon a magical ring which gave him the power to command all spirits.  Solomon commanded the spirits into a brass vessel, which he sealed and cast into a lake in Babylonia.  Solomon had foreseen the possibility of the demons being released again and had prepared a testament detailing the various rituals and instruments that could be prepared by any person to command the spirits once more.  This power was to have been used for curing disease and preventing harm, but when printed examples appeared again in the 17th century the emphasis had switched to the finding of treasure and personal gain by the magician instead.<br/><br/>",

Each Muse that you encounter will gain you inspiration points and assistance in encountering her sisters. You may also call upon hints gleaned from the works of classical authors.<br/><br/>It is a very quick, solitaire dice and card game. It is comprised of nine cards and three tokens and requires two standard D6s. There is no setup required and you can play through a full game in under five minutes. There is a significant element of luck in the game but players must make the right tactical choices to capitalise on that luck.<br/><br/>Each of the nine cards represents one of the Muses. On the card is a point value and - in most cases - a dice manipulation power, to be gained by encountering that Muse. Around the edge of the cards are between one and four conditions that you must meet on the two dice in order to encounter that Muse. Each turn the player draws a new card, turns any unclaimed cards 90 degrees clockwise and rolls the two dice. Using any powers they have acquired, the player then tries to claim (encounter) one of the active cards by matching the condition currently showing at the top of the card. Cards which are not encountered before they run out of claim conditions are discarded.<br/><br/><br/>        Update.

        "description": "This game is the first of a series of games which uses a dreidel in lieu of a d4. Like the traditional game Dreidel, it is themed for the Jewish holiday of Chanuka. Each move taken and cards added to or taken from a common pool for any spin are related to the traditional dreidel game. Movement can be modified by use of cards. That movement is round the six points of a star or magen David, and an action is associated with each space on the board.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to fill the eight slots of a menorah with candles. Certain actions can gain a player one or more candles. One can even try to take candles from another player, but if the attempt fails, one may lose candles to the player targeted instead.<br/><br/>",

The poker-chip sized pieces, embossed with scorpions, also stack neatly onto the impressively designed and attractive playing surface.<br/><br/>The race starts with players entering their pieces onto the yellow track. After 18 spaces, when the end of the initial S has been reached, players double-back on themselves, taking the black track to return home. The twist lies in <br/>that a scorpion may &quot;sting&quot; another, not just by landing on the same space, but also by landing on an adjacent space on the other coloured track. This enables a player to hinder opponents or to boost his own position by switching scorpions onto the other track.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rather minimalist rules supplied do not cover every gameplay eventuality. In particular, the knock-on effect that occurs frequently on a congested board, where a &quot;stung&quot; scorpion may inadvertently sting another is not explained in a satisfactory manner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fantasy Flight Games is proud to announce our newest card game, Penny Arcade! Set in the world of your favorite web-comic, Penny Arcade puts you in the middle of the epic battles between Tycho and Gabe. Unleash attacks at your rival, such as Mein Leapen or the (Cardboard) Tube Strike. Put your Hijinks to good use, employing your beard-growing abilities with Oneupsmanship or the powers of Skullduggery. Collect Stuff, and acquire the Rare Card or your ally in the tub Sir Quacks-a-lot. Hidden in each deck is also the awe-inspiring powers of the Watch, and it is sure to trade hands quite often as abuse is heaped on the head of whoever holds it.<br/><br/>Each deck features the feel of the characters. Gabe&rsquo;s sees him hiding behind the couch and using his apathy as the ultimate defense. Tycho summons forth his Vast Intellect to overwhelm the boy wonder, and loves nothing more than the feel of a natural 20 with Critical Strike.<br/><br/>Designed by James Hata, Penny Arcade is a brand new experience. Each turn, you will have to employ your strength and intelligence to best effect to smash the face of your foe. Tycho, being the smarter of the two, can bring to bear many different Hijinks to ensure his victory. Using combinations of Attacks and Hijinks, Tycho can set up the perfect Really Big Word Attack. While not the brainy side of things, Gabe can serve up heaping helpings of pain with his brute strength.<br/><br/>For fans and newcomers alike, Penny Arcade is a fun, fast-paced card game for two players. Though only one can walk away the victor, both sides will be itching for another go.<br/><br/>Penny Arcade is a card game for two players featuring the characters from the hit web comic of the same name. Gabe and Tycho employ various attacks, hijinks, and stuff they have acquired over the years to assist them in beating down their rival. Playable in less than 30 minutes, Penny Arcade is easy to learn and impossible to master.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One of the American Heritage Command Decision Strategy Games.<br/><br/>This one is the American Civil War game.  Each side has 22 pieces (10 infantry, 10 cavalry and 2 artillery), and the starting positions are fixed.  The grid is square, with no diagonal movement allowed.  On your turn, you roll two dice for movement, resulting in between 2 and 12 movement points to allocate.  Infantry moves 1 per pip, cavalry and artillery 2 per pip (a one-square move still consumes 1 pip).  Mountains force pieces to pause (they must stop until the next turn).  Railroads link stations and can be used to accelerate movement (one station per pip).<br/><br/>Combat is handled by lining pieces up (horizontally or vertically) to face (or flank) an enemy column.  You must have battle strength superiority to resolve the battle, and this is done after movement is concluded.  Infantry and artillery have combat strength 2, cavalry has combat strength 1.  The rear piece then jumps to the other end of the combined columns, and the entire enemy army is removed.  To be used, cavalry must have a piece at the front; artillery, if at the rear of your column, eliminates the enemy army without jumping.  Artillery cannot attack by itself.  Double jumps can happen, if the jumping infantry piece ends up facing a lone cavalry.  An open square must exist to jump to, so some map deployments are &quot;safe&quot; --but not against artillery.  However, pieces trapped so they cannot move are also removed as if they had lost a battle, so this strategy can backfire.<br/><br/>You win by completely eliminating the enemy army --but a player may concede earlier when a loss becomes unavoidable.  The four player game splits command of each army in two, and is played in partnerships.<br/><br/>A really good game, combining a historical theme with rather abstract mechanics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Presidential is a game of strategy played with dice and chance cards on a beautifully designed map of the U.S. showing the Electoral College votes of each state.  Two teams, Democrats and Republicans, fight for control of state delegations to ultimately win more than 270 electoral votes.  The Presidential is an entertaining and educational family game -- fun for both students (13+) and adults.  You may not know how the Electoral College works, but you'll enjoy the excitement of playing for the most powerful job in the world!<br/><br/>The Play of the Game<br/><br/>The 2 teams decide which side will be the Republicans and which side will be the Democrats.  The Republicans take the 150 red votes (chips) and the 3 red dice.  The Democrats take the 150 blue votes (chips) and the 3 blue dice. The teams then decide how much time there is until election day by selecting a number of weeks until the election.  One each turn, each team must decide whether they will go Fundraising or Campaigning.<br/><br/>Fundraising<br/>There are 4 states where a candidate can fund raise (California, New York, Florida and Texas).  The team decides which state they would like to fund raise in and then rolls 2 dice.<br/><br/>If a team rolls a 9, they have 9 votes to distribute.  At least 1/2 the votes must stay in the fundraising state.<br/><br/>The team then draws a Politics Card, follows the instructions, and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.  The Politics Cards offer many rewards and a few penalties to the teams.  They are similar to rolling another die.<br/><br/>Politics Cards<br/>Here are a few examples of the Politics Cards:<br/><br/>     Silicon Valley tycoons host a successful fundraiser for you. Add 6 votes to California.<br/>     You receive a 100% approval rating from the NRA.  Win 5 votes in Texas.<br/>     A popular blogger unveils pictures of your opponent&rsquo;s wife buying a brand new Bentley.  Add 3 votes to Michigan.<br/>     You are spotted wearing a Red Sox hat while prepping for a debate.  Your opponent adds 3 votes to New York.<br/><br/><br/>Campaigning<br/>If a team chooses to campaign, the team selects and announces the 3 states they will campaign in on that turn.  Each state may only be visited once each turn.  The team then rolls 3 dice.  The team then decides which die corresponds to each state and contributes those votes to that state.<br/><br/>Votes<br/>Each chip equals 1 vote.   Votes are gained through the roll of the dice and the Politics Cards.  At any one time, each state is Republican (Red), Democrat (Blue) or neutral.   The votes in a state represent the net amount of chips that have been allocated by both parties.<br/><br/>End of the Game <br/>When time is up (the number of weeks that was selected have passed), there may be several states that are undecided (still neutral) either because they are in a tie or no team has campaigned in them or allocated them fund raising money.  At that point, a neutral state is selected and each team rolls a die.  The highest die wins the state and the electoral votes go to that team.  If there is a tie roll, the teams roll again.  The team with the highest number of electoral votes after all the neutral states have been awarded to either team wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game lasts 8 rounds.  Everyone starts with a hand of 9 Teamwork cards (1-9) and each turn plays one card that will indicate how much effort you are going to put into the project, and consequently what order you will get to choose the research cards on offer.  Teamwork cards are chosen and revealed simultaneously.  If both team members play the same card they automatically lose ! Then Teammates add up their total teamwork effort for the Team Total, and the Team with the highest Total chooses first with the player in that team who played the highest card taking the pick and keeping it for himself.  Then the lowest card player in the losing team goes next.  So if you care about the cards on offer you either want to persuade your partner to play high (and play higher than him) or persuade him to go low (and go lower than him) but never risk playing the same card as him.<br/><br/>At it's best G.Nome is for 4 players with each game having a change of partners and the highest cumulative score winning overall.<br/><br/>",

However no-one survives in the desert alone - each camel must always be adjacent to at least one other camel.<br/><br/>The game board depicts a desert with a starting area in one corner and a finish area in the opposite corner. There are two oasis spaces in the middle of the desert and a gorge which approximately splits the desert in two.<br/><br/>After the initial placement of the pieces in the starting area, each player rolls all six of the dice, and moves whichever camels they want - restricted by the rule that a camel may never be by itself, but must have at least another camel in one of the 4 adjacent spaces (diagonal spaces do not count). The die roll determines how a camel may move: A 1 allows one space of diagonal or horizontal movement; a 2,3,or 4 allows the camel to move in a straight line (but not diagonally) that many spaces - it may also jump over any intervening camels; a 5 or 6 allows the camel to move that number of spaces and allows one right angle turn in the move - it may also jump over any intervening pieces.<br/><br/>Being the first person to move a camel onto an oasis earns the player bonus points, and also being the first person to move a camel past the gorge likewise earns a player bonus points. These bonus points are added to the points earned by your camel's finishing position (ie 8 points to the first camel to get to the finish line, 6 for the second camel and 4 for the third).<br/><br/>The person with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

In order to use the broom, the players will have to discover and remember which side of their figure is attracted to it.<br/><br/>The first witch to reach the top of the tower wins.<br/><br/>",

You place the stalwart private detectives and quick-thinking girl Fridays who've stumbled onto the Cult's plans, and it's your job to find and sanctify enough ritual sites to prevent the avatar's arrival. For good or ill, you're already a bit unstable from years of mythos-busting and not above using the Cults' relics yourself. You can resist the objects' siren call long enough to save the world...can't you?<br/> Designed for 2-6 players, Cthulhu!!!: Hastur La Vista, Baby! features an ever-changing map of downtown Kingsport, a 1920s Lovecraft Country city besieged by deranged cultists, frightening creatures from beyond the stars, and an endless supply of mythos mayhem. Players take turns placing map tiles, fighting Hastur's minions, collecting relics of power and striving to save the world from imminent destruction. Every game is different, and the strategy evolves with every new tile that hits the table.<br/><br/>",

The player to the left of the dealer plays the first card and the others, in turn, must follow suit of they can. The highest card wins the trick and advances one&rsquo;s pawn down the track. The color of the card on which the lead pawn rests is always trump. No players may share the same space.

Pitting Brawn, Speed, and Wits against one another as you chase mayhem around the city-grid.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a small box 'filler' game.<br/><br/>The game starts by randomly dividing the 18 cards, of which there are 9 green villain cards and 9 white hero cards.  Whichever color you get a majority of will determine which Super you are.  (You play cards of both colors, and you always know exactly which cards your nemesis has remaining in hand)<br/><br/>The Board is a 6x6 grid and each round the dice are used to find a space on it where 'Mayhem' happens.  Players move and play a card face down after the first die roll (before the exact location of Mayhem is known), and then move again after the second die roll.<br/><br/>Players can end in 3 configurations- Sharing a space, one player at the mayhem, or neither player at the mayhem.  Each configuration results in 1 of 3 showdowns (Brawn, Speed, and Wits, respectively) where cards resolve differently.<br/>-Sometimes the high card wins, sometimes a Decoy wins, and sometimes cards of the same color are lost.<br/><br/>Victorious cards are set by one side of the board, and defeated cards are set by another.  Win when there are 5 victory cards of your color, or 5 defeated cards of your nemesis' color.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to anticipate what your opponent will do, and to trick him into thinking he knows what you're up to.<br/><br/>",

If a faction has acquired sufficient power, represented by the number of its feudal holdings, it can &lsquo;do homage&rsquo; to the relevant sovereign and call on either the royal army of France or of Catalonia to intervene. In fact to achieve victory it must achieve this eminence as well as capture an enemy capital.<br/><br/>In a four-player game it is possible, suitable candidates being available, for a faction to ally with another by marriage and aim for a joint victory, unless Death do them part, albeit with more onerous conditions. The rules are modified slightly for two- and three-player games.<br/><br/>Caveat: This is a French-language production and there is some text on the event cards.<br/><br/>",

The playing tiles have the card symbols, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds, Spades, printed on them and have to be laid on their appropriate spaces on the board.<br/>Skill, concentration and a bit of luck, too are decisive!<br/><br/>The 32 tiles are laid on the appropriate spaces on the board. There is room for two identical tiles on each space. Each space has a different score value but the tiles placed only score when they are joined by neighbouring tiles. The last tile placed is not counted for the score. The aim of the players is to place their tiles so that they connect to other tiles of high value. The points scored are marked with the score markers. The player with the highest score wins.&quot;<br/><br/>Cartino was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.<br/><br/>",

So they've decided to take matters into their own hands and rob a speeding train full of Brains. They'll bring home the best Brain they can find, and then pass that around instead. Hey, no-one said it was a good plan.<br/><br/>This is the fourth game in the Friedey's series, and the first Cheapass board game to come in a sturdy cardboard box. The &quot;board&quot; is composed of eight double-sided Train Cars, and the Train grows and shrinks throughout the game. New cars appear in the front as players move forward, and old cars fall off the back, well, sort of randomly. To win the game, you need to find the Brain with the highest IQ before the Train comes to a stop, and defend it from all the other Zombies who'd rather beat you up than find a better Brain on their own. A splendid and imaginative adventure for 3-7 players, illustrated as always by lovable Zombie artist Brian Snoddy.<br/><br/>",

On the room boards there are 5 empty spaces for the &quot;Hideouts&quot;.<br/>Players receive randomly 5 hideout counters each and place them &ldquo;covered&rdquo; in front of them.<br/>Finally all kittens are placed in the garden which is in the center of the table.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get rid of all the hideout counters before your opponents. Each counter should be placed on its appropriate slot, according to the shape and color of the room.<br/>How to do it? Each turn a player move his own cat (the one corresponding to the color of his room&rsquo;s frame) and according to the his counters he chooses the room where hiding the cat. If he chooses his own room then he can place the cat on any slot of his choice. But if he chooses to move his cat to a room controlled by an opponent, it&rsquo;s up to the owner to choose where to place it.<br/><br/>When your cat is placed on a slot that corresponds to one of your hideout counters (according to the shape and color of the room), discover it and place it on the corresponding position; but remember, each room cannot host more than one cat because they are not willing to share a territory. If you place your cat on a board occupied by another cat, the brawl starts.<br/><br/>After this phase starts the &ldquo;Housekeeper moment&ldquo;.<br/>The current player rolls a die. All players compete to grab the matching colored kitten, wherever it is. The fastest hand moves the caught kitten to the garden and pass one of his remained counters, of his choice, to the player with less counters. If there are 2 or more opponents with the same number of counters left, he can choose the target. However he can never pass his last counter, which must necessarily be placed on the appropriate slot.<br/><br/>The first player that remains with no hideout counters is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is still basically the same (collect a full set), but you can either collect figures or colors.  In addition, each hand is played with a variable time limit, as the dealer gets to play either a quick hand (he thinks he can get the Remmi quickly), or a longer hand.  Either way, the first set (Remmi) gets the most points, with those that follow getting less or none.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Zogen, a.k.a. ゾーゲン, the player researchers want to rid themselves of their microorganism cards as quickly as they can, but they can do so only by observing the current lab environment and watching the one thing that changes, then &quot;recording&quot; it by playing their card.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player starts with a hand of sixteen cards, with each card showing 0-4 types of microorganisms, which are named &quot;Maru&quot;, &quot;Tsuki&quot;, &quot;Yama&quot;, and &quot;Siri&quot;. The start player for the round places one of their cards face up on the table, then everyone plays at once, trying to lay down a card that differs from the initial card by exactly one microorganism, whether one more or one less.<br/><br/>Thus, if a card shows &quot;Maru&quot; and &quot;Tsuki&quot;, you can lay down a card that shows either &quot;Maru&quot; or &quot;Tsuki&quot; or a card that shows &quot;Maru&quot; and &quot;Tsuki&quot; along with one of the previously missing microorganisms. You must say the name of the microorganism that is added or removed when you play a card, then everyone must match the card that you just played.<br/><br/>When a player has only three cards in hand, the round ends and players score points based on their rank in terms of how many cards they hold. Whoever has the most points after you've played the agreed-upon number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

All you need to do is shine a ray of sunlight at their eyes, and the beasts turn to stone immediately! It's up to you and a handful of other troll hunters to use your magical lanterns and mirrors with such cunning that you can outwit a troll &mdash; which is not saying much really, but that won't stop the celebrations that shall take place to glorify the greatest troll hunter!<br/><br/>In Troll Hunt, the players try to guide rays of light from their lanterns into the trolls' eyes by placing and moving reflecting mirrors around the board. At the end of the game the hunter who has managed to turn the most trolls to stone wins. To put shortly, it is a tactical tile placement &amp; movement game with grizzly trolls.<br/><br/>Troll Hunt includes a modular game board depicting the countryside with meadows, lakes, mountains and troll keeps. Because you construct the board before every game, no two games are the same! The trolls don't even have the decency of showing up in a predictable order.

When someone plays this Otto card, the next player must play either a card featuring Luigi or a special card; if this next player can't play, whoever played the last card is given a chance to score a goal by taking the top card of the action deck.<br/><br/>",

Each takes up the role of one of the economy's pillars: President of the Republic, Chief Banker, Corporate Director and Energy Tycoon. Each pillar, or Actor, has an associated score, that represents its economic interests. There's a fifth Actor called Social Stability, non playable, that represents the interests of the People.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to be the 1st to raise his/her score to 10, winning the game. To reach this goal, they will have to submit and vote Actions that will influence the economy, and thus their scores. But beware! If the score of Social Stability falls to 0 there will be a Revolution, and the player with the lower score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Dealer (first to draw and discard) rotates clockwise.  Only cards of the same suit (see variation) count toward your point total. Players take turns to draw the top card from either the stock or the discards, then discard a card. In replacement for drawing and discarding, any player can &ldquo;knock&rdquo;, signifying that each player then has one more turn to draw and discard.  When the turn returns to the &ldquo;knocker&rdquo;, then all players lay down their cards and announce their total.  The lowest score discards a token/coin.  In the event of a tie for lowest score, all lowest scoring tied players discard a token/coin.  At any time, if a player collects 31 points (A, and two face cards or ten), then they immediately lay down their cards and announce &ldquo;blitz&rdquo; or &ldquo;31&rdquo;, and all other players discard a token/coin.  If a player runs out of tokens/coins, then they are out of the game.

The object is to win by playing runs of 3 or more, 3 or 4 of a kind, or melds (or watching players having to meld) to your tableau (the winner's tableau must be the amount of the initial hand + 1 more card) and running out of cards in your hand.<br/><br/>The active player may use the the obligatory drawn card to lay down a run  or 3+ of a kind. Your tableau may be arranged in to different melds or runs to accommodate new arrangements. When a set or multiple sets are laid a card must be discarded. If a card is passed, then next player clockwise and likewise is able to utilize the card. If during the same turn someone utilizes the discards (thus laying down sets and ending with another discard) then the process repeats.

Board resembles a chess board, it's a 9x9 grid where players must move their pieces from one end to the other. Each piece can move horizontally or vertically as many spaces as the player wishes, but there are few complications: the guards. Each row has a guard. Whenever a piece moves to a row, the guard on that row moves as many spaces towards the piece as the piece moved (if you move three rows up, the guard on that row moves three spaces towards you). If the guard catches you, the move is illegal. Of course, it's legal to make the guards catch other players' pieces... The first player to have three of their four pieces escape wins.<br/><br/>Alcatraz is fun, quick game and a nice brain-teaser, especially with more than two players when the board gets quite crowded.<br/><br/>",

The title comes from two words, ichigo (&quot;strawberry&quot; in Japanese) and gorilla, put together. Ichi means &quot;one&quot; and go means &quot;five&quot; in Japanese, and that implies that two of the tiles (the strawberry and the gorilla) require one and five tiles to be flipped.<br/><br/>On your turn, you simply flip tiles until you flip the required number of tiles, or hit wrong tiles.

Rules include airborne/sea landings, fire combat (long distance combat between armoured units), air force, engineers, special units etc. <br/>Another distinctive feature of this system is the way of determining strength of unit. Each unit has a chart with its strength; when unit suffers loses, player has to mark it on chart.<br/>Classical activation system (&quot;I go, you go&quot;) and simplified command rules drives the game.<br/><br/>The game contains fiction map and scenarios but historical units (German, American, Polish and British).<br/><br/>Bitwy II wojny światowej (B-35) debuted in 1993 in the 3rd issue of the Magia i Miecz magazine. Some small boards and counters, along with rules were published there in the Klan Miłośnik&oacute;w Gier Strategicznych part of the magazine. Later system moved to the Strategia i Taktyka and Dragon magazines. Dragoncompany published first boxed edition of the system along with some other games using it (Szczury Pustyni, Kaserine 1943). Rules evolved and were published in the Dragon Hobby magazine in the 90's. In the same time additional rules for the Pacific War Theatre, along with the new boards, were published in the Dragon Hobby magazine as well.<br/><br/>After the end of the Dragon company, Taktyka i Strategia company took care of the system, publishing new editions (currently 4th), with new boards, scenarios and the games.

Certain cards have special possibilities (a King or an Ace may be played to get a new pawn into play, while a four moves you back instead of forward). A few spaces on the board have special properties as well, requiring certain cards to be played to enter or leave them. If more than two players are playing, they play in teams, devils vs. angels.

The game play is similar too: a player can exchange cards for warriors, distribute his warriors between his territories and then attack one or more adjacent territories.<br/><br/>The novelties are: you receive a certain number of coins at the start of your turn depending on the number of temples and mount olympus that you have; if you attack with a mythological creature, you must roll 3 d6 and 1 d8 and discard the smallest result; you can ask a favor for the gods; for example, you can pay a coin to Hades and he will revive up to 3 of your deceased warriors.<br/><br/>",

First Panzer Army had been cut-off by a total of nine Soviet armies. Its breakout began on March 25, 1944, and continued into early April. In these two weeks, the Germans continuously conducted a mobile defense as their pocket drove westward in an effort to meet a relief force (which was spearheaded by the II SS Panzer Corps) attacking eastward. Supplied by air much of the time, First Panzer Army deceived the Soviet forces by moving west, instead of south as the Soviet generals had anticipated. The pocket crossed several swollen rivers, and struggled through thick mud and deep snow, yet somehow remained intact. Unlike the Korsun Pocket disaster the month before, this time the Germans avoided yet another debacle. The commander of the First Panzer Army, Generaloberst Hans Hube, through his skillful leadership, proved to be a master of mobile defensive warfare.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn One day turns<br/>Hex: 5.5Km<br/>Units: Battalions to Divisions<br/><br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability - Medium<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>One Full color 22&quot;x34&quot; map<br/>Two Counter sheets (360 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24 page rulebook<br/>Two Air Sector Charts<br/>One six-sided die<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Viewpoint in a non-collectible card game produced by the Australian game design company 93 Made Games.  The game contents consist of a deck of 70 cards, each illustrated in a &lsquo;70s/&lsquo;80s retro art style, and a rule sheet, attractively packaged in a small black cardboard box.  Most of what you need to know is printed on the cards themselves and makes picking up and getting into the game very easy.  The use of icons on the cards, representing different aspects of the game (e.g. the discard pile, the play area and your hand of cards), makes the game even easier to understand.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2 to 6 players of ages 7 and up.  Games can take as little as 5 minutes or as long as 30 minutes to play - depending on the experience of players and the number of players in each game.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the first player with 100 points down on the table, which isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds.  Players have cards that can steal cards you have tabled or send them to the discard pile.  So you need to be able to judge the best time to put cards on the table and how to defend your cards once they are down.<br/><br/>Game-play is highly interactive and the base rules are simple to follow to make it accessible to casual and non-gamers as well as dedicated gamers.  At the start of play, each person is dealt a hand of five cards.  These cards each have values clearly printed on them, ranging from negative amounts to a maximum of 20 points.  They also have actions printed on them, along with a graphic (which features some pun on vision such as &lsquo;wink&rsquo; or &lsquo;blind spot&rsquo;).  The action associated with an individual card is usually executed as you attempt to put the card face up into your play area (known as your Field of View).  There are a few cards (such as Spectacles) that allow you to play the card as a reaction to other players trying to affect your cards.<br/><br/>While your first few games of Viewpoint might not appear to involve a high degree of skill for winning, you will soon discover that you need to be much more strategic about how and when you play your cards, as well as keeping a careful eye on what people have got down on the table.  Simply placing cards into your Field of View won&rsquo;t win you the game, as other players will start targeting you as you hit a score of around 80+. You need think &lsquo;out of the box&rsquo; and bluff your opponents, by sitting on a &lsquo;non-threatening&rsquo; score, while searching for cards that will let you steal cards or take multiple turns, allowing you to suddenly win the game by coming from behind.<br/><br/>The design of the game system provides an entertaining and interactive experience encouraging replayability.  The games system also provides the opportunity to release future expansion packs of cards to add to the mischief already present in the base deck.<br/><br/>",

Then he'll use any one of the two remaining until they suffer the same fate, upon which he'll use his last character.<br/>The turn is divised in 4 segments. All player undertake a segment before any begins the following segment.<br/><br/>The 4 segments are:<br/>- &quot;D&eacute;pensez vos butins&quot; (expense your loot) where you can buy some of the &quot;big&quot; weapons cards and add them to your hand (the small ones are ALWAYS in your hand)<br/>- &quot;Pr&eacute;parez vos esquives&quot; (prepare your dodges) where you put on your character, face up, any of the weapons you bought, up to the prestige (fame) value of your character<br/>- &quot;Attaquez&quot; (attack) where each player chooses a weapon in hand and say who he attacks (players at his side for contact weapons, other players with ranged weapons)<br/>- &quot;Videz vos querelles&quot; (end your quarrels) where attacks are resolved. An attack is dodged if the defensive player has correctly found the value of the attack coming. A succesful attack make the defensive character lose some of his HP, and the attacking character win prestige or loot.<br/><br/>In plus of the weapons card, there are other cards that players can use to affect the game.<br/><br/>If a player arrives at 5 in prestige, he can call the militia that will end the game. If a character becomes KO by losing all his Hit Points, its player takes his next character.<br/><br/>A player can come in the game, or leave, at any moment. The game is conceived for that.<br/><br/>La Taverne de la Licorne (tavern of the unicorn) is a light hearted tavern, in opposition of La Taverne de la Crypte, which is a tavern with undeads and horrors.<br/>Both games are decorated with cartoon art.<br/><br/>",

Now you and your friends make up the Revolutionary Committee, overseeing justice throughout the land. Still, now that the queen's gone, it would be a shame to let all that cake go to waste...<br/><br/>Become the first among equals by amassing honour! Become happy by amassing cake! Send your friends' pawns to the guillotine! First to forty cakes wins!<br/><br/>Let Them Eat Cake is a game of committees, coercion, and cake. Elect your friends to positions of power in the hope that they look on your patronage favorably &mdash; or denounce them as enemies of the revolution. Alliances and betrayal are all fair game as you try to amass as much cake as you can before the revolution collapses.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a set of voting cards, three pawns, three medals of honour, and some cake. Each round consists of a series of elections, from the Head of Committee to the Food Inspector. Each vote, after negotiating, bribing, and pleading, is simply a matter of each player secretly choosing a voting card of the player they wish to vote for. Each player&rsquo;s votes are multiplied by the number of pawns they have, and whoever is the Head of Committee will break any ties. Importantly, once you&rsquo;ve used a voting card, you cannot reuse it until you&rsquo;ve played all your cards, demanding shifting allegiances throughout the game.<br/><br/>The first vote of the round determines the Head of Committee, the official tie-breaker. Soon thereafter players determine the Enemy of the Revolution, who must place one of their pawns on the guillotine, immediately and potentially permanently reducing their voting power. Next, players elect a Guillotine Operator, who decides whether or not the pawn on the guillotine is executed or spared. Once settled, a Secretary is elected to divvy out cake and generals to the players, one card per player. But before these cards are taken, the players elect a Food Inspector who may, at the cost of a medal, declare all cake unsafe.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will accumulate medals, generals, and cake. Fewest medals make you the Enemy of the Revolution, but the player with the most Generals is immune to such accusations!
