        "description": "You are an Eternal Legend, a warrior who has the ability to take on at least a hundred men and survive.  A hero who has fought many battles and come back with trophies, gold and many tales to tell.<br/><br/>Such heroes and heroines of adventure and wonder travel the land to seek their own destiny and fortune. Yet there is only one true way to gain such fame and that is on the field of battle.  Any hero can go down into a dark dungeon or save a maiden from a tower, but it takes a true hero to fight alongside fellow men and outshine every one of them.<br/><br/>Eternal Legend is a  hack and slash adventure where you play one hero or heroine who has to cleave their way through years of war in order for their name to go down in history. Every turn a card is drawn and the player can choose to fight in that war or pass it by. If they pass they begin to fade into obscurity but if they succeed the Hero gains more riches and fame.<br/><br/>As the years go on the world gets harsher, new wars are fought and less is understood. Can your hero survive all eight eras of battle or will their name go down in just a few sections of history?<br/><br/>Play one hero or compete for fame with friends as you cleave your way war by war, becoming the victor or dying a (hopefully) heroic death. The objective is to claim fame in as many wars as possible and amount the largest pile of gold and riches before your inevitable defeat.  Everyone dies someday, so why not go out in a shower of bloody but heroic glory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "60 grammar terms and their descriptions are the basis of this Bingo-type 'educational' game. Each player gets one of 40 'GRAMO' cards, a 5 by 5 grid where each square has a grammar term number and it's description. The caller randomly pulls from the stock of 60 tokens, and reads aloud the column letter (G, R, A, M, or O), a grammar term, and optionally, that term's number. If that term's description is on his or her card, a player marks that square with a translucent disk, hoping to be the first to get five in a row. Can be played in three difficulty levels:<br/><br/>1) Playing by the numbers. The caller reads the column letter, term, and term number. This makes the game no harder than Bingo with some grammar terms thrown in.<br/><br/>2) Playing by the book. The caller omits the term number, but players have access to a &quot;Epi/Gramo&quot; booklet in which they can find the terms and descriptions.<br/><br/>3) Playing for mastery. Players no longer have access to the book and have to recall from memory all terms and their description.<br/><br/>A player calls &quot;Gramo&quot; when he or she covers five squares in a row on his or her card, and once verified is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

In the game, players use two spinners to generate numbers, and have cards that track the results of the spins, depending on the game.<br/><br/>In Product Capture, players claim the product of two factors they spin. Three or more chips in a row earn points keyed to the color zones.<br/><br/>In Factor Pursuit, players compute the product of two spinners and mark any set of factors for this product on their scorecards. Be the first to fill your scorecard and win! A bonus investigation guides students in exploring the multiplication table for repeating, reflecting, and growing patterns<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Duelers is an action figure based collectible game where players amass exciting armies to battle their friends. Duelers miniatures stand two to three inches tall and represent a vast variety of genres and archetypes. Duelers are meant to be easy to pickup and play. Players can choose to play with two duelers or twenty; there is no minimum or maximum army counnt.  Like other miniatures games systems, Duelers is based on 6-sided dice to randomize combat. However, in addition to dice, Duelers utilizes &quot;combat cards&quot; to add an extra level of strategy to the game. Attack Cards can give you an extra edge in battle, and Defense Cards will cause your opponent's carefully laid plans of men (and mice) to go awry.<br/><br/>In addition to total enemy annihilation, players are vying for special game objectives in the form of Treasure Chests. Successfully defending your own chests is good, but capturing your opponent's chests is what separates the winners and the losers.  Gameplay proceeds as players alternate turns until one of three things happens. Either all of the Treasure Chests are captured, or all of a player&rsquo;s Duelers are slain, or there&rsquo;s an earthquake that shakes the pieces onto the floor.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the player will either draw a card or pick up a discarded card, then must either discard a different card, start a comic strip by laying down two of the matching color cards in front of them, or adding a card to one of their comic strips.  All discarded cards are available for pickup, not just the top card.<br/><br/>Other players cannot play on one's comic strip, each player individually builds on their own.  A player can have up to two comic strips of two cards each, but cannot start a third until one of the two has at least three cards.<br/><br/>When all of the draw pile and discarded cards have been picked up, any remaining cards in the player's hand that match one of their own strips is laid down.  The largest number of complete strips wins the game.<br/><br/>An advanced variant is to collect the comic strips in the correct order, and only those in the correct order are counted at the end of the game.  The correct order is not shown on the cards, but a solution card is included.<br/><br/>",

Six small postboxes are placed in various locations around the playing space and six sets of cards corresponding to these postboxes are then mixed together face down.  Players take one card each and when play begins they rush to deliver it to the correct box.  When one card is delivered players come back for another.  This continues until the time is up, whereupon points are scored for correctly delivered cards.  The winner is the one with the most points at the end of a prearranged number of rounds.<br/><br/>The game can also be played over a wider play area, even incorporating indoor/outdoor locations for the postboxes.<br/><br/>",

The trail can be set up inside or outside and even have trails that branch off with ones leading to dead ends.<br/><br/>To Play: The person who spun and drew the lowest number gun goes first. They spin the spinner and move their gun the number of spaces as indicated along the animal tracks. When a hunter reaches a stop or go card they follow what is printed on the card.

        "description": "This game is currently seeking publishers.<br/><br/>Goblin Factory is a cooperative tile-laying puzzle game for 1-6 players that can be played in less than ten minutes.  Players take on the role of industrious goblins.  A Challenge card drawn from the Challenge card deck determines what sort of machine the players must build.<br/><br/>Players take turns drawing two tiles from a community pile and adding one card to the machine.  The other tile is discarded.  This represents parts coming down a conveyor belt faster than can be grabbed and bolted/welded/hammered onto the machine.  Parts are added by matching color-coded shapes on the edges of the tiles.  The players must work together in this fast-paced game to beat the clock.<br/><br/>Most challenges are only three minutes long.  A single game can take less than five minutes to set up, shuffle, and play!  There are also rules and challenges for competitive play.<br/><br/>",

There are three 'suits' that the cards convert between, and three possible values. Players use pawns to perform various actions over the course of a turn, and can either work cooperatively by building card systems jointly or competitively by taking over systems. Thematically, players take the roles of members of the Society of Learned, Orderly, and Beneficent Beings, a society of aliens devoted to bringing about cosmic unity as they attempt to harmonize a planet with three species locked in warfare.<br/><br/>",

With the help of tracing paper and a pencil, kids race to become the first to find the hidden words. At the end of the round, they flip the cards over to check their answers. The more words they find, the more spaces they move on the board. There's no waiting around to join the fun, since everyone plays every round.

The progress of the game depends entirely on the skill and strategy of each player.<br/><br/>Equipment:<br/>There are thirty-two white chips used in the game. These are marked with four different shapes (square, circle, diamond, triangle) in four different colors (red, blue, yellow and green). Thus in each color set there are two chips showing squares, two showing circles, etc. The board shows a target area for each player (nine circles either red or orange, numbered 1-9) and a number of grey circles to give freedom for the chips to be moved. Each circle is joined to other circles by horizontal, vertical and diagonal lines.<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/>Each player tries to be the first to have nine chips arranged on his target area so that in the three horizontal and the three vertical lines or columns of the target area no two chips carry the same color or shape. As soon as the player has his chips arranged in this way he wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The board is double sided - one side is a ludo game with standard ludo rules, and the other side is a straightforward roll-and-move game which is a race around the board, the winner being the first to cross all the bridges.  The thing that the game is most remembered for is its Dizzy Dice character used to roll the dice.  This is a transparent red plastic cube with legs and pressing down on the top of its head causes two dice inside to bounce around.  One dice is a standard 1-6 and the other has coloured spots.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of scavengers trying to survive in a savage wasteland, filled only with road, sand and danger. Each has heard rumors that there is a paradise, and it&rsquo;s about 2000 miles away. To get there, the player will have to face many battles, and manage their resources well enough to reach their goal. 2000 Miles to Paradise is not meant to simulate real-world physics, rather it mimics the fast paced and frantic combat found in movies like Mad Max.<br/><br/>Vehicle customization and combat have been streamlined for fast play, yet allow players to be creative. Players start by selecting a vehicle type, then spend salvage points on various modifications. The players then assign bonus dice to sections of the vehicle to tune the attributes of their vehicle.<br/><br/>The game is then played in a series of duels, with each player fighting to drive 2000 miles to reach the rumored paradise. Each duel won gets the driver 200 miles closer, as well as gas, ammo and salvage to upgrade their car. If the scavenger loses a duel though, it's all over. Do you have what it takes to reach paradise?<br/><br/>",

In addition, the images have been improved and the chances of reaching the try or a conversion are more common.<br/><br/>Teams can be made up of one player, two or three and the playing time is agreed in advance. The fact of being played with an eight-sided dice has a lot of random, but since smart cards have the possibility of deciding in various game situations, it gives to the same a touch of strategy which will depend on the score and the remaining playing time.<br/><br/>",

Each player is given two each of the $500s, $100s and $50s; six of the $20s; five each of the $10s, $5s and $1s.  During the game the bank cannot go broke.  The bank sells and handles the bankruptcies of the businesses and charges for the customers.  If the bank runs out of customers, no more can be obtained until some are sold back to the bank.<br/><br/>To Win the game, a player has to be the only player not to declare personal bankruptcy.  When a player owes more money than he can raise by selling customers and bankrupting his businesses, he is out of the game.  Any bankrupt businesses a play has, goes to the persona or bank that he owes money to.  The player who receives the bankrupt businesses immediately has to pay the bankruptcy charge plus 10% for any business he wants to own.  If he does not pay the charges, the business goes back to the bank to be sold to anyone who lands on the square.  Players may trade and sell businesses between themselves.<br/><br/>",

The 52 card deck showcases some of the new cards available.<br/><br/>Rhythm Deck Contents<br/>The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck includes playing cards based around music notation as the basis for games and activities. The deck includes cards for a range of notes &ndash;quavers, crotchets, semibreves and minims; dotted crotchets and dotted semibreves; along with doublet and triplet crotchets and doublet, triplet and quadruplet quavers. It also includes the corresponding rests for quaver, crotchet, semibreve and minim.<br/><br/>The card designs differ from the earlier decks. As the cards focus upon elements of rhythm, the notes are depicted on a plain background without staff lines. This allows players to visually focus upon the individual note values rather than positioning against the staff to discern the pitch of the notes.<br/><br/>Games<br/>The MelodieXpress Rhythm Deck provides a set of cards only. The cards may be used with the games from the MelodieXpress Note Reading and Composing Music packs. &lsquo;Snap&rsquo;, &lsquo;Memory&rsquo;, &lsquo;Rows&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rhythm Lunch&rsquo; all work well with this deck &ndash; though the players focus upon matching the note duration rather than its pitch.<br/><br/>Next Steps<br/>This deck provides fans with an early look at some of the cards which will be used in the upcoming MelodieXpress Rhythm Pack. This will include a further 150+ cards which can be integrated with this Rhythm Deck, along with a 16 page game guide.<br/><br/>The MelodieXpress System<br/>MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory. This step-by-step approach allows you to learn at your own pace, while the games provide an enjoyable way to learn and consolidate your knowledge of music.<br/><br/>",

The call has gone out for a Hero to rise up and undertake a series of Quests, each designed to bring ruin to the Dark Lord&rsquo;s dark plans. Do you have what it takes to solve the Quests before Darkness consumes Dragon&rsquo;s Ridge and its inhabitants?<br/><br/>MyQuest is a solo game designed to allow you to explore a fantasy town and its surrounding wilds in an attempt to thwart the plans of the enemy - a Dark Lord and its deadly Minions. Players choose from one of six different Heroes and must undertake 3 Quests, chosen at random from a deck of 30 Quest cards. Before the game begins, one of 10 different Dark Lord cards will be selected (at random) for the player to rise up against, each with a unique power and the command over one of four different Minion types: infernal demons, unrelenting undead, savage beasts, or elemental primordials. In this way, the game will offer variety each time it is played, as the Quests, Heroes and enemies can be different.<br/><br/>Heroes must overcome terrible Misfortune cards that get in their way and will even have to face Encounter cards that provide various skill checks that they will have to master. The central mechanic for the game revolves around rolling six-sided dice and trying to get at least one 5-6 to pass the myriad of tests facing each Hero. From the spoils of their victories in battle and chance encounters, Heroes will also earn gold that can be used in town to heal wounds, remove curses, buy items of power, and sail to distant spots on the board.<br/><br/>But time is not on the player's side, for the Threat of Evil track grows as Minions reach the town square or certain cards are drawn from the Misfortune deck. Does your Hero have what it takes to battle back against the likes of Evil such as the Demon Prince, Insane Horror, Ancient Dragon, Troll King, or Lich (to name a few)? Only the brave, cunning and quick will be victorious.<br/><br/>",

Normal movement is one space, but moving 2, 3 or 4 spaces is possible via a push-your-luck element (pulling an item out of a bag, which, depending on what you draw, allows you to move more spaces or costs you some of your antivenom). A player who has no antivenom left is eliminated from the game. Event cards add another luck element.<br/><br/>Game-play (detailed description)<br/><br/>Each player gets a player token (wooden jeep) and 6 bottles of antivenom (cardboard chits). The jeeps are placed on the starting area of the board. Players try to get their jeep to the temple by moving it on the board. The board has four types of spaces: normal spaces, swamp spaces, river spaces and event spaces.<br/><br/>Normally, players move their jeep one space per turn. On each space, there can only be one jeep, and players must move their jeep. Instead of moving one space, players can choose to call upon the God of Snakes - either because they want to get on more quickly or because moving one space would take them on a space they can't stop on (because it is already occupied by another player's jeep or because it is a swamp space on which players are not allowed to stop).<br/><br/>To call upon the God of Snakes, a player has to reach into the &quot;magic bag&quot;. The bag contains 4 wooden snakes, two green ones, a blue one and a red one.<br/>If a player draws the dangerous red mamba, they are not allowed to move on and immediately use up one of their antivenom bottles. The red snake is then put back into the bag. <br/>If a player draws a blue or green snake, it means that the God of Snakes has answered their prayers. The snake is put on the next free altar space in the center of the board. The number on the altar space tells the player how many spaces they move (2, 3 or 4 spaces). When the last blue or green snake has been drawn, all snakes are returned to the bag.<br/><br/>Drawing the blue snake announces dangerous water snakes. If any player is on a river space when the blue snake is drawn (or if they would land on a river space after moving), they lose a bottle of antivenom.<br/><br/>If a player lands on an event space, they have to draw an event card. Event cards are either positive or negative: losing/gaining a bottle of antivenom, choosing a player to lose a turn, having to draw a snake from the bag, getting another turn, losing a turn, moving forwards/backwards one or more spaces.<br/><br/>If a player has lost all their antivenom, it becomes too dangerous to continue the expedition and they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>",

Based on the roll the dice are arranged into runs, a series greater then 3 consecutive numbers(that is 3,4,5,6) or sets, all numbers which are the same(that is 4,4,4). One of the 10 dice is the KEY cube which is held seperate and effects scoring the roll, loss of a turn or taking an additional turn. Based on the arrangement of the numbered sets and runs and the color matching of the KEY cube scores are tallied. Play progresses around the table allowing each player equal opportunity.

For this reason, it is not permitted to make a move that leaves the two Kings facing each other with nothing in between. Unlike Chinese Chess, the King is not restricted to a particular area of the board. So it can threaten the enemy King along any line and in any direction.<br/><br/>Chariot - a Chariot can slide any number of spaces along a line in any direction.<br/><br/>Soldier - a Soldier can move one step along a line in any non-retreating direction.

        "description": "From Zillions of Games:<br/><br/>Altairian Checkers, recently decoded from SETI transmissions, is a checkers/draughts type game played on a radial hex board with four hexes to a side. Each player starts with ten pieces called Pods arranged on opposite sides of the board. <br/> A Pod moves by orbiting a neighboring piece of either color, called the pivot. A Pod can orbit around a pivot through any number of empty spaces or through outer space (off the board) provided it comes to rest on an empty space on the board. It must land in a space adjacent to the pivot in the forward direction. A Pod cannot capture. <br/> When a Pod reaches the shaded area on the far side of the board, it promotes to a War Pod. A War Pod moves like a regular Pod, with the exception that it can land on any orbital space (i.e., forward progress is not required), and it captures any enemy piece that it orbits around. <br/> When a War Pod returns to the shaded area on its own side of the board, it promotes to a Death Pod. A Death Pod moves like a War Pod, with the added condition that it captures any enemy piece that it lands next to.<br/> Because pieces must have pivots to move, an isolated piece is frozen. The game is won by scattering the enemy fleet and leaving it with no move. A player who has no pieces or no moves at the start of a turn loses.<br/><br/>",

The game simulates the opening few days of the dramatic Egyptian assault across the Suez Canal in October, 1973. The game includes an air game system, a ground system and unique rules where command and control are critical for movement purposes. Use of SAM missiles and SAGGER AT play important roles to keep the Israeli at bay. At first, it appears as a &quot;David vs Goliath&quot; battle because of the disparity of forces. The Egyptian needs to create breaches and bridging and move quickly before the balance favors the Israeli. Time is not a friend to either side at various times in the game.<br/><br/>",

They dedicate their lives to trying to build the most magnificent Island in order to impress the mysterious and alluring &lsquo;Angels&rsquo; who are believed to offer eternal life, rebirth and all one could desire.<br/><br/>Life on the islands is hard, mining asteroids for ore to refine in hot furnaces to increase the power and prestige of their Islands. The presence of weapons is known to anger the Angels, but some Islands develop them regardless, seeking to increase mining production, for defence, or for attacking their rivals.<br/><br/>When the Angels arrive, their whims are capricious. Sometimes they merely observe, sometimes they attack. Only the most magnificent Island in the eyes of the Angels will be chosen to be visited by them.<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION<br/>A game for one to three players who must navigate through space, looking for asteroids to mine in order to obtain the ore needed to build and improve their Island. They must avoid deadly asteroid collisions and the aggression of their rivals as they await the coming of the Angels, bringing with them the promise of eternal peace and the threat of destruction. The winner has the greatest island (decided by points) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/>Each player controls an 'island' a fully self-sufficent space station.  Players must move through the asteroid dense area of space on the board, destroy asteroids and then collectthe shattered remnants.  This can then be refined to create pure ore, and the different ores can be used to create different additional sections of the island, or repair damaged ones.<br/><br/>Needless to say, eventually the islands will come into conflict with each other.<br/><br/>The game's length is determined by the appearences of the mysterious angel-ships, players do no know how long the game is going to last exactly (20-45 minutes on average) and so must judge wen to build offensive weaponry (which score negative at the end), and when to capitalise on point scoring with certain sections (such as more luxurious living quarters and armour) nearer the end of the game.<br/><br/>The angels appear throughout the game, often dealing death and destruction to the island sections.  The final angel's appearence ends the game, points are scored, and one player wins, becoming the chosen recpient of the angel's love.<br/><br/>",

This isn't easy, because Kroko can scare them away.<br/><br/>How it is played: Each player gets eight &quot;monkeys&quot; and tries to move them towards the trees. Throwing a 1-4 means moving the same number of spaces. A 5 means you have to move one of your monkeys away from start. If you throw the Kroko side of the die, you give Kroko a push, i.e. you tip the crocodile-shaped spinner in the middle of the board. When Kroko stops, his big tooth points to a specific section of the board. All the monkeys in this area are scared and run back to the start.<br/>Special spaces include Kroko spaces (player has to push Kroko), spaces where a monkey is safe, and liana spaces which allow a monkey to climb to a free space in a tree. The game ends when all tree spaces are occupied. The player who got the highest number of their monkeys to the trees wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CodyCards is a fast and light card game based on the traditional games of 31/Scat/Blitz/Ride The Bus; players compete in rounds to avoid having the lowest scoring hand of 3 cards.  It is played with a custom deck of 54 cards in 4 suits (with values ranging from 1 to 10) but can be played with a normal deck with slight modification.  A print-to-play edition exists.<br/><br/>The story of the game is that a bird named &quot;Cody&quot; is trying to steal coins from the players.  At the start of the game each player gets 3 coins.  At the end of each round one of the players will wake him up and he will then steal a coin from the weakest player at that time.  Players try to avoid having the worst hand at the time that the bird wakes up.  The game ends when all but one player have lost all of their coins.  Players have to decide when it's to there advantage to try to force the end of a round -- but trying to end the round may invoke a penalty and often results not in the end of the round but in a sneak peek at a trump card which affects scoring.<br/><br/>Basic Gameplay:<br/><br/>At the start of each round, the dealer (who rotates clockwise after every round) shuffles the deck and deals 3 cards to each player, and then shuffles 2 random cards along with the special Cody-the-Bird card and sets these aside face down as the &quot;nest&quot; pile.  The dealer then places the remaining cards face down in a draw pile, and turns the first one over face up as the discard pile. Starting with the player to the dealer's left and going clockwise, a player's turn consists of either: Taking the top face down card from the draw pile, or taking the top face up card from the discard pile, or knocking on Cody's Nest door.<br/><br/>If the player chooses to take a card, they then immediately discard one card from their hand face up on the discard pile and play proceeds clockwise (exception: once per round players may &quot;bury&quot; their discard face down). If they choose to knock on Cody's door, they take a peek at the top card in the Nest.  If it's Cody the Bird, then it is turned face up and everyone has one more round to try to get a better hand.  If it's not, the peeked at card is set aside in a special &quot;Trump&quot; pile, and the player who peeked has some advance information about how hands will be scored at the end.  There are also a few special cards that allow players to perform actions out of turn.<br/><br/>The round ends when Cody the Bird is revealed, and at that point hands are scored and the lowest scoring player loses a coin.  Hand value is based on:  The sum value of up to 3 cards of the same suit, OR having a 3-card straight of the same suit (33 points), or having 3 cards of same face value (33 points).  But having cards in a revealed trump suit will decrease the hand score.  There is also a penalty for being the player to knock on Cody's Nest and end the round.<br/><br/>Strategy:<br/><br/>While there is a lot of luck in the game, there are some real strategic elements as well.  Players must decide which cards to hold and draw that will be most likely to give them the highest scoring hand.  To do this they must consider which cards have already been discarded and they must take into account the information they reveal to other players when they discard or choose a face-up discard card.  In addition, players must decide when they have a good enough hand to take the risk of trying to end the round -- knowing that they will pay a scoring penalty for doing so.  The moment when a player &quot;Knocks on Cody's Door&quot; is typically accompanied by curses and laughter as players find out if the round is really ending, or if a Trump suit is being revealed that will help or hurt them, and make emergency plans to quickly improve their hand before the round ends.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a card with two football pitches marked on it. One is for 'Your score sheet&quot;, the other marked as 'Opponents score sheet&quot;. You keep your card secret at all times. Each pitch is divided up into 10 squares across and 6 squares down. The rows across are represented by the letters A to F. The columns down are marked 1 to 10. So every square can be chosen by giving a letter and a number A7 or C2, for example. The idea is to trace a line from Row F up to row A, without running into a T square which represents a tackle.<br/><br/>",

An action card deck enhances basic actions, and provides units with spur of the moment options.<br/><br/>The game uses counters to illustrate vital game information such as wounds, range, ammo, command, and morale. The range system is easy to use and simulates the movement of forces on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Frontline can also be played solitaire using the enemy Tactic cards. These cards give general, specific, and conditional orders to the enemy troops based on the current battlefield situation.<br/><br/>You can create battles by purchasing your starting forces, playing pre-made scenarios, or using the balanced randomized engagement rules.<br/><br/>Scheduled Components:<br/>165 Full color cards (63mm x 88mm)<br/>1 Full color counter sheet<br/>Rulebook (Full Color)<br/><br/>Complexity:<br/>Low to Moderate<br/><br/>",

Along the way, you may step on special spaces that will give you sparks (the &quot;currency&quot; of this game), cards, or allow you to activate your unique Robopower!<br/><br/>On your turn you may do these things:<br/>- roll a 6-sided die 2 times <br/>- spend sparks if you have them<br/>- play cards if you have them<br/>You can do these in any order. You can spend sparks <br/>or play cards between die rolls.<br/><br/>Of course, racing is only part of it: the other part is fighting! You can attack your opponents with the cards in your hands , which usually represent a gizmo you can use offensively. You can also spend 3 red sparks to shoot opponents... and of course, as the name implies, you can crash into them!<br/><br/>Players are never eliminated from the game, they continue racing until a winner crosses the finish line!<br/><br/>",

If one of the numbered cards is drawn (they feature Christopher Robin, Kanga and Roo, Piglet and Winnie the Pooh) then the next player has to add cards to the central stack, how many cards being decided by the number on the previous card.

Each player takes on the role of a Gear Jacket pilot and battle his or her opponents in a variable arena.<br/><br/>In the not-too-distant future, a struggling television network gambled on the idea of a reality show about giant robots battling each other.  The concept was a huge hit.  Across the globe, young men and women dreamed of becoming Gear Jacket pilots and fighting for wealth and fame.<br/><br/>With Gear Jacket, you can take control of one of the famous Gear Jacket giant robots and take on one to three opponents!<br/><br/>There are twelve arena cards, each with six spots on which a player can land.  Any number of these arena cards can be combined in any configuration to create the combat arena in which players will battle.  Terrain tokens can be added to further diversify the arena.<br/><br/>There are twelve different Gear Jackets in the base game, with more planned for future expansions.  Players select the Gear Jacket of their choice.  Each player also takes five combat cards and a damage card.  Each combat card represents a different section of the Gear Jacket--Head, Chest, Arms, etc.  Combat is based on predicting the opponent's moves.  The attacker selects two combat cards, while the defender chooses three.  These cards are simultaneously revealed.  Any cards revealed by the attacker that are not matched by the defender count as hits.  Hits in different sections cause different amounts of damage, and may have extra penalties for the defender, as well.<br/><br/>There are also rules for game variants such as King of the Hill, Death Race 2000, and Tag that allow for further game diversity.<br/><br/>",

The strategy is to search for the most or longest words and accumulate the highest score possible.  Each player must decide how to best allocate their play time between moving the cube or searching and calling out each word with its point value. Typically, a game consists of 2 to 5 rounds of play.  Players compete for the highest score by adding up the letter values for all words appearing anywhere around the cube.  The letters can wrap around the sides of the cube from one face to another and must links diagonally, vertically, or horizontally. In QUBLE JUMBLE and FIRST TO FORTY, scoring may be based upon the length of the word. The more letters in a word, the more points.<br/><br/>Besides word game play, QUBLE can also be played as a conventional brain teaser by matching up each face of the puzzle by solid colors.<br/><br/>Rulebook includes 7 variants, mostly in the scoring and win conditions.<br/><br/>",

Players swap piles, then choose one of the two piles they hold to serve as their Queen hand. On a turn, a player draws the top card of the deck or the top three cards on the discard pile, optionally plays sets and runs and plays off opponents, then discards one card. To open, a player must first play a set and run from the Queen hand of 3-7 cards. Once the player does this, she may meld additional cards and play off opponents.<br/><br/>Once a player has run out of cards in the Queen hand, she picks up the other pile &ndash; the King hand &ndash; and needs to play a set of 3-7 cards from this hand before being able to play off opponents once again. The round ends when a player runs out of cards in her King hand. The other players are penalized based on the value of cards remaining in hand, and the player with the lowest score after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a stack of cards. These remain face-down in front of him. The first player turns over the top card of his stack. If it is a character card, play passes to the next player. But if it is a Spinach card, the next player must 'Put' the nimber of cards indicated on the can of spinach (either 1, 2 or 3). If no more spinach is added whilst he is taking this action, all the cards played go to the player who played the spinach card and he puts them face-down under his stack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Socker is a two player breakthrough abstract board game that simulates a soccer or rugby-like game where socking opposing pieces is a means to the end zone.<br/><br/>Socker is played on a 9x11 field, 9 columns and 11 rows. Each player has five man tokens (for example meeples), called sockers, and there is a ball token.<br/><br/>To set up the game, the ball is placed in the center space of the board. Players toss a coin to see who plays first. Starting with the toss winner, each player places all his or her sockers upright on any empty spaces that are in their nearest half of the field, but not adjacent (vertically, horizontally or diagonally) to the ball and not in the center row.<br/><br/>Players continue alternating turns and do the following.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must perform one to three actions listed below using any of his or her upright (referred to as active) sockers.<br/><br/>     Move.  An active socker may be moved to any adjacent empty space. This includes the goal and out of bounds areas. However, at the end of a player&rsquo;s turn, no more that three of his or her sockers may be in the goal and out of bounds regions.<br/> Kick. If an active socker is adjacent to the ball, the ball may be kicked directly away one space provided the destination space is empty.<br/><br/>Sock. If an active socker is adjacent to an opponent&rsquo;s socker, then the opponent&rsquo;s socker may be pushed directly away one space provided the destination space is empty. The pushed socker is then put on its side to indicate that it is inactive and will not be able to perform any actions for one turn.<br/><br/>Any action or active socker may be used multiple times. Player may use any combination of actions and active sockers, and in any order they like.<br/><br/>When a player completes his or her actions all that player&rsquo;s inactive sockers are put upright and become active again. This ends the player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to kick the ball over your goal line, into your farthest 1x9 row.  Players can choose either of the following winning conditions: first to score a set number of goals (usually one), or most goals after a set number of turns followed by sudden death if necessary. After a goal, players should use the setup procedures with the non-scoring player going first. For sudden death, only two sockers per player are used, and a coin toss is used to determine who plays first.<br/><br/>Special Rules<br/><br/>Out of Bounds: The first and last columns of the playing field excluding the goal spaces are out of bounds. If the ball is pushed out of bounds, the ball is immediately moved to the center space of the same row. If the center space is occupied, the owner of the occupying socker can choose any empty space adjacent to the center space.<br/><br/>Repeat Positions: When a position is repeated, the player that plays next gets one extra action (total of four instead of three) to break the deadlock.<br/><br/>Static Positions: The maximum number of sockers on the edge is three. This prevents unmovable defensive positions behind the goal line or along the sides of the board. That is, positions where the offensive player can not push the ball or an opponent's socker.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is situated in the low countries during the revolt against Spain, resulting in the independency of the Dutch Republic.<br/>One player takes the Spanish side and the other the Dutch. Control of the land is achieved by controlling the various cities. To signify the control each city is covered with a chit which has a Spanish side and a Dutch side. <br/>At the beginning of the game the players decide on the number of rounds they will play (about 10 rounds per hour can be played, 20 to 30 round are recommended) and a die is rolled for each city. On a roll of 1, 2 or 3 the Spanish side is up, on 4, 5 or 6 the Dutch side. Each player gets three leaders to control their armies and 15 units of infantry. The Spanish get an extra two units of cavalry and the Dutch two units of naval troops (watergeuzen)<br/>Each round both players roll a die. Their separate scores are the number of action points they have for that round. The combined number of both dies is used to decide on a random effect to be carried out before the round is started. <br/>Victory points can only be scored as the result of a specific random effect. For each province (there are 16 provinces with 1 to 8 cities) where one players controls all cities that player scores a victory point for each city in the province. <br/>The player with the highest roll starts the round, in case of a tie the Spanish player. Units are moved over the board by leaders, they cannot move alone. The naval units can move independently but only from one coastal city to another. Movement costs actions. A player can conquer cities by spending action points storming, starving or tricking them. A random event can cause the city to change its alliance at the start of a new round as well.<br/>Battles between armies are  a special affair: both sides take only one turn rolling dies, one die for a unit of infantry, three for cavalry and three for each point their best leaders ability is higher than the other players best leaders. First the defending player rolls the dies, scoring a hit for each 6 rolled. Then, after taking her losses, the attacker does the same, the defender taking her losses. The winner of the battle is the player who rolled the most sixes or, when both rolled the same number, the defender. The defeated player loses the entire army, both units and leaders!<br/>After the last round there is a final victory point calculation. In this calculation a point is awarded for each city the player controls, regardless of province control.<br/><br/>",

During your turn you may add further cards, which have to match with cards on the table only.<br/>4. If you have finished your turn draw a new card from the pile<br/>5. Check the dice results of the other players carefully; if you possess a  matching card the turn is yours, as long as you are quick enough<br/>6. Placing your last card on the table - you win<br/><br/>",

Heroes band together to form adventuring parties and face off against monsters and villains in the dungeon&mdash;but the adventure doesn't end there!<br/><br/>Dungeon of Dread is an exciting, cooperative board game experience in which heroes unite in battle to achieve a common goal and defeat the enemies standing in their way. If they succeed, glory and fortune will be theirs for the taking. If they fail, all could be lost!<br/><br/>This cooperative board game experience is designed for 2-5 players, ages 10 and up. One player is the Dungeon Master who runs the villains and monsters; the remaining players are the heroes. The game includes four adventures, each one featuring a unique villain.<br/><br/>Update, August 11, 2011<br/><br/>Apparently Dungeon of Dread was not as &quot;exciting&quot; as Wizards of the Coast hoped for, as the company announced at Gen Con 2011 that the title was no longer scheduled for release.<br/><br/>",

These rules are intended for use with 28-30mm miniatures but could easily be adapted to smaller scales. Individual models are assigned individual skill levels (Streetwise, Brawling, Ranged Combat) and are given an allotment of Option Points to further customize each figure. Players equip each of their forces based on an Equipment Points system which allows them to add weapons, ammo, and miscellaneous equipment. Combat rules cover close combat, ranged, and special weapons such as RPGs and other heavy arms.<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/>'Street F.M.' is designed to represent small-scale conflict in a modern or near future urban environment. By employing scale models to represent the combatants and their surroundings it is possible to create clashes between street gangs, criminals, law enforcers and small military units. In fact any group entering urban combat, armed with everything from improvised weapons through to rocket launchers can be covered by the system.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from the introduction:<br/>The Expedition Afrique<br/><br/>In 1892, the French led a military campaign in Dahomey, the &quot;Slave  Coast&quot; between Nigeria and Togo, against its kings so that they might  have control of Porto Novo, a coastal city. They marched all the way to  Abomey, the capital of the land, and found the rulers gone. They  amused themselves by looting the city for souvenirs. The French press  was most impressed by a white parasol decorated with human jawbones.<br/><br/>They never saw the inside of that parasol. Inside it was a map drawn  in human blood, a map that pointed to a legendary city deep in Afrca's interior. This city was called the City of Brass, a bastion of ancient  African civilization full of treasure, both gold and knowledge.<br/><br/>Sadi Carnot, the president of France, sent a expedition on that  doomed journey. It only took three weeks for them to become hopelessly lost in an uncharted land. To this day, no one knows what happened to them. According to legend, only one of them made it, and his  greatest wishes were given unto him.<br/><br/>In this game, you will play those lost souls. Trapped in Africa's interior, with a map drawn on a parasol and not enough resources, you  search.<br/><br/>A note about the content of this game<br/><br/>While there is no magic in this game, it is a fantasy. The nobility found  among the people of Africa is not balanced against the savagery found  here. Like all peoples, the historic Africans had both high nobility and  awful destruction found in them. Even though this game depicts the  negative side of culture disproportionally, the author is fully aware  that is not the only side, or even the dominant side.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>This game is a form of highly abstracted, limited scope role-playing game with a fixed set of characters and goals.<br/><br/>Each player takes one of 6 different pre-defined characters: the Explorer, the Official, the Doctor, the Priest, the Naturalist, and the Native Guide.  A minimum of 4 players is recommended and one player must play the Explorer.  The Explorer nominates the Leader and the Leader selects a Companion.  The Leader narrates the obstacles that face the expedition.<br/><br/>Each player must name their character (a French sounding name is recommended) and answer the question: what does your character seek in the City of Brass.<br/><br/>Each character has 6 predefined statistics and each Ability has a corresponding Resource that replenishes it . The Resources are drawn from a deck of resource cards during play.<br/><br/>The game is divided in 5 Acts, in each of the first four Acts there are 5 Obstacles.  The fifth act is the City of Brass and final scoring is done at the end of this act.<br/><br/>Points are scored by defeating the obstacles and players may help one another during play, but are free to refuse help.  Obstacles are defeated by rolling a pool of dice against the target set by the Leader for that obstacle.  The number of dice rolled is determined by the Ability that is required to defeat it.<br/><br/>Each player totals their Quest Points earned during play and plays out the endgame story.  The endgame has a blind voting/bluff mechanism that offers a point bonus based on player voting, bluffing is possible during the vote count.<br/><br/>At the end of play, the player with the most points is the winner.  Ties are possible.<br/><br/>",

They are available in four player colours and 7 times as white. The white ones are the general supply, forming three stacks, so the three top tiles are available. Each player has the tiles of his own colour as a &quot;personal supply&quot;.<br/>Gameplay: On a player`s turn, he can choose either a white top tile or a tile from his personal supply and place it adjacent to any tile(s) already placed on the table. It is allowed to place any white tile adjacent to any other tile, but coloured tiles must not be adjacent to other coloured ones. Aim of the game is to create as many &quot;perfect Rosettas&quot; as possible: groups of seven tiles, with a tile of your colour as the centre and 6 white tiles with the other six numbers surrounding it, which is 10 points worth in the final score. If one or more tiles of 7 tiles show the same number, the &quot;doubles&quot; are subtracted from the 10 points. Rose-tiles are &quot;jokers&quot; and stand for any number a scoring player wants.<br/>The game ends, when all tiles are placed, or all coloured tiles are surrounded.<br/><br/>",

But the actions the players will take will not always be received favorably by the three factions that will determine the fate of Judea &mdash; the Jews, who alternate between loving and resenting Jesus; Rome, which is not interested in Jesus but simply wants to impose civility and order, and the Pharisees, who abhor Jesus and who, as their anger increases, are looking for a member of Jesus&rsquo; inner circle to betray Him&hellip;<br/><br/>Each turn, players receive 4 actions, which they may spend traveling to one of the cities in Palestine, drawing action cards, spending action cards to perform a Deed in a city, or requesting Jesus to perform a Deed.  Deeds come in four categories (preach, heal, exorcise a demon, or show compassion), and the cost of performing a Deed increases with each Deed performed in that category.  But players can call on Jesus to perform a Deed, which resets that category's cost track and awards players present in the area with Gospel tokens.  Most of the Deeds also result in consequences on one or more of the political tracks, representing the crowds, the Pharisees, or Rome.<br/><br/>The game ends either when the Rome track reaches its end (indicating that Jesus and the Disciples have attracted too much attention and Rome decides to intervene), or when the player who was dealt the Judas card elects to end the game, and receives the payout indicated on the Pharisees track.<br/><br/>The players' score is comprised of victory points received from the Deeds they performed, the Gospel tokens they accumulated, and the conditions described on their secret Goal cards that they received at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

Every player has 56 Bid Cards, that range from 1 to 50 + 6 blank cards. When a player bids for an Asset, he selects one card from his holding. All bids are simultaneous. You don't have to bid if you do not want to. Bids are revealed and the highest acquires the Asset and all Bid Cards used go out of the game. Selling Assets is done in the same way but now the owner definitely won't bid but will collect the winning bid in cash. Again, all Bids made go out of the game.<br/><br/>Movement across the board requires no dice, you just move one Asset space to another each turn. You must follow the 'flight paths' of the planes printed on the board.<br/><br/>The objective is to collect Assets in the same group (Example: Group: Energy; Assets needed Nuclear, Gas and Coal). When you have a set of three Assets, you may declare it and claim a Blue Chip for that set. A Blue Chip holding doubles the value of a set. When 10 Blue Chips have been declared, the game ends. Players announce the value of their Assets, add in their cash, and thge highest total wins.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the month (or when 4 projects are complete), the player will consult they buyer deck to see if they can successfully sell the house.<br/><br/>Many cards will provide &quot;curve-balls&quot; that will usually be up to the player to resolve with careful planning. Rich in theme, a player will note that every cause and effect represents actual events experienced by the designer in his career as a home builder (and owner).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game mat has 10 spiders which light up in sequence simulating that they are moving away from the nest and towards the outside of the game mat.  All games begin with the spiders lighting up solid red near the center nest.  If this center spider is not stomped in time, it will turn off and one of the spiders on the mat's outside edges will blink red.  If this outside spider turns off before being stomped, the spider has escaped off the mat, and you will hear it bite you.<br/><br/>Just like Spider-Man, your spidey senses will be tingling when you play the Electronic Spider Stompin' Game--a squishy, battery-powered (three AAA, not included) test of reaction time for one or two players. The arachnid amusement begins when you unroll the three-dimensional, vinyl floormat portraying a colorful array of 10 soft-bodied, pop-up spiders that blink red at random intervals--depending on which of five game speeds you've selected from the push-button controls on the center nest. Players score points by stomping their feet on the blinking beast before it escapes off the mat, all the while enduring smart-aleck cobweb comments like &quot;Ha Ha, ya missed me!&quot; or sound effects like a satisfied &quot;Chomp!&quot; after a successful escape. Add to the mix a razzle-dazzle underscore of silly music during each round of play, and the Electronic Spider Stompin' Game provides more than an itsy-bitsy bit of fast family fun.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to extricate each country from dangerous circumstances and achieve global prosperity with the least amount of military intervention. As &ldquo;nation teams,&rdquo; students will gain greater understanding of the critical impact of information and how it is used.<br/><br/>As their teams venture further into this interactive social setting laced with highly charged philosophical issues, the skills needed to identify ambiguity and bias in the information they receive will be enhanced and more specifically they will rapidly perceive that reactive behavior not only provokes antagonism, it can leave them alone and isolated in the face of powerful enemies. Beliefs and values will evolve or completely unravel as they begin to experience the positive impact and windows of opportunity that emerge through effective collaboration and refined communication.<br/><br/>In essence, as meaning is constructed out of chaos and new creative solutions are proposed, the World Peace Game players will learn to live and work comfortably at the frontiers of the unknown.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a squad of around 10 to 15 models with which to beat their opponent.<br/><br/>Most wargamers who are interested in the sci-fi genre will already have a large collection of suitable miniatures. Instead of having to buy more, you can use the ones you have got to play Faction Wars.<br/><br/>The game is very easy to learn, but still offers a level of detail that should engage even the most experienced wargamers. Faction Wars is set in the not-too-distant future, so some of the technology and weapons will be familiar, but with plenty of added science fiction to bring the universe to life.<br/><br/>The human race has escaped the clutches of Earth and colonised the galaxy. The invention of wormhole technology has allowed the vast gulfs of empty space to be crossed. However, this vastness is also leading to the downfall of the Commonwealth. The supreme political figure is the High Guardian, who is losing control over the rapidly expanding wave of colonisation. A number of factions, all with greatly different agendas and ideas battle against each other in small skirmishes right across the galaxy.<br/><br/>The rulebook contains:<br/><br/>* An introduction to the Inviroate Commonwealth of the Federated Worlds<br/>    * Background material on each of the 9 factions<br/>    * Plenty of colour photos and original artwork<br/>    * Rules for playing the game, plus some scenarios<br/>    * Stats and background for each faction to allow you to build up your squad<br/>    * Stats and background for Special Characters<br/>    * Lists of weapons, armour, equipment, skills and psionic abilities to equip your sqaud<br/>    * Suggestions for creating terrain and setting up your gaming table<br/>    * Rules for using vehicles within the game<br/><br/>",

While contemplating your future at a local restaurant, the local news station runs a story depicting a man and his crew popping a bottle of Champagne as they celebrate finding a wreck full of Spanish treasure.  &ldquo;Why not me?&rdquo; you ask yourself....  Why not you?<br/><br/>Armed only with your boat and 50 Trade Credits (TCs), you decide to set out tomorrow to find treasure and fame in the waters between the U.S. and the Bahamas.  You will have to learn to dive, sail, and methods for search and recovery.  Will you try to advance conservatively, or try to advance quickly by luck?  Will you try to depend on cheaper equipment, or spend the fruits of your labors on the latest in high-tech equipment?  It will not be easy, and the competition with other wanna-be treasure hunters will be fierce.<br/><br/>Your goal is to become the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known.  Up to 6 players take on the role of one of 16 international treasure hunters, each with different individual strengths.  Players may choose to visit the ports of Miami, Port Lucaya, or Alice Town to purchase and sell dive equipment, boating equipment, search and recovery supplies, and other merchandise; players may choose to explore unexplored areas of the sea by turning over sea tiles with random depths, or dive in explored areas.<br/><br/>A player begins as an unexperienced diver, limited to shallow depths, limited by poor air consuption, and lack of equipment.  Beginning divers will be glad to recover minor treasures such as lobster, and shells during their freedives.  The more dives that are completed the more experience is gained.  The diver is allowed to make dives leading to greater depths, and with a larger possibility to obtain greater treasure.  The greater the treasure the diver recovers, the more Trade Credits a diver will earn at market.  The combination of experience and Trade Credits will allow the diver to eventually recover treasures that are worth too much money to sell on market, but can be donated to the Miami Nautical Museum in exchange for Victory Points.  The first player to win 10 victory points becomes the most renowned treasure hunter the Bahamas has ever known, and is the victor!<br/><br/>DIVE! is a board game made by a diver, but which can be played by divers and non-divers alike.  No dive experience is needed, however, those familiar with diving will recognize diving concepts.  Divers will also recognize some of the concepts in this game are not exactly realistic.  That is because making real concepts unrealistic, makes the game fun!  That being said, playing DIVE! should not be seen as a substitution for scuba training, and the concepts in the game should not be used in actual diving.  If you are interested in diving, please contact your local PADI dive center.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Based on the game from the original Battlestar Galactica television series. Game play is similar to that of Poker. The deck consists of 56 cards:<br/><br/><br/>     52 Pyramid cards (divided into 4 suits - red, green, black, brown)<br/>     4 Cylon cards (similar to Jokers)<br/><br/><br/>The value of the cards are determined by a symbol system of dots, lines, and triangles (pyramids). One dot has the value of 1 and one line has the value of 5. The highest value of the dot line cards is 13, with the pyramid card out ranking that. However a pyramid card can also rank low in a sequence of cards, much like an Ace can in standard playing cards.<br/><br/>Sequence examples:<br/><br/><br/>     Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10 (much like Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10)<br/>     5, 4, 3, 2, Pyramid (much like 5, 4, 3, 2, Ace)<br/><br/><br/>Cylon cards are used as wild cards, and can be played one of two ways. The card can either be a stand in for which ever card the player wants it to be OR it can be the Cap Stone to created a Full Pyramid, which is the highest possible winning hand in the game.<br/><br/>Players are dealt initially 5 cards in Pyramid. The cards are dealt out like in Poker, one at a time around the table, beginning with the player to the dealer's left.<br/><br/>Once the cards are dealt, the player to the dealer's left bets first and places their bet into the pot. Then the dealer will ask if anyone would like new cards and how many they want. Players can discard up to 4 cards.<br/><br/>After the new cards are dealt, each player can either surrender (discard and sit out the hand), call (match the pot), or raise (match the pot and raise it). If a player decides to raise, every other player must match this raise in order to stay in the game or surrender.<br/><br/>The following is the rank of winning Pyramid hands:<br/><br/><br/>     Full Pyramid - Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Pyramid, Cylon<br/>     Kobol - Pyramid, 13, 12, 11, 10<br/>     Colony - 5 cards in sequence AND of the same color<br/>     Quorum - 5 cards in sequence of any color<br/>     Quad - 4 cards of the same rank, one of each color<br/>     Triad - 3 of a kind<br/>     Duo - a pair<br/><br/><br/>If more than one player has matching hand types, then the hand that has the highest card wins out. For example two players have a Quorum. One player has 7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and the other player has 8, 7, 6, 5, 4. The second player, the one with the 8, beats the hand of the first player.<br/><br/>Much like Poker, Pyramid is a game of bets and bluffs. The goal is to win the most money in the end. Use your wits and your best Pyramid face to win all the Cubits!<br/><br/>",

The army is comprised of three columns commanded by George Crook, John Gibbon, and Alfred H. Terry. The most renowned American officer of the era, George A. Custer, commands the 7th Cavalry Regiment, its 12 companies organized in 24 sections, its pack of mules and its Arikara scouts. Also on the move are the units of the 2nd and 3rd Cavalry regiments, Crow and Shoshone scouts, riflemen, volunteers, wagons, machine-guns, 19 superior officers and important figures, 108 combat sections, and 30 support units.<br/><br/>All of this is represented by more than 250 original illustrations in Hoka Hey!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s a story of the Great Plains that takes a decisive turn.

        "description": "El Salvador Spel is a game about the El Salvadoran Civil War and the events leading up to it, in abstracted form. Players each receive a role card - roles include military, guerrilla, plantation worker, and Archbishop &Oacute;scar Romero - which determines how they play and what their goals are. Play takes place on a large square grid with areas designated as guerrilla camps, plantations, mass demonstrations, etc. Players roll dice and move their pieces and pieces representing resistance movement members in order to occupy the various areas; occupying an area provides a benefit depending on the type.<br/><br/>The game consists of a 24-page booklet containing the rules, historical background, &quot;news&quot; items and military tactics for use during the game. In addition, there are cardstock sheets bound in to the booklet. These are cut apart to create the role cards and cards depicting the various board areas. The players have to supply the board, dice, pawns, and resistance movement markers.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 13 players (one of whom runs the game and one of whom is in charge of the news), but can be played with more or fewer by doubling up players or roles. No specific minimum or maximum numbers are given.<br/><br/>",

Now, warlords ruling  multiple star systems seek to add to their domain through conquest of other sovereign  planets. Their weapons of choice are gigantic robots, 10 20 meters tall, fully armored and  bristling with guns. The pilots of these &quot;mecha&quot; are the new knights of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Note: to use these rules, you will need a hexagonal battle map and figures or markers for  the mecha.

There, he created his own society, based on a  caste system ruled by the bravest and brightest warriors of the Star Federation's  military.

Well, in this case, the Pharaoh is dumb. Really dumb. But he still holds all of the power to the kingdom. He has the power to sacrifice those that are disloyal to him, and bury the best servants with him.<br/><br/>Bottom line... be as mediocre as possible, and the Pharaoh won't off you.<br/><br/>Each player takes on a role (each with its own special abilities) for the duration of game play. Every turn, a player chooses to either increase his PR (Pharaoh Report... Pharaoh Faction) or to decrease it. This is done by decided whether to flip a Naughty or Nice card. Of course, each card has its own twist. Sometimes, a player may overshoot his goals and go from the most liked, to the least. In addition, players have gold that can be used to pay off the executioner from getting them this round, but that is only a stay of death. And the gold can be used to buy special cards.

Now the first player takes the first card from his deck and chooses one of the four characteristics (courage, creativity, coolness, musicality) which all have a specific score. After choosing the category all players turn the card and place it on the gameboard so that everybody can see it. Now the players compare the score of the chosen characteristic. The player with the highest score on that characteristic wins the round. If there's a tie, then the cards remain on the board till the next round. The winner of the next round also gets those cards. The game goes on until one person has won all the cards in the game.<br/><br/>For collecting purposes people have made their own interpretation of the game or let the winner choose a card from one of the losers decks.<br/><br/>",

Pieces can be played anywhere as long as they are connected to another of the player's pieces. The opponent's pieces can be taken by playing another piece on top of them, which can sever the opponent's chain. Once a piece is taken, the space it's in can't be taken again, it remains in control of the player who took the piece.<br/><br/>Once an uninterrupted chain is built between the two starting positions, the player who built the chain is declared winner.<br/><br/>",

So there could be six cars on the track rather than just the four bikes in speedway. The number of cars is divided by the number of drivers (players), so 2 players get 3 cars each, 3 players get 2 cars each, or you could have 4, 5, or 6 players with a car each.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Drivers drew for positions on the start line. (although there is nothing to stop you from having qualifying laps)&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;A race could consist of one or more laps.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The different size ball-bearings still signified different gear ratios, but drivers could select any one they wished at their turn.

All games in the series used a very similar mechanic: a ball bearing was dropped down a tube and used to propel a playing piece around a racing track. This particular game simulated horse racing, and the pieces were horses and jockeys mounted on Subbuteo style bases. This used the same basic rules as other games in the series, with some variations to account for the sport being represented.<br/><br/>The variations were as follows:<br/><br/>&quot;The race track may be regulation size, or possibly you may care to improvise its shape, but movement areas should not exceed 8&quot; in length. This measurement should be taken on the inside of the track.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When the horse has reached the distance post (two movement areas before the Winning Post) no horse is allowed to cross directly in front of another horse. If a horse crosses another in this fashion and within this area and subsequently finishes first, second, or third, the jockey on the crossed horse may lodge an objection, which will be automatically sustained. The offending horse is then placed last and the other horses naturally move up to fill the vacant place.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Once round the track will be a Five Furlong Sprint race. Twice round is regarded as the Derby course, and three times, the St. Leger course.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each race may be regarded as complete in itself, or may become part of a series of races known as a Meeting. The winner of a Meeting will be the owner of the horse, or horses securing the largest amount of prize money. Prize money is allotted as follows: Winner &pound;100, Second &pound;60, Third &pound;40.&quot;<br/><br/>There were also advanced rules for steeple chasing.<br/><br/>",

Quite a profitable procedure in the 1950's as Sooty was a huge favourite on television.<br/><br/>SOOTY&rsquo;S MAGIC CARD GAME<br/><br/>The Pack<br/>Here is a brand new card game for 2, 3 or 4 players which you will find easy to learn and which will give you hours of fun at parties and at home in the evenings. Mummy and Daddy will enjoy it too and, after you&rsquo;ve played a few games and learnt some of Sooty&rsquo;s special tricks with his Oofle Dust and Magic Wand, they&rsquo;ll have a hard job to beat you at it.<br/><br/>There are 54 cards in the pack and they are made up like this &ndash; <br/>    18 Sooty cards<br/>      1 Sooty Joker<br/>    18 Sweep cards<br/>      1 Sweep Joker<br/>      8 Oofle Dust Cards<br/>      8 Magic Wand cards<br/><br/>As you can see, both the sets of Sooty and Sweep cards, which we call &ldquo;Suits&rdquo; as in other card games, have different numbers on them running from 1 to 5. In each of the two Suits there are six cards with the number &ldquo;3&rdquo; on them and three cards each with the numbers  &ldquo;1&rdquo;, &ldquo;2&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo;, &ldquo;5&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The Object of the Game<br/>Starting off with 8 cards in each player&rsquo;s hand the winner will be the one who can first lay down the complete TWO sets (four cards in each set) with the numbers in each set adding up to the magic number 12. Each set must have four cards of the same suit, so you can finish with one set of Sooty cards and one set of Sweep cards or two sets of Sooty or two sets of Sweep. Most of you will be able to work out quickly how many different ways there are of making 4 cards add up to 12 but in case you want to see, here are the eight combinations which will work &ndash; 3333, 3342, 3351, 4422, 4431, 5511, 5421 and 5322.<br/>The Oofle Dust cards are used to put on your opponent&rsquo;s cards as they are laid down one by one, and the cards that have been &ldquo;Oofled&rdquo; cannot be counted towards a set until they have been &ldquo;released&rdquo;. This is done by placing a Magic Wand  card on top of the Oofle Dust card. So you can see that &ldquo;Oofling&rdquo; other players cards and being &ldquo;Oofled&rdquo; yourself becomes an important part of the game.<br/>The Sooty and Sweep Joker cards can, of course, be used for any number 1 to 5 when they are laid down.<br/><br/>The Rules of Play<br/>1.    Decide first of all on the dealer. He will shuffle the cards and then deal out to each player, <br/>including himself, 8 cards. The remainder of the pack is then placed in the centre of the table <br/>face downwards and the top card turned up and put at the side of the pack to start the &ldquo;discard pile&rdquo;.<br/><br/>2.    The Dealer starts play, and he and each player in turn can do ANY ONE of the following <br/>things but not more than one at each turn :-<br/><br/>a)   Start his first set of 4 cards by laying down face upwards in front of him a Sooty or Sweep<br/>       card.<br/><br/>OR     b)   Oofle any other player by placing an Oofle Dust card face upwards on top of one of the <br/>      cards in another players unfinished set. This card should only half cover the suit card so <br/>      that everyone can see the number which has been blocked.<br/><br/>OR    c)   Release any card of his own which has been Oofled, by placing a Magic Wand card on <br/>      top of the Oofle Dust card (again half covering it). This releases his suit cards, and he can <br/>     then go on completing his set. Remember, though, that you cannot go on completing <br/>     your  set so long as any one of the cards in it is still Oofled, and that you can only release <br/>     one card at a time.<br/><br/>OR    d)    He can extract the Joker from a completed set, his own or another&rsquo;s by substituting for it <br/>       the card the Joker represents. Thus, if in his completed set a player uses the Sooty Joker <br/>       as a 2 card, and you have a Sooty 2 in your hand you may exchange the cards and <br/>       then use the Joker in your own set at any of your later turns.<br/> OR    e)  Pick up the top card of the discard pile or the top card of the pack AND then discard one <br/>     from his own hand. This will go face upwards on the discard pile. You will usually do this if <br/>     you cannot do any of the other moves already mentioned, or if the top card of the discard <br/>    pile is one which you particularly want.<br/><br/>OR    f)  Pick up one card from one of his own unfinished sets. This should really happen only if <br/>    you find that you have by mistake put down three cards which already add up to 12 or <br/>    more, or if you can see that you cannot complete a set and therefore want to try a <br/>    different way.<br/><br/>3.    If at your turn you do (a) (that is, lay down a card towards a set) or (d) (that is, exchange a <br/>card for a Joker), or (f) (that is pick up a card from your unfinished set), you do NOT pick up <br/>another card. But when you play an Oofle Dust or Magic Wand card you MUST also pick up a card from the pack or discard pile, after playing your cards.<br/>If you remember this you will always have the right number of cards in your hand. These will<br/>gradually go down from 8 to 1 and the winner will of course be the one who in completing his second set has no cards left in his hand.<br/>At any stage of the game the number of cards you have in your hand together with the suit <br/>cards (but not the Oofle Dust or Magic Wand cards) you have laid down will always add up to EIGHT.<br/><br/>4.    You may build one set at a time or start booth sets at once but remember that only one card <br/>can be laid down at each turn.<br/><br/>5.    A suit card can be Oofled more than once, but the second Oofling can only be done after the <br/>first Oofling has been cleared by a Magic Wand card. A player who has more than one card <br/>Oofled in an unfinished set cannot go on with this particular set set until all the Oofled cards <br/>have been released with Magic Wand cards. Once a set has been completed, NO card in it <br/>can be Oofled of double-oofled.<br/><br/>A Few Hints on Play<br/>When the game commences you will all probably start building your own sets on the table. But when you see other players with 2, or more important, 3 cards laid down towards a set, you must use your Oofle Dust cards quickly to block them and hold them up. All the way through the game your choice of action is between trying to win quickly yourself and blocking the other players from doing the same.<br/>When the game has gone some way and there are a number of suit cards on the table try not to get into difficulties with your sets through shortage of particular suit cards. For example, if you have already started a Sooty with two &ldquo;5&rdquo;s, the last two cards in your set would have to be &ldquo;1&rdquo;. But, if you can already see on the table two Sooty &ldquo;1&rdquo; cards, that means that there is only one left. So unless you have, or can pick up a Joker, you would be wise to lift one of your &ldquo;5&rdquo;s (move (f)) and at your next turn lay down a card with a smaller number, thus giving you self a better chance to complete your set.<br/><br/>",

First player to eliminate all six of their opponent's pegs wins. Player's pegs start in a home section of the same color. A pair of dice are rolled to determine movement. Each die may be used to move two separate pegs, or they may be combined to move a single peg twice. A peg must land in either an empty space, or on an opponent's peg, eliminating it. A peg in its home section cannot be eliminated. A player is not allowed to land on his own pegs. If a player cannot move, the player must pass. Once either player is down to one peg, the home section is no longer safe. However, the final peg can only be eliminated by a 6 on a single die. If both players are down to one peg, then it is a race to see who can eliminate the other, or who can land in their own home section first.<br/><br/>",

Players are members of the British intelligence service attempting to catch German spies in England, France, Belgium and the Netherlands.  A player is based in each of these four countries and the winner is the first to identify the spies operating in their area.<br/><br/>Each country has three suspects who may be resistance workers, refugees or spies.  Players collect cards as the game progresses which help eliminate potential spies from suspicion until a player is able to make a positive identification.  If a player reaches an incorrect conclusion about the spies in their area then they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>Contents are:<br/>1 playing board, 1 control spinner, 4 Spy Catcher (player) markers, 4 sets of information cards (potential spies) and 12 covering discs.  Rules are printed on the inside of the box lid.<br/><br/>",

The game requires a game master who controls the game flow. (Due to the nature of the game being active at all times, there needs to be several game masters taking turns.)<br/><br/>The game is played on a large game board map. Players create characters and move around on the map picking up tokens which allow them to draw cards that represent resources, foes to defeat, missions or certain events. Players form &quot;clans&quot; consisting of 2-4 players and roam around the board, pursuing missions, earning experience points, money and points for their clan. Clan points are rewarded for completing missions that advance the game. Clans with high points may build home bases around the board and earn other privilegies.<br/><br/>Players can &quot;log out&quot; (leave the game) at any time. All cards the player has are saved. The player can come back at any time and re-enter the game by simply reclaiming his cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when the convention or set time (2-4 days) is at an end, at which point the clan with the most points wins. The game may also end if players manage to fulfil any end-game requirement set up by the game master(s).<br/><br/>",

Disgust  with the &quot;Wars of Succession&quot; spurred the General into self-imposed exile, far  outside the Known Sphere of systems. There, he created his own society, based on a  caste system ruled by the bravest and brightest warriors of the Star Federation's  military. Organized into clans, taught to place honor before and above all else, the  General's followers drilled and trained for generations, knowing one day they would  return to human colonized space, unifying all the squabbling warlords in a single,  bloody Jihad. That day has arrived!<br/><br/>Note: these rules are a supplement for the one-page micro-game War of the Mecha.  You will need War of the Mecha to use these rules. These rules are ADDITIONS to the  War of the Mecha standard game.<br/><br/>designer's comment:<br/>... provides rules for running an on-going campaign (planetary assault in this case) with specific mission objectives, victory scenarios, and rules for promotion in rank (as well as being busted down for failure). Fully compatible with War of the Mecha and War of the Mecha II:  Clan Invasion! this game provides only additional rules, not revisions or changes.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the team who builds the greater number of bigger squares, given that the score is the sum of the value of the built cubes.<br/><br/>SETUP THE GAME:<br/>The players meet around the game board (ex. 4 players: Blue player, Yellow player, Blue player, Yellow player), so that they represent each player&rsquo;s turn. It is a custom that the game should start with a move from the Blue team and to proceed among the players of the teams in clockwise fashion. At the beginning of the match the board has no pieces and the two teams have all their pieces yet to be played respectively.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Each player on his turn can make only one of these operations:<br/>&bull;    Place of a piece;<br/>&bull;    Move of a piece;<br/>&bull;    Pass the turn.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/>The match ends when all pieces have been placed and, therefore, the teams cannot make further moves. Interestingly, one of the teams will finish it&rsquo;s pieces before the other team and so can only make the movement (or pass) waiting for the opponent team to finish its remaining pieces. This phase is called the closure of the game. During the closure the team with pieces cannot move or pass.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INVINCIBLE is a game of battle between endurance and courage. It takes you into an arena, where champions from faraway lands come to compete and remain the last man standing. By mastering the balance between courage and endurance, you may reap the glory of the INVINCIBLE.<br/><br/>Players chose their champion from among 3 different tribes, each fielding a variety of 6 *(7) different classes. 18 *(21) unique characters with 2 special abilities each, 3 playing modes for 2-6 *(7) players promises great replay-ability. When designing the rules, our goal was to make them as easy to pick up as checkers, and as tactically deep as chess. From our experience, it is best learned &quot;on the go&quot;, and even first-timers DO win!<br/><br/>Players have 3 types of card at their disposal. &quot;Action&quot; card with reddish background, &quot;Equipment&quot; cards with yellow background, and &quot;Special&quot; cards with green background. The action cards work on a bit more complex &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; mechanics, and players need to decide which attacks to commence, in order to get their opponent in the spot they want them. Players pick 3 cards from the deck every time it's their turn in the round, or when they are challenged to a duel. At the end of their turn in the round, they may chose to discard one card for their convenience, yet this could also work against them, since the less cards you have on your hand, the more mouth-watering victim you make yourself. Duel is a battle mechanism, where two players engage into an exchange of action cards, where both of them are allowed to use two action cards for an attack, single special card of every kind, use as many equipment cards as they posses, and utilize their special abilities based on the amount of courage they gained in the season. (One whole game of INVINCIBLE represents a season in the arena). Each player's champion has different starting endurance, courage and  card stock based on their tribe of origin. Endurance and courage are two main resources used in the game. Endurance determines how much damage can the player take, and if it drops to zero, the player is eliminated from the competition. However, they are not eliminated from the game. Players who's endurance drops to zero, come back to game in the next turn as &quot;ghost&quot; players. Losing all their equipment and courage, starting with a single point of endurance. Players who are still competing for the title of INVINCIBLE, can no longer duel the ghost players, but this does not work the other way around, and so they may take revenge on their executioners or simply have fun playing with other player's chances in the game. Courage is gained with every successful hit. This means every time you play an attack card, and you duelist does not play a valid defense card against it, that player loses a point of endurance, and you gain a point of courage. Each character has two special abilities, which spent the courage when used. First ability costs 4 courage points, and the other spends 6 points being twice as powerful. Players need to chose whether they spend their courage early, or save up for more powerful abilities and risk that they get eliminated in the process, or somebody uses a card or ability that would steal their courage. The closer to the epic final duel the game gets, the more courage players gain, as every time you eliminate a player, you gain 6 points of courage, and also, there are more equipment cards available for less competing players. Equipment cards improve endurance and courage capacities, and special cads have many uses to disabling your opponents and &quot;resource redistribution&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>    (x) marked values refer to Collector's and Signature editions.<br/><br/><br/>",

The postcards are real cards: kids address them, write or draw a message, stamp the cards with a cancellation rubber stamp, and drop them into a bright-red British-style postbox, assembled from folded cardboard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Behind The Glass is a card game where players manage their own TV Channels and try to earn the most viewers from 4 different target groups by designing the most efficient schedule each day. Their aim in the short-run is to fulfill advertising contracts to get money and in the long-run to gain viewers from those groups which eventually will give them victory.<br/><br/>The action phase is played by using employees cards in order to perform common or special (more efficient) actions. Each employee card represents either a unique special action or a boost of a common action. Each employee, after he/she has been played is discarded. So players must constantly plan their hand keeping in mind the hand limit and the emploeyees available in market.<br/><br/>Players must manage their daily schedule by purchasing Films and placing them face down next to current day's viewers. Each film has a quality and a duration which constraints the available slots (for example, movies take 3 zones, so a player cannot place a movie in zone 1 and then place another film in zone 2). Also, some employees can boost this quality during the broadcasting phase, producing unexpected results! Films can also be used as advertisments of the channel. They can be discarded in order to grant 1 quality in a matching viewer of the next day's program. Finally, films, according to their type, may give players important end game bonuses (for example, fulfilling an action series 3 times, thus completing a season, will grant 10 working class viewers at the end of the game).<br/><br/>At the beginning players do not have any money. They will go in red as they will buy films and workers but soon they will need to fulfill advertising contracts in order to get money (or play some shows) and become profitable. At the end money will be added (or subtracted) to the final score. Advertising contracts can give a lot of money if they are fulfilled before expiration (some employees can extend those contracts).<br/><br/>Finally, players have the ability to create their own custom films and then use them for their program or sell them for good money. Also, designing internal productions is the only way to get Managers who give strong and long-term abilities.<br/><br/>Are you ready to manage a TV Channel efficiently? Getting most viewers is a must but at the same time you have to do it in the most profitable way!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Bridge comes easy with the partner racks. Two can play. The help you need to take yourself up to competition standard.&quot; (From box)<br/><br/>Beginners to Winners Bridge begins with modified rules to teach the concepts of Bridge, but also includes rules for Contract Bridge with four players.<br/><br/>With the included two-player rules, all 52 cards are dealt out. While both sets of partner cards are face down, both players make their first bid. Once this has been done, each player will set up his partner cards in his partner rack, according to suit. The card racks hold the cards at 45-degree angles, allowing a person to see the cards opposite them, but not their opponent's cards. Each player will play the cards in their partner rack as well as his own cards. The bidding continues as each player studies their partner hand as well as their own. Players can raise the bid until 7 NT is bid or until one player passes.<br/><br/>There is a simplified scoring system for the beginners' game. One point is given for each trick won. Both the Declarer and the Defender can win these points. If the Declarer wins at least the number of tricks called for, they win a bonus of 10 points. If he doesn't, the Defender wins a bonus of 5 points and the Declarer deducts 1 point for each Undertrick. The first player to score 30 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

After dealing one card to each player, the dealer must add one to the pool as well so that the game starts with a number of cards in the pool. Each player is given 24 counters. The person holding the Whip card cries &quot;Tally Ho!&quot; and asks the player of his choice if he has the Fox card. Various penalties occur if he is right or wrong. Then the Whip is placed into the pool cards, which are now shuffled.<br/>Now each player asks a player for a card, and if he makes a trick, he can claim it in front of him. Then he takes a number of counters from the pool and adds them to his other counters. If a pair of Hounds is played, he collects 3 counters, a pair of Lady Riders, 6 counters; a pair of huntsmen, 9 counters; a special pair of the Whip and the Fox, 12 counters and that trick counts as two tricks at the end of the game. All cards in the pair must match numbers as well as images.<br/>When all the cards are collected as pairs, the player with the most tricks takes the remaining counters in the pool, and the one with the most counters, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Object of the Game is to be the first player to collect at least one of every Tidal Pool Animal Card to fill your sand pail. You can win the game with 6 different animal cards or 5 animal cards and a Treasure Pool card.<br/><br/>Players then follow, taking their turns, to the left of the starting player. Play moves clockwise around the outside track with the larger &quot;squares&quot; by rolling 2 dice. If doubles are rolled, that player may take another turn. You may only enter a Tidal Pool path by landing on the arrow marked Enter. When you enter a Tidal Pool path you may use only 1 die to move your piece. If you land on one of the squares in the path with an arrow pointing at the animal cards, you may pick one up and put it on your Sand Pail Card. You may get more than one of the same animal cards. They are good for trading or dealing with a sea gull snatching up your animal.<br/><br/>",

Each player is given a hand of five cards.<br/><br/>On playing a card, the player must build on a continuous, common story, with the new addition to the story having a direct link to the card played.  Players are judged on the new contribution to the story, and if not accepted the player retrieves the card and also takes a penalty card from the deck.<br/><br/>There is no set play order -- any player can play at any time with the exception that no player may play two cards in a row.  Points are scored for the number of cards played.<br/><br/>A round ends after a player has no more cards remaining.  The player with the most points after five rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Bidding then takes place and the hand played out.<br/>At the end of the hand, you can check analysis book to see how 'experts' bid and played the hand. Points are scored during each hand.

The number of items also ranges from one to five. Shops are colour co-ordinated - bakery is orange, market green etc. There are coloured squares on the list as well - bread is next to orange square, tomatoes next to green etc. All the shopping lists are different.<br/><br/>When a player lands on a shop and doesn't have the item from it yet, he/she has to ask for it and also name the correct quantity: &quot;One loaf of bread, please&quot; or &quot;Five tomatoes, please&quot;. They then get the picture of the item to put on their list. If they already have the item, they miss their turn and play passes to their left.<br/><br/>There are four squares on the board without any shops, two showing people shopping and one someone having lunch. These squares also mean that a player misses their turn. However, if a player lands on the &quot;Checkout&quot; square, he/she can ask for anything on their list.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Collodian Conspiracy is a strategic game in Galaxy-Foundation Games' strategic Battle for Andromeda: Conflict for a Trillion Suns! series. It uses the series rulebook, Andromeda Foundation Official Battle Manual.<br/><br/>This particular game pits the Collodian Confederation (colonial outposts of the Xenon Empire) against the Kons Empire (or Dirak of Kons). The game can be combined with The Xenon Empire's Star Wars: Crusade Against the War-Lords in some way which is not entirely clear.<br/><br/>The game-specific rulebook has a lengthy description of the background (the forces are fighting over deposits of cesium, trillium, and magellinium), discussion of strategy, and the specific rules for this game. In the latter category, there are some special weapons for each side and neutral powers which might join the war.<br/><br/>According to the rulebook, a kit was available which added extra counters to enable play of &quot;the famed Xenon-Kons Frontier Battles of the First Galactic War.&quot;<br/><br/>From a GFG catalog (reproduced verbatim):<br/><br/><br/>        This connects to the previous Game and the Collodians represent the Colonies of Xenon above. In this game for the first time a Culture meets the KONS forces directly - not merely their Allies. There are many counters in this game as the Collodians must use stealth and trickery to protect themselves. The Kons Main Fleet, as governed by the Regent and Viceroy of Cyon is beyond number in power, yet the Kons can send 5 more fleets LKIE THIS at a snap of the fingers! But the Regency is surrounded by barriers of deadly Nebula of Gasses, Radiation Forces, Clouds of Anti-Matter near the Monopole. If the Collodians can move through the Tunnels of Low Energy and strike the Regency, they can cripple it long enough so new Kons forces will have to fight for a long time to reconquer the Zone. When they do, they will have to move up the narrow corridors (like the famous pass defended by Leonidas and his 300 Spartans against the Persion Host of Darius!), likewise limit the number of Kons Craft that can attack at one time. So a Culture with good fighters though outnumbered, can win. If Xenon (on the other board) wins, help will arrive and the Kons expansion might be halted in this direction permanently. Then this would  bring Xenon a springboard for its own counter-war!<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>        Xenon Export Cruisers and Collodian Fleets containing the fastest ships in the Galaxy, are included with 40 Kons war&mdash;ship counters in Imperial White. A beautiful Mapboard 22x28 inches long, even better unique rules go along with this BFA Game.<br/><br/><br/>",

The players space themselves evenly around the mini-trampoline and place all five of their dice on the game surface in front of them. Each player has a polo mallet (at times also known as a serving spoon). On the starting signal, all players strike underneath the mini-trampoline with their polo mallet to try to propel their dice into the bowl. The first player to get all 5 dice in the bowl is the winner. This game is an alternative to the difficult to obtain Piratenbillard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The players are gnomes in the employ of a troll on a burger restaurant. The troll told them: &quot;One of you will be fired at the end of the day; the one with worst cash!&quot;. The troll will take the customer&rsquo;s orders and he hope the gnomes make their work fast, very fast; because if they delay an order, the customer (another troll, usually!) will get angry and leave the restaurant without paying.<br/><br/>GAME COMPONENTS<br/><br/>15 order cards<br/>95 product cards<br/>12 counters: 3 green, 3 blue, 3 yellow and 3 red<br/>Rules<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>&quot;Trollburger&quot; is a 2-player card game. At the start of the turn, the starting player turn over the top deck card and show the number on it.<br/><br/>If that number is equal or higher thant the number of order cards on table, another order card is drawn and placed on the table.<br/><br/>Then the starting player choose to perform one of 4 actions on his turn. He can make that action as many times as the number shown at the start of the turn:<br/><br/>-Take cards from the product deck<br/>   -Search a card from the product deck<br/>   -Discard cards from the hand<br/>   -Place products on the table to build a burger<br/><br/>Then, he can choose to deliver a burger to the customers. The player can deliver an incomplete burger, in the hope that the customer does not realize.<br/><br/>Next, the other player takes his turn, using the same number; <br/>and at last he becomes the starting player for the next turn.<br/><br/>If at any time, a 5th order has to be added on tha table, the older order on table is discarded (and any player who was working on it, loses his product cards).<br/><br/>GOAL<br/><br/>When a player devilers an order he takes that order card. <br/>The game ends if 4 orders are discarded or the last order card is drawn.<br/>At the end of the game, each player add the victory points of his order cards. The player with more victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>(Here you can find all the files to print &amp; play your own Trollburger).<br/><br/><br/>Los jugadores son gnomos que trabajan para un troll en una hamburgueseria. El troll les ha comunicado que uno de ellos sera despedido al final del dia; aquel que aporte menos al negocio. El troll es el encargado de coger los pedidos de los clientes y espera que los gnomos hagan su trabajo rapido, muy rapido; pues si se retrasan en entregar un pedido, el cliente (normalmente otro troll!!) se va a enfadar y se ira del restaurante si haber consumido.COMPONENTES DEL JUEGO<br/><br/>15 cartas de pedidos<br/>95 cartas de productos<br/>12 contadores: 3 verdes, 3 azules, 3 amarillos y 3 rojos<br/>Reglas<br/><br/>EL JUEGO<br/><br/>&quot;Trollburger&quot; es un juego de cartas para 2 jugadores. Al principio del turno, el jugador inicial gira la carta superior de la baraja y muestra el n&uacute;mero que aparece en ella.<br/><br/>Si ese numero es igual o mayor que el numero de cartas de pedidos en la mesa, aparece una nueva carta de pedido y se a&ntilde;ade al centro de la mesa.<br/><br/>Despu&eacute;s el jugador inicial elige cual de 4 posibles acciones quiere realizar en su turno. Podra hacer esa accion tantas veces como el numero que se ha mostrado al principio del turno:<br/><br/>-Coger cartas de la baraja de productos<br/>   -Buscar una carta en la baraja de productos<br/>   -Descartar cartas de la mano<br/>   -Colocar productos en la mesa para elaborar una hamburguesa<br/><br/>Despues, puede elegir entregar una hamburguesa a los clientes. El jugador puede entregar una hamburguesa que no este acabada, con la esperanza de que el cliente no se de cuenta.<br/><br/>Acto seguido, el otro jugador realiza su turno, usando el mismo numero; y al final se convierte en el jugador inicial para el siguiente turno.<br/><br/>Si en algun momento, se debe anadir un 5&ordm; pedido a la mesa, el pedido mas antiguo que hubiera en la mesa se descarta (y cualquier jugador que estuviera elaborando ese bocata, pierde los productos que tuviera en la mesa).<br/><br/>OBJETIVO<br/><br/>Cuando un jugador entrega un pedido se queda esa carta de pedido.<br/>El juego finaliza si 4 pedidos se han descartado o si se muestra el ultimo pedido del mazo.<br/>Al final de la partida, cada jugador suma los puntos de victoria de sus cartas de pedidos. El jugador con mas puntos de victoria es el ganador.<br/><br/>(Aqui puedes encontrar todos los archivos necesarios para imprimir y jugar a tu propio Trollburger)<br/><br/>",

All players start by moving around the amateur circuit. Players enter rodeos by landing on a rodeo square and paying the entry fee. A card is then drawn which gives the player's result in the rodeo and money is awarded. Each rodeo can be entered multiple times.  There are places on the board where players must pay money and some where broke players can earn money. Filling a &quot;permit&quot; (earning a set amount of money) is necessary to move into the pro circuit.<br/><br/>Once in the pro circuit each player must enter and place in each of the 8 pro rodeos.  Each rodeo can only be entered once. Once any player has completed all 8 pro rodeos the finals begin.  Any players still on the amateur circuit are eliminated. All players on the pro circuit roll dice to find out their standings in the final events.  Winnings in the finals are added to money earned in the pro circuit and the winner is the player with the most money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zanshin is a fast-paced bluff-based game about samurai fencing inspired by kendo and &quot;Book of Five Rings&quot;. This game is my attempt to focus gameplay on &quot;learn your opponent&quot; rather than &quot;learn in-game tactics&quot;.<br/>Each player has same hand of skill, bluff and attack cards and five random Strike cards. Each round player try to spend less skill cards than his opponent in order to get advantage or catch an opponent on opposite strike. Players play their skill and bluff cards face down to form their intention for current round, than reacts on opponent's strikes and than ether evade or counterattack.<br/>Three player variant Twofaced Dragon allows player to recreate 2vs1 fight. This variant keeps almost all mechanic from main rules and all players starts with same sets of cards, so wining this fight is very thought challenge for Dragon. I tired to make this variant as close to real situations in kenjutsu as possible. There is no artificial benefits or constrains and every mechanic change justified by real aspect of that kind of fights.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designers Note:<br/><br/>Have found a potentially interested publisher, and several changes to the design have been made. I'm very pleased with them, but this may mean that the description here will change. - Alex<br/><br/>SEVEN WEEKS is a 2 to 3 player Euro-style war game that aims to recreate the maneuvering, bloodshed, and events of the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 in the German and Bohemian theaters. (The Italian front is also represented as an influence upon forces available and overall morale.)<br/><br/>Players represent the Prussians and their North German allies, the Bavarian and Federal German forces (including Baden, Hesse Darmstadt, Nassau, and Wurttemburg amongst others) , and the Habsburgs (who also control the Saxons, Hanoverians, and Kurhessen/Hesse-Kassel forces). The Bavarian and Habsburg forces must work together to stop the Prussians from achieving the historical victory - a crushing blow for the Habsburgs, a defeat for independent states in Germany, and the beginning of a long era of Prussian hegemony over German affairs.<br/><br/>The game utilizes hand management and card driven mechanics. The map is a traditional hex map, depicting major population centers, fortresses, and rail lines. The combat system uses a system of &quot;tactical cards&quot; and battlefield deployment, implementing some fresh ideas intended to represent the player's role as the commander in chief of a military establishment and the necessity of relying upon the battlefield doctrine practiced by his/her forces. Prussian forces, for example, heavily rely upon open order formation and &quot;Schnellfeuer&quot; technique, while the Habsburgs are fond of the &quot;Stosstaktik&quot; approach and rely upon a superior artillery arm. The game is completely diceless.<br/><br/>The aim is to produce an exciting wargame that can easily be played within two hours. The game is currently in playtesting, and hoping for a &quot;Sooner than Later&quot; publication date as we look for a publisher.<br/><br/>",

The Developers aim to build their respective projects by purchasing and improving land on a grid map of a river valley. Meanwhile, the Commission, along with a Banker and Recorder, must maintain the area's environment and settle disputes between developers.<br/>Time is measured in Trade-off with a Monopoly-type track running around the board. A full run of the track represents an in-game year. At each space on the track, events occur that affect the Developers, such as stock market fluctuations or environmental damage.<br/>The game ends when the players agree to finish. At that time, the Developers assess the extent of their accomplishments, while weighing them against the environmental damage they potentially caused. Trade-off is primarily a classroom aid, and so discussion of actual land development is encouraged. No &quot;winning&quot; Development team is chosen officially, but players may use the map and each player's wealth to make a decision regarding victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mechropolis is currently under development.<br/><br/>Mechropolis is a game of adventure, tactical combat, and choose your own adventure-like campaign play.  As added replay value, the game also incorporates a quicker player vs. player combat system included in the base game.<br/><br/>Taking place in the turmoil-ridden machine-city of Mechropolis, players assume the role of a mechanical freedom fighter, and travel the land in attempts to unhinge the current regime ruling the city with an iron (literally!) fist.<br/><br/>Players will have access to hundreds of items, weapons, skills, powers and upgrades, giving them fully customizable characters to play with.<br/><br/>Two ways to play:<br/><br/>1)  Follow the &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style game play in the cooperative campaign and fight against the enemy using tactical combat on a large, interchangeable game board.   Players play against the game itself, no &quot;dungeon master&quot; needed.  While not in combat, player traverse the terrain on the overall city area map, visiting locales, buying/selling scavenged items, and fighting through random encounters.<br/><br/>2)  Play with or against your friends in player vs. player deathmatch, capture the flag, king of the hill, and other team games for a free for all, fun filled action packed gaming experience.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed PC games such as the Jagged Alliance series, X-COM, or Fallout: Tactics, you'll enjoy the tactical game play and customizable options in Mechropolis!<br/><br/>If you like games such as Star Wars: Epic Duals, Frag, and Gunslinger, but wish the game was more epic, strategic, less luck driven and deeper with more replay value, this will be the game for you!<br/><br/>",

Fighting is based on power of the weapon, power of the character's attack strength, and power of the enemies defense strike. The hit points are calculated via 2D6 - the power of the attack. For example, if an attack had a total strength of 6 and a 10 was rolled, the attack would have a power of 4. Victory is achieved by having a character remain on a certain part of the board for three complete uninterrupted turns.<br/><br/>",

Players may attack their opponents during the race in order to slow them down. Before the race, players can build and customize their ship using a points system. Players have 35 points to spend on ship components. Each player has a playing mat that keeps track of all upgrades to the ship as well as damage received from the asteroids and other players. The game also includes an Asteroid deck of cards which players use to track race progress and events.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/>Asteroid Racers is a fast game of resource management and card play. The goal for each player is to be the first to traverse the deadly asteroid belt, racing at brake neck speeds so that you can be the first to cross the finish line and be declared the newest Asteroid Race champion. Be careful though, not only do you have to deal with the dangers of the asteroid belt, but also the other racers, for they will be armed with deadly weapons and missiles, each trying to shoot you down before you can win the race.<br/><br/>",

There are several rules governing traits the dragon can possess, such as no more than 10 attack or defense cards.<br/><br/>The players each have a hand of five cards which they use to build the dragon. At the start of each turn, they will roll an activation die and can only use cards with a value equal to or less than that number. As the players build their dragons, cards that have been placed on the table are playable but only those with a value less than the activation number are active.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/>Dragon Ranchers allows players to build a dragon deck made up of various cards. When both players have constructed a deck, they then battle each other, using attacks and defensive moves as they try to defeat their opponents.<br/><br/>",

Well this were it's at The game is a 3-5 players co-op where players work together to get back to their home dimension (Earth Prime). To do so they must split their forces between completing missions for/against historical figures encountered in alternate worlds and repairing the Navigator, a device that may lead them home... at least before it's out of power.<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/>&hellip;You just woke up... the last thing you remember is being on that late night bus, slipping in and out of consciousness, rocked by the vibrations of the almost retired vehicle. Then you&rsquo;re here, wherever that may be, everything looks strange but familiar, like looking through a cracked mirror. The other passengers are here too, and they found a device they say can take you all home. How do they know? Who knows indeed? It&rsquo;s worth a shot, anyway you&rsquo;re not liking the sounds of whatever is approaching.<br/><br/>You and the others have fallen through the dimensions that make the multiverse, an infinity of alternate realities where the best utopias and the worst nightmares can be found. The strange device you found, this &quot;Navigator&quot;, seems to be the key to get home. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem in good shape. Was it damaged before, is it the cause of your being here, is it some sort of test? All you know is that the batteries are fading fast and you and your fellow multiverse castaways better fix it and find your home dimension before you stay stranded forever...<br/><br/>Aim of the game:<br/>Players must work together to complete the missions set by the Navigator on each world they land and repair the Navigator along the way to ensure that they make it back to their home dimension: Earth Prime. Each turn, the players will encounter a historical figure in a new dimension where things are different and must somehow be righted: a ruthless Benjamin Franklin has sided with the machines to destroy mankind and must be stopped, a benevolent Genghis Khan needs help surviving in a dying world... those are but a few of the thousands of possible missions the players will have to complete before going home.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player receives a character card, indicating their strengths and weaknesses along five stats (Status, Fight, Intellect, Stealth and Tech). Each turn, by revealing one of each Alternate World, Target and Mission cards, the players get to face one of over 25000 challenges. As a group, they decide who will attempt the mission and pool their relevant stats to form the mission dice pool. Scoring more successes than the target in the contest set by the Mission card will allow the other players to repair the Navigator device. It's up to the players to assess their chances against various challenges and decide when to use the precious power left in the Navigator until they reveal the Earth Prime card hidden among 29 Alternate World cards to win the game. However the players can lose the game if the Navigator runs out of power or if they run out of World cards.<br/><br/>",

It plays in approximately 20 minutes.<br/>Players take turn placing and removing pawns (the Colonies) on an hexagonal board (the Asteroid belt) with 5 hexagonal cells (the Asteroids) per side.<br/>Playing the Colonies allow to have the controls of the cells through double-sided discs (the Mines).<br/>Aim of the game is having control of the most valuable group of Mines (a Chain): the value of a Chain is given by the sum of the values of the adjacent Colonies.<br/><br/>The game will participate in an Abstract Strategy Game Design Contest in the mathematics festival &quot;Tutto &egrave; Numero&quot; in Cald&egrave; (Italy) at the end of July 2011<br/><br/>What's so special about Hexteroyd ?<br/><br/>Hexteroyd is a kind of connection game but with several twists:<br/> - First and foremost, you don't need to connect distant parts of the board. You must connect points to... gain points !<br/> - The pawns you use are shared between the players and have a double role: they allow the players to make actions and they are the points themselves: positive if you connect them on the board, negative if you keep them in your hand.<br/> - You don't directly place the connecting pieces on the board: they come into play as a consequence of your playing a pawn, whether you place it on, or remove it from, the board.<br/> - Connecting pieces (the discs) aren't fix, they have a certain degree of variability as the result of players' actions: once they are on the board, they remain on their cell, but they change owner, therefore changing the connected pawns.<br/> Thanks to these characteristics, some parts of the board (usually the peripheral ones) are constantly subject to subtle but meaningful changes and the victory is somewhat uncertain till the end.<br/><br/>The strategic aspect of Hexteroyd originates in the different ways in which you can use pawns: if you tend to empty your hand, you will have more territory control but less mobility; if you keep them in hand you risk to lose points in the end if you can't get rid of them.<br/><br/>",

A player may, in turn, play one card in the middle of the board as in dominoes. Then the player replenishes his hand by drawing a card from the pool. The winner is the player who has the colour of the last card played when the pool is exhausted. The rules give a strategy tip - do not play cards of your own colour until victory looms. This will give you a good chance to play for a win.<br/>Betting is suggested as an option, even onlookers are encouraged to bet on who will win.<br/><br/>",

It is primarily for school lessons in the region of North Rhine Westphalia thought. Thus it can not be ordered or purchased outside of this region.<br/><br/>Players assume the role of owners of printing companies. They are advertising for their business, acquire orders that regulate the number of employees, advertise for public orders. They always have to make sure that the orders are fulfilled on time.<br/>A particularly interesting element is that, the pupils, beyond the basic rules, can arrange their own ways of dealing with the taks: by making arrangements, joint ventures and transmission of orders. The game length is variable. The game ends immediately when a company becomes insolvent.<br/><br/>",

Suspenseful entertainment is the goal, good knowledge of German language is the result. This game is not only fun for children, but adults can enjoy this game as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game from the early days of radio. There are seven sets of seven cards and you use one set per player per game.<br/>Players call out for cards they need to complete their set (in the manner of Pit) and points are scored depending on the place the set originates from e.g. London. Glasgow, etc..The player has to call out &quot;Tuned In to London&quot; or where ever for his set..<br/>There are two special cards:<br/>Oscillator - which is a penalty card if another player calls &quot;Tuned in to xxx&quot; whilst you hold the card.<br/>K.D.K.A. American Broadcast Station - Can be used as a wild card to replace a proper card. If you can complete a set without the use of this card and you have it in your hand, then you score double points for your set.<br/>The cards are rather nice, showing radio call-signs in those first few years.<br/><br/>",

Every turn is timed, so think fast and get out in front of your wily opponents. But watch out for those potholes, oil slicks and pesky squirrels or you'll be digging out splinters from the ditch!<br/><br/>Soapbox Derby features a deck of 45 cards, with four soapbox racers on each card in different configurations that represent race positions (i.e., first, second, third, fourth). There are three face-up card stacks that represent stages of the downhill course, a face-down draw deck, and two face-up cards next to the main draw deck for card options during play. Each turn a player chooses one of two face-up option cards, or one random from the face-down stack, and chooses one of the three open race stage stacks on which to play the card. Placing a card on the first stage stack has no special effect on the race, but placing a card on the second stage stack allows a player to choose one card from the first or third stage stacks and take it out of the race and back to the &quot;pit&quot; - the two option stacks next to the main deck. Placing a card in the third stage stack forces the player to swap the position of that stack with the first or second stack.<br/><br/>The race is timed - three minutes for each heat. Then players score points for the positions of their racers when time runs out. Three heats decides the winner!<br/><br/>",

After players have discovered their secret color and a secret numbered block they take turns pulling blocks from a bag and placing them in the wall. <br/>When the wall is complete, players take turns playing cards from their hand to knock blocks out of the wall. The deck includes a lot of special cards to make cannonballs miss-fire, go long, fall short or even knock 2 blocks off in one shot.<br/>There are a limited number of cannonballs per player, which varies based on the number of players, so when the first player shoots his last cannonball, the round is completed and scores are tallied.<br/><br/>",

The design is what was originally intended but deviated from with the introduction of chess pieces in Linebreakers.<br/><br/>Traplines, like Linebreakers, utilizes custodial trapping and delayed capture.  In this, two pieces of a player will &quot;bookend&quot; a line of enemy pieces and freeze them so they can't move, but can be captured in a future turn.  The origins of the idea came from pondering what would happen if you took Othello/Reversi and moved pieces on the board.  From this the custodial trap, with delayed capture, move came about.<br/><br/>In the game, there are a number of starting configurations and multiple variants that involve capturing opponent's pieces or exiting one's own pieces off the board, in order to win the game.<br/><br/>",

It is ideal for two players, two teams of two, or large multiplayer games.  You collect pairs.  You need to play your pairs in order from Ones to Eights.  You can SEE an opponent's hand, GET a card from their hand, DIG in the discard pile, or destroy their highest pair with a POW!  You can also negate any power card with NOT.<br/><br/>One of the key mechanics is the hand size requirement.  You must always have exactly six cards in hand before playing anything on the board.  Each player starts with six cards.  You draw one card to start your turn, then discard one card to return your hand size to six.<br/><br/>Ocho The Game is incredibly balanced.

        "description": "Token Wars (tm): Battle For Table Plain makes you king of a medieval army. The Table Plain is a coveted trade route once owned by a Merchant Prince, a merchant prince that has been reported dead (though no evidence of his death was ever found). He was loyal to no king and had no heir. Now, eager Kings from adjoining lands battle for control of the Table Plain in hopes that it will bolster their kingdom and further their means. Will you be the victor or will you watch your opponents take control of the land you so covet?<br/><br/>Token Wars is a 2 player head to head battle of skill and strategy. Each player takes control of an army of tokens that they must strategically push into the battle field (any flat surface with very little resistance). The game is played in four rounds with each player having two turns to defend and two turns to attack. In order to win, one player must either kill the other player's king, take the other player's flag, or capture all three of the other player's chests. If at the end of four rounds there is no victor, the player with the most powerful army wins.<br/><br/>Whenever your tokens survive a round, they level-up thereby making your army more powerful.<br/><br/>It is a fun game that is easy to learn but difficult to master.

Align yourself with one or more Royal lines of succession to control the thrones of King, Queen, and Bishop recreating the numerous dynastic civil wars of the Middle Ages.<br/><br/>The Challenge: Your opponents have troops, assassins, and can stage revolts. Rival royalty and their factions may attempt to imprison you - or worse - gather the right support to condemn your royal to death by execution.<br/><br/>Just like the power struggles of the Middle Ages you'll soon be facing fierce competition for political and military power, which quickly becomes shamelessly ruthless, viciously vengeful, hilariously melodramatic, and just plain fun!<br/><br/>If you are fascinated by the pomp, power, and melodrama of Medieval royalty and their struggles for power - this is the game for you!<br/><br/>The objective is score as many points as possible by claiming sovereignty over territories and controlling the royal thrones. Players maneuver to capture the Thrones of King, Queen, and Bishop of the Realm and control their lucrative territories - scoring points along the way. The first player to reach a predetermined number of points is declared the Supreme Sovereign of the Realm and game winner.<br/><br/>Every player is entitled to make one common play during their turn. Common plays represent the powers of the lower classes and a treacherous noble&rsquo;s access to the royal court. For example, revolts were ways the populace kept royalty and their policies in check. Assassins often gained access to royalty with the help of treacherous nobility. Both of these cards (Revolt and Assassin) represent real threats to royalty who fail to protect themselves.<br/><br/>Royalty may make an additional Royal play during their turn. Royal plays represent the unique powers of reigning royalty and are easy to identify by the Royal Play scroll on top of each card. They can be used to protect your royalty (for example, Troops) and to eliminate hostile ones (Royal Execution).<br/><br/>Play Options: Teams; Role Playing; Historical Based Games; Adding the Medieval England Feudal Deck; Adding the Medieval Combat Deck, Alliances and Pledges.<br/><br/>",

Each plane is different with its own aircraft&rsquo;s characteristics with a series of specific manoeuvres and special abilities, hence making it distinguishable from the other members of the squadron. CW, allows players to customize both flight style and combat technique, consequently the same model of aircraft can perform a varied range of manoeuvres or be endowed with a series of specific special abilities, depending on the Plane Data Sheet (PDS). The sPDS of the squadrons are based on historical facts and list the characteristics, abilities and hardware of the most renowned squadrons of the FWW which, in combination with the mission allow players to recreate the entire history of the war.<br/>Throughout each game, players are awarded experience points which in turn permit a series of abilities or manoeuvres, the ultimate aim of which is to be awarded the category of ace.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Million is a tabletop game of futuristic combat between fighters in high-tech combat armor. It was published in 2001 in the French gaming magazine Backstab, issue #35.<br/><br/>The game is played on a square playing surface of one meter length. The magazine provides counters for the playing pieces and scenery, but players are advised to build their own scenery and use plastic or metal miniatures.<br/><br/>Each player first builds a combat armor using a set number of points, buying systems in each of three categories (Mobility, Offence and Defense). Each of these systems is represented by a counter. These counters also represent the armor's &quot;hit points&quot;: once a player runs out of counters, the armor is considered to be too badly damaged and the player is off the game.<br/><br/>Each player then makes three piles of face-down counters (one for each system), put her figure in one corner and play begins.<br/><br/>Each turn, each player secretly chooses two of three systems to activate (Mobility and Offence for example). Players then reveal their choices, draw enough counters from their activated systems to replenish their hand to five counters, and roll a d10 for initiative (players can expend counters to gain a bonus on the initiative roll). Each player then take an action, alternating between players until there are no possible actions left or each player passes, at which point another turn begins. Each player can take a move action and a shoot action each turn, and also play counters as an action.<br/><br/>Damage is resolved by rolling on a damage table with a lot of different results (loss of counters, fighter pushed back and/or stunned...). The last fighter standing wins the game.<br/><br/>",

A player who ends in a dead zone is not allowed to count any single scoring event more than the holes remaining to the final hole. (A player can score normally from the final hole.)<br/><br/>The deck also includes Jokers, which may count as any card. Their value can change between pegging and counting out the hands.<br/><br/>A variant, HyperCribbage-7, includes seven card hands and cribs (and much larger maximum scoring combinations), and is played twice around the board.<br/><br/>As in Cribbage, players are each dealt a hand of 6 cards, of which they discard 2 into a special pile called the Crib.  One card is then cut from draw pile and turned face up - it is considered part of each player's hand and of the Crib.  The players then alternately play a card, scoring points for hitting certain totals, or for making sets or sequences.  Score is kept by moving pegs around tracks on the cribbage board.  This is repeated until all players have exhausted their hand of cards.  Once all players are out of cards, each player picks up his hand and determines all possible scoring combinations, pegging points again on the cribbage board.  The dealer then picks up the Crib and scores it for all possible points.  Then the cards are shuffled, the deal alternates, and the process is repeated.  The winner is the first person to peg 121 or more points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Des Crus et des Vins is a French game about exploring French wineyards and collecting fine wines. The game can be played by 3 to 6 players, one of them acting as gamemaster. The goal of the game is to be the first to collect 300 bottles of wines in a week (7 turns).<br/><br/>Each player starts the game by creating a character by rolling dice and consulting tables to determine what type of car she has, her driving style, and where in France her family is located (the character can spend the night in this region for free). The gamemaster prepares a secret list of hazards (car accidents, police controls...), and each player picks a town to start from.<br/><br/>Each turn, each player takes turn telling the gamemaster what her character's actions for the day are (driving, resting, visiting wineyards and ordering wine, where to spend the night). The gamemaster consults his list of hazards and the game tables and resolves the consequences (a character who is a fast driver will gain more fatigue points than a cautious driver for example).<br/><br/>At the end of the seven turns, the player with the best wine collection and the most money left is declared winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1st Blitzkrieg simulates the course of the military operations in Central Europe at beginning of the World War II, where the new doctrine of Blitzkrieg, based on armored and air forces was used by the aggressor to crush the defender within weeks rather than months.<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>Units are generally Divisions and Brigades.<br/>Each Turn represents 4 days.<br/>Each hex represents ca. 25-30 km<br/><br/>Mechanics is hex and counter, of course. Activation uses the chit - pull system. Generally one chit represents one army and units can only be actvated once during the turn. Except for German panzer and motorized units, which can also be activated by special chit &quot;Schenlltruppen&quot;. That makes the Polish player feels like he can be really outmaneuvred by the Germans.<br/><br/>Important factor is use of the air force. It can either support combat or interdict movement of ground units and rail transports. Luftwaffe can really dominate the sky.<br/><br/>Combat table seems to be pretty &quot;normal&quot; - it has 6 rows, but you are rolling 2 dice instead of one. Unlike many other games, the results are not added but substracted... The range is from 0 to 5. After calculating the probability you may notice, that 1 is the most likely result (16,6 %) and 5 is the less likely result...<br/><br/>Depending on the scenario, the players take part in:<br/>- the historical First Blitzkrieg &ndash; German strike on Poland in September 1939, <br/>- the alternative Red Blitzkrieg coming from the East, or<br/>- the hypothetic Blitzkrieg of 1938 (the defense of Czechoslovakia).<br/><br/>In the 1939 historical scenario Wehrmacht is superior to Polish forces. But do not worry, PL gains VP either for holding terrain objectives or inflicting causalties to German units. German player must eliminate PL unit to gain VP for it. Therefore, usually the Polish player has more VP during the game - and the German player must perform a really good Blitzkrieg to gain victory.<br/><br/>What is more, the players will get a chance to play the Red Blitzkireg scenario, and check how Polish Army can act vs. the Red Army. This scenario shows the actual Soviet deployment of 1939 versus Polish defense plan East, which was only theoretical.<br/><br/>Another what if scenario is Czechoslovakian defense of 1938, supposing that the Munich dictate was rejected. There are quite heavy fortifications along the border, and the Wehrmacht isn't as strong as it was it 1939. In expanded version, this scenario is going to be for 4 players: Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and USSR.<br/><br/>",

Players keep matched cards in front of them to track points.  The dealer then brings all players back up to 7 cards.  Then a new target card is drawn.  When there are not enough cards left to bring everyone to 7 cards, the game is over.  <br/>An alternate rule set eliminates the target card and plays 11 rounds using the numbers 1 to 10 and a wild round where each player names their own target number.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Discover this exciting new way of playing Baseball. You are now the Manager of your own team. You can make every choice that a major league manager makes. You decide when to HIT and RUN, whet to STEAL a base, or when to use your all important PINCH HITTERS! This game is as easy to play as real baseball. It's hours of family fun at home and at parties, for everyone.<br/><br/>Each manager places his four base runner discs in the dug out. The pinch hitter is placed in the bull pen and moved up one space as they are used. Place the out disc at the top of the playing field and move it as outs are made. The manager whose team is at bat should place his first batter at home plate (H). Take the dice and say aloud which play he is trying from the ten selection at the top of the game board. Example: Aloud &quot;Bunt for hit&quot;, now pitch the dice. Combine the face value of the dice roll and find the result of the play on the board under the play selection. Each time a base runner crosses home plate one run is scored to that team.<br/><br/>",

The first release, the Titan Battle Set, would feature the Greek myths. The 130 card set (including holographic cards) would be available in 60-card starter decks and 11-card booster packs . The second release would have been the Wrath of the Gods expansion set.<br/><br/>Cards were divided into three different levels: Level 1 was mere mortals, Level 2 was powerful creatures and heroes, and Level 3 was the realm of the gods. Defeating an opponent at each level would give a player access to the next level of characters and cards. Location and Action cards would supplement a player's battle tactics.<br/><br/>A pre-release set of 104 cards was published and demo decks were shown at game stores. A two-day tournament was held in Virginia Beach, Virginia. The game was scheduled to be in stores by Summer 2001, then Summer 2002, then Winter 2003. The project was cancelled before its official release.<br/><br/>",

CARD-tamen Rome also works beautifully as a stand-alone game involving topics from Ancient Roman culture. This game plays well in any setting, in or out of the classroom.<br/><br/>CARD-tamen is an exciting new card game developed by The Pericles Group, LLC. Intended to promote intelligent discussion and debate about a myriad of topics, CARD-tamen consists of decks of CARDs (Classical Attunement Reward Devices) organized around particular themes.<br/><br/>GamePlay: Players shuffle their decks and deal themselves seven CARDs at random. Players have two minutes to provide the most compelling argument as to why their chosen CARD wins a controversy selected by a d20 roll from a list provided with the game. The player who rolls the die to choose the controversy also makes the first argument. An independent iudex (judge) determines whose argument is more compelling. That player is awarded a point. The first player to three points is the winner of CARD-tamen&trade;.<br/><br/>There are also rule variants for 3+ players and integration into the practomimetic Latin curriculum, Operation LAPIS.<br/><br/>",

The game is comprised of six rounds were each player takes a turn to try and beat the odds or try not to lose too much money.<br/><br/>Cra$h is a simple game and was envisioned to help parents encourage basic mathematics skill and to open children up to the idea of the stock market.<br/><br/>Cra$h uses 6 ten sided dice as the amount of money you wager on the stock market. you may choose to roll up to all six dice. This is then compared to the market mood die (the 7th d10) anything below this number loses cash(k), anything that beats the market gains cash(k), anything that matches gains 10k.When a Player rolls triples it causes a crash and all players need to roll to see how much they lost. With each player starting with only 50K this game is fast!<br/><br/>The game continues until there is only one player left or whoever has the most money at the end of six rounds.<br/><br/>Leiker Games<br/>Give us a &quot;Leik&quot; on Facebook!<br/><br/>",

But, when things don't quite work out you can lose points. Starting with Make Frank's Monsters 1, each of the four games are a little more complex and strategic then the previous game.<br/><br/>The  deck consists of 64 cards: the 4 types of cards,  in 4 different colors (Red, Blue, Yellow and Gray) with 4 of each card in the deck. In the first two games the colors are not used, but in the last two they are. There are also two kinds of  tokens (the +3 tokens and the -1 tokens) which are used for scoring.<br/><br/>",

The box contains a board pierced with holes, around 400 wooden coloured matchstick-type pieces and the rules. Each player controls his own fleet at the same time trying to locate the enemy forces.<br/>I think this must be a Battleships-type game but the pieces, that you thrust through the board to hopefully score a hit, are different colours and this must have some effect on game-play. The manufacturer describe it a &quot;Thrill for Adults&quot;. But, covering all bases, it is also suggested for children. Nice to see wooden components.<br/><br/>",

The important part of the rules, the Game of Stars, is a card game in the spirit of Black Maria in Britain or Hearts in America.<br/>Two to four persons can play. The cards rank in the order indicated by the number in the corner, 1 being low. The cards are dealt one at a time until each player has eight cards. The object of the game is to avoid taking tricks which contain cards in the unlucky suit of Stars. There are four suits, Squares, Circles, Diamonds and Stars. The highest numbered card of suit played wins the trick. Players must follow suit if they can. After each hand every player counts the number of unlucky cards (Stars) he has had to take. Every Star card counts one against him and the winner of each hand wins one point for each Star card in his opponents' tricks. First player to get 25 points wins the game. <br/>The unlucky Stars are:<br/>1. Pride<br/>2. Danger<br/>3. Malice<br/>4. Gossip<br/>5. Calamity<br/>6. Envy and Jealousy<br/>7. Sickness<br/>8.

The deck is shuffled and than each player is dealt 6 cards face down. Each player places his cards in front of him in a row with the face down. The rest of the cards go in the center to draw from. The starting player reveals the first card of the stack and chooses a card in front of him that he replaces with the drawn card face up. He than reveals the replaced card and gives it to his left neighbor. That player again chooses one of his cards to be replaced by the given card. <br/>The first player to form a row of six ascending numbers wins the game.<br/><br/>Flaggenspiel is a regular game of Memory.<br/><br/>",

Here the cold sea is studded with floating mountains of ice, turning the waters into a frothing tempest that can crush the hulls of the strongest ships and freeze the bodies of the unfortunate sailors who dared to sail there. The land beyond the frozen sea is Ultima Thule.'<br/><br/>Wargods of Hyberborea is a tabletop miniatures game using metal miniatures that is closely related to Wargods of Aegyptus and Wargods of Olympus. Unlike many other tabletop miniatures wargames, the Wargods system uses hidden activation counters in order to simulate fog of war.<br/><br/>In this reincarnation, players simulate massive battles in the land of Ultima Thule by taking control of a race of fierce creatures called the Wendigo, who are led to battle by formidable Ice Witches, masters of snow and wind. Although one off clashes occur frequently between warring factions, Wargods of Hyberborea offers dedicated warmongers an immersive game play experience through campaign play. In campaigns, players play through scenarios, progressing to differing scenarios and acquiring new special powers for their Wargod depending on who the victor is.<br/><br/>",

Players sit opposite each other<br/>2. Remove coins from bottom of box (undernearth plastic tray).  Place coins at random, (in full view of both players) one under each of 10 &quot;money bags&quot; (2 bags will remain empty).<br/>3. Dealer shuffles the small Coin Selection Cards (those depicting the actual coins used in the game) and deals five to himself and five to his opponent, alternating and FACE UP. During the subsequent play of the game, each player will try to obtain as many of the coins shown on his small cards as possible. Obviously, this combination of coins will change with each game.<br/>4. Dealer shuffles the Playing Cards and deals five cards to himself and five cards to his opponent, alternating, and FACE DOWN.  The remaining cards are placed faced down in the DRAW tray.<br/>5. Players pick up the five playing cards. The dealer draws a card and must then play a card from his hand either in front of him to count toward his score, or into the discard tray. At no time after playing a card may a player have more than five cards remaining in his hand.<br/>6. If a player has a SEARCH CARD, he may play it face down in the discard tray and then &quot;search&quot; for one of his coins (designated on his Coin Selection Cards).  He does this by touching one of the &quot;money bags&quot; and declaring, for example &quot;the Turkish kurus is in this bag.&quot; He then lifts the &quot;bag&quot; and if the Turkish kurus IS underneath the &quot;bag&quot;, he removes the coin and places it in front of him as part of his score.  He then replaces the &quot;money bag&quot;.  As the game progresses, ocoins and empty areas will be exposed and it will become increasingly important to remember their locations.  If a player exposes one of his opponent's coin, he merely replaces the bag and it is the opponent's turn.  If the opponent has a SEARCH CARD, he is in the happy position of eing able to acquire a coin immediately.  Players draw and play cards alternately.<br/>7. If a player has a $5,000 or $2,000 COIN CARD he may hold it for future play, he may play it face up in front of him counting toward his score, or he may discard it.<br/>8. If a player has a WINDFALL CARD he may lift ANY bag and remove the coin - IF it is one of HIS coins.<br/>9. If a player has an ILLEGAL COIN CARD, he may play it on his opponent's score pile. The opponent then may not play ANY card except a LEGAL COIN CARD or a SEARCH CARD on his next turn. In the meantime he must discard one card into the discard tray after every draw. If he plays a SEARCH CARD, this permits him to search for a coin. If he plays a LEGAL COIN CARD, he takes no further action until his next turn.<br/>10. If the &quot;Draw&quot; tray is emptied before the game ends, reshuffle those in the &quot;discard&quot; tray and continue play.<br/><br/>WHO WINS:<br/>The first player to accumulate $100,000 or more in coins and cards. Actual coins from COIN CARDS count $20,000 each.  The COIN CARDS count $2,000 or $5,000 according to their face value.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets four cards face up on the table.  The remaining cards form a draw pile, and one card is turned up for the discard pile.<br/><br/>The turn starts by drawing one card.  At this point, you may trade an &quot;Oh Bother&quot; card (which has a picture of an object and character) that belongs to another player for one of their cards.  The receiving player takes the card, turns all of their cards face down, and shuffles them.  The giving player picks one of the cards and adds to their hand.  The turn ends with a discard.<br/><br/>If you get a &quot;Busy Bee&quot; card, and are the first one to discard this card when another player shouts &quot;Honey!&quot; to signify they have four hunny pots, you get to take one Hunny Pot card from the player.  The first player to avoid the bees and get the &quot;Hunny is Yummy&quot; card by holding four hunny pots wins.<br/><br/>Alternate rule sets for younger players eliminate the Busy Bee cards and players try to collect all six &quot;Oh Bother&quot; cards that match their character.<br/><br/>",

In most cases, the &quot;randomness&quot; of the die-rolling is used to set-up the game, but does not influence who will win.<br/><br/>All that is needed to play are 36 six-sided dice in six different (non-black) colors, and an additional 36 six-sided black dice (for most of the games). One also requires a chessboard, and some require keeping score with pen and paper.<br/><br/>SIX D &quot;ONE&quot;: A tactical game that allows each player to get creative and &quot;make&quot; a gameboard to stump the other players. Play consists of claiming a spot on the gameboard each turn, scoring for pip count and connections with other claimed spots.<br/>SIX D &quot;TWO&quot;: Roll a big pile of dice and take turns removing two dice of the same color. When all the dice have been removed, or there are no more matches left, whoever has the most pips showing on all the dice they've removed is the winner! <br/>SIX D &quot;THREE&quot;: Relying the most on luck of any of these games, the gameboard consists of a 6x6 grid of randomly rolled black dice. Players draw a &quot;hand&quot; of three dice (which they roll), and can play them on the gameboard in any space matching the pip count shown. Points are scored for matching adjacent die in color or pip count.<br/>SIX D &quot;FOUR&quot;: A &quot;pure&quot; abstract strategy game, played on a chess board, where you'll need to capture your own pieces in order to capture the black pieces that ensure victory.<br/>SIX D &quot;FIVE&quot;: A simple but strategic dice stacking game for 3 to 6 players. Place your dice matching the dice already in play. You'll need to think in three dimensions for this one! <br/>SIX D &quot;SIX&quot;: A game that involves identifying rows and columns on the gameboard consisting of &quot;same color, different pip count&quot;, or &quot;different color, same pip count&quot;. Players will place the pieces they identify into a personal play area, scoring points as they do.<br/><br/>The complete rules for each game are available in this PDF: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://chesstris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6D6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://chesstris.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/6D6.pdf</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "200 Steps to Freedom is an educational trivia game based on the American Revolution.  The game was published by American Way Games and &quot;copyright&quot; in 1776 (but published in 1977).<br/><br/>The gameboard has two different paths, either the 100 Days or the 100 People path.  At the start of the game, the players decide if they would like to play either the 100 Days or the 100 People path.  All player tokens are then placed at the start of this path.  Each player in turn will roll the die and move the number of spaces on the die.    The 100 Days path has 100 different dates on the spaces, while the 100 people has 100 different people listed on the path.  The player then must state one or more facts about the person or the date that they landed on, and if they are correct then they would get a point.  For example, if they land on December 14, 1782, the player would get a point if they state that The British pulled out of Charleston South Carolina.  Once all players finish the selected path then all of the player pawns are then placed back at the start for phase two, the Question phase.  The players then move around the track again, only this time when they land on a space they get to answer a multiple choice question from the book that corresponds to their space that they landed on.   Every correct answer gets one point.   Once all players cross the finish line of the question phase then the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

A sketch of a notation<br/>system is included to allow for correspondence play and record keeping.  Theoretically compatible with the ELO rating system for tournament or ladder play.<br/><br/>In Lazy King, players must move their King to a goal space on the opposite side of the board.  Sounds easy, right?  One hitch: the king is extremely lazy, and cannot move on his own.  So, other pieces must escort the king to safety.  But beware, the more pieces that escort the king, the slower they move.  Avoid the trap squares, mind the walls, and trick the opponent into a false sense of security.<br/><br/>",

In his/her turn, a player places a new triangle to the game area, trying to form color areas that are as large as possible. Interestingly, a triangle cannot only placed with full contact to another triangle, but also with half contact, so the game area can take a rather unusual shape. For each color area that a player adds to, a point is scored for each corner involved (including orange corners). The goal is to score the highest number of points this way.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ABOUT THE GAME <br/>Mining was their only livelihood. It was expected to be a normal working day when suddenly the upper galleries of the gold and copper mine collapsed, causing the miners to be trapped for months. In this rescue mission game, you and your team must try to overcome all odds in order to rescue these thirty three (33) trapped miners. To be successful, you and your team must meet all the government&rsquo;s mandatory health, safety and environment (HSE) standards, acquire the necessary gears, and endeavor to avoid danger zones. Remember, the perils and rewards are high - just when you think you are about to enter the chamber to rescue a trapped miner, your mission might suffer a setback as the other rescue team progresses. This game is about individual effort, team work, risk, strategy and sacrifice.<br/><br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2 - 6. <br/>AGES: 12yrs to adult.<br/>PLAYING TIME: 45-60 minutes.<br/><br/>YOUR CHALLENGE <br/>Your team&rsquo;s objective is to rescue as many trapped miners as possible. This process is not without its challenges such as: the unavailability of cash to acquire the necessary gears, risky danger zones, overcoming fluctuating gear costs imposed by the Greedy Merchant and the ability to meet the mandatory standards imposed by the government through its agency The Bureau of Standards. Lives are at stake! The longer you wait, the more unlikely it will be that the trapped miners will survive. Can you rise to the challenge? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENTS<br/>The game box consists of game rules and instructions, 1 board, 1 dice, 33 tokens (depicting the trapped miners), 6 player pawns, 6 rescue gear kits (or placeholders for the players&rsquo; gears), 42 tokens (depicting the gears), 1 game price chart, 1 debtor sheet, 20 Bank Notes of $5, 30 Bank Notes of $10 and $20 respectively, 6 &lsquo;holding card placeholders, and 2 decks of cards (HSE and Bureau of Standards). The deck of HSE cards are 35 in total and the deck of Bureau of Standards cards are 42 in total.<br/><br/>",

From your perch atop the ruling class, you&rsquo;ll bankrupt other players, drag them before show trials, carve them up in unnecessary surgery or just get one of your big labor goons to wack &lsquo;em in Rocko Roulette.<br/><br/>Rather than accumulate wealth in Spread the Wealth Around, you&rsquo;ll rack up mountains of debt just like Obama&rsquo;s America. Scam dead people and collect their Social Security in Public Office. Unplug granny and play the lawsuit lottery in ObamaCare. Gamble and go burnin&rsquo; and lootin&rsquo; with Big Labor. Cut in line for your Wall Street bailout it&rsquo;s all for the children.<br/><br/>Spread the Wealth Around is the perfect gift to cure that troglodyte Republican friend or conservative relation. No need for sensitivity training or coaching on tax and spend Obamanomics. Put away those teacher&rsquo;s union pamphlets and Mao&rsquo;s little red book.

So when he's found dead in suspicious circumstances, floating face-down in the swimming pool of his mansion, surrounded by a hundred scattered red roses, the whole film world is shocked to its core. There's no business like show business, they say, but when it comes to murder, a suspect is just a suspect. And one, or more, of Rick Toad's illustrious clients is about to get fingered for killing the most powerful man in entertainment. Your task is to discover who that killer is. Fortunately the famous Inspector McClue is on hand to assist your investigations.<br/>The guests are: MARILYN MANSFIELD - The blonde bombshell whose flamboyant life both on-and-off-screen has delighted the gossip columnists for years.<br/>ROCK HOUSTON - rugged, rough and rowdy, Houston was the biggest male star of them all, the ultimate in American masculinity; now he's going into politics and talking about running for the presidency.<br/>MARLON MEAN - The most famous teenager in the world. Mean is actually 27-years-old now, but he's still making a career out of screen rebellion.<br/>PRINCESS KELLY OF RURITANIA - before her marriage to the Crown Prince, the most eligible bachelor in Europe, Princess Kelly was simple Kelly Kennedy, the sophisticated star of romantic comedies.<br/>MADAME VELDA - clairvoyant to the stars, she has been a familiar figure in Hollywood circles for many years, predicting the future with surprising accuracy.<br/>WAYNE FONDA - also known as the Hillbilly Hero, Fonda is a rock and roll singer who might just cut it in the movies.<br/>MAE VEST - author, actress and activist, Miss Vest is seldom seen without a devoted young man on her arm, a glass of champagne in her hand, and a quip on her lips.<br/>SALVADOR DILLY-DALLY - Europe's most famous surrealist artist has come to Hollywood to work in the movies, and to make his fortune.<br/>The game includes invitations: simply choose which of your friends play which devious suspect and invite them to come along as that character. Also included are menu suggestions, recipes and of course, a really tasty murder to solve!<br/><br/>",

Each carts' contents overlap so taking fruit from the cart affects fruit taken later from the same cart. Using only cards, the Venn idea was definitely abstracted a bit.<br/> In Damsels in Distress, the players are wicked queens/witches that have determined through their talking mirrors, that damsels in the area are more fairer than they. Taking the fruit they poison the apples, feed the monkeys, draw cards, and hinder the prince charming on his way to save the damsel. The apples if given to the damsel before the prince arrives, will put the damsel into a deep sleep (coma). The player who does this will gain the prestige for doing so, of her wicked guild of witches and warlocks. The charming Prince of each Kingdom is headed towards his Kingdom's damsels, and each round saves one, unless hindered (slipping on a banana peel, perhaps? Or better yet, attacked by a band of flying monkeys?). In this community of Witches, there is more prestige for a collection of damsels from different Kingdoms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fields of Battle is a simple tabletop wargaming ruleset published in Warlock (Issue 12 - Oct/Nov 1986). The game is designed to introduce Fighting Fantasy gamebooks readers to tabletop gaming.<br/><br/>The rules are derived from the Fighting Fantasy rules: each unit has a STRIKE and a STRENGTH rating (which work like FF's SKILL and STAMINA), and a MOVE and ATTACK score. Move is the distance the unit can move in inches, Attack the number of attacks per turn (most units have only one).<br/><br/>Each game turn, units move or fire, then combat between units in contact is resolved (each unit adds a 2d6 roll to its STRIKE rating, the unit with the lowest result loses 2 points of STRENGTH). After combat resolution, units that have suffered losses must pass a morale test or rout. A routing unit must test morale again in the next turn and is removed from the game if it fails that second test.<br/><br/>The rules also include a few special rules for flank attacks, cover, fortifications and siege engines.<br/><br/>The rules come with a scenario (The Battle of Grey Rock) for which colour counters are included in the magazine.<br/><br/>",

Weather the disasters that affect your production, resources, and RIGS.  Manage to produce not only Luxuries, but other needed Energy, Metal, Supply resources to keep your operation running and growing.  Then, sell the Luxuries on the ever-changing market.  Make deals with other players for simple trades or pacts against other players.  In the end, final value of all resources a player has (except RIGS... no one wants those troublesome things) is determined.

There is a tray which fits in the box, and the 25 Little Baby Tiles are placed randomly on the tray.  A plastic punchout overlay sits on these tiles, and 24 slider tiles are placed on this with one space open.  This will give you something similar to a Sliding Puzzle.<br/><br/>Players each have 3 face-up Big Mommy Tiles.  On your turn, choose one of your face-up tiles and announce that you're looking for its associated Little Baby Tile.  You get up to 5 slide-moves to try to find it.  A slide-move consists of moving an adjacent Slider Tile into the open space.  This will uncover a different Little Baby Tile where the tile used to be.  You may continue sliding tiles until you either find the match for the Big Mommy Tile you named, or you have moved five Slider Tiles.<br/><br/>Tiles match if they have a Mommy and Baby of the same animal (the game rules includes pictures of all the matching sets).  They also will have the upper and lower case versions of the same letter.  If you uncover a match on your turn, take a &quot;MATCH&quot; Scoring Token and cover the Big Mommy Tile.

On your turn, you roll two dice, which show the five animals and a question mark. You then have to turn over two adjacent tiles that show the animals shown on the dice. If you roll a question mark, you may choose what animal you will turn over. If you turn over a correct pair, you gain a friends token. The tiles are turned facedown again, and are covered with a cloud token. Until another successful pair has been turned over, the two covered tiles cannot be used again.<br/><br/>You win the game when you have collected four, five or seven friends tokens(depending on the number of players).<br/><br/>",

Each space on the spinner has two colors with associated numbers. When the spinner lands on a spot, both cars with the appropriate color move the number of spaces indicated. (For example: There's a spinner spot that shows a yellow 5 and a blue 3. When the spinner lands on this spot, the Yellow Car moves five spaces, and the Blue Car moves three.<br/><br/>Cars may change lanes if they have an unoccupied spot to move to. (A car that is boxed in my even move backwards to get free.) If two cars &quot;collide&quot; by occupying the same space, then the car that initiated the collusion is penalized two laps, and the car that got hit, one lap.<br/><br/>The number of laps is determined by player agreement at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Game includes a board, four plastic cards, and an insert with a spinner and a series of peg holes to track the laps. (Some plastic pegs are also included.)<br/><br/>There is no indication of copyright year on the box, but based on other similar titles by the same publisher, it was probably produced in the 1960s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This title includes 4 &quot;Exciting&quot; race games Grand Pree Road Race, Demolition Derby, Drag Race Championships, &amp; The 500 Mile Race. These games share some of the same components, but each game has a unique board, and two of the games have card decks just for them. It appears that none of these games were ever produced separately. All games may be played solo, or with a number of other players based on the game.<br/><br/>Grand Pree Road Race<br/><br/>Players use cars 1 through 12 and move the their cars around a game board track as instructed by a spinner and by use of a deck of cards that comes with the game. Special rules govern how many cars may occupy a space, and which car(s) get to move in the event of too may cars heading toward the same space. First player to pass the finish line wins.<br/><br/>Demolition Derby<br/><br/>Up to 30 cars may be included, although 10 players seems to me the suggested maximum. (This allows each player to control three cars.) Game is played on the Demolition Derby board which features some Safe spots where cars may not be hit.<br/><br/>Cars move by means of a spinner (numbered 1 to 30) to determine which car is moved and a special deck of cards which determines distance and direction of movement. (Some cards allow for a choice about direction.) Since there is a set turn order, a player may end up moving an opponent's car.<br/><br/>When a car passes onto or over another car, the stationary car takes a Hit. Cars that take three Hits are eliminated from the game and removed from play. A wipe-off scoreboard with a crayon and a felt eraser are included to keep track of Hits. Play continues until only one car remains.<br/><br/>Drag Race Championships<br/><br/>Again all 30 cars are used. The game uses the Drag Race board. Before play begins, the 1-30 spinner is used to determine which cars are in which Heats. Play progresses by using the 1-12 spinner which shows which color car is moved, along with the roll of a single die to determine distance. One car advances from each of the 6 Heats. A final round is played to determine the Champion.<br/><br/>The 500 Mile Race<br/><br/>This game is played on the box insert which shows an oval track with various Sequence Tables printed in the center. Game may be played with up to 30 players, each controlling an individual car. The game starts with the Sequence Marker on Sequence Table &quot;A&quot;. Two dice are rolled and the numbers are added together. (The Sequence Table contains results from 2 to 12.) The result of the Sequence Table tells which cars may be moved... these cars are all advanced 3 spaces on the track. In the next turn the Sequence Marker is advanced and Sequence Table &quot;B&quot; is used. The Sequence Marker moves each turn, and goes back to Table A again if the game last long enough. Some Sequence Table results show hazards like Crash, Pit Stop, etc. The 1-30 spinner is used to determine which car is affected.<br/><br/>Four cars abreast stop cars behind them from advancing. However, there are a couple of spots on the board where cars are considered to crash if there are ever four cars on them. (This cuts down on the amount of log jams in a really crowded game.) Play continues until a car crosses the finish line. In the event of a tie, play continues until one car advances ahead of another.<br/><br/>The (many) game elements for this title include: one double-sided rules sheet, 30 die-cut pressboard cars, a sequence marker, a double-sided game board (with the Grand Pree race board on one side, and the Demolition Derby and Drag Race boards on the other), a wipe-off scoreboard (for Demolition Derby), a crayon &amp; felt eraser, a 1-30 spinner, a 1-12 spinner, two 6-sided dice, a deck of 20 cards with an image of a tire on the back (for Grand Pree Road Race), &amp; a deck of 20 cards with checkered flags on the back (for Demolition Derby).<br/><br/>No publication date is included with this title.<br/><br/>",

It's up to your choice - if you gain a 1 or 5, to roll the remaining 2 dice again for all or nothing (early 'Can't Stop).<br/><br/>Remarks:<br/>Due to (sometimes) small changes it's very difficult to track versions and define the publishing date of the first edition;<br/>there are (at least) 3 different Gr&auml;fe editions and from 1970 the Spika one; if you check the boards you can detect a (confused?) numbering system - see images. <br/>Some Sellers (e.g. on ebay) declare a publishing date mid 1935, but to my knowlegde those 'Bikini maids', printed on the early edition were not permitted/accepted by National Socialists.

Then, that number of cards is drawn; there is a word on each card.<br/><br/>Now, the players have to search for the words in the puzzle and mark them on their sheet. The round ends when a player has found all the words. Then, each player gains one point for each word found. The player that has gained the most points after four rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>The puzzles do not only contain each German word, but also the English translation, which makes it possible to use this game to learn English.<br/><br/>",

The drawn card&rsquo;s Event is revealed/ read aloud to the others after which players can bid for the event by playing cards from their deck. The winner of the bidding will then take procession of the card, adding it to their &ldquo;Portfolio&rdquo;. A card that is not claimed will go into the discard pile. Instead of drawing a card a player can also &ldquo;Pass&rdquo; and exchange any or all of the cards in their hand for new cards from the deck, or to &ldquo;cash in&rdquo; the point values of their cards to advance their &ldquo;Epistemology, Axiology or Political&rdquo; track markers. Players can also exchange cards in their deck for &ldquo;Mentor&rdquo; cards that can be used for various game functions.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to acquire a portfolio of Challenge and Opportunity event cards, as well as a number of sufficient Axiology, Epistemology and Political points to pass the Praxis III (professional licensing) exam and win the game.

Players are investors looking to make more than just financial returns by helping local entrepreneurs in Hawai'i develop sustainability-oriented businesses like organic farms, geothermal plants, green building companies, solar installers, and bike shops. The game is ideal for those who are interested in sustainability as a better way to do business, and can be played by 2-4 players ages 13+. It's also a great learning tool, and the parent company has produced free downloadable lesson planning materials for teachers! Check out <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.GBOHawaii.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.GBOHawaii.com</a> for more info on that.<br/><br/>The game consists of a beautiful board with the map of Hawai'i, several decks of playing cards used in the game, a green business property deck of businesses you can invest in, dice, player pieces, and a stack of money.<br/><br/>The game is set in Hawai'i, and players act as impact investors. Their goal is to start businesses that have a triple bottom line effect: make money, create good paying green jobs, and deal with three main environmental challenges of energy, food, and waste. To establish businesses, players must obtain certain resources like human resources (entrepreneurs, green collar workers, and the wild card--green MBA's). Some businesses require permits, mostly for larger developments and energy projects, and it's a humorous twist on permitting processes in local governments--full of possibilities and potential frustrations. Players must also navigate public policy and chance events that may or may not be helpful in achieving the goal of a sustainable economy in Hawai'i.<br/><br/>The player with the best Triple Bottom Line (people, planet, profit) score wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game - an action-packed game of survival and Zombie combat.<br/><br/>Can your band of survivors escape the Zombie-infested village of Endicott before the town falls victim to an eradicating nuclear purge? Or will you become infected by the Undead and turn on your allies? The possibilities are endless in a game that utilizes randomization and custom structure mechanics that immerse players in a completely fresh scenario with every new round of play.<br/><br/>Based on the ENDICOTT EPIDEMIC multi-media series created by filmmaker and author Douglas Harvey, Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game is the first full board game that accompanies the Endicott Epidemic: Infectious Contagion card game.  While Infectious Contagion was the condensed, &quot;lite&quot; version of the main game, EE:TBG is an epic battle for survival that offers all of the insane mechanics and suspenseful buildup to destruction that the card game couldn't bring to the table (literally).<br/><br/>Utilizing game boards acting as maps based on primary areas of the Endicott Epidemic story (with fully functional expansion &quot;connections&quot; to mix and match your favorite ares as the game expands), players will drop their chosen characters (each with their own unique abilities that can be used strategically) into the heart of the epidemic and begin battling the Undead using classic roll-and-move mechanics as well as a series of unique &quot;Intrique&quot; cubes that modify gameplay with every roll.  A deck of Inquest cards act as side-missions that can be ignored or completed to gain resources used to fight and survive, or to gain special tokens that can be used in many different combinations to unlock new areas of play as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Combat is as simple as choosing your weapon (or brawling unarmed, if you so choose) and rolling the Combat Cubes.  Each face of each cube means a different value, giving you numerous combinations of attack to dish out against your chosen enemy.  But while rolling the cubes is the simple part, bear in mind that your enemies can (and most of the time *will*) fight back or dodge your attack entirely.  Strategize your plan of action before engaging the enemy to give you the best course through the hordes of Undead.  Or, if you think you have the stealth abilities to do so, roll the dice to try to evade the groups of enemies and slip through unnoticed and live to fight another turn.<br/><br/>But beware - hidden with the game's deck of cards lay numerous deadly obstacles ranging from stronger than average 'Boss' Zombies, Black Ops agents, and even a handful of mutant Hazard Zombies, which spread MBI's toxic plume everywhere they go.  Once these villains begin to appear, the spreading plume is something the Survivors must be extremely wary of.  Plume markers begin to build in each area and once they reach their critical mass, deadly chain reactions are caused that could potentially wipe out every living thing on the board.  The biggest and most brutal enemy within the deck, however, is the Countdown - eight cards that constantly remind players of the impending nuclear purge.  Once the eighth and final card is drawn, the game is over - regardless of whether or not the survivors have completed their mission to find the Hermit, his critical intel, and his escape route.<br/><br/>With all of the chaos going on as each Survivor makes their way through the town to complete their mission, the gameplay could get a little too intense for some people's liking.  Endicott Epidemic: The Board Game utilizes a completely customizable experience so that players can create the best scenario that is tailored to how they want to enjoy their game.  Removing certain aspects of the game like Hazard Zombies or Plume counters can greatly reduce the amount of suspenseful buildup that could turn players off from a game that could potentially be nearly impossible to win.  Inventory management and play deck building are also ways a group of players can ease the difficulty and ensure that the game, if played with all the right moves and strategic plans, can indeed be won without laying at the mercy of the Countdown or the roll of a die.<br/><br/>The board game, at its core, is designed for 2-8 players.  However, like Infectious Contagion, the board game also allows a single player to enjoy the game experience as the lone survivor of Endicott&rsquo;s shift from living to undead.  Other game modes include a point-based Survivor mode that removes the Countdown and many other aspects of the game to allow players (or factions/teams of players) to battle waves of Undead, tallying up points at the end of each round and crowning a winner after a set amount of battles.  Or, players (or teams) can simply battle each other without the inclusion of Zombies (but with a Countdown) in a vastly customizable VS mode.<br/><br/>A ticking time-bomb's clock, swarms of Undead that will chain themselves together to create deadly hordes, an ever-spreading toxic plume beneath your feet, stealthy Black Ops agents that mark you for execution when you fall within their sights, a limited number of resources that must be used in conjunction with an even more limited inventory system, a constant surge of adrenaline with every roll of the Intrigue cubes, making allies with your fellow Survivors only to find your group surrounded by Zombies with only two bullets and a grenade...all of this and more is what builds your game up from a simple beginning to an all-out epic battle for survival.  Think you can handle it?<br/><br/>",

Give each player a piece of paper and get them to write down Cadburys Bournville Cocoa on it.<br/>The idea of the game is to collect all the letters that spell Cadburys Bournville Cocoa. Almost every square on the board has a letter, so if you arrive on a square you can tick off that letter from the name on your paper.<br/>You need a 6 to start (of course!).<br/>If you land on a square with special instructions, you must obey them.<br/>The first player to tick off all their letters, wins. And the rules say you should get a steaming cup of lovely chocolately Bournville Cocoa.<br/><br/>",

Diseased, toxic creatures spew forth into Midgard, and the gods, once protectors of that land, have forsaken humankind in their blind rage against one another.  Once their sacred protectorate, Midgard is now their battleground.<br/><br/>In The Last Edda, players take on the role of one of six Norse gods and do battle, taking control of the monstrosities pouring out of the tainted Yggdrasil, in order to defeat their rival.<br/><br/>The Last Edda blends the mechanics of player combat and deck building card games.  Each turn, a player has the option of directing monsters from a common pool at his opponent, while his opponent has the opportunity to defend the attack by playing unit cards from his hand.  The turn also provides an opportunity for players to buy cards from personal and common supplies, and construct buildings and artifacts that remain in play and help you to defend and attack more effectively.<br/><br/>Yggdrasil, the World Tree is rotting.  The air grows colder and drier by the day.  Murmurs of Fimbulvetr and Ragnarok can be heard across Midgard.  Which of the gods is strong enough to survive the coming storm?<br/><br/>",

The game is comprised of 70 square cards, each containing a multi-colored cross, and five sets of colored tokens, representing up to five players. The game is housed in a cardboard box with color printed top and unprinted bottom.  The box contains a plastic tray to hold the cards and the tokens.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt two cards, and the remaining cards form a draw pile.  The first player draws a blind card and then lays one card from their hand face up on the table.  Playing clockwise, each player takes a turn, drawing a card and playing a card on the table.  Cards must be placed, edge to edge, so the colors match.  Players must place a card if they are able, but rows of cards cannot exceed three cards in length.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to create squares of cards and claim them with the colored tokens.  Additionally, your can seize an existing square if you are able to replace one of the cards on the table with a card from your hand.  The first player to claim four squares wins.  There are additional rules for a points game.<br/><br/>",

Unlike most Mancala games, [1] there are between two and six sowing directions to choose (depending on the cup), and [2] the direction deflects when a board edge is reached. Sowing is extended (&quot;re-sowed&quot;) if the last stone drops into a pit containing only the active player's stones.<br/><br/>Stones are captured when the last piece sowed lands in a pit containing an opponent's stone.<br/><br/>The game is won when a player captures nine stones or claims the majority in each corner pit.<br/><br/>",

A round consists of players playing action cards, and a single player playing an event card at the end of the round. Players use action cards to draw extra cards or cause other players to discard in an attempt to favorably control the number of cards in players' hands, their own included.

Here are the important rules;<br/><br/>The game is intended for two players, one taking the 'planes' and the other the 'shells', both represented by discs.<br/>The aim of the game is to get as many planes as possible through to the Objective. Each player moves in turn commencing with a Plane.<br/>The Moves;<br/>The discs move according to the number obtained by spinning the arrow. The exact number of places must be moved each time and only one disc for each move. Planes must be moved forward (never backward).<br/>The red-circle shells move horizontal (sic) left or right only. The black-circle shell may move horizontal (left or right) or vertically (backwards or forwards) but not outside the green half of the board.<br/>Shells can move only if the number of spaces to be moved brings the shell to a circle of the same colour as a plane in play.<br/>Rules;<br/>The planes' player moves any plane he chooses. He may try to reach his objective with one at a time or more if he so desires, but he must not forego a move if it is possible to move a plane the required space.<br/>Shells may pass over planes but not over another shell.<br/>Planes may pass over another plane or shell.<br/>Losses;<br/>A plane is hit (and thus out of the game) if it comes to a circle occupied by a shell or if a shell hits the plane. That is, if a shell is able to move to a circle occupied by a plane. A hit is also registered if a plane comes to one of the red circles in the yellow half of the board, provided the red line is connected with a circle of the same colour as the plane and this circle has a shell on it or a shell hits it before the plane moves on.<br/>Now place the discs on the circles as marked taking care to put the black-circle shell on its appropriate circle.<br/>If the arrow should stop dead on a dividing line, spin it again.<br/><br/>These rules make a little more sense when you look at the images. Note that it is never properly explained who wins. Does the planes' player win if he gets just one plane to the objective? Or more? I guess you need to make some 'house rules' before playing.<br/><br/>",

Future versions will contain also negative numbers, and fractional joiners (to form fraction numbers)<br/><br/>CONTENT:<br/>Key game components are octagonal tiles with numbers in the center, equal signs, and half math operations between them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), decimal joiners, and tile holders.  <br/>Basic Edition contains: 33 Positive Tiles, 11 Joiners, and 2 Tile Holders.<br/>Standard Edition contains: 66 Positive Tiles, 22 Joiners, and 4 Tile Holders.<br/><br/>GAME RULES:<br/>Each player receives an equal number (6-10) of randomly selected octagonal tiles that he/she keeps hidden from other players on tile holders. The remaining tiles are kept in the bank face down.<br/><br/>One of the tiles from the bank is placed face up on the table. E.g. Tile no. 5 is placed on the table.<br/><br/>The first player makes a move by creating a math operation with his/her tiles by attaching them to the tile on the table. (E.g. The player that happen to have tiles 2 and 3 uses them to create the math operation 5-2=3)<br/><br/>The next player attaches his/her tiles to any number on the table creating his/her math operation. (E.g. The player that happen to have tiles 1, 4, and 7 may create the operation 14/7=2. (The double digit number 14 is created by placing joiner between 1 and 4).<br/><br/>The players take turns using up their tiles.

A match consists of one innings by each player (longer games can be agreed at the start).<br/>The first player to bat flips his 11 counters on to the board. If a counter is in a box with a number, it counts that many runs.  If a counter lands in an 'out' box, then that counter is lost. After scoring runs, the same player flips again and the same procedure is followed. As wickets are taken, less and less counters are used, until you have no counters at all and the innings is over.

From around 1950, they obviously thought the kids would enjoy learning how to gamble because the box shows Mum, Dad, Gran and two young sons, all getting a thrill out of the 'race'.<br/>The board is a large spinner with 6 numbers. It is connected to a battery and a set of 6 lights. There is also an area where you can place your bets. After all wagers are laid, the wheel is set spinning and as it does so, the bulbs will light up every time the relevant number passes a contact point. Eventually the wheel will stop and the last light bulb to be lit will remain lit and that is the number that pays out winning bets.<br/>A game that seems devoid of skill.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player to get one quarter (25 cent piece).<br/><br/>The game consists of the board, one custom die and 'fun money' modeled after Canadian coins.  The board is illustrated with a stone pool, a barrel and a wheelbarrow.  Each player starts the game with 3 pennies (1 cent) and 1 nickel (5 cents). The rest of the 'money' is placed in the stone pool. Rolling the die tells the player to either place the specified amount of 'money' in the stone pool or take the specified amount from the stone pool.  Then the player must exchange their coins for a coin of larger value if they are able.  To do this the player places their coins on the wheelbarrow and takes the coin of equivalent value from the stone pool and places it on the barrel. When all the players agree that the two amounts of money are equal, the player takes the coin from the barrel.  The 'money' in the wheelbarrow goes into the stone pool.  Play continues until one player has enough change to get a quarter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Zillions-of-Games site:<br/><br/>Tyr is a variant of Hasami-Shogi. Object: Be the first to establish a Phalanx inside enemy territory. A Phalanx consists of 5 pieces in a line in any direction and is made up of 1 Lord and 4 Warriors. Enemy territory corresponds to the 5 rows on the opponents side of the board. The middle row, marked with the crisscrosses, is considered the front line of the battle and therefore mutually shared by both sides.<br/><br/>A player may also win by making it impossible for their opponent to create a Phalanx, either by capturing all four of their opponent's Lords or reducing their opponent's Warriors to three or less.<br/><br/>Warriors slide like rooks in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down, left,or right. It can also make a single jump over another piece of either color that is adjacent to it horizontally or vertically. The jumping piece lands on the other side. This is not a capture. The only capturing is achieved by sandwiching your opponent's pieces between yours along a row or column. This is similar to Reversi, except that the pieces are removed from the board instead of flipped. A sandwich capture along an edge may wrap around the corner.<br/><br/>Lords have the additional power of moving and capturing diagonally. So they slide like Queens in Chess, i.e. any number of empty spaces up, down, left, right or diagonally. They may jump over another piece in any direction. Also they can make captures diagonally in coordination with another friendly piece.<br/><br/>",

You need to make the best decisions with limited options. Where is the next bend, what is the speed of your opponents, what weapons are available and who can you push in to that race-ending trap? Make sure you cross the finish line first or see to it that none of the other players do.<br/><br/>Players build the track before each race using tiles and customize their cars with equipment and weapons. Each new race delivers new challenges as cars are upgraded and tracks re-imagined.<br/><br/>Accelerating, hitting the brakes and using different equipment and weapons all needs to happen in a split second when racing so each turn your actions are limited. Managing speed is the key to victory! Enter the corners too fast and you crash, go hard on the brakes and weapon-pickups will be gone when you arrive and being careless might get you rammed in to traps by your fellow racers.  You need to race smart as taking damage will cause your top speed to go down. A few dents are fine but taking too much punishment will eventually end both the race and your life.<br/><br/>",

The cards in each suit rank in this order and, if won, they are worth the points noted;<br/>Bride 5 points<br/>Bridegroom 4 points<br/>Best Man 3 points<br/>Mother-in-Law 2 points<br/>Minister 1 point<br/>Bridesmaid A 0 points<br/>Bridesmaid B 0 points<br/>Bridesmaid C 0 points<br/>The suits are called Notes, Gold, Silver, Copper.<br/>The Notes are white because this game harks back to the days when bank notes were always white.<br/>The object is to win cards in tricks, that have a point value as described above. After dealing, each player should assess their hand and make a bid in turn as to how many points they will collect in their winning tricks. Each bid must be higher than the previous bid. High bidder can call any suit as trumps. When the cards are dealt, there will be 2 to 4 cards left over. These form The Widow and remain face down. The high bidder can choose to take The Widow (and discard the same number of cards taken from The Widow) thus, perhaps, improving his hand.<br/>Normal trick play rules apply.<br/>If the high bidder makes his points or more, then he scores. If he doesn't then all the other players score the amount equal to his winning bid. It will be noted in this game that the high bidder is on his own whereas the 'defending' players are a united team against him.<br/>First player to score 150 points or more, wins.<br/>The rules even carry suggestions as to how to use these cards for fortune-telling.<br/><br/>",

For two or more players.<br/><br/>Directions for Playing : Place a ball upon each of the pedestals in the bottom of the box, placing them on the pedestal or corresponding color. To Wind the top: Place the wooden disk over the center pin with the small metal pin and end of wire spring against the top of the top. Hold the bottom part of the top firmly in the left hand and give the wooden disk a few turns to the right. To release the spinning part of the top, hold the wooden disk firmly in the hand and press one finger on the center of the metal pin. The spinning top must be dropped into the center small circle of the playing board. Each player has one spin at a turn and at the end of his turn the score is taken, counting the numbers in front of the pedestals from which a ball has been thrown. If two balls of one color are thrown, it doubles the score of those two balls. A game may consist of 300 points; or it may be played by rounds, the player having the greatest score at the end of an agreed upon number of rounds, being the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>The pedestals are numbered as follows in clockwise direction :<br/><br/>Red: 20 points<br/>Blue: 15 points<br/>Green: 10 points<br/>Yellow: 5 points<br/>Orange: 10 points<br/>Red: 5 points<br/>Blue: 20 points<br/>Green: 15 points<br/>Yellow: 10 points<br/>Orange: 5 points<br/><br/>There is a wooden coloured ball, corresponding in number and colour to each pedestal. The game is played inside a square wooden box with a height of about 5cm (2&quot;). The box is 34cm square (13.5&quot;).<br/><br/>Rules for this game come from --- Famous Belgian (famousbelgian).

It was published in issue #9 (February 2002) of Ravage, a French miniature wargaming magazine.<br/><br/>Each mini has several stats describing its ability to move, shoot, fight and use &quot;Chi&quot; powers. The most important is Action Points (AP) which represent the character's life energy.<br/>A player's turn begins by choosing one of several tactics. Tactics influence how many figures can be activated, how many APs are recovered at the end of the turn and what figures can recover APs. The player then chooses which figures to activate, and expends the figure's APs to move, charge, use a ranged weapon or a Chi power. Each fight is duel; duel are resolved by secretly choosing a combat action for each combatant (which can give bonuses or penalties to die rolls), then rolling for initiative, then trying to beat the opponent's Armour score with 1d6 + the fighter attack score. Each damage point lowers the victim's APs, minis with no APs left must make a save roll each time they are wounded to avoid death.<br/><br/>The last player standing wins the game, also players are encouraged to create scenarios and alternate victory conditions.<br/><br/>The rules include two army lists with classic Japanese folklore figures (samurais, ninjas, shaolin monks, kappas, onis...), a set of markers and tactical advice for both featured armies (Light and Darkness).<br/><br/>Scale: skirmish (1 mini = 1 combatant, 1 cm = 1 m, a turn = a few seconds)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Founders: A More Perfect Union is a trivia-plot game for 2-3 players or teams. Each turn involves roll and play, as well as the possibility of play cards.<br/>     Each player has authored a draft of the Constitution that contains the principles and protections necessary to unify the states. However, in order to present the draft at the Constitutional Convention, each author, must convince a certain number of states to join his or her delegation in support of the draft. Once the delegation is large enough, the author can travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and present the draft before the convention in Independence Hall.  If you are successful in persuading the convention in your favor, your draft is ratified and becomes the Constitution of the United States! Players will have to study up to prove to these learned delegates will test your knowledge and  reason before choosing to give you their support.<br/>Answer trivia questions to get your state cards necessary to go to Philadelphia, but be careful, another player might have the play cards needed to steal a member of your delegation, or just send them packing home!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Intoduction:<br/><br/>Author and game designer, Elree Ellis, is the mind behind &quot;The World of Lucidia&quot;. Lucidia is a living, high fantasy world manifested though a series of epic works. These epic works include a series of novels, graphic novels, short stories, board games and a role-playing game. The first of his works, Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame, will be released in 2012 via Time Warp Games.<br/> Theme:<br/><br/>Entitled Islandis: A World of Lucidia Boardgame, this prologue will transport players to the humble beginnings of Lucidia, to a place far removed from the mainland, to a time before time, to the very birth place of life. <br/>Islandis is the largest and most populated island in the Tokelau Sea, serving as the cornerstone for the exploration and settlement of the Asazi Isles. The island is teaming with culture, beauty, bountiful sea life, a seemingly endless supply of resources, and all of the essentials for a growing populous.<br/>In time, through innovation and exploration, neighboring islands are discovered and populated. The new found islands introduce the Asazi people to previously undiscovered resources, thus giving life to a perpetual network of trade routes, and an incessant market place.<br/>Island life is sublime, until...<br/>Villages wake to the sound of chaos. The island pulses and cries with anguish. Families stumble out of their bungalows and into the night, only to find themselves dodging debris from the sky. Turning toward the summit, screams echo across the sea as bursts of lava erupt into the night sky. Dark clouds loom overhead, and no stars are watching from the night sky. Almost word for word, prophesy unfolds. This way of life is coming to an end,it is time for a new beginning.<br/>In Islandis, each player takes on the role of a great leader of the Asazi people. It is each player&rsquo;s charge to lead their tribe in this prophetic time.<br/>Each player has a whole host of strategic colors in his pallet. Some may decide to stay on the island and continue to gather resources, make trade, and nourish culture. Others may gather resources to build vessels, explore and settle undiscovered islands.  The most successful leaders will exhaust both of these options in perfect harmony. Whether choosing to make significant contributions in trade, develop high culture, or spread the seeds of their people across the vastness of the great sea, one common goal remains: To not be forgotten, to make your mark on the history of the World of Lucidia.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>At its core, Islandis is a 1-4 player, turn based worker placement game for ages 13+; however, due to the nature of epic works, players will find that Islandis is truly a set of mini games within the whole part. In accord with the worker placement mechanic, players will enjoy fending off sea creatures, making trade, exploration, variable player powers, dice rolling, set building, and empire building (including conversion sites, villages, monoliths, colossi, and temples).<br/>There are five primary building resources found on Islandis (Stone, Iron Ore, Gold Ore, Cotton, and Timber). These five resources, in many cases, will need to be converted into their more useful forms (Ashlar, Iron, Gold, Textiles, and Lumber). In order to upgrade resources, you will need to utilize your conversions sites, and workers. Dice serve as workers in the game and the results of a roll indicate the productivity of workers. Throughout the game players will find ways to &quot;inspire&quot; their workers to be more productive with the assistance of innovative tribesmen and women!<br/>In addition to the five primary resources, and their upgraded incarnations, players will find many uses for the four major imported goods (Copal, Bamboo, Dyes, and Fruit). These imported goods are earned by lending workers to the four neighboring islands as trade.<br/>Finally, and most important, players will need to feed their people! Players will rush for the opportunity to fish from the shore, however, due to limited space, most will be required to employ their sea vessels to earn fish. The most successful players will begin planting fruit trees early in the game to supplement the demands of fishing. <br/>During the game, players will be able to develop culturally, allowing for a variety of new uses for the 14 resources. These cultural advancements include heirloom recipes, jewelry, musical instruments, and more, each lending their tribes the ability to earn victory points through trading cultural goods.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to earn as many victory points as possible before Islandis is destroyed by molten lava. Victory points are earned in a variety of fashions: Trading resources at the markets, developing cultural items and trading at the markets, fighting off sea creatures, surviving deadly storms, building villages, monoliths, colossi, and temples on newly discovered islands.<br/><br/>",

Everything from road-converted steam engines to solar harvesters staffed by inviting female engineers, and it's your job to get these guys the-hell-outta-here.<br/>AtomPunk makes use of some inventive new puzzle-mechanics and loots the best ones from elsewhere.

You will constantly need to be thinking about getting these in the best configuration.<br/>2. An event deck throws everything at you from crazy cleaning robots, twisted mutants, resource giving oasis, and caravan weaponry upgrades<br/>3. Each turn pits you in a certain land. This land card tells you what resources you need to move on to the next land. After 5 of these you will come up against the 6th and final hard-as-nails boss land which will tell you the final quest you need to complete.<br/>4. Not only do you need to conquer these 6 lands, but each player has a secret achievement goal card that they MUST complete in order to be allowed into the winning team. Will you tell your team mates yours?<br/><br/>How do we win?<br/>Once you fulfill the requirements to bear the 6th and final quest land the &quot;players&quot; team will be successful.

The map contained holes in the location of key cities such as London, Liverpool, Birmingham and Newcastle, as well as points representing shipping targets in the North Sea.<br/><br/>Players shoot spring-driven metal balls representing &quot;bombs&quot; at these targets and are awarded points for hitting the enemy targets. Players are awarded a maximum 100 points for landing either on London or on the home base of the British fleet at Scapa Flow. Other cities and shipping targets are worth between 20 and 70 points. The game was clearly published during the &quot;Phony War&quot; period of late 1939/early 1940, since Calais in France is also worth 100 points, but neutral Amsterdam and Brussels score -80 points each (and hitting Germany is -100).<br/><br/>As with many games published during the Nazi regime, it was pure propaganda intended to focus players on supporting the war.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sc&eacute;nario is a game about producing movies. It is a trivia game with set collection and negotiation elements<br/><br/>The players' goal is to make and publish movies. Movies are made by collecting a set of matching Actors, Title, Director and Producer cards as well as enough money to produce the movie. Money and cards are collected by moving on the gameboard and answering movie-related questions. A player can only have one card of each type in hand, so if additional cards are collected (for example a second Director card), they can be either discarded or traded with the other players.<br/><br/>Movement on the board uses a roll-and-move mechanic, with a few tweaks, like no &quot;reroll&quot; spaces, and several spaces allow the player to move her game piece anywhere she wants on the board. At first players only have access to the board spaces that allow them to collect cards or money (provided they correctly answer a question). Once a player has at least produced at least one movie, she gains access to all of the gameboard, including spaces which allow players to collect cash from their produced movies.<br/><br/>Once a player has made more movies than other competitors, she can win the game by going to the &quot;Palme d'Or&quot; space and answering a special question. End of game questions are designed to be more difficult.<br/><br/>Sc&eacute;nario won the 1989 &quot;As d'Or&quot; for best simulation game at the Cannes international games festival.<br/><br/>",

Round up a few hombre's to compete against and start digging for gold. Get your hands on a few mines and while your at it, jump a few claims from your competitors.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s an all out rush to see who can wrangle up one million dollars in gold nuggets first and get them safely to the bank. But watch out! When your dealing with gold, there is always some outlaw lurking around to steal it from you. It&rsquo;s going to take more than a little luck to finish first in this game.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>Players take turns rolling the dice and moving around the board in hopes of staking claims in one of the five mines available. Once a player obtains a share in a mine he may dig in it, once he lands or passes the &lsquo;mine for gold&rsquo; space. When a player mines for gold he draws one of the &lsquo;golden nugget&rsquo; cards and records the amount of gold found, on a score sheet.<br/><br/>During the game, the price of gold will fluctuate when players land on the &lsquo;gold rises&rsquo; or &lsquo;gold drops&rsquo; spaces, causing his gold to be worth more or less throughout the game. He must try to get this gold to the bank while the price of gold is still high, in order to receive cash payment for his gold. He may of course, deposit as much or as little of his gold as he wishes, hoping for higher prices later.<br/><br/>He must be careful though. There are outlaws waiting to steal all un deposited gold from you. Throughout the game, players can jump claims of other players, thus stealing away their shares of mines, preventing them from gaining more gold. The player who manages to get one million cash on hand first will win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts on any of the story spots, 24 story tiles are laid out face down. In his turn a player rolls the die and moves the number of spots rolled. If he reaches a moss hill, the turn ends. On a moss hill with an arrow he can turn up a tile and replace it face down. On a story spot he can turn up a tile and keep it if it corresponds to the story of the spot, and he has another turn.

A non-playing referee slides a card into the crocodile. At the beginning only the tip of the crocodile&rsquo;s tongue is visible and the first letter of the word. Now all players guess which word the crocodile is spitting out and call out words. Each player may only call out one word for each new letter, if you call out more than once you are disqualified for this word. If somebody manages to guess correctly, the card is shown to all players and is given to this player. The referee enters a new card. If the word was not guessed correctly after the first letter, the next letter is slid out and all guess again. If you do not want to guess you need not do so. If the word is not guessed before the last letter appears the card goes to the player who reads out the complete word first.<br/><br/>At the end of the word a little picture clarifies and explains the meaning of the word and allows control if the guess was correct. The playing time can be varied by the number of cards used. When all cards have been played, the winner is the player who collected the majority of cards.<br/><br/>",

If successful he may call again from the same person until unsuccessful and then must discard one card on face up stack, which completes his turn. Then, the next player to left follows the same procedure.<br/><br/>Complete categories, and meld them, face up, in front of you as fast as possible. A player may pick up all the cards in the face up stack at any turn, but must meld at least one complete category after so doing. You must meld at least two categories before you can meld the single UN card. When any player has no cards left after his discard - the hand ends, and he scores a bonus of 100 for going out. Cards held by other players are discarded for next deal and each scores the total of the value of each card in their meld. Play for time available - highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

In this roll-and-move game KiKaninchen and his friends want to fill the empty harvest basket with apples which they want to pluck from the tree on the last track card. Players must bet on the winner of the race and the winner of the game is the player who has guessed the winner. Between the start card with the basket and the finish card with the tree you place any number of cards you like. Each player chooses one of his color dots and thus bets on the animal that will reach the finish first. In turn each player takes both dice and moves the animal of the color rolled as many steps ahead as the number dice die demands. When you roll red the player puts back an animal of his choice the rolled number of steps. When the first animal reaches the tree the winner is the player who chose this color dot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "3-Squared is a dice rolling game where players try to score the lowest number of points. The game ends when one player reaches 150 points.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>The game begins when the first player rolls the 9 3-Squared Dice.  8 of the dice are colored with blue (3 sides), purple (2 sides) and red (1 side).  The 9th die has 3 blue sides with a 10 on it, 2 purple sides with a 20 and 1 red side with 40 printed on it.  The object is to NOT roll all of the sides with the same color and complete the 3-Square.<br/><br/>After the dice are rolled all players examine the results.  The Score Die is set in the center of the play area and all other dice that are the same color are set along side it.  If all of the other 8 dice are the same color as the Score Die, the player has completed the 3-Square, the round ends and the player who rolled the dice scores the points showing on the Score Die.  If any of the other 8 dice are not the same color, play passes to the next player.  The second player rolls all of the remaining dice that do not match the color of the Score Die and the other dice that were not set aside.  Play continues in this manner until all of the dice match the color of the Score Die and the player who completed the 3-Square.<br/><br/>There are two little tricks however that can alter the gameplay.  The first is the 10th die...called the Event Die, it has six different sides that can change the results of the dice rolls.  One can end the round immediately, even if the 3-Square has not been completed.  One can allow the player who completed the 3-Square to pass the points to a different player, others double, or even triple the points showing on the Score Die.<br/><br/>Each player is also given 3 Pass Tokens which they can use to skip their turn rolling the dice, shifting the turn to the next player.  The 3 Tokens are not renewable so players must be careful when using them.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     3-Squared Dice (10 Total)<br/>     Pass Tokens (18 Total)   <br/><br/><br/>",

If you are the first to reach the starting point, you get the card. If you have the highest score from your cards after a pre-set number of rounds you win the game. If you race the clock you puff the marble along the track on your own, the fasted receives the card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clownpocalypse is a card game for 2-4 players, set in a world ravaged by evil clowns.  One player plays the Clowns: their goal is to abduct the remaining humans and force them into the Circus.  All the other players play Survivors, who roam the blasted wastes in a pitiful search for food, salvageable material, and safety... and who try to take out as many Clowns as possible along the way.<br/><br/>In Clownpocalypse, each player playing a human Survivor leads a Team.  At the start of the game your Team is just a single Survivor, but a big part of the game is rescuing other Survivors and attempting to lead them to safety. Each Survivor you shepherd to safety at game's end is worth a victory point, but having a large Team during the course of gameplay can create problems: the larger your Team, the more attention they attract from the Clowns.<br/><br/>It also gets tougher to feed them. In classic survival horror fashion, you start the game with only a limited number of Rations, and you'll need to use your quickly dwindling supply to feed each member of your Team every turn.  If your Team gets too large too fast, you're going to have trouble, and then you're going to need to do a hard moral calculus: do you let someone starve? Do you cannibalize your own Team? (Each of these choices has their own pros and cons.)<br/><br/>After you've fed your Team, you get the option to Travel. Traveling is the main way you move through the game deck, uncovering resources and, eventually, the Way Out.  There will always be three cards in the gameplay area displaying three possible resources to Travel to.  Those resources could be Locations, Rations, Salvage, Weapons, or other Survivors, and part of your strategic thinking in the game will involve assessing which resources your Team really needs--you can only attempt to get one per turn, leaving the rest on the table for your rivals.<br/><br/>And of course, there's danger.  The Clowns want to stop you from reaching those resources. So, each turn, the player playing the Clowns places one Clown card, face down, in front of each resource on the table.  This is where the game becomes a battle of wits.  The Clowns have some cards that are stronger than others, and so they need to carefully choose where they place their best cards.  Which resource on the table is the most valuable to the player whose turn it is?  Is that the one that the Clowns should defend the strongest?  Or should they bluff, placing a weaker Clown there in the event that the player decides to grab up a lesser resource, in the hope of avoiding confrontation?  Being able to predict your opponent's strategic choices is an important part of this game.<br/><br/>Once you've declared what resource you're travelling to (or opted to stay put, which has its own risks), the Clowns flip the card they uses to defend that resource, and a confrontation ensues.<br/><br/>Clownpocalypse contains 64 cards (Clowns, Survivors, Weapons, Salvage, and Locations), a set of counters to represent Rations, plus some other goodies in an attractive, sturdy box.  Clownpocalypse is hilarious, disturbing, challenging, and rewarding: you're going to love it.<br/><br/>",

Quidnam is not just a game; it&rsquo;s a mirror on life and the totality of human existence.<br/><br/>Quidnam is a unique card deck that can be used for contemplation and illuminating solitaire meditation or in a groupthink party game.  The heart of Quidnam is the deck of 64 insightful cards developed from fundamental principles of human existence using Set Theory.  Each card has lore and art to provide verbal and visual suggestions as to their meaning.  There are 4 suits of 16 cards.  These suits represent the 4 planes of existence - physical,  biological, cognitive, and social.  Each plane (suit) has 4 unique elements and a color; each card in the suit is composed of a combination of those four elements from zero to four.   The mix of elements is shown on each card.<br/><br/>Meditation.  To meditate, simply decide on a topic, shuffle the deck, deal some cards using a pattern or method to your liking, and study the result.  You can do this alone or with family and friends.  Some patterns for reading are shown in the action shots.  You can create your own patterns and methods.  The topic is up to you.<br/><br/>The Quidnam deck can be used to play the Groupthink game.  This party game is best played with at least 4 players; the more the better.  A question or issue is chosen at the beginning of play.  Play consists of one or more rounds.  For each round, one player serves as a judge.  The role of judge rotates from round to round.  Shuffle the deck and deal some cards using a pattern or method that the group likes.  All players look at these cards and develop a secret reading which they write down and give to the judge.  The judge picks the best reading and the winner gets a point.  Several rounds should be played.  The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Important note.  Quidnam forms the foundation for the exciting game of Totality.<br/><br/>Totality also shows how the set theoretical design maps the cards to the I Ching and Zodiac.<br/><br/>",
