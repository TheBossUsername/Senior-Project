        "description": "A war game of a hypothetical 21st century US civil war, very topical with a dark twist on current events, a great conversation piece whether you are Conservative or Liberal. A mere four pages of rules means it&rsquo;s easy to play. Components also include a playing map, popularity track and three sheets of cardstock playing pieces. Two or three players ages 12 to adult.<br/><br/>From the game background:<br/><br/>After recent elections the Ruling Party gained control of the Presidency and a majority in both houses of Congress. They immediately set about to &ldquo;restore the promise of America&rdquo; through wide sweeping reforms. The rich were taxed. The poor received free health care, education, and housing. Big Business was regulated. The environment was saved. The civil rights of pornographers, illegal immigrants and underage children were preserved. The victory of Labor over their capitalist exploiters was assured for the first time since FDR.<br/><br/>But these reforms provoked equally widespread opposition from right-wing extremists. It became obvious that after the next election the minions of rich Wall Street capitalists would overturn many of the reforms and renew their attacks on the environment. The Christian Right stood ready to poison the minds of school children with creationist dogma. Only quick action by right-thinking patriots could save the Republic&hellip;<br/><br/>Play the crusading Big Government do-gooders or their gun-toting Conservative opposition. Each turn players can choose from various political actions as they attempt to &ldquo;save the Republic&rdquo; in their own way. Eventually martial law will be declared and the game takes on more of a military nature, as bullets instead of ballots determine the destiny of America. The game features overseas garrisons, militia recruitment, terrorist attacks, packing the Supreme Court, the National Guard, defecting government troops, air strikes, UN intervention, mass arrests and more as each side tries to &ldquo;restore the promise of America.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The rules are written from a darkly humorous perspective and the game is fun to play, a real conversation starter. Explore various scenarios. Are freedom and the liberal agenda incompatible? Can we avoid civil war yet preserve our liberty? Find out with The Second American Revolution!<br/><br/>",

They will be reminded of the downfalls of impatience, anger, rudeness, and grudges.<br/><br/>...a great way to learn about friendship while playing a game.<br/><br/>...a fun way to learn how to apply Bible truths to everyday life and relationships. Players draw cards that will teach them about being kind, happy, and friendly. And as they try to help Andy Ant reach his friend Dickter Ant, they learn how to be good friends to the other players and to the people around them. Everybody can have fun; anybody can win.<br/><br/>",

Players roll the silly feet and inch dice, add up their length, and then race to find a matching combination of cards in their hand. Zany action cards help players change their roll's value, adding to the fast-paced fun. As players make matches, they collect corresponding inch tokens, then convert them to feet and yard tokens when they've accumulated enough. But, be careful - don't roll two dirty feet, or you'll lose tokens! Perfect for home and school. Includes feet dice, inch dice, 48 measurement cards, 20 action cards, 1 conversion card, 13 feet tokens, 40 inchworm tokens, and 24 yard tokens. For 2 to 6 players.<br/><br/>",

The rules are simple and not intimidating for casual gamers, but there are also advanced gameplay options for seasoned wargamers. The beauty of Trial by Fire is that it doesn't get as detailed or complicated as most wargames, but still maintains the realism of battlefield decision-making. The game, still in the prototype/playtest phase of development, includes a board constructed of sheet metal and plywood; magnetic hexmap pieces; infantry, cavalry, artillery, and general markers; two card decks which determine movement and attacks; redoubts and bridges; and dice which resolve combat. The basic game is played with a random card deck, but advanced rules allow players to &quot;issue orders&quot; by choosing several cards at a time from their deck. Each space on the modular board is a separate magnetic hex, which allows for an almost infinite number of possible battlefields.<br/><br/>",

The dice shaker is a bamboo tube that has two chambers, one holding colored dice and one holding one black and one white die. When shaken, one dice from each chamber appears in a small window on the side of the tube.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they shake the dice and get two dice in the window. The black die means feet, white means hands. The colored die shows the band color that must be connected. So, if a player rolls white and red, he must connect one his hands (the white die) to any red wristband. In short order, the players get connected and twisted up in all kinds of hilarious ways! A very fun game from Uncle Skunkle.<br/><br/>",

Decks of cards have different themes and the matched cards feature pictures that fit the theme.<br/><br/>Players are dealt eight cards each. The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock and players take turns drawing a card from the stock. If a player forms a matched pair of cards, the pair is displayed face up in front of the player. When the stock is exhausted, players continue to play by drawing a card from the next player in the sequence of play. When a player runs out of cards, that player drops out of play. In the end, one player is left with the odd card - this player loses regardless of how many pairs he or she has formed. Of the other players, the player with the most pairs wins the game.<br/><br/>Eight pairs of matched cards are also designated as Command Cards. After a player forms a pair of of such cards, they can use the pair once (instead of drawing a card) to execute a special action. There are four different Command Cards:<br/>1) Reverse - these reverse the direction of play<br/>2) Take Two - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to select another player from which to draw two cards<br/>3) Give One - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to give a card to another player of their choice<br/>4) Miss Turn - the player can designate any player (including himself or herself) to miss their turn<br/><br/>Players must use up their Command Cards before they run out of cards.

The cards with the service orders are placed on the table in a covered stack. The game is played in turn or with a game master. The first player (or game master) takes the upper most card from the stack and reads it out loud (for example, &quot;please bring a bottle of wine to the red table with the blue tablecloth and yellow legs -- and don't forget the flowers!&quot;.

Four scenarios including:<br/>1)   In an attempt to unify the country, the government of Pakistan launches an attack on India.<br/>2)      Fearing Islamic extremists will get their hands on a nuclear weapon India launches a pre-emptive strike.<br/>3)      Pakistan dissolves into Civil War. (This one is maybe not so theorhetical.)<br/>4)      The government of Pakistan falls. Armed with atomic weapons, the Taliban then launches an all-out attack on infidel India.<br/><br/>The game includes complete rules, including the possibility of Chinese and US intervention, three cardstock sheets of playing pieces, two player aid cards, a card with charts and tables, and an 11x17&rdquo; unmounted mapboard. For two players ages 12 &amp; up.<br/><br/>Some Assembly required. Dice, poster board, glue, and some pennies are required to play.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Two versions (editions) were made: one in Swedish and one in English. Both carried the English name. The publishing company thought it would be an easy way to learn the golf rules.<br/><br/>Initially the idea was to release new question-and-answer cards every fourth year (since the rules of golf are updated every fourth year internationally) but it is unknown whether this ever materialised.<br/><br/>",

The game itself plays like a simplified version of Advanced Wars for the Nintendo DS, but with a territorial control aspect that feels like Risk. Using a hex grid for our maps, we created a set of module pieces so that players set up the board before hand, creating a unique game every time it is played. The game comes with 32 separate board pieces for the players to place, though to use all in a single game is not suggested unless the players have a long time to play. Clockwork Crusade is made for 2-6 players and with the modular pieces the board can be made as small or as large as it is needed for the amount of players. Players will manage resources, create units and use strategy to outwit or outsmart their opponents and obtain victory!<br/><br/>",

The animated bones flew part with the power of the dwarf's blow, as the momentum carried his hammer into the next skeleton with almost the same amount of might. All about him his battle brothers crushed the necromancer's undead soliders, the weak skeletons going down as fast as the foul magic could reanimate them. The dwarf began to sing a battle song, the words carried by his brothers nearby as they works at the slaughter before them.<br/><br/>This is Steal and Glory, the newest Mini-Game from Bad Baby Productions. A fast paced skirmish game of battle, skill and guts, Steel and Glory allows players to field small bands of warriors, who will then fight bloody engagements. Each set within the system will cover two different forces, and also offer new battle tiles, new abilities and new excitement. So don't wait, gather your warriors to you and fight for the glory of your chosen lord.<br/><br/>The third set covers the forces of the Dwarven Caers and the terror filled forces of the undead. Fully expandable, add this set to the others within the system and you find you have a massive game system. Don't wait, join the rage and fight your foe to the death<br/><br/>",

An incorrect answer at any point forfeits the money to a Jack Pot which starts at $25.<br/><br/>After all players have had an opportunity to answer questions, the Quiz Master selects a question from booklet #10 for the Jack Pot, after which the players have 60 seconds to write down the correct answer. The Jack Pot is split between all players who have written the correct answer; the rules do not state what to do if the Jack Pot is not won.<br/><br/>At least two editions were released (First Series and Second Series). The gameplay is largely similar to Take It or Leave It, released in 1942, the only major difference being the usage of quiz booklets in this game versus a spinner in that one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Interesting tourist simulation set in Washington DC.  Seems to have been put together by a company that was interested in tour guides (Macomas, Ltd).<br/><br/>Players take turns choosing a type of venue to visit (historical, presidential, entertainment, bars, diners, sports, etc).  Then they roll a six-sided die to determine which of the six places is available for them to attend.  The result shows them how much time and money must be expended along with the resulting victory points gained (which is a straight formula based on time and money).  Some locations can only be visited at night (and no later than 9:00 to start); others are only daytime affairs.  If the tourist returns to their hotel too late, they are docked victory points. The game ends after two days (four segments of night/day).<br/><br/>Speaking of hotels, players also decide which area they wish to stay in (close in, convenient but expensive, or farther out), which affects their total allotment of money.  Players also choose transportation modes (walk, taxi, rental car, subway) where the time/money trade off rears its head again.<br/><br/>There are a few cards that players can use to augment their scoring.<br/><br/>In the end, it's a move-and-roll game, rather than vice versa, and it's very spreadsheet-like in that players log their comings, goings, time, and points on a grid/scoresheet.<br/><br/>",

When all cards are correctly matched, the one having the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Or<br/><br/>You seperate all of the state and capital cards, placing the Capital cards on the table face up. The State cards are dealt to the players to form a hand. The dealer shouts &quot;GO!&quot; Every player picks up matching Capital cards as fast as they can.

The boat is made up of 6 tiles with animals on them. The tiles are turned up, and whoever finds a pair of identical animals may take one of the tiles and put it down in front of him. Later in the game, if a player finds another pair of friends, he may only take a tile if it fits next to one already in front of him. If not, the player gives it to an adjacent player. The first player to find all six tiles wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>This is essentially a memory game with an added twist of puzzle manipulation.<br/><br/>",

Units are squad, company and individual AFVs.<br/>The Battle of Wadi Saluki was a long time coming. The units of the IDF 401st Brigade had been waiting for weeks for orders as they sat taking incoming Hezbollah attacks. Orders had come in twice to proceed and twice were cancelled. The canyon like Saluki is a &quot;gateway to the Litani river&quot;, an essential objective in southern Lebanon assigned to the brigade before the cease-fire went into action. On August 11, just before 1500 hours, orders came in, but at this late stage, made no sense to the brigade staff. Crossing the Saluki meant the troops and tanks had to climb a steep hill while exposed to attack from mountains on every side. Understanding the risk to tanks, Division 162 deployed its Nahal Brigade infantry on the high ground outside the villages Ghandouriya and Farun, to provide cover for the armored column advancing below. The distance from one plateau to another across the steep valley is only a half mile. Both towns that the IDF attempted to screen were still in enemy hands and both a good half mile from the edge of the Saluki Valley. Russian-made AT- 14 Kornet anti-tank missiles waited en-masse in excellent firing positions. IDF tanks would attempt to climb along a narrow dirt track just below this area! There would be no air support nor artillery support. Thus, began the IDF tank assault with its latest Merkava 4 tank, 24 of them, which some called murderous and suicidal.<br/><br/>",

The judge will then choose the best out of the first 3 submitted.<br/><br/>Game 3 (2-4 players) has the players dealt a hand of 5 cards. One random card from the deck is placed in the middle, and each player on their turn must place a connected card next to the one of the cards on the table. If player does not have a card to connect they must draw a card from the deck.

Features stunning box cover art.<br/><br/>(From boxtop): THE OBJECT OF THE GAME is to take a trip to Fairyland, avoiding the monsters and obstacles in the enchanted forest.<br/><br/>Before entering the forest each player will meet or pass two good fairies who are able to help him through the forest and land him safely in Fairyland. If a player lands on either the &quot;Bird&quot; or &quot;Good Fairy&quot;, they can safely pass through the forest without having to follow the directions on the monster or obstacle spaces. If a player does not land on either of these spaces before entering the forest, they have to follow the instructions on the board.<br/><br/>There is no pass for the cave. If a player spins a number that will cause him to land on a space another player occupies, he forfeits that turn. No two counters may occupy the same space.<br/><br/>The player first reaching Fairyland by an exact count WINS THE GAME!<br/><br/>",

The pieces are tall Eagles with wings held up, and are the only thing this game has to do with Eagles.  The game could easily be played with an ordinary Checkers set.<br/><br/>The board is rotated so that light-colored corners are closest to each player.  The closest square is empty, but the next closest eight squares are where the Eagles start the game for each player.  Players take turns moving and capturing each other's Eagles.  Eagles may move to one adjacent light-colored square in any direction.  They may jump a friendly piece, like in Halma, to an opposite vacant square.  Multiple jumps are possible but not required.  When jumping an opponent's Eagle in the same manner, the opponent's piece is removed from the game.  Jumping and capturing are not compulsory.  The first player to remove all his opponent's pieces from the board (or to trap them so they cannot move) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Or will they sacrifice the colony's well being for their own financial benefit?<br/><br/>T.O.O.L. is an exercise in supply and demand economics involving competition between three or four players. To win, players must cooperate for the survival of the colony while balancing the need to acquire the most wealth.<br/><br/>Central to the game is the acquisition of land, and the use of TOOLs to harvest resources from that land. Each of the four resources has a unique purpose, and each one is vital to successful life on the colony. These resources are then bought and sold at a market, where supply and demand dictate the price.<br/><br/>At its core, T.O.O.L. features a modular board and no luck.<br/><br/>",

The games all have a paper board with graphic illustrations in the style of that period. Text on the board is in both English and Chinese. The boards were printed by Koon Wah Lithographers, Singapore.<br/><br/>In Sea Hunt, the board depicts the sea around a sunken galleon overflowing with treasure. Players roll a die and move their token around a winding track, moving forward or backward or missing turns if they land on certain special spaces. Moving to another space happens if you land on a space with a dotted line connecting to where you are supposed to go; landing next to a whale makes you miss a turn. The first player to reach the sunken treasure ship at space 96 wins.<br/><br/>",

It is mostly a party game.<br/><br/>To play, one person acts as host and the shuffled answer cards are distributed equally among the rest of the players. Thus the host doesn't know which player has what numbered card. The host picks questions at random and whichever player has the answer card for the question with that number reads the answer. The card is then thrown in the discard pile on the table. The host ticks off that question as used and picks another question. The first player to get rid of all of their answer cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "貿易之路 (M&agrave;oy&igrave;zhīl&ugrave; - trade roads) is an economic game set in Silk road era China. It is more a game about economics and game theory than about China and its neighbors, however. Routes in 貿易之路 (M&agrave;oy&igrave;zhīl&ugrave; - trade roads), the 'trade roads' of the title are chains of trading posts / inns etc. that you as a merchant can choose to use. All trade roads can be used by all players. Shipping fees are payed to the 'shipping company' that controls that trade road. There's shipping by sea as well, which works a tiny little bit differently.<br/><br/>The players, rich merchants, decide which shipping company invests where and how. They do this by buying cubes of the color of that shipping company. The cubes bought can be put on the map as sections of trade roads (or harbors), or they can be kept in the player's stock as 'influence' in that shipping company. The profits of a shipping company are divided by ratio of such influence cubes. Hence, owning more cubes means a larger share of the profit. However, a shipping company can only make a profit if it has many trade roads, many cubes on the map. Therefore, cube hoarders get a large share of nothing, and a player that spends all his cubes on roads gets a tiny share or even nothing of - potentially - a lot.<br/><br/>Of course, the profit a shipping company makes is entirely dependent on whether the roads (and harbors) of that company are actually used. Players decide what to ship from what location to what other location. Of course, the choice is driven by profit maximization.<br/>There are 10 locations on the map. 7 of these are Chinese cities. The other 3 are foreign locations. In all locations, three (out of five total) goods are traded. Prices are set randomly at the beginning of the game, but after that they depend on trade. Buying goods in a market makes the price of that good increase. Selling goods in a market makes the price of that good decrease.<br/><br/>And, rather importantly, all players (secretly) plan their trades at the same time. Plans are revealed simultaneously, and then carried out one after the other. Only after all players have made their trades, the market prices change.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game that came free in Vol 5 No, 4 of Old Soldiers magazine. The game is a demo version of the game, Devil's Due, Brice's Crossroads. This will allow you to test drive the Rebel Yell system in general and the upcoming game in particular, at no cost.<br/> Tha game is about one of the most lopsided victories in the war for the Confederates. Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest was a threat to General Sherman's vulnerable and strung out supply line during his Georgia March to the Sea in 1864.<br/> A detachment of 8000 Union soldiers, a mix of cavalry &amp; infantry, were sent to eliminate Forrest's troops.<br/> The over eager young Union officer, Samuel Sturgis, sent his cavalry over 7 miles in front of his infantry.<br/> Forrest predicted the battle's outcome early that day to one of his generals. He stated that their Confederate cavalry would drive the Union cavalry back in a rout and push them into the tired Union infantry slogging their way towards the battlefield. His prediction was true as the Union cavalry quickly broke and retreated right back into the confused infantry. The infantry could not organize a stand in the panicked retreat of the horsemen. The Union troops were routed and suffered casualties that exceed the CSA losses by 3 to 1.<br/> In the end though, Forrest was not able to interfere with the supply line of Sherman's army, so in this, Sherman's goal was accomplished.<br/> This game comes with 2 scenarios, the simplified rules, 2 maps (in four pieces), counter images and needed charts. A 10 sided die will need to be supplied. The counters will need to be mounted on cardboard.<br/> Scenario 1 is Forrest Attacks! It depicts the initial routing of the US cavalry and is played on map 1.<br/> Scenario 2 is Drive on Brice's Store and is played on map 2. <br/>The 2 scenarios can be played as a 'campaign' game. This would require the CSA player to win both or the Union will be victorious.<br/><br/><br/>",

Historically, this attack, along with some French shocked the Germans. Originally, the attack was to have occurred on the 22nd, when other French units near Cambrai and their 7th Army south of Amiens were to attack. Due to confusion, the British went alone, while the Cambrai attack occurred on the 22nd and almost retook the city. The 7th Army historically was near ready but failed to attack until days later when it did not matter. The &ldquo;what if&rdquo; in this game is a simple one: the planned attack slated for the 22nd with the British and French at Arras, while French units near Cambrai were also part of the attack from Arras instead, and its 7th Army south of Amiens went on the coordinated offensive to cut off the panzer divisions in the 40 mile wide corridor.<br/><br/>Each turn is six hours.

One of the basic components of this game is the &quot;Pedigree Card&quot; shown in a diagram below.  It will be noticed that in each case the parents are to the right of their children. The Father is always on the upper line; the Mother is on the lower.  The numbering system begins with the person whose ancestry is being sought.  Number 2 on the chart is the searcher's father; Number 3 is his or her mother, etc.  It will also be noted that all male names have even numbers and all female names have odd numbers.  Another interesting fact is that each father is double the number of his child.  Hence if Number 2 is a Smith, Number 4, 8, 16, 32 etc. would also be Smiths.  This could go on indefinitely, and in spite of the infeasibility of putting 10 or 15 generations of ancestors on one chart, one can easily relate to a certain ancestor 13 generations back on one of his surname lines by the pedigree number of that ancestor.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Now they are marching towards the capital. The emperor has called for all able men and women to rise and defend against this threat.<br/>The game is played on a hex map showing the terrain of the battlefield. The imperial units consist of cavalry, infantry, bowmen, militia and leaders (coincidentally the RPG adventurers). The imperials are played by the role-players while the ogres are moved by the game master/dungeon master. Attack rolls are made by throwing a d10 and cross indexing the result on a table against the own attack strength which is the units base strength modified by terrain and leaders.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Der Elchtest is a race game with a unique mechanic. The &quot;Elchomat&quot; is a wooden square with four square corner legs. This allows it to stand, like a table, with one entrance on each side. Five round wooden pieces fit inside the Elchomat perfectly. The game includes six round wooden pieces: two with white numbers (2 and 3), two with black numbers (2 and 3), one with an arrow, and one with an elk.<br/><br/>The roll-out board shows a map of Scandinavia with a race track superimposed on it. The track is made of spaces that are either white, red, or black. Players try to be the first to get to the end spot on the track, and movement is determined by the Elchomat.<br/><br/>The Elchomat is filled with five of the six pieces. The sixth is placed outside one of the four entrances. On a players turn, they push the outside piece into the Elchomat, and of course one of the pieces comes out the other side. The piece that emerges determines the car's movement. The arrow means the car moves one space. The numbers depend on the colors. With red numbers, the car moves forward if the car is on a red space. Otherwise, the car moves backwards. The same works for black. The car moves forward with any number if it starts on a white space. If the elk emerges, the car is struck by an Elk and loses a turn.<br/><br/>A fun game to play, and it is very difficult to remember how the pieces are positioned within the Elchomat.<br/><br/>",

A stone is captured if it ends up &quot;in the tongs&quot; -- meaning between two foreign stones. On a players turn, they can move one space or jump in a straight line. The game is played in three phases that help react to the realty that the game requires more movement toward the end as there are fewer pieces to jump.<br/><br/>The game is essentially an advanced version of Seega, the ancient Egyptian game, but makes it much better by using a hex board and adding the phases of play. The game can be played using the components from Perlhuhn's Ombagi game, but was also sold as a standalone game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This roll &amp; move game is another Monopoly clone with some notable differences.  The &quot;color groups&quot; represent different craft fairs held throughout the year and the &quot;properties&quot; are different days of each fair.  Instead of &quot;houses&quot;, player may buy booths to open on different days of the fairs.  Different players may have different booths on the same day space.<br/><br/>Booths and mortgages are marked on the board with durable, vinyl, reusable stickers (like Colorforms toys) and the player pawns look like little old craft fair vendors (both male and female).<br/><br/>From back of the box:<br/><br/>TWELVE CRAFT FAIRS surround the game board.  CRAFT BOOTHS are in each fair.  Players (VENDORS) shake the dice and move around the board, trying to buy the fairs and booths that each one thinks will help him/her win the game.<br/><br/>Colorful VINYL MARKERS are used to show the ownership of the fairs and booths.  Each player has a different color which matches his/her playing piece.<br/><br/>PROFIT or LOSS CARDS contain over 100 DIFFERENT CRAFT ITEMS and designate whether the player &quot;COLLECTS&quot;, &quot;PAYS OUT&quot;, OR &quot;BREAKS EVEN&quot; on the business transactions in the booths.  These cards also bring about INTERACTION AMONG THE PLAYERS which adds to the fun of the game!<br/><br/>",

But should the players let paranoia get the better of them, they will be forced to collaborate, and even then their lack of cooperation may allow the murderer to escape.<br/><br/>",

I forget how gosh-awful many you could &quot;stack&quot; (with room to lay them out) inside a single large hex. But the shtick was while the Persians pounded away at the phalanx, at some point they began making die rolls to see if they are shown the little pass. Once they are shown the pass they come behind and the game if not literally over is pretty much a mop up.<br/><br/>",

Whitehouse in Table Games (pg. 17). It was kept in print into the 1840s by John Passmore.<br/><br/>The game board was a pictorial map of England and Wales, with each space defined by accurately-shaped county boundaries. Race from start of the Thames to City of London in 151 stops - with each county having a number of pictorial representations.<br/><br/>According to Whitehouse it was published by Edward Wallis, 42, Skinner Street<br/><br/>On the later 1850 edition:<br/>This is a geographical race game played on a map of England and Wales. The boardgame is divided into counties with representations of local landmarks and industry. There are 151 playing spaces. The play is a circular one, with the starting space at the River Thames and the end space in London.<br/><br/>The players are provided with a Card, containing nine Letters, nine Numbers, two Crosses and one Blank, which are to be cut up on the lines with a pair of scissors. The letters are to be distributed one to each player, according to the number about to play, and the remainder laid aside. They are used to mark each player's position o the Game.<br/><br/>Each player, on drawing a number, is to place his letter on the same number in the Game, and read the description aloud. When it is his turn to draw another, he adds them together and advances his letter to that number which they make when so added, reading as before, and observing any directions which may be given him. But if he draw a cross, he is to draw again, till he obtain a number, which number is to be deducted from, instead of added to his former station, and his letter moved back accordingly. Each card to be returned to the bag after drawing. Whoever draws a blank, remains at his former number. After each player has drawn once, the Game is to be continued in the same manner, passing the bag round, till some one makes up the exact number 151, who wins the Game.<br/><br/>The details of the boardgame reveal the date of the Great Fire of Plymouth, October 1840 and the land slide at Lyme Regis of 1839.<br/><br/>",

The purpose of the game is to help children see what certain followers of Jesus Christ did to reconcile people to God and one another.<br/><br/>Mary, St. Paul, St. Francis of Assisi, Pope John XXIII, Dr. Tom Dooley, Dorothy Day, &amp; Mother Teresa are the individuals highlighted in the game.  Additional reading is also suggested in a bibliography within the rules book to facilitate follow-up discussions.<br/><br/>The game requires an adult or peer moderator, and two to six children to play.  In a classroom, the students could be divided into two to four teams, with the teacher acting as the moderator.  Prior to the stare of play the moderator gives a brief bio of each of the seven christians mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>Colored pawns mark the position of each party on the play board, and a deck of cards and die direct play.<br/><br/>There are 72 cards in the play deck, and a die is rolled by each player or team in sequence, and if their number is rolled they are able to draw a card from the deck.  If their number isn't rolled, they pass the die on to the next player or team.<br/><br/>When a card is drawn, the party reads the card to the other parties and does as directed.  When a card is used, it is discarded from the game.<br/><br/>The first party to reach the finish line wins the game.  But it is hoped that the parties will continue until all finish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A word dice game packaged to appeal to antique lovers.  It is &quot;inspired by centuries-old references to spelling dice&quot;, quoting John Locke's approval of using them, and the box art and the font on the dice have an antique feel to them.<br/><br/>There 8 dice included -- whose sides have a letter from the (modern) alphabet, or an asterisk as a wild card -- and a rules sheet.  To play a turn, a player rolls all 8 dice and rearranges them to spell as many words as possible in a set amount of time, while another player writes them down.  Different scoring schemes are presented for players of different ages.<br/><br/>The rules sheet has safety warnings on the back not to play on a glass or other fragile surface, useful precautions since the dice are fairly large (1 inch cubes) and weighty.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hack In The Dark Ages 250 AD to 1000 AD by Philip J. Viverito, 1 vol, 56 pgs L.M.W WORKS.<br/><br/>A historical game system for tabletop gaming with miniature figures in the Dark Ages. This book is a stand alone set of rules based on it's predecessor Classical Hack III: Hack in the Dark and is profusely illustrated with diagrams, photographs and charts. Most players are able to play the game without much, if any, help after turn three. The primary change from First Edition is the use of a D-10 system from a percentile based casualty calculation. The first part of the book describes the basics of the game in regard to unit generation, movement and shooting. The remainder of the book is designed around the turn sequence. This takes the player basically through a typical turn describing each turn event in sequence.<br/><br/>Scale 1&quot; = 150' for 15mm and 25mm figures. Each turn = 15 to 20 minutes. Figure scale is flexible, from 5 to 200 men. Table size 4' x 6' or larger.<br/><br/>The end of the book contains a section on Special Add-on Tactics. There is also a general Q.R.S. or Quick Reference Sheet for playing the game. There are 39 Army Lists and four scenarios, plus play aids. Besides having a comprehensive Table of Contents there is an Index; which is not always found in game systems of this type.<br/><br/>",

If a travel agency had this &quot;game&quot; displayed in a window and someone that worked there was wearing the buttons supplied in the game...they would win a free travel award from Frontier Airlines.  Secret frontier employees did the checking.  There were also entry forms in the game for other prizes.<br/>Game play involves spinning a spinner to arrive at one of nine destinations. Each person starts with $100,000 of seed money. At each destination, you move around a circular track and follow instructions on the spaces until you return to the airport. Las Vegas is an exception and has cards rather than a track. Once the last player leaves the ninth unique destination, the game is over. Whoever has the most money after returning the seed is the winner.<br/><br/>",

From LPD's website: &quot;Antietam represented the best opportunity for the Army of the Potomac to win the war at one blow. Major General George B. McClellan's command style was an important part of why this did not occur. Once again, BACW's command and initiative system has to pick up the slack, allowing the Federal player some control of the battle while showing just how the Little Mac's dysfunctional command style prevented complete victory. The Confederate player faces Lee's greatest challenge - winning against 2:1 odds. Includes South Mountain, the precursor to Antietam, and Harper's Ferry, a classic race against time for divergent objectives.&quot;<br/><br/>",

According to LPD's website, &quot;This three-day battle (Oct 21-23, 1864) is a mini-campaign of the largest battle west of the Mississippi. Five cavalry Divisions (2 Federal, 3 Rebel) and the Kansas State Militia maneuver over the heart of modern Kansas City. Battle of Westport uses the command system from Battles for the Heartland, untried Kansas Militia and Confederate conscript regiments.

Instead, it adds more depth to the game it's self by adding more elements to game play and strategy. The expansion includes 6 new high-resource system cards, a Black Hole system, and an Unknown system. <br/>In addition to these, the game also features a new building aspect, where you can build structures such as factories, science institutes, and mobile shipyards. Each of these structures improves different aspects of your empire, making the games focus wider and your empire larger. With these buildings also come the chance to research and develop new technology and advancements in your empire. There will be a military technology tier, and an economical technology tier. These tiers will have 2 options per level of advancement. This will give players 4 Research Management Cards and 48 Research counters (12 for each player).<br/><br/>That makes 13 new cards to print out, which at 25 cents a print, comes to $3.25.<br/><br/>8 System cards (including the Black Hole and Unknown System)<br/>4 Research Management cards<br/>1 Research Counters sheet<br/><br/>I am really excited to be getting another System Vector game off the ground.

Apparently D&ouml;derhultarn was a bit excentric, and also very fond of the island. This game tries to encompass all this in a story of how he travels all over the world before actually reaching Bl&aring; Jungfrun.<br/><br/>The game consists of a single sheet of paper, 76 x 54 cm, folded twice to create a thin booklet. Each space the players move through has a small illustration and a short verse, describing what happens.<br/><br/>The game is published to benefit &quot;Svenska typograff&ouml;rbundets invalid- och tuberkulosfonder&quot;, the Swedish typographer union's invalid and tuberculosis funds.<br/><br/>",

Rules: Cards are placed down one at a time. Two players see who can make the correct animal sound first. The person who makes the correct sound first, holds on to the card. When the rabbit card appears - don't make a sound! If you do - you lose one of your cards. It helps to have a judge, too, to determine who shouts out the right sound first. Whoever ends up with the most cards in the end wins.<br/><br/>",

(The board could easily be drawn with hexagons instead of circles and lines.)  The game is meant for three players but can be played by two.  Its pieces (ten per player) begin in one corner and move to an opponent's starting corner to be crowned, then must move to one of three central circles in order to win the game.  The first player to get one king to the central circles wins.  Pieces, be they ordinary un-promoted pieces or Kings, may move in any direction and capture opposing pieces by jumping.  Kings have no advantage other than that they are required to win the game.<br/><br/>According to The International Society for Board Game Studies, Shan Tu dates back at least to an 1895 advertisement describing it as &quot;A worthy successor to Gobang, Reversi, Halma and other favourites.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each has their own unique abilities to influence the game play. Orc has piece promotion and piece destruction. Undead has graveyard manipulation and piece control. Human has piece position and board manipulation. Elf has card manipulation. The battle has just began!<br/><br/>ChessCraft is an abstract game played with cards, for 1 vs 1 or 2 vs 2 players. Each game takes around 30 min to 1 hr. Contents of the full games are:<br/>a)    32 pieces<br/>b)    75 cards<br/>c)    16 board tiles<br/><br/>The objectives of the game are <br/>(1) Capture the opponent king <br/>(2) Accumulate 20 or more cards per player <br/>(3) When the king reaches the opponent&rsquo;s summoning board tile<br/><br/>Players take turns to place the board tiles. At the beginning of each player's turn, he draws 1 card from a common draw pile. During his turn, the player has to make a move on one of his pieces. At any time during his turn, he can <br/>(1) Summon basic or advanced pieces <br/>(2) Promote basic pieces to advanced pieces <br/>(3) Play cards<br/><br/>To do these 3 actions, costs must be paid first, which means discarding cards equal to the cost face down to a common discard pile. Whenever a card is played, the opponent may respond by playing a card. Cards are resolved first in last out. During opponent's turn, player may also play cards. Player can also modify the movement, capture or interaction with opposing piece of a piece in play by paying the cost of a Piece Modifier Action card. The effects of the modification lasts only the turn the card is played. Unsummoned pieces are in each player&rsquo;s reserve. When the pieces are captured (or destroyed), they are placed in each player&rsquo;s graveyard.<br/><br/>There are 2 types of cards. Actions go to the discard pile face up immediately while Permanents stay in play in front of the player who played them. Kings cannot be targeted or affected by cards unless specified. Player may not Check the opponent if he plays any card prior to his Move.<br/><br/>Each 2x2 board tile has a coloured circle in one of the squares. The circle indicates the square as a terrain of that colour. At the beginning of a player&rsquo;s turn, if his pieces occupy all 4 terrains of his own colour, he can draw 1 more card.<br/><br/>Discussion forum can be found here<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3869101#3869101\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3869101#3869101</a><br/><br/>",

Each card's cost is also worth the same amount of Victory Points.<br/><br/>Player may activate the abilities on his cards in play.

These are essentially non-nuclear &quot;type&quot; vessels, reflecting hypothetical combat which could be all the way from the middle of World War II, to the 1960's.&quot;<br/><br/>The game appears to have come in a large ziplock bag with the following components:<br/>- Rule Book (139 pages with additional charts in back).<br/>- Map (A large hex map with a coordinate system running down two edges)<br/>- 12 Submarine/Counter sheets (Each heavy paper sheet is identical and has two basic elements: 1. An area to cut out counters for ships, torpedoes, etc.; and 2. Player sheets to track damage, etc., on two different, and somewhat odd looking, submarines.<br/><br/>",

If the enemy stone cannot retreat (because both cells are occupied) the actual player gets an extra move.<br/>By column: if there are exactly one black and one white stone at a column, the higher stone can be attacked. If the other player moves one stone forward to that column, the upper stone is placed in an empty cell on the lowest row of that column (which is accessible by a sequence of moves: in a chess-like board, the game only uses black squares). If the enemy stone cannot retreat (it was at the fifth row) the current player gets an extra move.<br/>If both attacks occur in a single move, column attacks takes precedence over contact attacks. That is, the player only executes the column retreat. If that retreat is not possible, he executes the contact retreat. If that retreat is also not possible, the player gets an extra move.<br/><br/>LAST STONE<br/>If a player only has one stone, it may move one or two cells (mover's choice) and may retreat one or two cells after an attack by contact (attacker's choice).<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>If a player repeats a position by the third time, he loses.<br/><br/>",

Players start from Station WEAF in New York and make a &quot;complete circuit&quot; around the country.<br/><br/>The game features an unusual mechanism for movement. Instead of a die or spinner, players use a &quot;radio tuner&quot; with two turning card discs. Shutter windows in the tuner reveal a station call sign (like WEAF) on one side and a number on the other. Players look up the station on the back of the tuner, where it is associated with a numerical value; that value is then added to the number revealed on the front. Therefore, if a player &quot;tunes in&quot; to Station WMC (Memphis), and the number 3, they then look on the back to see that WEC has a value of 1. That player then moves 3+1 spaces on the board.<br/><br/>If players land on the same station they &quot;tuned in&quot; on their turn, they get a free extra turn. Players must &quot;tune in&quot; an exact number of spaces to finish their route and end on WEAF back in New York.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The ferocity and insolence of these black-souled barbarians makes one shudder.  It is an abominable kind of war.  The air one breathes is contagious of insensibility and hardness.&quot;<br/>-Louis Antoine, Comte de Bougainville<br/><br/>An Abominable Kind of War, presents the players with a juxtaposition; on the one hand, you have the stylized warfare of 18th century Europe, embodied in the Regular Infantry of the Line, and the dandified  officers who were habituated to the finery of the courts of England and France, with a mentality little suited to combat in &ldquo;a labyrinth of forests, without roads;&rdquo; on the other, the brutal, almost feral type of warfare unleashed in North America in the form of &ldquo;an invisible enemy, who strikes  and vanishes, swift as the lightning&hellip;&rdquo; whose &ldquo;ferocity and insolence&hellip;makes[sic] one shudder.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As the French, you must tame the &ldquo;lords of the wilderness&rdquo; and harness their fierce art of war without burning up too much materiel on them; though, should you allocate too little in the way of gifts and supplies for your formidable allies, they will return to their haunts in the wild, leaving your undermanned French regiments alone to face the gathering might of Great Britain and her American colonies.  So, can you find the right balance between the ferocious partisan war of the wilderness and the more &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; style of war as practiced in Europe?  If so, then perhaps the Marquis de Montcalm, with his French battalions, can stave off his more numerous enemies to the south; perhaps New France can survive the tempest of war.<br/><br/>As the English, you, too, have a difficult &ldquo;balancing&rdquo; act to master; you must find a way to placate and protect your fiercely independent, but extremely valuable Colonials.  Without their numbers and forest craft, you stand little chance of besting the potent combination of &ldquo;unmitigated savages&rdquo; from the Lakes, Mission Indians from the St. Lawrence Valley, Canadian bush rangers, and French battalions which will be coming at you in waves.  Ask too much of the Americans; do too little on their behalf; treat them with disrespect; they will turn a deaf ear to your entreaties and allow the British Regulars to march off to certain defeat out there, at the hands of a foe who is covered &ldquo;by the universal forest.&rdquo;<br/><br/>And, facing both of you, is &ldquo;an immense uninhabited wilderness, overgrown everywhere with trees and brushwood, so that nowhere can one see twenty yards.&rdquo;  This vast, uncharted forest dominates the struggle.  Ultimately, victory will only go to that player who can conquer that savage landscape stretching out before him.  It is the &ldquo;insidious warfare of the forest,&rdquo; then, which will determine the outcome of this struggle!<br/><br/>",

Players take turns moving and taking two different actions such as Attacking a monster or another player, Casting a spell (either from a spellbook or as a one-shot from a scroll), Picking up an object, Exchanging items in town, or Upgrading stats and Equipping items and skills.  After a player's turn, any nearby monsters move toward that player and attack if able.<br/><br/>The goal is to collect 5 points by picking up Flags and delivering them to the entrance and/or killing the Dragon.  Each time a player picks up a flag, more powerful monsters, a free item, and a flag are placed in the labyrinth.  The Dragon, by far the deadliest monster, spawns after a player collects 4 flags.<br/><br/>This game is &quot;beta&quot;; it has no art and the rules and rulebook are unrefined.

        "description": "Swimming pools can be very dangerous. You have been hired as a lifeguard. Each shift, the kids line up to get in and swim. As more children enter the pool, it is your duty to assign them safe areas to swim. If a child is paired up with a swim buddy, parents tend to reward you for taking care of their kids. When an area of the pool gets too full, kids get bored and leave. If there are a lot of kids playing in your area, you are considered to be a good lifeguard. If you help enough kids you will gain favor with the Boss. It is always good when the boss likes you.<br/><br/>Players take the part of lifeguards assigning buddies to the children entering the pool. They will choose the best area of the pool to guard, hoping the children will be happiest there. The Boss will reward the lifeguard who has the best reputation, allowing the lifeguards to rank up. If ranking to a level 5, that player wins.<br/><br/>",

Unlocked words receive no points when the round ends. Use special cards to double or triple word point values or freeze opponent's words. A great game for groups and parties!<br/><br/>Best played with 4, 6 or 8 players in teams of two.<br/><br/>After dealing 7 cards to each player, each player attempts to make words with their cards (with help from their teammate when it's their turn - who sits opposite) No more than 5 active words can be in front of any player at any given time. A word can be frozen or &quot;locked&quot; (turned over face down) and no more letter cards can be placed on that word(s). Teams work together in creating more or longer words. The longer word, the more points. Always at the end of each player's turn, he/she draws back up to 7.<br/><br/>There are special card in the deck including Wild (any letter A-Z), Double and Triple cards the double and triple the value of those words, Freeze which can lock an opponents word and Unfreeze which unlocks your own word.<br/><br/>There are special instructions in the game for 2, 3, 5, or 7 players.<br/><br/>",

The game will include a map, counters, rules, and cards.<br/><br/>The game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions. is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes with the use of some beautiful, super-size counters. No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s. Skill determines the outcome.<br/><br/>",

Mirroir the Cyclisme have appealed to the collection of Rene Geslin to bring out this reprint. In the course of years, several versions of this game have been published. For example one with the name &ldquo;Tour the France Cycliste &ldquo; in the Fifties.<br/><br/>It is a simple game of goose where a cycling game is played along the outer track of the game board and on the other hand a (initially) tourist car game on the track with the map of France. In the original game cyclists, small cars and bonus cards were provided.<br/><br/>Whit this version comes only the game board and the game rules.<br/><br/>In the version of the years ' 50 the layout of the game board has been preserved, but the characters and symbolism has been adapted to the era. Also the rules have been strongly simplified. In the original game bonus points could be deserved at stage wins, this has been completely deleted from the rules and everything has been reduced to a simple game of goose.&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Quest: A New Age, the purpose of the game is to take your Adventuring Party into each Dungeon and attempt to complete your assigned Quest Objective.  This can be done as a Solo player or with any number of players controlling and arguing over the party members.  (I have run one of my D&amp;D groups through it with 8 people as the party)<br/>Your Adventuring Party is made up of 5 Unique and Specific Classes that must be represented as you begin the game.  Each class has a Hero that Begins at Level 1 and can advance up to Level 5 during game play.  Most 1st level Heroes need 3xp to advance to level two. 7xp more to advance to level three, 10-15 more to level four, and 18-24 to level five. This depends on the class and individual Hero.<br/>Here is a list of the 19 Heroes that we have at this time and what they are at each level.<br/>Protection Class:<br/>Griff - Journeyman - Fighter - Warrior - Barbarian - Berserker<br/>Sonya - Wanderer - Explorer - Questing - Paladin - Angel<br/>Olli - Son of Hamfast - Pikeman - Squire - Knight - Crusader<br/>Solarion - Footman - Swordsman - Lieutentant - Captain - General<br/>Death Class:<br/>Selene - Outlaw - Bandit - Thief - Rogue - Shadow<br/>Gabriel - Urchin - of the Streets - Minstrel - Bard - Muse<br/>Grimm - Outlaw - Bandit - Enforcer - Assassin - Reaper<br/>Sabban - Rebel - Renegade - Deciever - Deserter - Betrayer<br/>Nature Class:<br/>Richard - Farmer - Woodsman - Guide - Scout - Ranger<br/>Isseili - the Fey - Forester - Naturalist - Druid - Warden<br/>Venr - Awakened - Scavenger - Hungering - Feasting - Vampire<br/>Magic Class:<br/>Marteel - Novice - Adept - Wizard - Mage - Archmage<br/>Callius - Novice - Adept - Cultist - Warlock - Demon<br/>Zaphian - Underling - Adept - Sorcerer - Necromancer - Lich<br/>Rymar - Stonehead - Preserved - Protected - Encased - Fortified<br/>Life Class;<br/>Dana - Follower - Acolyte - Healer - Priestess - High Priestess<br/>Jesse - Follower - Acolyte - Brother - Preacher - Martyr<br/>Sarah - Searching - Enlightened - Forgiving - Redeemed - Guardian Spirit<br/>Mary - Acolyte - Cleric - Devoted - Blessed - Saint<br/><br/>The Adventure consists of a 60 card Dungeon, which has one Quest Objective, Terrain, Creatures, Equipment, Effects, Fast Effects, Events, and other Items.  There are always two Unigue Tier Creature Cards that can be interchanged after completion of each Tier to make the adventure last longer and become more difficult.  The eight Adventures that we have complete are listed below with the amount of games played, completion rate, and Quest Objective.<br/>Goblin Kingdom -    71/120     60%    Goblin King<br/>Dead Marshes -      58/90       63%    Lord of the Undead<br/>Demonic Rift -          35/63       54%    Balor              <br/>Ruby Mountain -      31/64       49%    Ancient Red Dragon<br/>Forsaken City -        25/51       50%    King of the Streets<br/>Nature's Abundance 23/50      46%    Ancient Treant<br/>Dangerous Seas -    21/47       38%    Captain Davy Jones<br/>Tomb Kingdom -      17/50       34%    Tomb King<br/>We are planning on a total of 10 adventures to become available in the future.<br/>        <br/>Game-play:<br/>In Quest: A New Age there are Abilities, Upgrades, and four stat Values -- Accuracy, Armor, Life, and Damage. <br/>Abilities differ for each Hero and Creature according to their assigned value in the game, (e.g. a Goblin Recruit has no abilities and is worth 1 point value, while a Goblin Captain has a value of 3 and grants abilities to other Goblins).<br/>5 levels of Upgrade are available to each Hero and are earned in the Dungeon as the party delves deeper into the adventure. As you gain XP from Terrain, Trap, and Creature cards, you can spend the XP to make your Heroes stronger. <br/>Accuracy is the Hero or Creatures base accuracy which you then combine with a roll of a D20 to attempt to hit.<br/>Armor is the Hero or Creatures base defense against attacks.<br/>Life is the Hero or Creatures base damage that they can take before dying.<br/>Damage is the Hero or Creatres base damage they can inflict against another.<br/> Phases of the Game:<br/>1)  Quest Deck - Turn over the appropiate amount of cards.  Fast Effects happen at this time and can change how many cards are turned over.<br/>2)  Effects - Any Effects that are turned over happen at this time.<br/>3)  Hero1 - All Heroes have one action per turn, which can be used to either Attack, Heal, Pick Up and item or attempt to Disarm a trap.  The Hero may also Hold their action for Hero2 phase.<br/>4)  Dungeon - Any surviving Creatures may perform one action at this time.<br/>5)  Hero2 - The Heroes that held their action can now act.<br/>6)  Events - Events such as traps that have not been disarmed and other Events take place at this time.<br/>7)  End of Turn - End of Turn abilities such as Regenerate and Aura's take place at this time.<br/>8)  Upgrade - XP that has been collected can now be used to upgrade your Heroes.  When a Hero is upgraded they gain full health.  Once XP has been spent on a Hero, it cannot be used again.<br/>Start the Phases over at this time.<br/> The game begins by shuffling your Quest Deck and turning over three cards.  As the game progresses and your Heroes are upgraded, you start to turn over more cards to make the Adventure more difficult.  The Breakdown is as follows:<br/>Game Begins - 3 Cards per turn<br/>After Two Hero Upgrades - 4 Cards per turn<br/>After Five Hero Upgrades - 5 Cards per turn<br/>After Eight Hero Upgrades - 6 Cards per turn<br/>After Ten Hero Upgrades - 7 Cards per turn<br/>After Twelve Hero Upgrades - 8 cards per turn<br/> Rules Questions:<br/>1)  When Attacking you take the Accuracy and add a D20 roll. That roll must equal or beat the targets Armor.  You do not have to roll when Healing or using an Ability unless it is used as an attack.<br/>2)  Melee characters cannot target Ranged characters unless all other Melee opponents are defeated.<br/>3)  Rolls of a 1 are considered an Epic Fail and always miss.  Rolls of 20 are considered a Critical Strike and always hit, in addition a Critical causes Double damage to the target.<br/>4)  All XP this is collected goes into a community pool which can be used at the direction of the Party's controller or controller's.<br/>5)  As an overall rule: The Cant's outweigh the Can's<br/><br/>We did a short Demo on youtube which is quite boring but you are free to take a look at the mechanics of the game. :)<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenKeep#play/all/uploads-all/1/hDXivVltVB4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.youtube.com/user/HiddenKeep#play/all/uploads-all/...</a><br/><br/>",

The player is asked a safety or first-aid question related to the topic of the square they land on. A timer is started once the question has been read and the answer must be given before the timer sounds.<br/><br/>Once a player has completed the external track on the board they enter the central area and then must answer questions based on the spinner result. If answering successfully the player gets to point to one PREVENTIT lettercard of any opponent. If it is the correct colour they add it to their scorecard. If it is not the correct colour the lettercard remains face-down in front of the opponent. In either case play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Win: The first player to fill their PREVENTIT scorecard wins.<br/><br/>",

The best secret agents were summoned to the task of retrieving the information contained in this bag and the winner will receive one million dollar reward, besides knowing the oldest secrets of the mankind. Uncover your opponents and abuse the nerve to not be discovered and enter into history as the best secret agent of all time&quot;(Translated from the game box) <br/>Each player represents a secret agent, but there may be ghosts agents (additional pawns). On his turn, the player moves any agents, distributing the total movement points obtained among the agents he wants to move. When one or more pawns stop at the building where the suitcase is, all players score: the pawn which is the suitcase&rsquo;s building receives 5 points and the other pawns receive points corresponding to the buildings where they are at this moment. At the beginning of the game, each player only knows its own identity. Thus, the game has two objectives: to win more points by moving the pawns (the game ends when someone reaches 42 points) and earn additional points, by discovering the identity of other agents (this is done, once someone reaches 32 points, placing numbered chips into the slots of the forecasts bases).<br/><br/>",

Battles involving over a dozen ships per side should be resolved within a couple hours play easily. While not as detailed or full of options as several other games available, this should be appropriate for even small children to understand and enjoy until they are ready themselves to move on to more challenging rule sets. Above all, it is hoped that the rules presented here provide an enjoyable experience to all that choose to play, for a game that is without fun...is simply not a game at all.<br/><br/>The ships portrayed within the Argosy Command universe travel between stars by means of wormholes and may represent various races as characterized and postulated by the likes of H.G. Wells, Jules Verne, and other such literary notables at the turn of the 20th Century.<br/><br/>",

In order to place yourself on the throne, you will have to win the support of the people, gather valuable resources, collect taxes, raise an army, and finally obtain tactical information on your opponent. The player who uses their skills at bribery, sabotage, and brute force the most effectively will capture the throne!<br/><br/>This game is played over 4 rounds with opponents competing to claim 6 objective cards per round.  To do this each player places a card face down at each of the objectives.  When all cards are placed there is a showdown where players claim their gained obectives.  New objectives are then drawn, hands are refreshed, and the next round begins!  The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>This game was designed as an alternate version of the card game War with shorter game lengths and addition of decision making.  After a redo in March 2010 it is now a set collection game with 5 varying types of objectives with 7 cards of each type (3x standard card, 1x +1 bonus, 1x +2 bonus, 1x +3 bonus, and 1x +1 per card of this type).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sitzkrieg is an expansion set for Axis and Allies which includes a new board sized 80 x 150 cm, an Excel based IPC-tracker, printable battleboards and a PDF based printable rules set.<br/><br/>The set comes without plastic figurines, so you need at least any of the Axis and Allies games with all major powers present or spare parts from Xeno Games to have enough figurines for all nations. The playable nations are: Germany, Italy, Japan, USSR, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Kuomintang (KMT), France (Free &amp; Vichy), Netherlands, neutrals and Britisch Commonwealth Nations divided into UK, Canada, South Africa, India and Australia.<br/><br/>The map offers you geographical features such as rivers and mountains that have their own influence on the units. When set up, the game starts with a couple of events that took place before 1939. You have to roll for the Second Sino-Japanese war and for the Spanish Civil War to start with. The Long March, The purge and the Winter War all take place in what is called turn zero.Starting turn 1 you may roll for nation specific technologies. Urban Warfare, Burma Road, Lend Lease, Convoys, International and Territorial Waters, Ports, Elite Infantry, Partisans, Spanish Blue Division, Political Leaders are elements that enhance the realistic feel of the game.<br/><br/>The goal is to win a bronze, silver or gold (historical) victory over your enemies.<br/><br/>Rules for which Axis and Allies and Xeno pieces can not be used:<br/>-Weather effects like rain, heat, snow, fog and wind effect your troop's mobility. You can make your own weather markers or use the Litko Aerosystems weather markers.<br/>-Oil Derricks (we recommend Petropolis pieces) and oil drums (we recommend the supply counters from Axis and Allies Battle of the Bulge)<br/>-Commanders (we recommend 1/72 scale minis, Table Tactics jeeps or Axis and Allies miniatures commanders) Commanders allow surrender or retreat options.<br/>-Elite Infantry (we recommend 1/72 scale minis or AA Miniatures<br/><br/>To get all the miniatures to play all the rules is a bit of work, but remember you can also use them to make house rules for your regular Axis and Allies games or use the Sitzkrieg rules as an expansion to your own games.<br/><br/>",

Getting through the course fast will help your cause but will not guarantee victory as the winner is not the horse that finishes fastest but the one with fewest fault points.<br/><br/>You design the course before each game so the strategy will change with each play. You can make the course as demanding as you want. While Grand Prix Jumping is at its heart a card game, there is very little luck involved and the better skilled rider will be victorious.<br/><br/>",

Players have a monthly budget that includes insurance, expenses, income, savings, and stock speculation.<br/><br/>Monthly income is determined by the job that each player receives at the beginning of the game and by investments that pay dividends or interest each month. Expenses are both fixed (for insurance, etc) and determined by random card draw. For example, a card may say, &quot;You have a child go to college, pay $50 a month for the next 16 months.&quot; Players are also allowed to take loans, which of course increases monthly expenses.<br/><br/>The game ends after 24 months. The player with the highest Net Worth is the winner. Any player who's debts cannot be paid off is considered bankrupt and has lost.<br/><br/>There does not appear to be a maximum to how many people can play the game.<br/><br/>",

When a player covers all the letters of their phrase, they must tell an example about how they are loving, delightful, etc. The group leader should encourage players to give very detailed examples and reinforce them with positive statements like, &quot;I think you are loving because you are always kind to me.&quot; All of the players can win once their card is filled in and they have told their story.<br/><br/>The game supports up to 25 players (for a classroom setting).<br/><br/>",

Players use a tournament format to choose their preferred quotations from several historical sages, and the winning quote makes it to the championship. Everyone wins! The tournament includes hundreds of great quotes and encourages discussion of &quot;real stuff&quot;--peace, love, honesty, trust, truth, dreams, hopes, forgiving and genuine friendship.  If you pitted the wisdom of Gandhi against the wisdom of Mother Teresa, who would win?  Pit the wisdom of Shakespeare, Buddha, Eleanor Roosevelt, William James, Helen Keller, Coach John Wooden, Maya Angelou, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jane Austen, Plato, Anais Nin and a host of other thinkers up and bare witness to something good.<br/> Agreed The Tournament of Enlightenment:<br/><br/>Creates a safe context for sharing thoughts, beliefs, values and opinions.<br/>Fosters sharing, cooperation, working together and building a sense of community.<br/>Generates and achieves heartfelt dialogue.<br/>Helps people get to know each other on a personal positive level.<br/>Prompts deep conversations and the use of concepts and choices that are sadly missing from our black and white world.<br/>Provides a means to re-learn the skills necessary to find common ground, build agreement and connectedness.<br/>Provides a safe venue for a group of like minded or different minded people to achieve deeper discussions. <br/>Guides players to share two thousands years worth of wisdom, wonder, mysticism, and precepts from many different traditions.<br/>Provokes a stretching of the mind, encourages reflection and lighthearted banter.<br/>Stimulates non-competitive and non-argumentative exchanges.<br/>Teaches skills in listening, sharing, consensus, team-building, critical thinking and democracy.<br/>Compels exploring of important poetic/literary/spiritual/philosophical/religious concepts among family, friends, colleagues, romantic interests, and acquaintances.<br/> Step into a good for you, good for me consciousness.<br/>  <br/>Great for: people who love quotes, the alternative/hippy/green/peace &amp; love crowd, the health and sustainability crowd, educators, bookstore patrons, literary types, coffee shop customers, poets, song writers, friends, family, strangers, metaphysical book store customers, college students, clients, spiritual and ecumenical folks, conference/fair/festival goers, philosophers, academic settings, therapeutic and self help folks, religious studies groups, dating, couples retreats, therapists, counselors, groups, companies, corporate trainers, Sunday school classes, boards of directors.<br/> Select comments from the comment cards from the 2010 Mensa Mind Games Competition: Original idea, interesting concept, easy set up, smart green board and minimal packaging (it does not come in a big clumsy box, it comes in a neat container), promotes agreement, has a feel good quality to it, a way to get away from alienating first person shooter videos, actually it was cool: kind of like watching democracy and philosophies at work, non-competitive entertainment, based on a concept of no discernible winning player; rather everyone is a winner, leaves you knowing more than when you began playing, worth marketing but not to the competitive and strategic game player market.<br/><br/>",

Then the following will make more sense.)<br/><br/>1. Shift up or down 1 gear.<br/>2. Roll a number of six-sided dice equal to your gear.<br/>3. The highest number showing on a single die is your speed rating.  You MUST move forward a number of spaces equal to your speed rating.<br/>4. The lowest number showing on a single die is your maneuver rating.  You MAY move side to side a number of spaces equal to your maneuver rating.<br/><br/>The higher gear you are in, the more ground you will cover, but the less turning you will be able to do.  You will need to downshift going into the corners or you will hit the wall.

        "description": "This game is designed to reinforce The Big Six, an informational and problem solving technique developed by Mike Eisenberg and Bob Berkowitz. The Big Six consists of six separate tasks, which help students focus research, solve problems and make decisions. The players must have received instruction in The Big Six before playing this game.<br/><br/>The board game consists of a series of questions which players need to answer correctly in order to score points and cycle through the Big Six process twice. The game board is divided into six areas that represent each step. These areas are flanked by &quot;rooms&quot; which occupy the four corners of the board. The rooms describe locations in which Big Six activities typically take place: the Classroom, the Library Media Center, the Home, and the Group Study (where students might work collaboratively on projects).<br/><br/>The game is a linear race game which continues until all the players have finished. The first player to finish is not necessarily the winner. Nuts and Bolts has been designed to reward understanding the Big Six more than the roll of the die. Those players who have answered questions most deftly accrue the greatest number of points. The winner is determined when the last player has completed the second round.<br/><br/>",

The basic mechanism is to execute one or two out of three permitted moves. To understand these it is important to note how many corners the pattern of the rubber band has (i.e. triangular, rectangular, etc.). The number of corners can be increased by one, decreased by one or stay the same, with one corner being moved to a new position. The player using least moves to reach the positions on his/her cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Our website provides information that will enable players to use any of these derivatives.<br/><br/>The winner will have a chamsuite with a total energy efficiency covered by his/her permits, and more money (from the remaining permits that are converted to cash based on the spot price of carbon at the time the game is stopped).<br/><br/>",

A rabbit is put on top, resting on the carrot tips. Everything is spun around to let the players forget which carrot is where. The players then roll dice to determine how far to pull out an individual carrot. When a carrot comes out completely, the player can keep it. The game ends when the rabbit falls (when it is no longer supported by enough carrot tips). The player with most carrot is the winner.<br/><br/>",

As with all things in the universe, the Dragon Currents mirror the five elements of the Wu Xing: Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water.<br/><br/>Players represent powerful Geomancers attempting to harness the five energetic attributes of the Dragon Currents in such a way as to bring harmony to the land.<br/><br/>Dragon Currents is a strategy game for two players, in which players place two-sided energy tokens on Dragon Current lines.  Based on the relationship of the Wu Xing, elements either enhance or diminish other elements.  Well placed tokens can increase the player's score while decreasing his opponents.  The player who best harnesses the relationship of the energies wins.<br/><br/>",

With a degree of skill and a small amount of luck, do you have what it takes to solve this appalling crime?<br/><br/>In this themed rummy game, players lay sets of suspects while attempting to conceal vital evidence cards that point to the identity of the murderer. It&rsquo;s easy to conceal evidence, simply keep the card in your hand. Of course, by doing this you risk being caught out and having to pay heavily in points - not to mention the card that you wanted to keep secret is now revealed to all. Balance your hand and know when to purposely reveal your evidence to double your points total and boost your overall score, but don&rsquo;t give too much information away to your opponents!  Never fear though, as the astute sleuth, Inspector Moss, is always on hand to provide you with some assistance into your inquiries. If you are able to &lsquo;go out&rsquo; with your cards and are able to identify the murderer, congratulations, you will be rewarded handsomely in points, however, your opponents will not be so lucky.<br/><br/>Inspector Moss Investigates is a free PnP rummy game developed for the 2009 Themed Rummy Contest (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3867905#3867905\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3867905#3867905</a>)<br/><br/>",

These are the cirkus' &quot;bad guys&quot; so Trygg have to watch out!<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player has 36 counters in a grid in front of themselves on a mutual board. In turn the player throw two dice and uses them as coordinates on his grid to identify which counter to turn. All counters start face down. The turned counter has a character on it and that states what the player must do. Typically it is to move his or an opponent's pawn which run along a track in the center of the board. When the player finds a key he may try to reach goal, and if he does he wins.<br/><br/>",

In the beginning, a random player has to wear it. Each player has four pawns and moves them over the 13x13 game board. This is done by rolling two dice of which one can choose one for the movement. When both dice show a red dot, the player currently wearing the hat loses his or her current pawn. When he or she manages to move the current pawn next to another player's pawn, however, the hat is passed on. The players can also move bushes to protect themselves from the Schlafm&uuml;tze. The game ends when one player has no more pawns, whoever has most pawns then is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pacific 1942 Point Luck, the second extension of Pacific 1942 Admiral game, came to gamers as a small present free of charge.<br/><br/>This extension brings to game new dimension - chance.<br/><br/>Name Point Luck is connected to meeting point of US ships in the Battle of Midway.<br/><br/>The true is that we have decided to keep Pacific 1942 as simple as possible, which, absurdly, brings the game much closer to reality than too complex and tricky rules often do. But everyone knows that chance plays quite important role in real combats. Up till now every fusillade destroyed one battle unit (one prism), an attacking bomber squadron destroyed one battle unit of the attacked ship (one prism) and so on. Now combat rules has changed by Point Luck Card.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>A) How many dices are rolled?<br/><br/>Attacker rolls as many dices as many Battle units he use for attack. For example a fully equipped (3 prisms) battleship can use up to 3 dices. But if it have moved in the turn, you need to reduce number of dices according to number of moves.<br/><br/>If more bomber squadron attack a ship, you can use as many dices as you have squadrons (cylinders).<br/><br/>You never roll more than three dices. The fourth, fifth etc. attack is always succesfull.<br/><br/>You can, of course, use only one dice and roll it more times up to number set above.<br/><br/>You can stop your attack at any moment and use your actions to move out.<br/><br/>B)Where put deffender his Battle units<br/><br/>B1) Rows<br/>According to number of Battle units uses deffender the first, second or third row of Point Luck Card.<br/><br/>The first row has a symbol of one Battle unit, second row has a symbol (prism) of two and third row of three (or more) battle units. So if you have (as a deffendor) one attacked Battle unit, you use first row and so on.<br/><br/>B2)Columns<br/>B2a) First row<br/><br/>To which column has a deffender to put his BU? It&acute;s only his decision.<br/><br/>Expamle: In case of one BU form columns 1-4 and 3-6 two groups. If deffendor puts his BU to number 2, his BU will be destroyed if attacker will roll 1,2,3 or 4. From previous text implies that more BU attacker has, more attamptions has to roll.<br/><br/>B2b) Second row<br/>In the second row are fields splitted to half, so columns 1-3 and 4-6 forms units. Because deffendor has two BU, he can choose whether to split them or put both BU to one section. In first case he will for sure loose at least one BU. (And of course attacker can roll the dice according to number of his attacking BU.)<br/><br/>B2c) Third row<br/>When has a deffendor three or more BU, he can place them in the third row. Here fields 1-2, 3-4 and 5-6 forms units.<br/>When is the Point Luck Card used?<br/><br/>C) Point Luck Card is used all the time when:<br/><br/><br/>     battleship fires<br/>     bombers attack<br/>     fighters attack bombers (even in case when it is turn of player whose bombers try to flight through place where enemy&acute;s fighters are.<br/>     whne fighter shoots on un-armed fighter <br/><br/><br/>D) And when NOT to use the Point Luck Card?<br/><br/>Point Luck Card is not used in case of:<br/><br/><br/>     battalions combat<br/>     armed fighters combat <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Where's Wilson? provides playful practice in identifying and plotting ordered pairs, an essential skill in algebra! The first quadrants of the coordinate plane enhance the understanding of integers. The distinctive starting board offers eight tracks for placing dominoes. Players match each ordered pair with one of the 16 locations where Wilson is hiding. The winner is the player with the fewest remaining dominoes.<br/> Wilson takes pleasure hiding in various locations in the first quadrant.  Players match hiding places with ordered pairs such as (2, 5) and (4, 3), building an octopus-like pattern outward from the octomino starting board.  Where&rsquo;s Wilson? is self-checking! If the 44 dominoes are placed correctly, open ends of those on the octomino tracks and those yet to be played can be paired. Game variations make it possible to meet the needs of a wide range of students.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Confidence is a &quot;word poker&quot; game in which players will have to test their vocabulary and their nerve!<br/><br/>Players will attempt to make words that contain all of the letters dealt from a &quot;Payoff Deck&quot; and at least one of the two letters dealt to them as a hand.  A player may &quot;cash out&quot; with a word at any time, but since the point values of the letters increase - sometime dramatically - when more &quot;Payoff Letters&quot; appear, to gamble on &quot;just one more card&quot; is a tempting option.  But there are risks:  the inability of a player to make a word will result in a zero score!<br/><br/>Confidence is a game for two to four players, although variant rules are included which allow more people to play.<br/><br/>",

On the site <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.trool.it/giocodicarte\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.trool.it/giocodicarte</a> both the rulebook and the complete deck can anyway be downloaded and printed.<br/><br/>",

In this boardgame you can be one of the heroes of folktales.<br/>There are four characters in the game, the strong, the clever, the lucky and the good hearted. Each player chooses one character at the beginning of the game. One player can choose the same character as another player's ; in this case you replace the character with one of the extra tokens.<br/>- Strong: he replaces the trials with his strength<br/>- Clever: he uses his brain<br/>- Lucky: for him every trial is equally difficult; he trusts his luck<br/>- Good hearted: uses his good heart<br/>There are several characters who accompany you. They are represented with cards and if you defeat them you can take their cards. If you have these characters first they will try to complete the trials for you. If they do not succeed then it is your turn. At the same time you can have two helpers.<br/><br/>",

The player who best spends his or her resources of time and money will be elected and win the game.<br/><br/>During the initial setup phase, players take turns adding region tiles into a 5 x 5 political landscape grid. Players take a set of handshake tokens and media tokens to be used during the game phase.<br/><br/>During the game phase, players alternate turns. On a turn a player places a handshake token and then a media token. After each placement, the adjacent regions are checked for poll closings and voter turn out. If the polls are closed, as indicated when a region is completely surrounded by tokens, the players' tokens are tallied and which candidate wins the region is determimed. If the moving player wins a region, he or she is allowed an additional token placement.<br/><br/>The first player to score more than 12 votes wins the election.<br/><br/>",

If this takes one shake it is also a hole-in-one, if two it is worth a score of two on a hole, and so on.<br/><br/>However, there are also &quot;red joes&quot;. These cancel par dice and jumping jacks when three are rolled in one shake, and the player is issued a penalty stroke due to being in a hazard. For example, if this occurs on an initial shake, the player earns two strokes for that shake instead of the usual one.<br/><br/>Scores are tallied for 18 holes, based upon the par rating for each hole on the scorecard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hotspots is a, print and play card and dice game where the lone modern-day militant starts out with nothing but his worldview and sets out to eliminate opposing militants and control the small country. Hotspots is as much as a dice game as it is a cardgame, giving it the feel of a miniatures skirmish game.<br/><br/>Choose a faction and win by taking out the enemy's firebase or completing 3 objectives before your opponent(s).<br/><br/>This game has a game mechanic that makes it suitable as a print-and-play game.  Instead of playing resource cards to bring a unit, or what would usually be represented by a rare card into play, a training die roll must be made according to the unit's value.  So there is no incentive to stock an unrealistic deck with all of the heavy stuff.<br/><br/>Also, it is not good enough just to build the most powerful military force during the Hotspots Card Game, because you may yet be foiled if you don't protect yourself from your opponent's clandestine activities.<br/><br/>See the rules for instructions on you can produce this game at home on the cheap.<br/><br/>Note that there is also a Hotspots Board Game, which was created by the same designer.<br/><br/>",

So you and up to three of your friends take to the fields in search of treasures. What will you find? Trash or Treasure??<br/><br/>In this free to print and play board game for two to four players, you grab your Beginner's Detector and a Small Shovel and search a field for hidden treasures like coins, rings and artefacts. But beware, there is not only treasure to be unearthed, but also useless trash. For each treasure you add to your collection, you score one Victory Point. You may sell off Treasure from your Collection to buy new equipment, like better detectors and shovels. For every two pieces of Trash in your Garbage Bin, your VP Score is reduced by one. Whoever reaches 10 Victory Points first is the winner (in a 2 players game - if there are 3 players, you need 7 VPs to win, if there are 4 players, you need only 5 VPs).
