        "description": "The game usually lasts up to 30 minutes, up to 6 players can participate, with the possibility of an additional seventh who runs the bank and takes care of reading the questions and dealing the cards.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, all players get 8 cards from their country, which determine how much money they get and how much they move at the start of the game. This starts in the selected rocket on the planet Earth, on the starting part of the game board, divided into 4 stages of the journey to the red planet.. Earth - Moon - International Space Station - Mars.<br/><br/>Each stage has an initial set of 60 quiz questions on the history of space and the history of space exploration, astronomy, chemistry and physics, and space programs, missions and vessels. The player moves the rocket around the designated fields of the stage by throwing a dedicated rocket game gadget called Lucky Star. A successful throw gives the rocket momentum and gives the player a number from 1 to 5. The player is then asked a question. If the answer is correct, the number drawn is doubled, if the answer is incorrect, it remains the same. The player then moves the rocket by the number of squares gained. Players then move their rockets around the playing surface by squirming. If they manage to land on the moon, they can buy extra tickets there for booster or rocket safety, and if they successfully land on the International Space Station, they get the option to buy a private space station. This comes in handy when competing rockets collide, because without a collision safety card or mentioned station, the rocket returns to the stage's starting point. When the rockets reach Mars, they have four landing sites available. When a rocket occupies one of these, it only needs the last minimum frc to land on Mars, which must be exactly 1. Whoever lands on Mars first wins the game!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Historical Background<br/>In 618, the Tang Dynasty unified China, which had been in turmoil following the fall of the Sui Dynasty. Unlike the Sui Dynasty, they maintained peace with neighboring states. However, one of the emperor's sons, the ambitious Li Shimin, despite his role in unifying China under the Tang Dynasty, when his father refused to name him heir to the throne, he staged a coup d'&eacute;tat, killing his two brothers at the &quot;Xuanwu Gate&quot; and removing his father from the throne. Upon his ascension to the throne, he invaded neighboring states and destroyed the mighty nomadic empire, the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, and grown to become the sole hegemon of East Asia.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, with a new king on the throne, Goguryeo wanted to maintain good relations with the Tang dynasty and heal the wounds from the past war with the Sui dynasty. However, some nobles found this very humiliating. They thought that Goguryeo, which had defeated the Sui Dynasty's one million soldiers in the past, was now abandoning its pride and begging the Tang Dynasty for peace. In the end, the king tried to assassinate Yeon Gaesomun, who was at the center of it all, but Yeon Gaesomun found out and staged a coup, purging the old king and all the dissident nobles and installing a new king.<br/><br/>Li Shimin wanted to invade all the neighboring regional powers and bring them under his feet. After the fall of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate, the last one left was Goguryeo to the east. Eventually, in 645, despite the opposition of almost all his subjects, Li Shimin went to war, and 570,000 Tang soldiers launched a massive invasion of Goguryeo.<br/><br/>Whether this is the pride of a &quot;Dragon&quot; only history knows.<br/><br/>Game Description<br/>Dragon's Pride: Ambition Against Korea, 645 is a 2-4 player historical-war strategy game that aims to be deep but not difficult. Players can choose between the Goguryeo and Tang Dynasty factions. The Goguryeo faction consists of Yeon Gaesomun, who came to power in a coup, and his opponent, Castellan of Ansi, who won the most important battle of this war. The Tang faction consists of Li Shizi, a central figure in the military who actively supported the war, and Zhang Liang, a central figure in the civil service who opposed the war, who led the naval forces and was responsible for key supplies. Li Shimin can be used in common by the Tang faction.<br/><br/>The game has three distinctive features<br/><br/>     It's a team game, but you'll need to solve unique objectives hidden from the other players to score victory points. Depending on those objectives, your teammate won't necessarily cooperate with you. Always watch out your teammate.<br/>     Instead of just focusing on combat, the game focuses on operations, such as the morale and supply of your army, which makes for a unique experience. In particular, the Tang Dynasty will be under pressure to supply their 570,000 men at every turn, and this can only be solved by fast-paced battles and looting. Goguryeo must defend his castle to the end, but sometimes the need for a great field victory can lead to a dilemma of choice.<br/>     The historical theme is reflected throughout the game, implementing the various strategies employed by the Goguryeo and Tang dynasties. It also features unique illustrations that have never been seen before.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "British Tank Ace: 1940-45 is a solitaire, tactical-level game by Gregory M. Smith that places you in command of a British tank during World War II in North Africa, Italy, and the European Theaters of Operation. You will make the tactical decisions a tank commander faces and control the actions of your crew while trying to survive.<br/><br/>You will be assigned missions to attack, defend, or conduct movement-to-contact, depending on the current tactical situation. As time progresses and players survive, they may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request improved versions of tanks when they suffer the loss of their previous tank. Awards and promotions help to narrate the player&rsquo;s eventual goal &ndash; to survive the war and help defeat Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>Players will find it challenging to survive an entire tour from June 1940 to April 1945, although shorter games may be played involving just one theater of operations. You will start with one of the tank models available to the British Army at the start of the game, but as your fame and prestige rise, more advanced tanks will be available to choose from.<br/><br/>Game play moves quickly. Once you have your initial tank and commander, play proceeds by rolling for a mission and then conducting it. Enemy forces range from Penal units to SS or Fallschirmj&auml;eger, all randomly generated, ensuring no two careers will ever be the same. Combat is swift and sometimes deadly, as many of the Axis tanks, SPGs, and AT guns can destroy your tank. Terrain and weather also have an impact on operations, as well as smoke. Players must pay attention to hull down status, the orientation of their hull and turret, and decide when it is prudent to &ldquo;button up.&rdquo; Artillery and mortar fire can sometimes support either side, and random events will add to the uncertainty of combat. Due to its streamlined play, a single mission can be completed in as little as 10 minutes.<br/><br/>When a mission is completed, assuming you have survived, you will ascertain if any awards have been earned or experience points gained. Promotion is also possible, which has the advantage of allowing for artillery and mortar support. You may also upgrade your tank if you have sufficient Prestige to get a better model; otherwise, you continue to fight in your starting tank until it is knocked out.<br/><br/>While British Tank Ace is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>    Complexity: 4 out of 10 (Low/Moderate)<br/>    Playing time: 10-15 minutes (single mission), 4-5 hours (full career)<br/>    Solitaire Suitability: High; Designed for solitaire play<br/>    Players: One or more<br/>    Map Scale: Abstract<br/>    Time Scale: Semi-abstract (individual missions, 8 missions per month)<br/>    Unit Scale: Individual tanks, crewmen, enemy vehicles, anti-tank guns, and ammo<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is designed to allow players to explore the different facets of IPM and how they affect a crop and species living within it. This is done through a facilitator-led simulation where players make decisions that ultimately lead to a unique outcome based on their choices.<br/>The facilitator carries out the effects of a player&rsquo;s action within its scenario while players make decisions as pest managers contending with pests in an agricultural field or similar setting. Their role as managers is to keep pests in check and minimize the amount of damage done to a crop while using their time and money efficiently.<br/>Each game consists of eight rounds. At the end of a game, players tally points based on their crop yield and the amount of money they have collected/earned. The game can be played with multiple scenarios, but this set only comes with Scenario 1: Lunar Wheat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kuru Dynasty is an immersive board game that transports players into the epic world of the Mahabharata and the legendary Kurukshetra war. In this strategic tabletop experience, players step into the shoes of the iconic Kaurava and Pandava armies, each vying for supremacy in the battle that shaped the destiny of a kingdom.<br/><br/>As you embark on this epic journey, you'll be faced with the pivotal decision of choosing a Hero, your faction's Leader, who wields unique abilities and commands an army of devoted allies. The game features asymmetric powers, ensuring that no two factions play the same way, and an asymmetrical starting deck that reflects the distinctive strengths and weaknesses of each side.<br/><br/>The heart of &quot;Kuru Dynasty&quot; lies in its combination of engaging game mechanisms. With card deck building, you'll craft and tailor your strategy as you gather and enhance your army's capabilities. The game also incorporates elements of area control, requiring players to plan and execute their tactics with precision to dominate key regions of the battlefield.<br/><br/>In this ever-evolving war-torn world, market manipulation adds a layer of intrigue and strategy as players can trade resources and cards to their forces or undermine their opponents. Engage in fierce combat, deploying your armies and unleashing powerful Hero abilities to secure your faction's place in history.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal is to lead your faction to victory by reducing the survivability of your rivals to zero. As you navigate the complex web of alliances, betrayals, and fierce battles that defined the Kurukshetra war, &quot;Kuru Dynasty&quot; immerses you in a world of strategy and legend, offering a unique and thrilling gaming experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The Heroes then move on to the next Monster.  If they must Retreat a second time, the Heroes lose, the Realm is lost and the game ends.<br/><br/>When Heroes have vanquished the four Monsters, including the Nemesis Monster (if there was one), the Heroes are Victorious and have saved the Realm, and the game is won!<br/><br/>",

The integrated roulette generates 1-6 results. The player who spins the highest number starts. Each player spins the roulette and advances the number of squares indicated in the result. When a player falls in an explosion marked square, the other player advances his victory bar 1 point. The first player who scores 10 points, wins.<br/><br/>- game 2 (the empire strikes back): 1 player. 9 squares lineal tug-of-war board. The player choses a red or blue pawn and place it in the start (S) in the middle of the board (with 4 squares at each side). The player spins the integrated roulette which generates random Vader (red) or R2 (blue) icons. If the result is of the same color of the player&rsquo;s pawn, it advances one square, else it retrocedes one. When the player reach the final square, wins.

And in cases like this your Character can Flee, taking only a Flesh Wound in the process! Or you can just Trip one of your companions you've gathered along the way to suffer the enemy's wrath instead (how cruel, utterly Heartless!)<br/><br/>Heartless! has a unique damage system surrounding the Hearts suit cards, specifically the Ace of Hearts. Shuffle up the hearts cards and put the 10 of Hearts on top. This is your LifePool. The most important card of the Health deck, the Ace of Hearts aka Your Beating Heart, is shuffled somewhere in that lifepool deck. When you take damage from enemies you simply take cards off the top of the Lifepool until you have a lesser value of health than when you started with. That means you could possibly go from being completely healthy to being right down to your Beating Heart in a single hit!When you die, you are Heartless!<br/>Finally, this game makes use of Lord cards, the Jokers in the deck. These entities can heal you, give you the most powerful weapon in the game, the mythic Lord Sword, and even revive you after death! Forever maintain caution, traveler, for these deities are known to thirst for blood.<br/><br/>Slice, dice. Human Sacrifice! <br/>Can you traverse the twisted depths with your Beating Heart in tact? <br/>May the Lords be with you.<br/><br/>",

Opponents can then call 'Leech Liar' and expose the cards, hoping to find the wrong number of leeches on the cards.<br/><br/>Start with 6 leech cards, play as many as you think you can get rid of without being called out and then draw back up to 6.<br/><br/>The twist comes in two main areas, the Wild Leech, once exposed it becomes whatever the player called, giving them a 'get out of jail free card' and also allowing some hilariously 'wild' calls.<br/><br/>The second twist is the scoring, with each revealed truth that player turns the cards into a ladder, a ladder to the Leech Queen.  The first to reach 6 steps wins the round and is awarded a Leech Queen card (the first to 3 wins the game and is announced Master Magi of the Queen Leech of the United Marshes of Stienk - that's right the title is that long!).  Though if the reveal is shown to be a lie (the incorrect leeches are exposed), that player not only takes the stack of cards but the exposed leech cards and taken and score steps to the eternal marches, the first player that gets to 6 ends the round and are 'rewarded' a Stienk Marsh Card (you don't want these).<br/><br/>If every player is being a little cautious and cagey the round ends when a player empties cannot draw any cards and empties their hand, at that moment someone might as well call 'Leech Liar!'<br/><br/>A quick, language free card game for up to 6 players that love a little bluffing and are generally a little mischievous.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

They launched the Second Southwest Shandong Campaign（第二次鲁西南战役）in a vast area starting from the south bank of the Yellow River in the north, reaching the Longhai Railway（陇海线）in the south, Heze（菏泽）in the west, and the Grand Canal in the east. At the cost of over 10000 casualties, the People's Liberation Army destroyed 9 and a half brigades of the National Revolutionary Army (PLA), totaling 56000 people (including 43000 prisoners).<br/><br/>The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) player plays Liu Bocheng（刘伯承）&amp; Deng Xiaoping（邓小平）, while the National Revolutionary Army (PLA) player plays Ku Chu-tung（顧祝同）.<br/><br/><br/>     Scale = 16 kilometers /hex (10 miles /hex);<br/>     Time = 4 days /GT;<br/>     Size = Division Size / unit.<br/><br/><br/>Turn procedure<br/>The Great Turning is played in turns called Game-turns. Each game turn is divided into several phases. The player which phase is in progress is called the phasing player. After the end of the last game turn, or when either player reaches an instant victory condition, the game ends. Exception: There are special procedures in the first turn.<br/>1. Cards Phase<br/>Both sides randomly draw 3 cards from the deck, and the NRA player draw first.<br/>2. Recovery Phase of PLA<br/>Roll 1D6 to each unit of PLA units marked with CP (up to 3 units). If the recovery is successful, the unit is -1CP. If it fails, it has no effect.<br/>3. The First Movement Phase of PLA<br/>Any number of PLA units can be moved.<br/>4. The First Combat Phase of PLA<br/>PLA player can use their units to attack adjacent NRA units.<br/>5. NRA Reinforcement Activation Phase<br/>NRA player roll 1D6 each according to the army to determine whether each division under the army can carry out actions in this turn. Non-reinforcement units (i.e. units that do not belong to the Second or Fourth Army) do not need to roll the dice, they are always active.<br/>6. NRA Recovery Phase<br/>Roll 1D6 (up to 3 units) to each unit of the NRA units marked with CP. If the recovery is successful, the unit is -1CP. If it fails, it has no effect.<br/>7. The First Movement Phase of NRA<br/>Any number of NRA units can be moved. Reinforcement units may enter at this time.<br/>8. The First Combat Phase of NRA<br/>NRA player can use their units to attack adjacent PLA units.<br/>9. NRA Supply Phase<br/>Determine the supply of NRA units. Rotate the Out of supply (OOS) unit 180 &deg; (i.e. invert); Return the units with supplies to its normal position. The supply will be maintained until the supply phase of the next turn.<br/>10. The Second Movement Phase of PLA (skipping the last turn of the Scenario)<br/>Same as the first movement phase.<br/>11. The Second Movement Phase of NRA (skipping the last turn of the Scenario)<br/>Same as the first movement phase.The reinforcement units may enter at this time.<br/>12. The Administrative Phase<br/>①Weather: Starting from the third turn, NRA player roll 1D6 to determine the weather for the next turn, and flip the turn marker based on the result (the first and second turn are fixed as clear, so there is no need to roll the dice to determine).<br/>Note: If there is no change in weather for three consecutive turns, the weather will definitely change in the next turn. Refer to the weather table. <br/>②Air Force: Place Air Force marker on the &quot;2&quot; (clear) or &quot;0&quot; (rainy) box of the Common Record Track.<br/>③Turn: If this is not the last turn, push the game turn marker in the Common Record Track forward by 1 box, and then start a new turn. If it is the final turn, the game ends and the winner is determined.<br/>Exception: The first turn of both Scenario s has a special procedure that does not follow the standard procedure. And neither side had a second movement phase in the last turn.<br/><br/>",

They then move their robots and fires them.  Each robot can fire once, except for the missile bot, and each needs LOS, except for the mortar bot.<br/><br/>Firing is done by a die roll and comparing it to the number in a hex.  If that number is rolled then the bot is hit and must retreat one hex back (done randomly).

The fruit tree tiles show spaces for 0 to 4 cubes, which are cubes in three colours, red, blue, yellow, for each variety of apple. The player also has a small truck, that is moved about to harvest the crop. The truck and exit the player's board from one side and enter from any other side, but must pass over tiles to harvest fruit. Players can place fruit cubes but only on free spaces and not where their truck is placed.<br/><br/>The game has a marketplace, and a series of long thin tiles are placed under the market to indicate demand. Each demand tile shows a number of cubes in each colour wanted, and as contracts are completed, the tiles move up and fresh tiles are placed from the left.<br/><br/>Each player keeps their income hidden behind a screen and spends money to acquire new fruit tiles, seed their crop and harvest.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the wealthiest player is the winner.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Find out what went wrong, and fast!<br/><br/>The Marriage Mix-Up, title #9 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.<br/><br/>This game is app-assisted. When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next. The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>This system is non-desctructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game, but can pass it on to another group for their use.<br/><br/>This entry in the series takes about an hour to solve, and is rated 1 out of 3 in difficulty. You will need at least two players to solve the puzzles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Master Of Innuendo is a fill-in-the-blank card game where players can flex their naughty bone by using words and phrases on the Innuendo Cards and Party Cards to make blush- and giggle-worthy versions of their favorite movie titles on the Title Cards. Players get 7 Innuendo Cards each per hand, and there are 3 Party Cards that are laid out in the center of the table for every player to use.<br/><br/>To start, the player with the longest name is the first Critic. The Critic reads the Title Card from the top of the pack, noting the blank(s) in the title. The other players use up to 3 of their Innuendo Cards and the Edit Cards to make a funnier version of the movie title. When everyone's ready, The Critic reads the Title Card with the blank, then each player gives their pitch for the new movie title, showing which Innuendo Cards and Edit Cards they're using. When everyone has gone, the Critic chooses their favorite and the winner gets 1 Critic's Choice Point. The Critic then asks the winner to name the real movie title for a bonus Encore Point. Acceptable answers are listed at the bottom of the Title Card. If the player knows another movie that fits that's not listed, they can still get the point if they can prove that it's a real movie. If the player doesn't know the real movie title, the Critic opens it up to all players and the first one to give the real title wins the Encore Point. The next player becomes the new Critic and another round begins after all players have replenished their hands so they have 7 Innuendo Cards each. Used Innuendo Cards are put aside or at the bottom of the stack. The used Title Card is set aside or at the bottom of the stack.<br/><br/>The length of the game can be based on a set time decided by all players or after every player has had a turn as the Critic. At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins and is crowned Master Of Innuendo! They get bragging rights and can wear the Master Of Innuendo medal for the next hour, or until a new winner is crowned, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You can only perform this roll once, but if you<br/>have any Iron cross tokens (re-rolls) you can use them, but any DRM bonus from the Operational card for that turn is<br/>not applied to this roll.<br/>Lose conditions:<br/>1. If you don't have any planes in your Airlift pool at the end of your turn, your game is lost<br/>2. If all of your army groups are destroyed or in Hospital, game is lost<br/>3. If you draw Paulus Surrenders! card from the Operational deck, you immediately lose the game<br/>4. If 3 or more of the areas of your pocket are under Soviet control, game is lost<br/>5. If all of the Operational cards are in the discard pile and you haven't execute successful Operation Winter<br/>Storm or a Breakthrough! roll at the end of that turn, game is over<br/>6.

After you draw a card, if possible, use 2 actions from it.<br/><br/>On the card are usually 4 possible actions you can perform for that turn. Each action is connected to each other with a line. You can only use 2 out of 4 actions, and they must be connected in orthogonal manner. For instance, you can either use top 2 connected actions, or bottom 2 connected.

Each of you must splash the cash and try to buy the most valuable items in the auction. But wait&hellip; any money you have left over turns into bragging points! Will you gain enough points to earn the envy of your opponents and win?<br/><br/>Phase One of the game is the auction, where players bid for job lots for a chance of securing valuable Item Cards, from private yachts to diamond rings! There are four types of <br/>collectible with the Item Cards. They are: Watches, Transport, Antiques and Crypto. Crypto is a trump suit. Will you manage to get your hands on items that are worth bragging about or will your opponents outbid you?<br/><br/>In Phase Two, it's time for the drinks party, get ready to compare and show off about your items!<br/>Everyone picks up the Item Cards they won at auction. <br/>The person who has the most money puts down any one of their Item Cards &ndash; face up. Each player must then put down an Item Card. When possible, Item Cards should match the type of the original card. If you can&rsquo;t match the type, you may play any card &ndash; including Crypto. After you&rsquo;ve all played one Item Card, it makes up a trick. A Crypto Card beats all other cards &ndash; even if the other cards have a higher value. The only way to beat a Crypto Card is to play one with a higher value!<br/>Finally, if you can&rsquo;t match the type, or play a Crypto Card, you still have to play an Item Card. Put down whatever you can. Unfortunately, it means you immediately lose the hand.<br/>Whoever plays the highest Crypto Card wins the trick. If no one plays a Crypto Card, the person who played the highest Item Card of the original type wins the trick.<br/><br/>Bragging Rights ends after 12 rounds, when you&rsquo;ll have played all your Item Cards. The person with the most tricks wins.<br/><br/>",

Fight breathtaking battles on your tabletop with some of the most finest resin miniatures ever created!<br/><br/>What if dragons really flew, in those ancient times, and giants really walked the earth? What if berserkers actually were bear-men, man and bear joined together? What if all of the myths and legends we take for granted were real and our ancestors fought against - and with - creatures and beings and realms we thought were nothing more than the fantasies of our uncivilised selves?<br/><br/>Darklands answers all of those questions for you and more, so take a deep breath and re-create the true history of our world with the Darklands: Second Edition Rules found within this hardback book!<br/> The second edition of Darklands plays much faster than the first edition rules but loses none of the immersiveness and atmosphere of the original. Combat, shooting and sorcery is greatly streamlined but the game's structure is roughly the same - players alternate the activations of their units, performing actions and reactions with them until each unit on the battlefield has activated, at which point the battle hour (what we call a turn) ends and the units that are left steel themselves for another round of combat, shooting and sorcery!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Agents without a Clue&rdquo; is a strategic deduction card game for 3 to 8 players. Players take on the roles of secret Agents trying to find and kill the Ace Agent among them to keep top secret information from getting leaked. The catch is that nobody knows who the Ace Agent is, including the Ace themselves!<br/><br/>The game starts by each player choosing a character to be their secret Agent; the characters that are available are random each game, as there are a total of 17 but each player only gets to choose from two and will discard one. Each character's envelope contains a unique Rank card, a unique Signature Ability card, and a Signature Gun card. The player with the highest Rank will, at the end of the game, be the Ace Agent; but which character has the highest Rank is random each game! Higher ranked Agents will also have more powerful abilities, but are more likely to be the Ace Agent! Any player who is not the Ace Agent will instead be a Rookie. The deck of equipment cards is then drafted amongst all players to give them a starting hand, but do they not play them right away. They must be careful which cards they keep, because they'll have to use them all before the game ends!<br/><br/>With game setup complete, players then take turns, one at a time, playing a single card's effect from their hand. These can be guns for shooting each other or other utility items for defense, deduction, or even adjusting the Rank of other players. Most cards have more than one effect, but you must choose one to play out. Players only have a single hit point, so they must be careful to keep enough defense cards on them! If a player dies from being shot, their turns are skipped unless they are revived. Players will use the cards at their disposal to figure out or influence who the Ace Agent is and act accordingly to achieve their goal. While characters' Signature Ability cards are super powerful, they also give away a player's identity and should be held onto until the right time.<br/><br/>The goal of the game for the Ace Agent is to have either the highest ranking Rookie be dead or more than one Rookie be dead (even if the Ace himself is dead). The Rookies' goal is to work together to kill the Ace Agent without accidentally fulfilling his goal for him. The end of the game occurs after all players pass their turn in a row (from being either dead or out of cards); upon which all character's ranks are publicly revealed to determine who the Ace Agent is and whether the Ace Agent or the Rookies succeeded.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The contents of each &quot;set&quot; were:<br/><br/>Larger boxes:<br/>-8 figures<br/>-1 crossbow firing device.<br/>-1 cannon firing device<br/>-1 catapult firing device<br/>-projectiles<br/>-Gates and wall pieces<br/>-a spinner<br/>-one page of rules<br/><br/>Even the box was needed because it was used to measure movement of troops and distances between the combatants.<br/><br/>Each player sets up their forces two box lengths apart.  Both sides setup their castle and position their four soldiers and firing device.<br/><br/>A turn begins with both players spinning the spinner, with the high side shooting first that turn.  A soldier needs to be within 3 centimeters to be able to fire a device.  Both sides take turns shooting at their opponent.  Each soldier that is struck, even by ricochet, is out.  Players can also forfeit shooting and instead advance one of their soldiers, and the firing device next to them, one box length (to get the weapons closer). A cannon or crossbow can only be fired every three shots.<br/><br/>The first player to knock out all their opponent's soldiers wins.

Instead, because of luck and mission ingenuity, Opportunity continued for more than 14 years. She and her twin rover Spirit helped discover some of the first clear signs of ancient water on Mars and reinvigorated exploration of the red planet.<br/><br/>Opportunity is a fast-playing solo strategy game that gives you the chance to control the mission yourself. How successful will you be?<br/><br/>You mission: Move point-to-point across Mars. Make as many Discoveries as you can. Keep going for as long as you can. Score as high as you can.<br/><br/>You'll need: One deck of poker cards and two different colored six-sided (d6) dice (one for rolling, the other as a game piece).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Without food or water and only a massive stash of alcohol to stay alive, you must navigate these completely sauced astronauts as they each race to conquer their mission before launching back to Earth.<br/><br/>Players are each dealt 3 task cards and 5 cards from the deck. Each player must acquire the necessary resource cards to successfully complete their (sometimes mindless) tasks. The first player to complete all their tasks wins! Beware of unruly obstacles like drawing a Passed Out card, keeping you from completing your mission. But fear not worthy space traveler, the Rocket Rope Ride card or a lucky roll of the dice will definitely help sober up your drunken astronaut.<br/><br/>And nobody likes to drink alone, so watch out for sneaky fellow astronauts getting you drunk and swiping your resources to complete their tasks before you! Drunk cards can be an advantage to you when played against another opponent. Playing matching Drunk cards affords players the opportunity to swipe a resource card or a card from their opponent's hand.<br/><br/>Additionally, players can experience other challenges along the way with skip, double skip, and shuffle the deck cards.<br/><br/>*Please note: Drinking is not required or part of the gameplay.

        "description": "Империя (&quot;Empire&quot;) is a conquest and building game, much like Risk and Civilization, with only two pages of rules.<br/><br/>The map is divided into territories. Each territory has the portrait of its dictator on it along with a gold symbol for how much income it gives, and symbols for the units it can recruit.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>The turn begins with a roll of the dice to check for rebellion. If it is &quot;6&quot;, then some province has rebelled. Rolling a pair of dice indicates its number.<br/><br/>Next, players take turns buying armies with the available money at approved ancient Spartan rates, placing them in the provinces where they are hired.<br/><br/>Then they begin to move armies to neighboring provinces for conquest. Armies are led by a general. Without it, it is not an army, but a collection of recruits who cannot fight on their own but are able to simply move around. Most often, as conscripts in the direction of the &quot;military registration and enlistment office&quot;, that is, the commander. And only this &quot;head&quot; (and this is what a commander looks like) is able to unite forces into an army and lead into battle. Since each side has only four generals, no empire can afford more than four directions for simultaneous aggression.<br/><br/>When entering someone else's territory, a battle begins. Even neutral countries at the beginning of the game snap back very painfully. So, there is no easy loot in the game.<br/><br/>In the mechanics of combat, the dice has a great influence as a generator of battle randomness. First, both sides play rock-paper-scissors, choosing a value between 1 and 6. When announcing the values, refer to the &quot;Battle Scheme&quot; in the center of the map.<br/><br/>The winner gets the right to an additional roll of the dice in the battle. The second additional roll of the dice is played in the same way. Next, each player calculates the strength of his army (infantry = 1, cavalry = 2, etc.), adds the main roll of the dice and, if he wins an additional roll, also its value. The opponent does the same, after which the obtained values are compared. The result of the battle is described in the &quot;Battle Table&quot;.<br/><br/>I would like to note that the winner, no matter how huge the advantage, always loses at least one infantryman. Or an analogue of his power if the attacker does not have infantry. War requires sacrifices, even if it is &quot;small and victorious.&quot;<br/><br/>But on the other hand, a pleasant surprise awaits the invader. Lovers of &quot;robbing cows&quot;, rejoice! A roll of the dice is used to determine how many coins have been requisitioned from the undoubtedly grateful population to the liberator. And then there's the ODN fee, ugh, the tax will be collected from this province at the beginning of the next turn. In general, war is a profitable business here. True, if not for the rivals, who are probably of the same opinion.<br/><br/>Then the next player attacks, and so on.<br/><br/>From time to time, successful expansion is disrupted by unfortunate uprisings in the rear, often leading to the &quot;breakaway&quot; of the province from the empire. The restoration of constitutional order takes time for the transfer of troops and breaks plans for the conquest of peace. Plundering a newly enslaved province, as an easy form of compensation for the inconvenience caused, sweetens the &quot;bitter pill&quot; of losing momentum.<br/><br/>The turn ends, and it repeats all over again. (end of article)<br/><br/>The game comes with numerous miniatures for the infantry, cavalry, elephants, chariots, ships, and fortifications.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer (translated)<br/><br/>",

The player who wins the round, throws a dice and moves forward on the board. A surprising feature of Last Heards is that the player who reaches the finish first, also wins the game.<br/>The playing board features &ldquo;Verdict&rdquo; cards. A player who lands on a &ldquo;Verdict Square&rdquo; on the game board, has to pick a Verdict Card and vill follow ze instructions on ze card.

        "description": "In this game, each player strives to be the first to destroy the enemy's warriors.<br/><br/>Players take turns. During his turn, the player makes one shot with the help of the dice. The right of the first move is determined by the roll of the dice. The player who gets the right to shoot is the first to call the opponent's sector A or B and rolls his dice. If the number of points on the dice coincides with the number of the hex, on which the opponent's figure stands, then the shot was accurate.<br/><br/>The opponent must make a defensive throw with his dice. If the number of points of the defensive throw coincides with the number of points of the &quot;shot&quot;, then the protective equipment saved the warrior from being &quot;wounded&quot;, the figure of the warrior remains in the same place. If the points of defense and shot do not coincide, then the figure of the warrior is &quot;wounded&quot; and moves to the yellow field of its hex.<br/>The next time the unit is wounded, it should move from the yellow to the red field. If a unit is on the red field and is wounded again, it is considered destroyed and is removed to the center of the hexomap, where the sector designation is depicted.<br/><br/>The ARMOR icon in the card next to the unit figure saves the unit from one wound if it is on a yellow field. The ARMOR Usage Card is out of the game if it does not have the MEDKIT icon on it. If there is a MEDKIT icon, the card stays next to the unit, but lies down halfway so that only the MEDKIT icon remains open. The player will need the FIRST AID Kit a little later - on the red field.<br/><br/>The MEDKIT icon saves the unit from one wound if he stands on the red hex. After using the First Aid Kit once, the card is out of the game.<br/><br/>Cards provide additional protection for warriors. There are two symbols on the cards: &quot;yellow shield with a blue stripe&quot; - ARMOR and &quot;red cross&quot; badge - FIRST AID KIT. Each of the badges saves warriors from being wounded once.<br/><br/>Game come with:<br/>-Hexopoles - 4 pcs <br/>-Flashcards - 12 pcs <br/>-TRKP squad figures - 6 pcs <br/>-Heavy line infantry figures - 6 pcs <br/>-Dice - 2 pcs<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fr&ouml;schis (engl. Froggis) is the German version of the game תעשו מקום (Make Room), published in 2020 by Shafir Games in Israel.<br/>In Fr&ouml;schis, you want to line up your cards in numerical order, eventually getting rid of your card row entirely.<br/><br/>The deck consists of cards numbered 1-8 with six of each, along with four frogs and eight trash. To start the game, deal each player a row of eight cards face down.<br/><br/>On a turn, take either the top card of the deck or the discard pile, then place the card in the proper place in your row &mdash; a 1 goes in the first spot, a 2 in the second spot, etc. &mdash; as long as the card you're replacing is face down. Reveal that face-down card, and if you can place it in your row &mdash; again, replacing only a face-down card &mdash; then do so. If you reveal a frog, it's a joker that can serve as any number. If, for example, you place a frog in the 4 spot, reveal a 6, then place the 6 and reveal a 4, you can place the 4, then move the frog to a different face-down spot. If you reveal trash or a number you already have face up, discard it to end your turn.<br/><br/>If you have eight face-up cards in a row, each other player takes one final turn, then you start a new round, and all players who completed their row are dealt only seven cards instead of eight. Now you have to get only seven cards in a row to win the round, but all 8s count as trash for you, possibly making it harder for you to do so. Keep playing rounds until someone gets down to a row of only one card, completing it with a 1 or a frog. That player wins when they do so, and multiple players can win if they complete their one-card row in the same round.<br/><br/>This free demo version doesn't have all the cards of the full version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A magical meteor crashed in the Tassacra desert, sparking a fierce competition among fantasy creatures. They're all after the magical shards the meteor left behind to become the top faction in Zephyrund. Possessing these shards increases your faction's influence, or they can be used to craft powerful artifacts, boosting your strength on the battlefields.<br/><br/>In Tassacra, you play four rounds called Days, and the winner of the game is the player with the most victory points at the very end. During the course of the play, you can earn victory points in many different ways, such as defeating foes, winning battles, scoring end-day objectives, stealing from your opponents, selling resources, and more.<br/><br/>In this strategic race, players select asymmetric factions of magical beings, each equipped with distinctive abilities and strengths. Factions also have different activity peaks during specific times of the day (dusk, day, and night), but all players will take eight main actions by the end of the day. To win, you will invade the desert, move units, engage in combats, scavenge magical shards, and resupply. Additionally, you can craft items to upgrade combat abilities, sell shards to the market, and complete quests.<br/><br/>You will attack and get attacked. In combat, active players roll combat dice, which can be modified by upgrades and combat cards.<br/><br/>There are just four days before rivals and the desert sands claim the shards. Get your warriors ready &ndash; the battle in Tassacra begins!<br/><br/>",

After a massive battle, the Alice's drove out the Void, saving the inhabitants of Wonderland. But when it came time to rebuild the devastated Wonderland, every Alice insisted on creating their own version. They couldn't agree on anything, so the Queen of Hearts made a suggestion. &quot;Let the Alices fight, and the winner shall decide.&quot; In response, the Alices made alliances and split into four factions, each fighting for their own ideal world. A ruthless battle royale begins&hellip;<br/><br/>Alicematic 完全世界 (Kanzen sekai / Whole Wide World) is the first game in Manifest Destiny's Alicematic series. Players compete to win the most territory in Wonderland. Battles are carried out by each player drawing and placing a line of five cards, with some cards face-up and some face-down. The different factions defeat each other in the style of paper-rock-scissors, but players have the option to play cards from their hands as reinforcements. Unique Alice cards and Landmarks offer special abilities that can quickly turn the tide of each conflict. Players play a set number of rounds depending on the player count, and the player with the most territories on the shared map plus the Landmarks they won from other players is the winner.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of the gameplay and components is using jigsaw puzzles as the player maps. Each player has their own map, while battles take place on a central shared map. All the 28-piece puzzles are cut the same, so their pieces have identical shapes. To show you've conquered a territory in Wonderland, you replace it with the puzzle piece from the same position on your own map.<br/><br/>",

Or will you, Mrs. Hudson, landlady of 221B, prevent her disappearance? In a SherBlock, you can play as many as two protagonists! Choose sides, flip the block and play!<br/><br/>The rules are very simple and are all contained on the first page. We will begin our adventure as Wiggins whose acumen was rated a whopping 5 pipes by Sherlock Holmes. As we progress through the adventure this number will eventually increase or decrease based on our choices. As for Wiggins, the final rating will depend on the number of pipes in our possession.<br/><br/>On some pages of the work then we will find portions of text written in red. At that time we may decide to flip the game to play the adventure as Mrs. Hudson. We will experience the story from the point of view of the two main characters, and it will be up to us to decide who to lead to victory. Mrs. Hudson's final evaluation will be decidedly different from Wiggins'.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and a run of the game takes about 10 minutes. However, the fact that it is replayable several times to discover the various possible scenarios, encounters and endings is definitely a plus.<br/><br/>Excellent introduction to this genre of games, suitable for even the littlest ones (but not only) that is set to fill all that downtime you have during the day: pick up the pad and read.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arena of Mages is the first installment in a series of games released by Tehnolog.  It was released in 2001 in two large, boxed sets, along with 10 supplements.<br/><br/>This entry is for the second boxed set.<br/><br/>The boxed version included: <br/>-a playing field (made up of 4 sections)<br/>-12 standee markers<br/>-2 player aids<br/>-72 soldier cards <br/>-48 artifact cards <br/>-18 event markers <br/>-2 game dice <br/>-rules<br/><br/>The rules of this boxed version were slightly different from the rules of the game of the larger version.  However,<br/>the cards (soldiers and artifacts) of the different sets were compatible with one another, and players had the opportunity to assemble their own, invincible armies.<br/><br/>Fans of the Fantasy Battles game system will recognize the characters on the cards from the units of the Fantasy Battle system. Each of them has its own name or nickname.<br/><br/>The rules of the boxed version are based on the confrontation of squads from two players (no more than six squads on each side). One soldier from each squad can be on the field at the same time. Each player's turn consists of four phases:<br/><br/>1. Preliminary phase - introducing new fighters into the game, equipping fighters with artifacts.<br/>2. Maneuver phase - movement of fighters on the field.<br/>3. Action phase - each player's fighter on the field can perform one action: movement, healing, shooting, using magic, declaring hand-to-hand combat, passing.<br/>4. The final phase - turning the cards of the fighters turned over in the action phase to the starting position.<br/><br/>To win, a player must remove all of their opponent's tiles from the field first (regardless of whether the opponent has any units left in the squad decks or not).<br/><br/>If you wished to expand your game, there were up to 10 expansion packs that you could add.  Each contained:<br/>-a small playing field<br/>-6 game tiles in three colors<br/>-18 soldier cards<br/>-12 artifact cards<br/>-rules <br/>-1 die<br/><br/>",

Players must first find three precious stones of the same color and bring them to the old pirate who will then give them a map.  They must then go and find the treasure.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Players begin in one of the cities on the map.  They select a path to travel on and roll a die.  The number rolled is the total spaces they may move. When a player rolls a 4,5 or 6 they get a $100 bonus from the bank.<br/><br/>There are three modes of travel: land, sea, and air. Moving on land is free, moving by sea cost $200 per turn moving on it, and air cost $300 per turn.  To transition from one type of mode to another costs $100.  Air travel is from city to city.<br/><br/>Event cards (circular tokens) are gained by landing on them.  They can also be purchased by being in proximity to them and paying a fee of $100 times the distance to the card.  So, if I was three spaces away, I could pay $300 and get the card, or I could get closer and pay less.  Cards have different abilities and can be bad or good.  Some are worth cash, or cause the loss of cash, and some are colored precious stones.<br/><br/>Once the player acquires the three stones of the same type they must go to the pirate and obtain a map (card with a location on it).  Once they reach the designated location on the map, all players roll a die.  If the total value of the dice is even, then the map was real and the player wins.  if not, the map was fake, and they must start the process all over again and bring the pirate (swindler) another three stones.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

As the game progresses, you can make combos that speed you along.<br/><br/>For the racing game, each turn, each player chooses people in the shopping district who will lend their help.

Place 5 jewel pieces in the treasure box squares. <br/>Shuffle the Resident cards and place them face down next to the board along with the money chips. Place all player pieces at the starting point.<br/><br/>Depending on the number of players, each player chooses two Resident cards as helpers, so that other players do not know.<br/><br/>Players then go through the Resident cards chosen in numerical order, from 1 to 9. Where players have chosen the same kind of helper, such as borrowing money, the lower value goes first.<br/><br/>When a Resident helps by moving the player piece backwards or forwards along the street, the player takes the action on the space they land on. If this causes them to advance to another tile, they continue with the action given there. If a player moves through one of the jewellery boxes, they collet the jewel they find there.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the jewels are taken, with the most valuable total being the winner.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is part a series of games that was in Japanese Tactics magazine issues 48, 50, and 52.<br/><br/>In issue 48, the players take on the roles of either rabbits or rats.  This is a kind of RPG, and the battlefield can be whatever the Game Master decides, so you may be trying to get sustenance or to other objectives.  However, in your way are many obstacles. For the rabbit there is the farmer and fox, and for the rat there is the lady of the farm and various birds and owls.  There are additional foes that can be thrown into the mix, such as a squirrel, cat, dog, mole, beaver, snake, even barbed wire. Each of these had their own ability stats which were resolves using one or more d6.<br/><br/>The later issues featuring the game added different complexities and critters.<br/><br/>All issues came with a map and paper tokens, with the rules and charts being inside the magazine.  The tokens were standees.  Assembly was required.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>From Japanese Wikipedia:<br/><br/>A TRPG in which the player plays a small animal such as a rabbit or a cat as a player character (PC). Other than the fact that PCs are animals, PCs do not have a common purpose. What the PC needs to do depends on the scenario prepared by the game master, and at one time the goal of the game is to hunt for survival, and sometimes the goal of the game is to explore the city of humans.<br/><br/>According to the design concept defined in the rulebook, the atmosphere that Rabbits &amp; Rats is aiming for is &quot;The Rabbits of Watership Down&quot;, &quot;The Adventurers&quot; (Gamba's Adventures), &quot;The Adventures of Miss Bianca&quot;, and &quot;Rocky Chuck the Mountain Mouse&quot;. &quot;, &quot;Dr. Raccoon and His Friends&quot;, &quot;Seaton's Book of Animals&quot;, etc.<br/><br/>In this game, the player characters are able to communicate with each other even if they are of different races due to the common language of the animals. (However, you must succeed in the skill assessment.)<br/><br/>The player character is determined by choosing a preset animal race. Each animal race has its own set of stats and initial skills, making it a kind of archetype-based character-making system.<br/><br/>The animal races in the rulebook are rabbits, badgers, rats, squirrels, cats, dogs, otters, sea otters, snakes, and moles.<br/><br/>The act judgment belongs to the percentage roll. If two decahedral dice are rolled to obtain a value in the range of 10~1, and the value is less than or equal to the skill value used for the action judgment, the judgment is considered successful.<br/><br/>Many of the skills are unique to animals, and some of them are not often found in regular TRPGs. (For example, when performing actions that are common sense for humans but should not be performed by wild animals, such as &quot;crossing a river using something similar to a boat instead of swimming,&quot; it is necessary to succeed in determining the act of &quot;conceivable&quot; skills.)<br/><br/>",

Its reverse side has two orientations: Poisoned and Unpoisoned. Each round, the Sommelier takes the Goblet and chooses whether or not to Poison it by rotating it to the associated orientation, then hands it to another player face-down. That player can choose to Drink from the Goblet, or peek at the card and Pass it to another player, who then chooses between the two options, but watch out: If all other players Pass, the Sommelier must drink from the Goblet themself!<br/><br/>If you drink poisoned wine twice, you are eliminated from the game. You win the game if you drink unpoisoned wine twice or all other players have been eliminated. Will you leave the goblet unpoisoned knowing that no one else will want to drink from it? Or will you poison it, knowing that someone else will know that you know that no else will want to drink from it and thus will want to drink from it?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With no designated successor, the family recalled the existence of the Viscount's will, securely stored in a safe. The challenge, however, lies in the fact that nobody possesses the complete password to access the safe. The Viscount, known for his love of solving mysteries, had scattered clues throughout the mansion.<br/><br/>In Shadow House: The Code, players assume the roles of detectives, invited to the Shadow Viscount's mansion to uncover clues that will unlock the safe. Throughout the game, you have already discovered some clues to make educated guesses about the password. You interact with your opponents, posing questions to extract additional clues, and then work towards deducing the final solution. It requires cleverness to answer accurately, as your conversation may inadvertently reveal more information to the listener. However, making a mistake in divulging secret document clues could expose your own secrets. The first person to input the correct pair of numbers while revealing the correct answer emerges victorious.<br/><br/>This deduction game carries a lively party game atmosphere. In the course of the game, will you choose to disclose details such as the time you woke up today, your weight, or your birthday?<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players have secret roles in the game, and use item cards to attack on opposing character, adding a token which gives a clue to their own identity. Players also have sword and shield tokens to use, and witch tokens.<br/><br/>The new game differs by having each player run a number of characters in their team. This allows broad gameplay with just two players. Further, players do not start the game knowing who their allies are, and the characters include a werewolf who is a traitor to the team. If the werewolf can identify the princess, they win outright.<br/><br/>When the game was first produced at the Tokyo Game Market in December 2023, pre-orders received some bonus cards:<br/><br/>Hidden Princess - This character allows the leader to be switch amongst the other characters. The Hidden princess is more powerful than the normal Princess, and enables the game to played longer.<br/><br/>Cursed Werewolf - If the cursed werewolf identifies the opposing Princess, the game does not end, and the team's leader may switch to another character.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The game can be played in three ways, but the main objective is always the same.<br/><br/>Beginner Bakers (2-6 Players): Players start with foam cake pieces in all six colors and two different double-sided icing pieces that is theirs to keep throughout the game.<br/><br/>Mixin' Madness (2-6 Players): All pieces (cake and icing) are mixed together in the middle of the table at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Bakery Bakeoff (Sensory Play, 2-3 Teams): All pieces (cake and icing) are mixed together in the middle of the table at the start of the game. Each team picks one player as the Lead Baker, and one as the Assistant Baker. The Assistant Baker has their eyes closed, and must be instructed by the Lead Baker on how to bake the cake while feeling for pieces with the correct texture. The winning team receives the Candle Card at the end of the round.<br/><br/>",

Players choose pre-existing routes between cities to connect, and then bid against each other to purchase the various power plants that are needed to provide the selected cities with energy.<br/><br/>However, once the plants have been purchased, new, more efficient power plants become available over time. Therefore, by your purchase, you are potentially allowing other players to gain access to equipment superior to yours.<br/><br/>In addition, players need to purchase the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power the power plants (except for renewable wind and solar power plants, which do not require fuel), creating a constant struggle and competition.<br/><br/>Thus, you are faced with a difficult choice - either upgrade your power plants to maximize efficiency or have enough money on hand to quickly expand your grid when the time comes to get the cheapest and most profitable routes.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>This is a stand-alone version of Power Grid that comes with the Russia/Japan map instead of the Germany/USA map.<br/><br/>",

The mix of rotting fish and peculiar additives made her hallucinate. In a very extraordinary feverish trip, seven personalities diverged to manifest the seven houses of Muffins Magical Kingdom. Through acts of political discourse, and the clever use of magical tails, the Houses began to vie for control as they sway the tides of the Muffins Mind.<br/><br/>Muffin's Magical Kingdom is a semi-cooperative trick-taking game for 3 or more players, that plays in 20-45 minutes depending on the number of players. It plays in exactly 21 tricks.<br/><br/>We start with the dealer, who comes in the form of a Rat trying to put the pieces of Muffin back together again. They randomly deal a House and 10 cards to each player. The Rat then chooses the Trump House which serves a dual purpose for scoring. Each trick won, the player collects not only the cards from the trick but also the Trump house card.<br/><br/>Each House has a special ability that is a reflection of their personality trait that is triggered whenever the card is played. These abilities can manipulate players hands, communication, and their future. Players may communicate by passing messages through courier Rats, but each message sent can be read by the Rat player so all houses should handle with care.<br/><br/>The game ends when all 21 tricks are won, or any player wins a Trick from all 7 Houses. If the Rat player wins all 7 Houses, they immediately win the game. If a House player wins all 7 Houses, they immediately lose the game and the Rat wins.<br/><br/>Scoring is based on the house and playing cards won during each each. 1 point for each card, 5 points for each card with a matching house, and 10 points for each card where all house cards are collected for that house. There are 4 cards for each house inclusive of the one randomly dealt at the start of the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The game is all about delivering mathematically-correct mail around neighbourhoods and collecting money in return.<br/><br/>LASERCUT COMPONENTS: <br/>&bull; 108 number tiles: 1-9, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50<br/>&bull; 12 sets of operator tiles: + - x<br/>&bull; 10 house standees with bases<br/>&bull; 5 mailboxes with bases<br/>&bull; 5 mail trucks with bases<br/>&bull; 20 coins in two denominations ($) ($$)<br/><br/>GOAL: <br/>Players will be required to collect numbers to form equations. The equation will match a house number. Deliver the mail to the matching house to get paid. Collect the most value in coins by forming simple mathematical equations that yield a street delivery address for a target house.<br/><br/>MODES: <br/>Younger Child Play: Only the addition operators will be used and house numbers will range from 11 to 20.<br/>Full Play: All mathematical operators are used with house numbers 11-99.<br/>&emsp;<br/>SETUP:  <br/>&bull; Arrange the houses into your choice of neighbourhoods with one mailbox per group (see Neighbourhoods below)<br/>&bull; Shuffle the number tiles and operators upside down in two separate draw piles<br/>&bull; Assign each house an address using random number tiles (1-9 only) face up.<br/>&bull; Place a coin on each house base as follows: one ($) for addresses 11-50, ($$) for addresses 51+.<br/>&bull; Place three number tiles and one operator tile face up on each mailbox base.<br/>&bull; Each player grabs a mail truck.<br/>&bull; Each player grabs one number tile to keep in secret.<br/><br/>END OF GAME CONDITIONS:<br/>Agree upon what constitutes the end of the game:<br/>&bull; Abandoned Homes: upon picking up money, the house is abandoned and will no longer have an address.<br/>&bull; Target Score: play until a player has collected coins that total a minimum value like 5 points.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:  <br/>On each turn, a player has 30 seconds to do the following: <br/>&bull; Move their truck to either a mailbox or house.<br/>&bull; When at a mailbox, pick up one or more required tiles into their truck slots, replacing empty mailbox slots with fresh tile(s) from the draw pile(s).<br/>&bull; When at a house, call out their equation and destination address, allowing opponent(s) to verify the math is correct; collect the coin; replace the house with two fresh tiles (unless abandoned); discard all the tiles from the truck.<br/><br/>Secret Number Tile:<br/>Place your secret number tile into your truck at any time. Once used, grab another number tile to keep secret.<br/><br/>Mailbox Operations:<br/>A truck at a mailbox may either:<br/>&bull; Take one or more tiles from the mailbox and place in the truck; replace all empty mailbox slots with new tile(s) from the appropriate draw pile(s)<br/><br/>House Operations:<br/>If the truck is in the same neighbourhood as their destination address, the player calls out their equation and collects the coins.<br/><br/>If the truck fulfills their equation and is not at the neighbourhood with the destination address, the player must wait until their next turn to move their truck to the correct neighbourhood.<br/><br/>TIP: Before selecting tiles at a mailbox, choose wisely based on the addresses you see.<br/><br/>FORMING EQUATIONS:<br/>Form math equations by using at least two numbers and one operator. The equation is formed within the base of your truck. The solution to the equation will be the address of a house (destination). To form the equation, collect the correct numbers and operator(s). Examples:<br/><br/>Valid Matching Equations<br/>7+7    2x5+4   20-6   all match house number 14.<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME:<br/>Keep playing until no one can collect any more tiles.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/>The winner will have the most value in coins. If there is a tie, play another round.<br/><br/>EXCEPTIONS:<br/>You cannot stop in a neighbourhood where there is another truck. Only one truck per neighbourhood.<br/><br/>FAQ: TBD<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Walk, run, and jump around the board to hamper the other team, but make sure to leave enough room for your own!<br/><br/>Quagmire is an abstract strategy game for two players, played on a small hexagonal board.  On their turn, a player moves one of their two meeples a short distance and destroys some of the board in the process.  Meeple can jump small gaps, but eventually, through tactical movement and blocking, one player will run out of moves and lose the game.<br/><br/>The game is intended to be an introduction to luckless, combinatorial games and to be accessible to young children.

You must navigate a dangerous world, evading the police while trying to win Bonnie Parker's heart. Every decision matters, from resource management to avoiding law confrontations, as you carve your path to destiny.<br/><br/>In this game, Bonnie&rsquo;s presence through her poetry is a constant influence on your choices. Her spirit and writings add a romantic and narrative dimension, as you, playing as Clyde, seek to earn her affection and forge the bond that will unite them in history.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each turn, you have (at best) 4 actions to distribute in order to optimally manage your resources while paying the cost of living and avoiding being imprisoned too often or too quickly. You need to accumulate poems, love, and boredom, as well as ammunition, before stealing a 1927 Ford A and embarking on the roads of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde, Love and Death&quot; before being killed by the police.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is not so much the game, but the art of Ritta Nakanishi that makes this game so popular.  Ritta is noted for his military illustrations and military model art.  This game is fully illustrated from top to bottom (well, not the bottom of the box) with his wonderful art featuring all sorts of horror.<br/><br/>In addition, the entirety of the box is used.  In fact, there are four tops/lids that are illustrated and used in the game.  The result is a three-dimension board where the players move through different levels.  There are even pitfalls at the highest level, as well as caves, in addition to foldable terrain pieces.  To top this off, there is a facade that fits to the back of the board featuring the game's objective. All this creates a highly immersed game experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The unique grading system lets the players decide how intimate they want to be. The game is completely flexible and will be different every time you play.<br/><br/>A mobile app is provided to provide instructions and help manage the game for the players. All players can log into the game to see the random card draws, instructions and player choices on their own devices.<br/><br/>A game board and 16 quality playing pieces are also provided to track the progress of the players through the game.<br/><br/>The game is LGBTQ+ friendly and can be enjoyed by everyone aged 18 and over. The grading system allows the players to dictate what level of intimacy there is between them, from no physical interaction to activities which would make seasoned swingers blush.<br/><br/>The game can last from 30 minutes to several hours and often lasts longer than the players do with all the drinking and excitement which it generates. Play can continue until the end - and a winner announced - or played for a certain period of time. The object is to have fun with your friends, to get to know them better and to help improve intimacy among couples rather than simply winning a game.<br/><br/>The game is suitable for individual couples and groups of friends whether in a relationship or not. It has proved popular with the swinging community during our testing but is suitable for all levels of intimacy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to be the player with the most Olympus points, which means stealing and earning points, as well as spending them to play cards. It's up to you to find the best strategy for reigning supreme on Olympus.<br/><br/>To do so, the game proceeds as follows : <br/>At first, a god card and 10 Olympus points are distributed at each player.<br/><br/>On each turn, players draws 2 cards and can play as many as they like.<br/><br/>When a &quot;power&quot; card is played, an Olympus point is stolen from the player with the corresponding god, or taken from the reserve if it is of his own god. These cards are discarded afterwards.<br/><br/>For every other types of cards, players needs to pay the appropriate number of Olympus points to place the cards and use their powers.<br/><br/>A player loses when he runs out of points.<br/><br/>To win, a player needs to be the first to gather 20 Olympus points, to be the only player left with points or to be the one with more points when the card deck is empty.<br/><br/>",

Players each get 6 board tiles which they take turns placing on the field of play, connecting the tiles to form a unique battlefield. Players place their 12 checkers strategically on the squares of their tiles, with the kings hidden, face down at the beginning of the game. Eliminate your opponents by capturing their king.<br/><br/>On their turn, players roll two dice to determine how to move a checker. One die has the symbols for chess pieces, the other is a standard d6 numbers die. Whenever a 6 is rolled, the player may opt to reroll with the KANGAROO Die and the numbers die for 6 additional useful moves.<br/><br/>Players eliminate their opponents by capturing the hidden king of the opposing army, which then leaves the board.

        "description": "A Vanguard paves the way for the rest of the forces in a faction. Bound by honour and pride, their duels are often the first of conflicts between two opposing forces in an arcane war.  Their victories amplify morale and their defeats ominous signs for their Battle Mage masters &hellip;<br/><br/>TKG ARENA: The Vanguard Duels is a game set up for 2 players.<br/><br/>Components required for this game:<br/><br/>STANDARD DECK (DECK):     1<br/>PLAYING CARD STAND (STAND):     2<br/>OINKS:    1 from each element<br/><br/>Winning Condition<br/><br/>The player with the most HONOUR points wins the game when it ends.<br/><br/>Ending Condition<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players reaches 12 or more HONOUR points.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>A player starts the game by designating the following areas: A draw deck area O, a discard area X and five adjoining spaces that is designated A, B, C, D and E on the card stand. The players should be seated facing each other with sufficient space between them to place the trumping order represented by the spaces T, 1, 2 and 3.<br/><br/>X    A    B    C    D    E    O<br/><br/><br/>     Determine the starting player by taking turns to draw cards from a shuffled standard deck. The player who draws the highest face value starts first. In case of a tie, the tied players keep drawing till the tie is broken with a player drawing a higher face value. The other player decides the initial trumping order.<br/>     All 36 cards are re-shuffled and each player receives 18 cards faced down as a drawing stack at their respective area O.<br/>     Each player draws 5 cards from the top of the draw stack and places them on the stand one by one in the sequence drawn. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th card drawn should be located on the stand at positions A, B, C, D and E respectively. All the front facing contents of the cards face the player and the backs of the cards towards the opponent.<br/>     Players are not allowed to switch the positions of the cards freely during play.<br/>     The area X is used as a space to place discarded cards during play.<br/>     The Oinks representing the 4 elements will be placed in the spaces T, 1, 2 and 3 to indicate the priority of the elements. The trumping element has priority over all other elements during play.<br/><br/><br/>T        1    2    3<br/><br/>E.g. Fire (Ashw) is in the T space &ndash; Any Fire (Ashw) card will beat cards of any other element, when both cards are Fire (Ashw) cards, the card with the higher face value will win.  Moving forward, let&rsquo;s assume that Water (Esbner), Earth (Ohif) and Air (Ukelele) are in positions 1, 2 and 3 respectively, this means when face values of opposing cards are the same, the tie is broken using this priority: All Water (Esbner) cards will prevail against Earth (Ohif) cards which will prevail against Air (Ukelele) cards. Water (Esbner) cards will also prevail against Air (Ukelele) cards.<br/><br/>On each player&rsquo;s turn<br/><br/>The player can choose to execute ONE of the two following actions.<br/><br/><br/>     End the round immediately by discarding 2 cards from his/her draw stack at O. All players proceed to scoring the round. This move cannot be chosen when there are less than 2 cards in the draw stack at O and 5 cards in the discard space X.<br/>     Draw the top card from the draw stack at O and may choose to either discard it into X or replace it with one of the cards placed in A, B, C, D or E. In this case, the replaced card goes into the discard space X. 3 further possibilities stem from here.<br/>         If the discarded card into X has an odd face value (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), the player must reveal one of his/her cards by placing it face up in front of card stand while maintaining its position relative to the other unrevealed cards.<br/>         If the discarded card into X has an even face value (2, 4, 6, 8), the player must reveal the top card of his draw stack at O and keep it face up until it is drawn.<br/>         If the discarded card into X is of the same element as the immediate previous discard card, the player can choose to re-arrange all the elements in the trumping order.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>At any point of time, if the draw stack at O has no more cards, the last turn takes place followed by scoring of the round. Otherwise, the other player takes his/her turn and the game proceeds.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>When each round ends, players will pit their cards against each other in the respective spaces on the card stand. E.g. Corresponding cards in space A of the players are compared, followed by those in spaces B, C, D and E. Trumping priority are resolved first. This is followed by face value priority. Cards with higher face values win those of lower values. Ties in face value priority are resolved by spaces 1, 2 and 3 in the trumping order explained earlier. For each card that has higher priority over his/her opponent&rsquo;s respective card, a victory is scored.<br/><br/>Over 5 spaces, the player with more victories will claim HONOUR points equal to the number of discarded cards in the opponent&rsquo;s discard space X. If the ending condition is met, the game ends and the winner is the one with most HONOUR points. Otherwise, the HONOUR points are recorded, all cards (inclusive of discarded or unused cards) in the game are re-collected and the set up for a new round begins.<br/><br/>",

See examples below for clarity.<br/><br/><br/>GAME PLAY: <br/>Players have five minutes to simultaneously form words horizontally in each row by adding one or more additional letters from their stockpiles. As you add a letter, mark it off from the stockpile. You cannot reuse letters. Words must be at least three letters long.<br/><br/>SCORING:  <br/>At the end of five minutes, assemble your letters into words, unscramble as needed. Score each completed word, then add up the total for your final score. The player with the highest score wins. If there is a tie, the player with the alphabetically-highest word wins.<br/><br/>EXAMPLE: <br/>(See images for example).<br/>Wendy calls out COUNTRY and OUTCOME as the seeds.<br/><br/>     The letters from both words are written down vertically in order.<br/>     Letters are added from the stockpile and marked off  <br/>     The letters in row 6 are unscrambled.<br/><br/><br/>as used. <br/><br/>     Words are scored to get the final score.<br/><br/><br/>  <br/>STRATEGIES:<br/><br/>     Before dropping the initial letters from each seed word, think about what new words you might wish to form for maximum points.<br/>     Try to use the top value letters.<br/>     Call out your own, more complicated seven-letter words.<br/><br/><br/>",

The side with the initiative then rolls a die for the number of action points they get.<br/><br/>An action point can be used to:<br/>1. Fire the walker or multigun. The multigun can only be fired a maximum of three times per turn. To fire the walker all friendly militia must be closer to the fortress than the walker, and for the multigun to fire the infantry must have a soldier within 5cm of it.<br/>2. Move a walker, gun, or soldier 10cm.  Moving up and down the stairs of the fortress costs 10cm.<br/><br/>When enemy soldiers are at a range of 5cm or less to one another, they fight a melee.  Both roll a die and the high side wins.<br/><br/>To win the attackers must eliminate all enemy soldiers or capture the flag atop the fortress.  The defenders win if they kill all enemy militia.<br/><br/>The game comes with:<br/>-1 Firing Robot Walker<br/>-1 Firing Multigun<br/>-6 Militia troops<br/>-6 Empire Infantry<br/>-Shells<br/>-Fortress<br/>-Flag for the fortress<br/>-1 die<br/>-1 measuring device<br/>-Rules<br/><br/>The photo on the box also shows two palm trees, but these are not included in the rules manifest.<br/><br/>",

If a player has the card and the necessary blocks, instead of rolling the die, they can build on the city's ground plan.<br/>Once there are 12 buildings in the city, the game is over and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The number four plays a special role in Struckle, with four sides battling via a set of four pieces. Each set of four pieces available to a player is nudged to behave like a team by the game&rsquo;s peculiar turn&rsquo;s definition.<br/><br/>At its core, Struckle is a game of strategy and emergence. Players take turns mobilizing their entire teams at once and using their powers, when available. Progress toward the final objective of occupying two goal squares is intertwined by actions to disrupt the opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>The rules are simple, but the strategic depth is profound. It's easy to learn, yet it takes time to master. At every turn, players must consider not only their immediate actions but also anticipate their opponent's responses.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

We, his parents, have to experience time and again that those around us know far too little about food allergies, which is why there was once even a life-threatening incident.<br/><br/>We want to change that: with the Allergy laying and memo game! 26 children look for their food allergen.<br/><br/>Alongside egg, peanut, fish, nuts, soy and wheat, milk is one of the allergens to which children react most frequently. The memo game Allergy! also revolves around these seven allergens. 26 children are looking for their food allergen.<br/><br/>I have drawn children from all cultures who are happy about a food and then have an allergic reaction to it: For example, a little girl bites into a chocolate marshmallow. The allergen egg is depicted on the corresponding card and the child has pustules. Players can easily match cards, as the child depicted and the background match on the pairs of cards.<br/><br/>Players not only learn which allergens can be found in food, but also the various allergic reactions: from itchy, burning skin redness and swelling to digestive and circulatory problems and breathing difficulties.<br/><br/>A pair of cards also explains how emergency medication can help allergy sufferers in the event of an anaphylactic shock. The game box also contains useful information on the topic. <br/>We need your consent to load this video<br/><br/>Unboxing! What's inside?<br/><br/>When drawing, I made sure to package the serious topic in a funny way. The allergic reactions are depicted in an exaggerated way, which is particularly popular with young players and arouses their interest in the topic.<br/><br/>The game, which has been thoroughly tested by the German Allergy and Asthma Association (DAAB), is aimed at children of toddler and preschool age.<br/><br/>It consists of 56 cards, including four information cards. The appealing and child-friendly illustrations were created by Anita Barry.<br/><br/>The laying and memo game was produced in Germany using FSC-certified materials that are safe for children.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Djinnchilla is a captivating board game centered around summoning and bonding with magical creatures called Djinnchillas. The game, suitable for 2 to 5 players, starts with setting up two decks of Djinnchilla cards &ndash; Regular and Awaken &ndash; and preparing exploration cards based on the number of players.<br/><br/>In each round, players engage in various actions: summoning Djinnchillas from a shared row or deck, fusing male and female Djinnchillas to draw powerful Awaken cards, trading cards to acquire specific Awaken Djinnchillas, and exploring to gather exploration cards for additional benefits. The game ends when any of the decks (exploration, regular, or Awaken Djinnchilla) runs out.<br/><br/>Scoring is based on the collection of Djinnchilla cards with a focus on forming sets of different elements. The player with the highest score, combining points from Djinnchilla and exploration cards, wins the game. Djinnchilla combines strategic card play with a charming fantasy theme, appealing to players who enjoy tactical decision-making and a touch of magic​​.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players step into the shoes of pastry chefs, navigating through strategic rounds that test their planning and risk-taking skills. The game's phases - Preparation, Baking, and Selling - each offer unique challenges and opportunities. In Preparation, players select from a mix of regular and 'Overbaked' (OB) pastry cards, setting the stage for their baking strategies.<br/><br/>The Baking phase introduces an element of suspense, as players flip their cards to find pastries, mindful of the risk posed by OB cards. Deciding whether to stop or risk continuing adds a thrilling push-your-luck aspect. Then, in the Selling phase, players engage in strategic decision-making to fulfill orders from the Order row or earn points by trading pastries, balancing their choices to maximize their score.<br/><br/>The game culminates after a predetermined number of rounds, where players tally their points primarily from order fulfillment. Overbaked! rewards the player with the highest score, celebrating the strategy and risks taken during the game. This blend of strategy, risk, and engaging gameplay makes Overbaked! a delightful experience for those who enjoy a competitive yet whimsical gaming atmosphere.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The first player to reach 1 million Yen is the winner. Players collect three kinds of cards, Arms, Legs, Attack, and combine these to build a better bot.<br/><br/>The game has a short square track and the ability to attack is affected by the relative position on the track. So if the enemy bot is on the same side of the track as the attacker, it is easier to attack. Then the left or right side and finally the far side is hardest to attack.<br/><br/>Further, the more times a bot circles the track, not only does the prize money rise but it also multiplies. So by making three laps before a fight, a player can win triple money.<br/><br/>The winner of each fight steals money from the enemy, but the game includes many elements to reverse fortunes. So the designer advocates attacking quickly and often and not waiting for better equipment to turn up.<br/>description by user<br/><br/>",

The empire is also on the alert and is actively calling for an all-season call-in order to give a worthy rebuff and preserve the centuries-old foundations. Soon space will be ablaze.<br/><br/>Up to 4 people can take part in the game, where one will try to defend the interests of the emperor, and the other three will struggle to overthrow him. You will capture colonies, build and expand your fleet, as well as conduct combat operations to impose your regime.<br/><br/>The playing field is a grid of hyper transitions between planets, framed by Events. Each turn, the player rolls the dice and moves through the Events and, if it belongs to his faction, casts it. Then the player has the opportunity to receive and spend money, fly around the galaxy and fight with the enemy.<br/><br/>Players not only move along a grid on the sides of the board, but they also maneuver their fleets and capture planets.  Fleets are rated for their movement ability and firepower. When two fleets meet in the same space there is combat.<br/><br/>In combat, the attacker rolls a die and adds the fleet's power to the roll. The number rolled is the number of ships that the defender must lose.  Following this, the defender retaliates.<br/><br/>The game features quite a lot of beautiful plastic figurines of ships, which will undoubtedly attract the attention of younger players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Apex is a strategic game in which various civilizations vie for galactic dominance through influence, technological advancement, and warfare. Set in a science fiction universe unlike any you've seen before, it features truly alien civilizations, diverging from typical science fiction clich&eacute;s.<br/>The game is a straightforward and minimalist 4X, taking approximately 15 minutes per player. Victory points are accumulated by controlling sectors at the end of each of the three ages. While winning doesn't necessitate engaging in war, it can yield additional points.<br/>Each age consists of five turns, during which players select a card to play from a drafted hand. Every card provides the option to pursue one of the four strategies: Evolution, Expansion, Colonization, or War, offering players a multitude of choices. Consequently, your overall strategy is not dictated by the civilization you choose or the cards you receive. It's entirely up to you whether you opt for aggressive expansion, technological improvement, war, diplomacy, or a strategic blend of these elements.<br/>Highly symmetrical, with minimal randomness and devoid of the chaos found in more intricate games, Apex poses a chess-like challenge for seasoned strategists. However, its rich universe and straightforward mechanics make it an ideal game for introducing more casual players to strategic gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "七転牡蠣～Oyster Dance～ (Shichitenkakki～oisutaadansu～) (Oyster Dance) is a game from Japan in which players are grilling oysters to eat. Players roll the dice and following the icons, they prepare the oysters on the barbecue grill. The oyster tokens must be grilled on both sides and then brought to the plate, but only if the player has acquired slices of lemon first. The first player to get three oysters on their plate is the winner.<br/><br/>The oyster tokens show the normal shell on one side and the open oyster on the other. These open oysters have different face emojis which are matched with the dice. If a player cannot take an oyster (they cannot find a matching face or they do not have a lemon slice), they must turn an oyster face down and take a lemon slice as recompense.<br/><br/>If a player can find a matching face, and they have a lemon slice, they can take the oyster to their plate. Then the grill is spun around so that players forget which oysters are where on the grill.<br/><br/>The game is sold with the components in a round box (10.5 cm round, 5 cm deep) which acts as the charcoal burner. However, the actual metal grill used is too large to fit in the box (22.5cm across) and is supplied separately.<br/>--description by user<br/><br/>World's first!

Connections deepened. And a**es laughed off.<br/><br/>It can be played in 3 easy steps: <br/><br/>     Naughty or nice? The choice is yours! Tailor the game to your group by keeping your removing the rowdy cards. We want grandma to play too! <br/>     The starting player picks 3 preferences cards and secretly ranks them in order of most liked to least liked. In no particular order, the player will then read the cards to the group. <br/>     With their combined knowledge, the group will try to guess the player's preferred order through hilarious debates, deliberations, and ah-ha moments, testing how well the group really knows each other. <br/><br/><br/>I bet you're wondering who the winner is? Well, not everything is a competition Monica, this is just for fun! BUT, if you really can't contain your competitive side, grab a sheet of paper (as your score pad) and a pen. In this version, everyone will guess the player's preferences on their own, no conversing with the group! Whoever guesses right, gets a point. Player who has the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>We know you're excited to play, so get ready for those &quot;who knew?!&quot; moments, belly laughs, and that warm and fuzzy feeling we all know and love.<br/><br/>Walk away with smiles that never fade, abs that never looked better, and hearts never so full.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Hit Send is causing message mayhem across social media and Youtube after it was co-created and played by The Sidemen: JJ (KSI), Harry (W2S), Ethan (Behzinga), Tobi (Tobjizzle), Simon (Miniminter) and Josh (Zerkaa). It's easy. Take a letter and number card, e.g. M &amp; 3. Scroll to your 3rd contact under M in your phone (your best friend&rsquo;s mom). Other players put down their most outrageous text card. The DM Don chooses which message you should send. If you send the chosen text, such as &lsquo;Do you ever fantasise about me?&rsquo;, then you win a point. If you back out, the person who put the card down wins it. Get a reply to win another point.

This weakening of France is a boon for Spain, still at war with France, to recover territories (Catalonia, Roussillon, the North of France).<br/>The War of Devolution (1667-1668) - Spain&rsquo;s non-payment of the Infanta of Spain&rsquo;s dowry at her marriage to Louis XIV was used as a pretext for a war of conquest. This was the first conflict initiated by Louis XIV against a militarily and economically weakened Spain.<br/>The Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) - France wants to bring the Dutch Republic to its knees. This fierce commercial competitor, too tolerant as a state, opposes France&rsquo;s expansion toward the Spanish Netherlands. This war for glory pitches against each other living legends of the Thirty Years War like Turenne, Cond&eacute; et Montecuccoli. As a result of this conflict, the King of France earns the nickname Louis the Great.<br/>The War of the Reunions (1683-1684) - Spain does not accept the annexation by France of enclaves and surrounding areas in the Spanish Netherlands, stating their boundaries were poorly defined by the international treaties ending the War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War. Vauban recommends limiting the territorial enclaves, leaning against the mountainous area and securing the enclaves by constructing strongholds; it&rsquo;s a matter of turf.<br/>The War of the League of Augsburg (1688-1697) - The Habsburg&rsquo;s victory against the Ottomans diverted the Empire&rsquo;s attention on the French territorial gains following the War of the Reunions. In 1687, Louis XIV wanted to transform the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent accord and send an ultimatum to the emperor who refused. The German princes and the great European powers form an alliance to counter France&rsquo;s politics of expansionism and religious persecution. France finds itself diplomatically isolated.<br/>The War of Spanish Succession (1701-1713) - King Charles II of Spain dies with no descendants. The two principal reigning families of Europe, the Bourbons (France) and the Habsburgs (Austria), are both related to Charles II and claim the throne. The principal stake is the domination of Europe by seizing the enormous heritage of the Spanish Habsburgs. France is confronted with its fiercest military enemies: Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy.<br/>Maximise your resource points to recruit armies, build strongholds, lead sieges and battles and win glory points.<br/>Will you be able to vanquish Montecuccoli, Eugene of Savoy or Marlborough with Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Villars and impose the Sun King&rsquo;s will? Or Vauban will be the nemesis of all enemies &lsquo;citadels?<br/><br/>The game includes :<br/>&bull; One 59 x 85 cm MOUNTED (!) map<br/>&bull; 324 double-sided, pre-cut counters and markers<br/>&bull; A scenario booklet and a rulebook <br/>&bull; Many player aids<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a chess-style army consisting of a king, a queen, and a variety of supporting knights. The object of the game is to maneuver one of your royalty around the hexagonal board then reach the center space.<br/><br/>The hex board offers a variety of movement options for each type of piece and, combined with the rule that capturing an opponent's piece awards an extra turn, creates an ever expanding web of possibility. Knights are themselves promoted to royalty after their second capture and gain increased mobility with a second move every turn.<br/>The drama increases when the royal families embark on their journeys of destiny to conquer the central territory and become MAGNA VICTORUS.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

After the time limit, each player calls out their word and their score. <br/>Mark your score on your dry erase board.<br/>A word consists of one letter from each of the marked vertical columns and/or horizontal rows.<br/><br/>FORMING WORDS:<br/>To form a word, collect one letter from each line marked with an arrow. See the examples in the images.<br/><br/>PLAY IN ROUNDS:  <br/>After each round, shuffle and swap at least six letter tiles. Remove the arrow tiles. Decide upon 3-6 arrows for this round and randomly select and place a new set of arrows. <br/>Ensure that one of the lines contains a vowel.<br/>&emsp;<br/>ENDING THE GAME:<br/>The game is over after ten rounds.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/>The winner will have the most points.

The rules book has roles for these games:<br/><br/>CROSSWORD RUMMY <br/>During your turn you play cards that add a word to a growing crossword on the table, or draw a card. The first player to play all cards from their hand gets the points on all the cards of the other players. First to 250 points wins.<br/><br/>MEMORY WORDGAME<br/>A version of Concentration. All the cards are spread out face down on the table. During your turn you reveal 4 cards, and if you can spell a 3- or 4-letter word you keep its cards and turn the rest face down. When all cards are used or no other words can be made, the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>WORD CASINO<br/>Like Logomachy or Casino. Four cards are played face up, and 4 cards dealt to each player. On your turn you take a card from your hand and either make a word with it and cards on the table, or leave it face up on the table. When all hands are played out, deal 4 more to each player. When the deck is gone and all hands emptied, the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>WORD POKER<br/>Five cards are dealt to each player, who may then exchange up to three of them at a cost of -10 points per card. The player who can make the longest, most-points word gets 10 points for each unused card of the other players. First to 250 wins.<br/><br/>WORD SOLITAIRE<br/>Like Canfield solitaire, with 28 cards in 7 piles, and then revealing the rest one at a time. From the visible cards you can make new words and add to previous words.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is based on the highly successful anime titled &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot;, which was initially broadcast in 1974. At the time of its first broadcast, the anime did not gain much popularity for various reasons, but later it became a huge hit thanks to television reruns and film screenings. This game is inspired by &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; and puts you in the shoes of Captain Okita, commanding the Yamato. Your goal is to guide the ship to Iscandar, obtain a radiation removal device, and return to Earth before humanity is exterminated.<br/><br/>The original game was created in 1983 during the summer vacation of the third year of middle school as a solitaire game. This version was reposted based on my memory. At the time I had no intention of letting anyone else play it or releasing it anywhere, and the rules varied every time I played it. I hope you can face it with a great spirit.<br/><br/>",

One player plays the role of the People's Liberation Army(PLA), and the other plays the role of the NRA.<br/><br/>This is a special battle, and when the NRA landed, there was a huge disparity in strength between the two sides. NRA had an absolute advantage of about 10-1, not only in terms of sea and air superiority, but also in the presence of the first deployed special force&mdash;the paratrooper battalion. Hu Lian(胡琏) thought he had a safe chance of winning and could quickly occupy the entire island, and then use the dangerous terrain to implement defense, in order to demonstrate the strength of NRA to the United States and lay the groundwork for future counterattacks on the mainland. As a result, PLA on the island stubbornly resisted and held onto the crucial Eight Foot Gate(八尺门) Ferry. The reinforcements rushed from the mainland and entered the battlefield half a day later. At this point, the crucial role of the commander was demonstrated, and Hu Lian decided to immediately retreat. While feinting on the front line, the rear troops retreated in an orderly manner. In just one day, the already deployed troops were gathered and boarded, completing a more difficult retreat than an attack. The successful recapture of Dongshan Island by PLA has shed its former shame.<br/><br/>The mechanism of this game was modified based on Kinmen 1949: The Battle that Saved Taiwan.<br/><br/>Scale = 800 meters /hex;<br/><br/>     time = 8 hours /GT;<br/>     size = battalion or company / unit.<br/><br/><br/>",

They then draw 5 cards and draw one each turn after every first turn has been completed.<br/><br/>One can play a single point card and action card each turn unless bypassed by another ability. There are 5 action cards within the draw pile that can be played by everyone and there are suit specific action cards such as the ace of swords, that can only be played if one chose swords as their suit at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>The character you have determines how many loot you need to win the game, 2 loot win characters have weaker abilities than 3 loot win characters. But once a loot is obtained one can choose to draw a new character and shuffle their old character back into the character pile.<br/><br/>Instead of there being one winner everyone continues to play for placement.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players are compiling a long and somewhat rude title of their light novel, and the designer gives the English title as  &quot;There's something wrong with the title of the light novel I came up with&quot;.<br/><br/>In this game, players take turns turning up word cards. They must turn up one card, and may choose to turn up more or stop. If any card they turn up has an ▲ icon, they must turn up another. Once they stop, they can collect whichever cards they like into their hand. They must take one if a ▲ icon was turned up, but otherwise can choose to not take any that turn.<br/><br/>Once a player feels they have enough cards in hand to make their book title, they can declare Complete! and stop for the round. When every player has stopped, they present their titles formed from all the cards in their hands and score points if possible.<br/><br/>The word cards show two words, top and bottom and the player can select which word to use. The cards may also show a Restricted Number (R2, R3 and so on) because those words are a bit rude in Japan. If a player's title totals R18, they are eliminated because they made it too rude for a light novel.<br/><br/>Before the round starts, three theme cards are turned up and players are trying to build a title matching the theme. This includes an R number, and bonus points for matching the theme. Players score points for the total of the R numbers in their title and can also score bonus points for using tricky words (marked with stars).<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins, being able to craft the best long titles to suit the market.<br/>description by user<br/><br/>Word-based party game about the long names of Japanese literary works called light novels.<br/><br/>Players combine different word cards, such as &quot;different world&quot; and &quot;reincarnation&quot;, to create their own light novel title that fits the game-specific objectives.<br/>Each word card has a special value called R-points.

Leaving three men to guard the first gun, Winters led five others in a charge down the trench, throwing grenades, firing rifles. They captured two wounded Germans at the first gun. The second gun's crew retreated; Easy took it with minimal casualties...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Assault on the 105s!&quot; is a tiny solitaire wargame published by Joyance Games and designed by Hans Gem. The game depicts a remarkable assault carried out by soldiers of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the U.S. 101st Airborne Division during World War II, the assault on Br&eacute;court Manor on June 6, 1944. This historic engagement is upheld by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point as a classic example of command artistry and assaulting fixed objectives, and it is also portrayed in the book &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; and its namesake TV series.<br/><br/>The game has a duration of approximately 30 minutes, with AI controlling the German forces and players assuming the role of U.S. Airborne. Players must strategically plan actions and equipment usage, aiming to minimize their own casualties while swiftly demolishing four 105mm LeFh howitzers in the German stronghold. The objective is to ensure these artillery pieces have minimal impact on the attacks on Utah Beach. After neutralizing the cannons, players must carefully evacuate their paratroopers from the battlefield to secure victory.<br/><br/>In the game, event cards influence the actions of the German soldiers and may bring positive or negative effects to the U.S. paratroopers, such as ammunition shortages, intelligence gains, or reinforcements, among others. Additionally, the MG42 machine gun position situated behind the artillery emplacement poses a significant challenge. Players face the decision of prioritizing soldier safety, gradually suppressing the German firepower, or focusing on overpowering the artillery position to expedite victory.<br/><br/>The power of choice lies in your hands!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Is this where you expected Sprawlopolis to go next?<br/><br/>In Casinopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new casino from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. Each turn, players will play 1 card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types.<br/><br/>The new concepts here are really cool. Thematically it&rsquo;s a casino setting with blocks of all of the regular types, Rome, Egypt, and Medieval. The roads have slot machine icons and getting a jackpoint (3+ of an icon in a row) will get you positive points to offset the negative points that roads normally provide. Instead of getting points for your largest group of each block type on the map, now it needs to be your largest block type on the strip, which is your longest road. And finally the card backs have a betting element where you arrange the 3 cards in the order you would like, and they pay off based on how well you performed.<br/><br/>",

Practice your skills on this course to see how far you can get!<br/><br/>ROVE Jr. is a standalone entry in the ROVE series. In this solo spatial puzzler, the player must complete missions by using their movement cards to align ROVE&rsquo;s modules in the proper pattern. Each module has a unique one-time ability that can give ROVE a much-needed boost at a key moment. As ROVE travels further, efficient use of movement points and module abilities becomes paramount to achieve success.<br/><br/>ROVE Jr. provides a more casual, kid-friendly experience than the original game without removing the core elements. Players now have only 4 modules to manage, and each movement card provides unlimited movement in any one direction. Additionally, players always refill their hand at the end of a mission. With these changes as well as variable difficulty options, ROVE Jr. is a great introduction to ROVE while still remaining appealing to existing ROVE fans of all ages who just need a break from the dangers of outer space.<br/><br/>",

A story based on real-life events, it involves a single woman who chooses not to marry immediately and is eventually scorned and ruined for her choices.

Three tiers of sheep are available with increasing ability power: Starter Sheep, Special Sheep, and Shiny Sheep. During your turn, you may do 2 of 3 possible actions, or repeat an action: Blindly draw a starter sheep, breed 2 sheep to increase its sheep tier, or shear the sheep (activating its ability). Higher sheep tiers and sheep levels have better abilities to activate.<br/><br/>There are 3 secret objective card decks: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each player starts with an Easy objective. Once a player completes their Easy objective, they move onto Medium, then Hard. The first player to complete their Hard objective wins! Objectives vary from leveling up sheep, collecting a variety of sheep colors, or even stealing sheep from other players.<br/><br/>",

In numerical order, each player places their card at the end of any row in which the character on their card comes later in the Hiragana syllabary than the character at the end of the row.<br/><br/>If you can't place your card in any row, then you must take all of the cards in a row, making your played card the first card in a new row. The cards you take are worth negative points equal to the number of red Xs on them &mdash; but if you can create a word from some or all of these cards, you discard the used cards instead of placing them in your score pile.<br/><br/>The player with the lowest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game box comes with instructions booklet and a set of 204 cards. Designed for up to 4 players. Game matches range from 20 minutes to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build your own game board, and the first player to complete their game board, wins! Players do this by taking turns drawing Dice cards and playing them along with Assist cards. Assist cards range from as simple as adding +2 to your &quot;roll&quot; to as strategic as making an opponent go back the number you &quot;rolled&quot; instead of you going forward on your turn. Once the player has &quot;rolled&quot; their dice, they draw that number of Tile cards and lay them out in front of them in a grid pattern. Tile cards are square cards that resemble the spaces of a board game.  Your goal is to build a 5x5 grid with Tiles. If you are the first to do this, you win!<br/><br/>Tiles come in three colors: Blue, Green, and Red. The last Tile you draw and place on your turn, adding it to your board, is considered the space you've &quot;landed&quot; on. Blue Tiles don't do anything, they are a neutral space to land on. Green and Red Tiles, when landed on, result in that player drawing a Good or Bad card. As the names suggest, Good cards help you while Bad cards hurt you. Think of them like the chance cards in traditional board games. If a player is made to move backwards, they'll discard the most recently placed Tiles on their board to represent them moving back, and when they go forward again on their next turn, it'll be all new Tile cards they'll draw, permanently changing their board from what it once was, creating endless replayability. Every time you play, it'll be a different board you're playing on and the board will constantly be changing while you play.<br/><br/>With over 20 unique ability cards, some powerful enough to knock the leader down to last place or position the player in the back of the pack for a quick victory, it's anyone's game until the very last second.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On Christmas Day, 1985, Mali invaded Burkina Faso over a dispute in the contested Agacher Strip. In what became known as the Agacher Strip War, two of the poorest nations on earth fought over a strip of the southern Sahara. Air operations featured prominently, but there were no air-to-air combats. By the time of the Agacher Strip War, Burkina Faso had just one MiG-17, but until a few months before the Force A&eacute;rienne de Burkina Faso (FABF) had a force of eight Libyan supplied and manned MiG-21s. Merry Christmas, Mr Sankara imagines if these had still be available during the conflict.<br/><br/>Merry Christmas, Mr Sankara has a background of the war and the forces involved, a full campaign system, maps and a painting guide. Players have to balance offensive and defensive operations, keep an eye on public and world opinion and avoid attrition that they can ill afford.<br/><br/>In a short war players will use Soviet Cold War era jets &ndash; MiG-17s and MiG-21s &ndash; for air strikes, ground attack, escort and fighter missions and Mi-4 helicopters to transport troops. In the vastness of the Sahara players will need to form a strategy to seize key road junctions. For the Burkinabe player it will be a tough proposition; the Malian forces are more numerous but the Libyan pilots are more experienced.<br/><br/>The campaign should provide between 5 and 8 tactical games. Though designed with Wings at War: Thud Ridge in mind, it can be used with your favourite jet-age rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Requiem takes place on Earth but this version of Earth is much different from the world you know today. About 100 years have passed since &quot;The Event&quot; happened and the effects of that calamity have begun to surface all over the globe. Creatures have mutated, weather patterns are different, the physical make up of the environment has fundamentally changed. Lush green forests have become lush purple forests. Mushrooms that grew a few inches tall now grow dozens of feet tall. The shell of &quot;what was&quot; is still here; buildings still stand but most are crumbling and overgrown. Large cities are more like literal concrete jungles at this point. It is essentially a new world. This radical change has caused the recovery of humanity to stifle and it seems fairly obvious that things will never quite return to the way they were. In spite of these setbacks, humanity has made some progress.<br/><br/>Accompanied by their warband, the player is out to seek their fortune in the wastelands, playing through adventures and encountering all the wild environments, creatures, and characters that await them.<br/><br/>Summary of mechanics...<br/><br/>Solo-play, skirmish level miniatures game, played in a narrative style<br/>Miniatures agnostic...use whatever figures you like<br/>D6 based, no other dice required<br/>Charts for various outcomes<br/>Simple stats and stat tests to accomplish tasks<br/>Rules are easy to learn and don't get in the way of the story<br/>Character advancement with skills and mutations<br/>Settlement mode, your in charge now<br/>Includes intro adventure &quot;Wide Open&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Figgie is a card game that was invented [by professional traders] at Jane Street in 2013. It was designed to simulate open-outcry commodities trading. Most of the skill in Figgie is in negotiating trades that benefit both the buyer and seller. Like in poker, your objective in Figgie is to make money over a series of hands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Figgie is a turn-less, timed game of simultaneous action. Players call out offers to buy or sell and accept offers from others as they choose in an attempt to collect the most valuable cards. Chips are exchanged for cards to settle the action.<br/><br/>Figgie is played with a 40-card deck of four suits in an unequal distribution of 12, 10, 10, and 8 cards. An unusual feature is that the suit for each count in the distribution is unknown to players when a round begins. (In a face-to-face setting, this is managed with one or more prepared decks.) Figuring out the distribution is key, because the 12-card suit determines the payout at the end of each round.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The player with the best line wins!  <br/>The Judge draws a Petal Card from the Game Board. The Judge reads the character on the Petal Card aloud.<br/><br/>Each player writes their best pick-up or break-up line on their Dry-Erase Board based on the character on the Petal Card. For example, if &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; is the character drawn from the Game Board and it is a whole heart, players will create a pick-up to use on the Doctor.<br/><br/>After all of the Dry-Erase Boards are in front of the Judge, the Judge shuffles them before reading each response out loud. The Judge picks their favorite line and gives the winning player the card. Once all Petal Cards have been selected, the winner of the game is the player who has the most cards!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sealed City, you are mercenaries who have come to a town to rest and resupply when the local governor asks for your help. But what starts as a competition to build reputation with the town turns into a desperate fight to survive once the town gets sealed in by a magical dome.<br/><br/>Throughout the 13 games, you will create a unique story with the other players. Who your mercenaries are, how the town develops, and what ultimately becomes of the town are all in your hands. The first several games have you exploring several locations of the town and determining your background based on your choices while gathering food, water, and reputation<br/><br/>From there, mysteries will become revealed, and you'll find that what seemed like a relatively safe little hamlet is rapidly turning into anything but, putting your combat skills to the test. And you can work as cooperatively or competitively as you desire&mdash;will you work to protect the town no matter the cost, or will you make sure you stand supreme over the other mercenaries?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Gameplay continues, with any subsequent silver acquisition coming from the remaining silver in the box. The game ends when the player to the right of the starting player finishes their turn.

Think like the Internet and you will be rewarded!<br/><br/>Mes Amis Sont... is inspired by the Internet, because on the web, when you enter the start of a search, you often receive surprising ending suggestions! It's up to you to guess as many suggestions as possible from our authors to help your team win!<br/><br/>In Mes Amis Sont... there is a referee and two teams: the reds and the blues. The referee takes the hourglass, the six tokens and draws a card. It starts the trick by reading the start of a search, e.g. : &ldquo;How to pretend to&hellip;&rdquo; and presto, he turns the hourglass over!<br/><br/>The players then have 40 seconds to give as many suggestions as possible for the end of a sentence orally, in no imposed order. As soon as the referee hears a valid proposition - close to a suggestion on the card - he places a token in front of the player concerned. Ex: if a player says &quot;work&quot;, he can validate because this evokes the suggestion &quot;work&quot;.<br/><br/>Each token won moves the team's pawn forward as many spaces on the edge of the box. Bonus: a token won thanks to a suggestion marked with a smiley by the authors of the game, double count! The first team to reach the Victory box wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Players must craft items using resources they gather from expeditions to complete local jobs to gain respect from the village. The player to first reach 5 respect wins and is crowned the most respected blacksmith of the village.<br/><br/>The game sees players carrying out certain actions each turn around the table until each player has exhausted all of their available &quot;time&quot; tokens, the primary resource of the game. When all time tokens are spent, the game moves to the next round, or &quot;days&quot; as they are called in-game. Each day has a specific event that happens, either the job bulletin gets refreshed so players can get new jobs, or the traveling merchant opens up so that players can trade their crafted items from their forge for money. On the seventh day players may earn up to 1 respect if they win the smithing tourney, which is dictated by some dice rolls.<br/><br/>Players alternate between gathering resources by going on &quot;expeditions&quot; underground, managing their resources either by selling them at certain events or using them to craft items at their forge, combating monster underground or bandits on the surface, or building buildings that offer communal benefits to all players, but give respect to the one who built it. Players keep deciding on what actions to carry out to try and be the first to get 5 respect.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "AUKUS &amp; CHINA is 2-5 player, easy to learn hard to master, asymmetric modern-day strategy wargame. Area control meets hidden resource allocation and open-choice deck building. A&amp;C explores the fictional scenario of an escalating conflict between the USA and China and their allies.<br/><br/>You and your friends are the leaders of one of 5 teams on 2 sides. Red side teams: China and Russia. Blue side teams: USA, UK-AUS-FRA, JPN-KOR. <br/>Your goal in the game is to drive down the enemy side&rsquo;s morale points. Morale points represent the public&rsquo;s political willingness and economic ability to continue to support the government&rsquo;s war efforts. Allies will win or lose together. You can drive down the other side&rsquo;s morale points by controlling sea and land areas, and winning battles.<br/><br/>Mechanics that Make AUKUS &amp; CHINA Unique:<br/><br/>     Asymmetric Gameplay: Asymmetry plays a central role across all aspects of the game, manifesting on both side-specific and team-specific levels. This asymmetry ranges from resource availability and unit deployment to strategic options and unit-specific abilities. We refer to this as 'layered asymmetry,' which simplifies the learning curve for new players, as they don't need to immediately grasp multiple unique playstyles. Instead, they can gradually understand and adapt to the nuances of each level, making it easier to think strategically and empathize with different player perspectives. Simultaneously, it offers seasoned players a thrilling challenge to put themselves in their opponents' shoes, deepening the strategic complexity and excitement of the game.<br/>     Unit special abilities: Unit special abilities are the most prominent aspect of the game's asymmetry. These abilities allow players to strategically outmaneuver and even overpower larger forces with smaller ones by using the right combination of units and their unique powers. This depth of strategic options, stemming from the diverse abilities of each unit, provides unmatched variety and replayability. <br/>     Permadeath: Units are in limited supply. Units destroyed in combat are permanently removed and placed in the destroyed section of a team's tray, with some exceptions.<br/>     Catch up: We call it 'Rallying Call'&mdash;a game mechanism that allows players to use their setbacks as a catalyst to redouble their efforts in combat. It supports the trailing side by effectively preventing any player from gaining an insurmountable lead, thereby maintaining a competitive and challenging gameplay environment.<br/>     Hidden resource allocation at both macro and micro levels: You secretly manage your resources across three main powers: Mobilization power for deploying new units, Operational power for moving units, and Intel power for using unit special abilities, tactics, and cyber warfare. Plus, you use special abilities in combat covertly.<br/>     Escalation dynamics: The game unfolds over five escalation phases, introducing new units, combat zones, and events, making it progressively engaging. This structure is ideal for beginners to learn at their own pace and for seasoned players to strategically build their approach, while also ensuring that early mistakes don't immediately jeopardize the game, allowing for a more forgiving and fun experience.<br/><br/><br/>The story of AUKUS &amp; CHINA:<br/>It's the second decade of the third millennium. The Indo-Pacific has become the core of the global economy, fueling the unprecedented growth of China, positioning it as a rival to the United States. In response, the USA and its allies have announced the AUKUS security pact to contain the expansion of China, which aims to displace the US as the world&rsquo;s pre-eminent power. Finding itself increasingly isolated, China has strengthened its alliance with Russia, united by their belief that the current international arrangements give the US too much power and their determination to change that and to create a new world order, where new institutions, ideas and power structures will better accommodate their interests. The board is set, the pieces are moving. It's your turn to shape the outcome of the great conflict of our time.<br/><br/>We have put considerable effort into ensuring geographical and military accuracy, in proportion to the game's level of abstraction.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If the player stops to pay with the cat, they get a better chance of escaping.<br/><br/>The game has an advanced set of rules using 10 tool cards, which are various cat toys to distract the ghost cat. And the game has a basic set of rules for an easier, faster game too.<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>This is a press your luck racing roll &amp; move game in which you advance by throwing chips. You have to get out of a cursed house where a ghost cat is playing with you!<br/><br/>When it is your turn, choose whether you want to 'run' or 'play'. If you want to run, you throw three sound chips. The sound chips have footprints written on their surface, and you can advance your piece up to the number of footprints you have made. If you advance successfully, you can continue throwing chips.<br/><br/>However, if two or more cats on the back of the chip appear, you are out. The ghost cat will find you. If the ghost cat finds you, you will be taken back to the cat tower in the middle of the house, and you will be far from the goal.<br/><br/>If you choose to play with the cat, you end your turn by turning over your piece. The person whose piece is turned over plays with the cat and is liked, and can change the front or back of one of the chips they throw once. You have a simple but important choice to make: run through the game or play to the cat's good mood.<br/><br/>チップを振って進むチキンレースすごろくゲームです。<br/><br/>手番が来たら「走る」か「遊ぶ」かを選択します。走るなら物音チップを3枚振ります。<br/>物音チップには表面に足跡が書かれており、出た足跡の数までコマを進められます。<br/>無事進めたら、続けてチップを振り続けることができます。<br/><br/>ただし、チップの裏面に描かれたネコが２枚以上出たらアウト。幽霊ネコに見つかってしまいます。見つかったらコースの途中のネコタワーまで連れて戻ることになり、ゴールから遠のいてしまいます。<br/><br/>遊ぶを選択した場合は、自分のコマを裏返してターンを終えます。コマが裏になっている人はネコと遊んで気に入られているので、1回だけ自分が振ったチップ1枚の表裏を変えることができます。駆け抜けるか、猫の機嫌を取るか、シンプルながら選択を迫られます、<br/>--description by publisher<br/><br/>",

Each time the Storm moves to a new site, all adjoining white paths (not ports) gain a Hazard Marker.<br/><br/>Mode #2: Deadly Contracts - Reavers have attacked our beloved Stormholds. Fortunately our allies managed to get word out before it was too late. Fulfilling these Contracts can only be achieved using Weaponry.<br/><br/>Mode #3: Atlantean Elixir - The days are long, and the nights, longer. Carrying a flask of Atlantean Elixir can come in handy when you need a little extra pick-me-up. Give each player 1 Atlantean Elixir during Setup. Players can turn over their Atlantean Elixir Token and lose 1 Health to take any 1 Resource from their site.<br/><br/>New Vehicles - x1 Trike, x1 Plane, x1 Sub; all with unique abilities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher;;<br/><br/>",

These events include a significant ritual, crafting a cucumber horse and eggplant cow, known as shōryō uma (精霊馬, &quot;spirit horse&quot;) or ushi uma (牛馬, &quot;cow horse&quot;), that act as a vessel for the ancestors to come back home and return, respectively.<br/><br/>In this game, players create these spirit animals in order to race them. By combining the Head, Body, and Tail cards from their hand (2 of each type), turning them up one by one and following the strategy written on the card, players advance their horse or cow along a linear course to aim for first place.<br/><br/>Cards have activation conditions, but there are some that advance you two squares at once, and others that move the animal in front of you back one square, creating a dead heat feeling in a horse race. The downside is that the order in which you reveal your cards during the race is fixed, so the first player tends to have an advantage. This tendency was especially noticeable when the number of players was small, because some of the actions require interference with the animal in front, and this could not be achieved with too few players.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The game is packaged in a large styrofoam box of the kind used for seafood, and the theme is based on the annual migration of Christmas Island red crabs.<br/><br/>Players are crabs, smart ones that try to help the other crabs survive the migration and spawn successfully. The game features lavish components, including lots of crabs and special bridges to help the crabs get over a busy road, and spawning grounds in the sea to save the crabs from being eaten by sharks.<br/><br/>The crabs spawn in large numbers on one board (the land), and relentlessly march across the land by the most direct path. This relates to player number, so with four players, four crabs appear and move four places each turn. The players must collect logs of one colour, to be able to steer them across the bridges and to the other board (the beach). There, they must be guided into spawning pens, which the players build. But the pens might be damaged by storms.<br/><br/>To win the game, three pens must be built and collect three red crabs each. But if five red crabs are killed, on the road or in the sea, the players lose.<br/><br/>The game has had updated rules and suggestions from the publisher after it was released.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

After this, 5 cards are dealt to each player - these are their Witnesses. Each Witness has a &quot;Bias&quot; that either helps or hurts either player's case. Then, as each player plays their cards onto the table, the cards played &quot;sway&quot; jurors one way or another, convincing them to support either the defense or the prosecution.

There is a particular way to hand the card over, and a way to take it and handle it that shows respect to the other person.<br/><br/>In this game, players take turns handing business cards out and taking them. But the social rules change for each card, based on the colour of the card and the type of business. Players must try to follow the complex rules and not get caught out.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players' net scores are totalled up and the player with the most positive total is the winner, being the most socially adept and well-mannered.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The number of banner icons determine the conquering strength towards that particular castle and must be equal or greater than that of the card directly underneath.<br/>     Play a rainbow wizard: Rainbow wizards are played just like banner cards, but serve as a wild card and don't have to follow the same placement rules.<br/>     Move a rainbow wizard: Move one rainbow wizard card onto another castle's banner pile. Then draw one card from the deck a place it on top of a castle space (with matching colour).<br/>     Play a card on a castle: Place one card from the hand on top of the castle with matching colour.<br/>     Play a rainbow card as a rainbow bridge: Place a rainbow card on any banner pile regardless of the banner icons. Then place a banner card (following the usual rules) on top of the rainbow card.<br/>     Steal a rainbow card: A player can take a rainbow card previously played by their opponent if they can exchange it with a suitable banner card from their hand.<br/><br/><br/>After playing one action, players draw cards to a hand of 5 cards. These can be drawn either from the deck, or the face-up piles on the five castle spaces (not banner piles).<br/><br/>The game ends when the draw deck runs out of cards. Then players compare their strength (number of banner icons) under each castle; the player with the higher value conquers that castle. The player who controls the most castles wins the whole game.<br/><br/>",

Play continues this way until all but one are eliminated.<br/>--description by user<br/><br/>The publisher says:<br/>In a world where magic rather than science was developed, the civil war in this country was also extremely intense due to the power of magic.

Let's win this battle with your smart strategy!<br/><br/>You start with a total of 8 cards, 2 each of attack, magic, defence, and life crystal cards.

While trying to acquire cats players must balance multiple jobs, renovate their home, and deal with general cat maintenance. lord-chub.png The entire game is represented by a deck of only 18 double-sided poker-sized cards. Players draw cards using a set amount of points each turn, based on their current job. By acquiring and playing these cards you can put them in to play to apply for more jobs, gaining more points per turn - renovate your home to house more cats - and, of course, acquire more cats! But beware - based on that same hand of cards, at the end of every turn you draw a game-changing event card that adds cat complications to your life. Can you manipulate your hand to prepare for such events, while not losing the cards you need to win? Clever hand management and forward-thinking strategy are required to win!<br/><br/>The game uses double-sided card system that serves multiple purposes. On one side of every card are various events, but once these events occur the card is flipped, revealing a new cat, renovation, or job card, and is made available for the player to gain into their hand either instantly or for a price, depending on the scenario of the event. The order of the events change up the game, allowing it to feel like a new challenge each play-through!<br/><br/>Plays in 5-10 minutes.

Each Volume comes with 100 Cards | 4 Card Sets | 50 Card Pairs.<br/><br/>GeoQuest encourages you to engage, discover, and match nations, fostering a fun and educational experience.<br/><br/>Surprise! Experience it through TWO UNIQUE GAME PLAY LAYOUT.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>We wanted to innovate the classic memory game by adding interactive features that will make it more engaging and enjoyable with rich information. That's why we came up with the idea of O-BYE Quest Games, an interactive quest game that allows players to ask questions before matching the right card.<br/><br/>GeoQuest is among our dozens of games in the O-BYE Quest Games lineup.<br/>All game cards follow color, shape, or number themes. In GeoQuest, each card is color-themed based on its respective country flag.<br/><br/>Unlike the traditional memory game where cards are facing down, our interactive quest game presents the cards facing up.<br/>This way, players can already start familiarizing themselves with the information or images on the cards, and have a better chance of retaining them in their memory.<br/><br/>What's in the Game?<br/><br/>In each round of the game, you will need 50 cards to get started, with 25 cards for each player.<br/><br/>The best part? You determine game duration by opponent's cards for victory.<br/><br/>Each Card includes the following info: Country, Capital, Continent, Demonym, Language, Dialing Code, Flag, Map, Landmass, and Alpha 2/3 codes.<br/><br/>The game Layouts:<br/>GeoQuest offers a versatile gaming experience with two distinct play layouts.<br/><br/>Layout 1: This is designed for compact spaces, eliminating the need for a playmat. This layout requires only the GAME CARD SETS to initiate your gaming experience.<br/><br/>Layout 2: This layout necessitates the use of the giant playmat for an immersive game play session. This layout enables you to seamlessly engage in all three playing modes using a single play mat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take turns rolling dice and committing them to Investigation cards. This represents the detectives spending time and resources to explore locations, question suspects, and examine evidence. When the dice requirement for an Investigation card has been met, the player claims that card, earns the associated points, and a bonus (based on the card type).<br/><br/>Players can also spend dice to go on a Stakeout or Wiretap.<br/><br/>Stakeout: Sometimes gathering a little intel can make all the difference. To go on a Stakeout, players discard dice to move their marker up (from 1 to 6) on the Stakeout track. On a subsequent turn, the marker can be removed to add a die of that value or lower to their dice pool.<br/><br/>To Wiretap, players spend 2 dice to draw 3 Investigation cards from the deck and choose 1 to keep as a Personal Lead. No other player may investigate this card.<br/><br/>Hot Tip cards provide opportunities for dice manipulation.<br/><br/>Motive cards provide end-game bonuses.<br/><br/>Vintage photographic art enhances the noir theme.<br/><br/>The game end is triggered when a player reaches 25 points. All players have one final turn and then points, including those from Motive cards, are totaled. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It can be played with a regular chess set, but unlike orthodox chess, there is no piece-movement nor capturing, and the goal is to occupy more territory than the opponent. No advanced chess skills are required to play, you only need to know the types of chess pieces.<br/><br/>RULES IN BRIEF<br/><br/>The game begins by placing each player's king on the board edge. Thereafter, each player on his turn places one of his/her pieces on the board.<br/><br/>If the piece to be placed is a high piece (non-pawn), it can be placed at any point from where it can reach any of his/her pieces on the board according to chess rules.<br/><br/>If the piece to be placed is a pawn, it can be placed at any  point to where your high piece on the board can be moved according to the chess rules.<br/><br/>Once all the pieces have been placed, the score is calculated. Your score is the sum of the square on which your piece is placed and the empty square of your color adjacent to your piece. However, the score is doubled for territories containing your king and territories containing your queen.<br/><br/>",

This Tech Deck game exemplifies Parrondo&rsquo;s Paradox. The players juggles cards from losing decks to find a winning combination, to discover a paradox. Paradoxical is the embodiment of a game theory mystery called Parrondo&rsquo;s Paradox. In Paradoxical, players race to discover two Parrondo Paradoxes.

        "description": "An economic game of investment in railway companies that operated in the Northwest of Spain throughout the 19th century, based on the &ldquo;18xx&rdquo; series and more specifically in 1817.<br/><br/>Although 1855 inherits practically all the financial mechanics of 1817 (short sales, conversions, mergers, -hostile and friendly- acquisitions  and liquidations), it presents very innovative variations that break some common patterns in the 18xx.  They stand out above others: <br/>   <br/><br/>     The deconstruction of the OR where trains are purchased before running, and in addition, all companies run their trains simultaneously!!!.<br/><br/><br/>   <br/><br/>     In the 18xx, the profit per route is independent of the size of the company, so that the profit per share reduces as the number of shares per company increases.  In this game, route profits grow with the size of the company, and earnings per share remain the same.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>     Fixed interest Loan System based on real life mortages. Five banks offer loans at interest rates 6%, 13%, 20%, 40% and 50% and you have to return them in 6 fixed installments, but the sooner you (partially) return it, the less final interest you end up paying. (Maybe the only game implementing this realistic mechanic).<br/><br/><br/>  <br/>Other great changes in common 18xx are:<br/><br/>     Players start with no money (they ask for loans and pay interest as companies)<br/>     No private companies. Every company has different initial bonuses associated with its historic location.<br/>     Pass-based player turn order for SR (instead of Priority Deal)<br/>     Non-predictable Round scheme: SR + OR + [ CR + OR ] + MR. The second [CR +OR] is not played if a phase change within the first OR; else, a train is exported.<br/>     Incremental cost of construction, and cost in border hex (1882-like)<br/>     Parallelized and simplified auctions, for presidents in foundations and buying companies. Bid based on market. Only 1 round per OR for buy/sell all converted/merged companies together.<br/>     Tiles: no asymmetric. Upgradable towns with crosses. Plain tiles without crosses.<br/>     (experimental) 2 player mode and play by teams.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Influenced by magical ravens sent by Odin to steer your course, and by the winds of Fate, you will face powerful and monstrous creatures out of the Norse mythos to fulfill your quests and prepare you for the final challenge to defeat the greatest enemy of the Gods and prevent Ragnarok!<br/><br/>Viking Route uses a brilliant compass-and-magnets movement mechanism first introduced by co-designer Martino Chiacchiera in his game The Faceless. The main game piece &mdash; the Drakkar &mdash; is represented by a compass, and multiple magnets (representing ravens and wind) are manipulated by players to steer the course of their ship.<br/><br/>This mechanism is only one of the elements under control of the players, who also have to manage the resources of the Drakkar and their hand of cards to face opponents and achieve the goals of their quests. Multiple quests, using different board layouts, are included in the game; quests can be played either independently, or as a continuing campaign, ending in a final climactic confrontation to avoid Ragnarok.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Along the way, the X-Bomber's path is obstructed by a sea of methane, a meteor shower, the Germa army, and a black hole.

Every Captain's job is to help their team guess the slogan from the card and make sure they beat the other team at doing so. Captains draw a card with a category and 3 slogans. Then, each gives a clue - either by saying a sentence, singing, gestures, or pantomime. The opposing team always guesses first, and the team of the active Captain goes second. After guessing the password by any team member, its Captain receives 1 Victory Point. The team with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Their speciality was laying the fieldstones to form a stonewall for a castle. &ldquo;Listen to the voice of the stone, and follow them&rdquo;. Only a few who could master the art of masonry were considered to be a part of it.<br/><br/>Anou is a trick taking game. Players become a member of Anou, laying stones in front of themselves to form a stonewall. You don&rsquo;t want your wall to be too high nor too low, go precisely as you planned or else you will get a penalty. Whoever scores the most by the end of the game becomes a master builder of Anou.<br/><br/>",

Inside the old and cozy mansion, the ghosts were all content, but they had different ideas about the arrangement of five statues scattered throughout the grand hall. To place the statues to their liking, the ghosts began moving them around at random. Can they find a placement that satisfies everyone before daybreak?<br/><br/>Quiet House is a co-operative game in which players take turns moving statues to create arrangements that meet the goals. At the start of the game, goal tiles are assigned, indicating how the statues should be placed for a victory. However, players have only partial information about these goals and cannot communicate with each other regarding them. Success in the game relies on careful observation of others' moves, making guesses about the goals they know, and collaborating effectively to achieve the correct arrangement promptly.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Pat Gonu is often referred to as &ldquo;Hobak Gonu&rdquo; which means &ldquo;Pumpkin Game.&rdquo; This is probably due to the round shape in the center of the board.<br/>The origins of the game are unknown, but there are artifacts that go back to the tenth century in North Korea, and further references from the 14th century in the southern part of the peninsula. The name &ldquo;Pumpkin Gonu&rdquo; is a more recent name for the game - only about 500 years old.<br/><br/>The Components and Setup &mdash;<br/>In addition to the board, each player gets three pegs of a unique color. Our version includes black and yellow pegs. These three pegs begin the game on the straight lines nearest the player.<br/><br/>The Objective: <br/>By moving your pegs around the pattern of holes on the board, you attempt to trap your opponent so they cannot move.<br/>Choose a first player any way you like. <br/>Each peg moves one space per turn following the lines.<br/>Once a piece has left the starting row - the straight line of three spaces - the peg cannot return to that row.<br/>NOTE 1: Some rules do not include this rule. Players should agree on this before the game starts.<br/>NOTE 2: Some also prohibit entering your opponent&rsquo;s starting row, which is generally pointless anyway except to prolong the game.<br/>The last player to move a peg is the winner!<br/><br/>",

One day, you boss announces a contest for you and your coworkers: &quot;Whoever rents out the most umbrellas, with me as the judge,&quot; she adds, &quot;wins some big bonuses!&quot; You're the best umbrella rental agent on this entire coast, and it's going to be a big payday for sure!<br/><br/>Shady Business is a 1-4 player game where players bid to cordon-off sections of the beach, and while they do they can also sneak an umbrella of their color into that section too!<br/><br/>Tiles show cordoned-off ropes to mark different sections of beach. When a section is completely closed, the boss will judge the section and give bonuses (points) to the player, or players, that have the most umbrellas in that section.<br/><br/>However she also gives a bonus to the player who closes the section, based on the number of unique beachgoers in there; the more unique, the more money earned!<br/><br/>The tiles that you place also are used for bidding. Each has a number going from 1-15. The highest number bidder goes first, placing their tiles and adding an umbrella. The beach begins to fill with umbrellas, and you must follow the rule: You cannot place an umbrella in a section already with at least one umbrella... but if you can set it to the side, and then sneakily connect it to an already existing section... NO, that would be SHADY!<br/><br/>Or wait... do you know what would be even shadier?! If you bid the highest, you instead can move one of your umbrellas into a section, even if there are umbrellas there. OR HOW ABOUT... if you bid the lowest, you can decide to put up to two umbrellas on your tile.<br/><br/>Score as many bonuses before the day is out, then you'll have enough money to buy at least one textbox for classes this fall!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It works for 2 - 4 players, but combining two sets of cards can extend that from 5 - 8 players. First, the players will make a &quot;discard&quot; pile by removing the lowest value card from each type and putting them aside. Then they will shuffle all the rest of the cards and put them on the other side of the table, creating a &quot;dig pile&quot;. The distance between the dig pile and the discard pile is the &quot;dig site&quot;.<br/><br/>Then each player will start their turn by flipping a card from the dig pile onto the dig site. Each card has a special power that can help the player, or make it harder for them. The player then keeps on flipping cards and exacting their powers for as long as they can, or want. If a similar card is flipped up (for example if a coin card has been flipped earlier onto the dig site and then another coin card is flipped), their turn is over and they have to put everything in the dig site onto the discard pile. If they stop before getting a similar card, they will gather the cards in the dig site and put them in front of themselves, creating their &quot;treasure pile&quot;.<br/><br/>The game ends when the dig pile is emptied. Then each player will calculate their scores by counting the highest number of each card that they own, and the player with the highest point wins. After a few plays, when players are a bit more advanced, they can use &quot;special cards&quot;. They will shuffle the cards and give each player a card. Each card has a power that corresponds with an item, and they can use those powers in combination of those items.<br/><br/>",

Limited in what each individual has access to alone, these industry leaders forge strategies and pacts, each hoping to be the first to collect enough Neptunium.<br/><br/>In Subterfuge, players control Industry superpowers competing for Neptunium (Np) by drilling new mines across the ocean floor, and by stealing existing mines of other players by force. Balance control of generators, providing you with electrical output, and factories, which produce your units used for combat. Excellent strategy will set you ahead of the pack, but diplomacy is where the game is truly won. Form alliances with other players, negotiate trades, and when the time is right, break all ties to shoot ahead for a victory!<br/><br/>Subterfuge is based off of the hit mobile game of the same name (which already plays like a tabletop game).

Each team has a set of cards (0,0,1,1,2,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) and chooses 11 blocks.  There is also a wooden &quot;robot&quot; for each team.<br/><br/>Rounds alternate between teams.  On their &quot;turn&quot;, a team lays down 1 or 2 cards facedown and chooses a number of bricks for the build. Each team then builds a structure with the stated number of bricks.  The box is placed on the board blocking view of the building.  The robot may be added in addition to the bricks.  The team with the tallest structure before the earthquake gets a point.  The card(s) are revealed, determining the strength of the earthquake.  The rubber band mechanism is wound and released.  The team with the tallest structure after the earthquake gets 3 points.  If there is no clear difference in height, neither team scores.  The other team then becomes the active team and you repeat.<br/><br/>Game continues until both sides run out of cards. It is possible for one team to be out of cards, thus leaving the other team to continue taking turns without alternating.<br/><br/>The game was apparently originally presented to a local geology group for demonstration purposes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Architecture, once again.<br/><br/>The king thought he could retire after his previous work. However, his abdication was postponed due to signs of rebellion. The decision was made to lead his army to subdue the rebels.<br/><br/>The reluctant king is always thinking about architecture, even when he is nodding off in his saddle from exhaustion.<br/><br/>&quot;I'm concerned about the capital's cathedral...I wonder if it will be completed before I die...<br/><br/>Yes. Let's build a small house near the rebel's fortress and take command from there. This battle will probably take a month or two. That doesn't seem so long...&quot;<br/><br/>There are 32 cards, same as in the base set. Shuffle them together. The deck has doubled so now up to five people can play without any problems.<br/><br/>The 'Legion' icon has been added as a new element. It's a symbol that usually doesn't matter but, depending on the effect of the building, it can give you huge points - or it can just be a decorative icon. It brings various advantages (and, sometimes, disadvantages).<br/><br/>By combining over 60 cards (including the base set), you can enjoy more diverse developments!<br/><br/>It's a drafting game that can be finished in 15 minutes! A game will make you feel like you've played it in your spare time.<br/><br/>After drafting, you only need to build once! You can play as many games as you want by changing buildings.<br/><br/>",

At the start of each mission, players identify together the targets to be reached and divide up the boards among them.<br/>The first player launches the spinning top with the help of the thruster, and moves it by tilting his or her tray towards the target. Once the target has been reached, the player guides the spinning top towards the exit and onto the board held by the next player. The relay between players continues until the mission is completed.

Perfect for playing on the go.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 5 dice. After rolling all their dice, each player keeps their results hidden and, in succession, makes a &ldquo;bid&rdquo; about how many of a particular result they think all players have in total OR challenge the previous bid. Each bid must be &ldquo;bigger&rdquo; than the last (a higher result or a higher number of the result in the previous bid.<br/><br/>All dice are revealed when a challenge is made. If the total results meet or exceed the challenged bid, the bidder wins! If not, the challenger wins!<br/><br/>Losing bids result in lost dice, so you can only lose 5 times before you&rsquo;re out of the game.<br/><br/>",

This is followed by an action phase, where some of the army tokens can remove key tokens from other players. The player with majority in each realm earns treasure. Treasure and army tokens taken from other players counts as points in the end of the game. The game is played over three rounds, and the God with most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Everything needed to play all three games is included in this book minus the dice and a marker. Players will need at least one D10 and one D6 dice. A total of 34 missions/scenarios including 4 Bonus Missions, 12 hex-maps (x4 Each Module with extras), all unit counters, markers, mission sheets, charts, and player aids are included. Players mark units represented by letters and numbers from a Mission Sheet directly onto the map, and track movement using symbolic marks.

The game includes 336 food cards and 50 meal cards, providing a wide range of combinations for players to use in their culinary creations.<br/><br/>To play, participants draw food cards with three associated foods in different colors. The judge, chosen from the players, selects a meal card and designates a color (yellow, red, or blue). Players then choose three cards from their hand that match the designated color to pitch their dish to the judge. Each player takes turns presenting their creations, and the judge awards the meal card to the player with the most convincing or entertaining pitch. The first player to accumulate a set number of meal cards wins the game, with the required number depending on the total number of players.<br/><br/>Overall, Pitch Your Dish is a light-hearted and competitive game that combines strategy, creativity, and humor as players strive to concoct the most appealing or absurd meals in the quest for victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is designed for players aged 8 and above and has a duration of 30-45 minutes. The theme revolves around raccoons invading your yard, and players must employ strategy and determination to keep these trash-loving critters away.<br/><br/>The game includes 144 cards, featuring basic bandits numbered 0 through 10 and special bandits with unique abilities. Players aim to build sets of raccoons in their yards while using special cards like Steal, Trash, Swap, and more to hinder opponents or enhance their own positions. The goal is to accumulate the fewest raccoons by the end of the game, with each round totaling the raccoon count in players' yards. The player with the least number of raccoons, or in case of a tie, the one with the lowest count in a single round, emerges as the winner. The game combines elements of strategy, card management, and a touch of humor in dealing with the raccoon invasion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.<br/><br/>On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.<br/><br/>Silver: Big Box Collector's Edition collects all six standalone Silver games in one box, along with playmats and &quot;collector's edition&quot; cards with new artwork.

The inner city suburbs of Darlinghurst and Surrey Hills are a battleground between warring gangs led by former prostitute Tilly Devine and sly grog queen Kate Leigh. And in the middle of it all is you, a detective for the New South Wales Police, just trying to solve the crimes and bring the perpetrators to justice.<br/><br/>Razorhurst: Blood Alley is a story-driven detective game similar to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective. You will interview suspects, follow leads, and use your abilities for observation, persuasion and force. Razorhurst uses a unique clock mechanic for affecting the player's abilities. But the main difference with other detective games is that here everything is real. You will be investigating actual crimes, tracking down historical evidence, and bringing real killers to justice. Based on exhaustive research, Razorhurst allows the player to step back in time to one of the most heady and deadly places in history.<br/><br/>The Blood Alley case takes place in May 1929, when a street brawl in a darkened alley led to unexpected and bloody consequences for one of Sydney's criminal kingpins. Can you solve the case and bring justice to the murky world of Razorhurst?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since the apes have taken over, the atmosphere in the southern coastal town has been harsh. Gangs armed with bananas roam the dark alleys in search of attractive trading points. At the same time, new primates flock to the city, laying claim to the most promising territories. Unsurprisingly, conflicts are a daily business in Ape Town and the local bosses regularly assert their  power &ndash; that is until other alpha animals enter the arena to  impose themselves. Only the loopy lemurs can help, acting as mediators to ensure peace and order, but also vying for influence in neighbouring territories with their cunning approach.<br/>Keep a close eye on the evolution of the city, because only those involved with profitable territories stand a chance of becoming the most influential silverback.<br/><br/>",

This game represents those close-knit and fiercely competitive family alliances, their political intrigues, and economic enterprises, as Venice grew into a wealthy and influential Renaissance power.<br/><br/>Upon setup, each player takes charge of one family of the Great Council of Venice and collects starting wealth and influence. Each turn then proceeds through three phases: Crisis, Actions and Resolution. The Crisis phase simulates generational challenges that impact the state of the city and its domains, including fire, plague, war, and conspiracy. The Actions phase is the heart of the game: players in turn expand their family network through marriage alliances and grow their power in the city&rsquo;s districts and domains through placement of influence in political, religious, military, and economic spheres. The last phase entails crisis resolution, scoring of victory points, collection of player and state income, aging of families, and the election of a new Doge to lead the Republic. After six turns, a final scoring accounts for which player has attained the most prestige and legacy in the history of La Serenissima.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vive l'Empereur Series -Vol. XI <br/>La Bataille de Wagram<br/>July 5-6, 1809 - includes Aspern/Essling<br/><br/>The battle of Wagram, July 5 and 6, 1809, is the second biggest battle of the Napoleonic era after Leipzig. It is the nadir of the Danube Campaign, starting in Bavaria in April and ending in July across the Danube. Around 180.000 French troops face 135.000 Austrians lead by the skilled Archduke Charles. After a bloody stalemate a month and a half before at Aspern-Essling (also included in the box as an experimental scenario), Wagram is a huge battle, a clear but not decisive French victory. Another battle, at Znaim a few days later, will be needed to finally push the Austrians to sue for peace.<br/> The game includes 17 scenarios, spread over historical small pieces of the huge battle, a few scenarios from the opening moves the night and day before, and several what-ifs scenarios. The game includes Austrians troops from Archduke Johann and Prince of Reuss that could have been there that day and would push the final Austrian army to 165.000 men.<br/> Other scenarios cover well known episodes like MacDonald&rsquo;s attack, Davout's maneuver, the Austrian move to cut the French army by taking the bridge on the Danube, and Mass&eacute;na&rsquo;s stout defense, among others.<br/> History shows the advantage of an interior lines deployment, keeping a lot of reserves, and gambling on losing the left flank to prioritize the right wing and punch a hole in the center of the enemy army. The archduke, too extended and without a real reserve, will fight there his last campaign. Things could have turned differently!<br/><br/>Vive l'Empereur Series is a simulation of the battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. The scale is the regiment, a good compromise between the brigade level (with no formations) and the detailed battalions. The scale is 250 m/hex and a turn is 30 minutes.<br/><br/>",

In Hire Me!, you'll have to convince the other players of your suitability for a variety of quirky jobs. However, there's a catch - the other players don't know the exact job title!<br/><br/>To start the interview process, one player assumes the role of interviewee and must secretly generate a job title using a random selection of attributes. The other players must then use question cards in an attempt to figure out the interviewee's role!<br/><br/>Interviewers will score points if they manage to guess the job's attributes correctly. The interviewee will not score points if one of the job's attributes is unanimously guessed, and so it is important for the interviewee to hint enough that players will be able to figure out your full role, but not be so obvious that they will all get it completely correct.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The players take turns rolling the dice and then discuss which duck to move on the board.<br/>It is important that the mother duck should always be in front; one field cannot contain more than one duck; after each roll, you can move only one duck, by moving it to the nearest square to the one you rolled.<br/><br/>The last few fields of the board are no longer the usual ones. The mother must be the first to arrive at the first puddle visible on the lake, and she can be placed there with any throw other than the sunbather. Since the pond can be rotated and the ducklings must also arrive here, pushing the mama doll forward will reveal another small puddle where you can place the next duck.<br/><br/>In the event that a sun is thrown, the sun marker must be placed one space to the right on the vertically positioned rainbow board.<br/>If we were lucky with our throws and stepped the ducks skillfully, all four of them could be swimming in the lake before the sunshine reached the end of the rainbow.<br/><br/>Cute cooperative game for little ones, which can be used to develop social skills and speaking skills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A riveting card game for 2-6 players that combines the classic thrill of War with the strategic depth of Rock-Paper-Scissors, and introduces Blitz Cards - powerful abilities that turn the tides of battle, changing winning conditions, or giving players an edge over their opponents through attacks and counters.<br/><br/>In Oathen: Blitz, you'll take part in an epic battle between three powerful factions: the Norn, followers of the old Gods and the old ways; the Nivet, defenders of the many realms; and the Akhul, the orken clans of the Jotnar. These three armies are locked in a brutal war for Midgard.<br/><br/>Every round players flip over the top card of their War Deck, a randomly dealt collection of cards that feature one of the three factions and a unique strength value. Victory is determined by which factions are present in the battle (Norn beats Nivet, Nivet beats Akhul, and Akhul beats Norn.) If all three factions are present in the battle, the winners are determined by which faction has the highest combined strength of their combatants.<br/><br/>However, war is never so simple..<br/><br/>At any time during the game, players can choose to play one of their Blitz Cards &ndash; an arsenal of instant play abilities that change the conditions of battle; such as switching the faction of your war card to be among the victors, annihilating an opponent's card to remove them from battle, or directly attacking and destroying cards from another player's War Deck - these Blitz Cards add a layer of unpredictability and strategic play through player chosen actions.<br/><br/>As the war wages on, cards are permanently removed from the game, escalating the intensity. Players must battle with dwindling forces, maneuvering through the ever-increasing stakes until only one player emerges victorious.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One person is appointed as the game leader. He divides the tokens evenly among the other players. He also gets the map of Europe and the scale. The station that most players vote for is used as the starting point for guessing the distance. The game leader asks each player about the distance between the starting point and another transmitter. For the sake of simplicity, guessing is rounded up to the full 50 kilometers according to the scale. If you guess incorrectly, you have to pay the game master 50 tokens by how many 50 kilometers he misjudged. However, if the distance is guessed correctly, the person concerned receives 100 tokens from the game master.<br/>The winner is the person who has the most tokens left at the end. By changing the output station when guessing, there are countless possibilities for the game.<br/><br/>The game was published as a promotional giveaway.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

'Parlor'].  Played on a 15&times;19 grid of squares, which are shaded alternately like a draughts / checkers board, play taking place only on the shaded squares. <br/> The game has some resemblance to more modern games such as Bladder and Phutball, and is one of several 'Parlor' simulations from the same source, the others being Base Ball, Croquet, Quoits, [Horse] Race, and Ten Pins.  Players may move any of their six men on the board, with the aim of securing and advancing a thirteenth piece, representing the ball, into the opponent's goal, but the distance that can be moved is determined by the throw of dice.<br/><br/>",
