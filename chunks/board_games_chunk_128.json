        "description": "Dan Qi is an ancient Chinese game dating back to at least the Han dynasty.  The exact rules and design of the pieces/board have only been recovered in fragments, but many scholars speculate on what the game actually looked and how it was actually played.  Some scholars believe that the game is dexterity-focused, where players take turn flicking pieces at each other.  Others believe the game may involve playing with pieces hidden in a manner similar to Lu Zhan Jun Qi.  Still others think that the game had some sort of religious application and involved dropping the pieces randomly onto a special diviniatory board.<br/><br/>",

Therefore toys were made of cheap and poor quality materials. The subject matter used for this board game reflects its time and many children during the war loved to play war games. The playing pieces are represented by different vehicles that have to make their way across Central London during the imposed night-time blackout. This was when no lights could be showing so that night - time bombers would not see any targets.<br/><br/>The back of the board is completely back with a label with the name of the game and a silhouette image of the city of London. The playing side of the board is marked out with a street map with each corner named marble Arch, Holborn, Hyde Park Corner and Charring Cross. The edge of the board has a boarder with three stripes red, white and blue. The game has pack of cards and 4 playing pieces and instructions.<br/><br/>",

There are 110 question cards divided into 40 Love and Etiquette cards, 40 Elvis Presley question cards and 30 penalty cards, and 10 miniature records.<br/><br/>The game requires you to spin a spinner which determines what color card to chose for your question and then answering the question correctly and moving forward on the board or answering the question incorrectly and moving backwards and then having to incur a penalty. The penalties might require you to &quot;walk like Marilyn Monroe&quot; or give your solution to &quot;How would you cheat on an exam?&quot;<br/><br/>Players wind up going through different areas of the board from &quot;Getting to Know You&quot;, &quot;Learning to Like You&quot;, &quot;Let's Go Steady&quot;, and finally &quot;Get the Preacher&quot;. Players wind up pairing up depending on when they finish the board.<br/><br/>",

These eco-impacts have either positive or negative impacts on the environment and the events all relate to one of ten environmental impact areas (land, population, climate, politics, energy, water etc).<br/><br/>The advanced game adds secondary impacts and eco-events (again both positive and negative) to the game taking it away from just a straight game of chance.<br/><br/>Players get positive or negative points when double positive or negative events happen in the related environmental impact areas.<br/><br/>The level of detail about possible future environmental events makes this game's theme very strong and probably its strongest point.  It is great to read the 260 eco-event cards and consider if they have already happened or are still likely to since the game was published in 1993<br/><br/>",

The game allows players to command approximately a division each.  Individual bases represent regiments (approximately 250-500 men).  The ground scale is 1&quot; = 50 yds., regimental bases are 3&quot;x1.5&quot; in size.  Each turn represents 15-30 minutes of time.  The authors use 10mm miniatures, but any size figures can be used as long as the base size is maintained.<br/><br/>During each turn, each brigade, division and corps HQ throws a six-sided die for activation.  Players then draw cards one by one from a deck composed of black and red cards from 1-6 plus a single joker.  Each time a card matching the dice result thrown by the HQ is drawn, elements of that HQ can activate for movement, fire, etc.  HQ's can exchange dice with the HQ above or below it, in order to seize the initiative.  When the joker is drawn, the turn ends.<br/><br/>Each stand fires by adding its attack factor to a d10 roll; hits are caused by equalling or exceeding the target's defense factor varies with unit type and terrain.  Regiments have 3 step losses.:  when a unit takes one hit, it fires at half strength (factors are not modified, but any odd die roll is an automatic miss); on a second hit, fire is at half strength and units may fire only on black cards; on the third hit, the unit is eliminated.  Long range fire cannot cause hits, only morale checks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Death or Glory - What&rsquo;s it all about?<br/><br/>These rules are one of the first historical projects to come out of Spartan Games. The idea was to create a set of skirmish rules that were quick to play, fun, colourful and different to other rule sets. We wanted to play games featuring mythical warriors such as Robin Hood, Achilles and King Arthur, and historical legends like Alexander of Macedon, Frederick Barbarossa and William the Conqueror.<br/><br/>The focus of development was therefore to create rules that favoured the heroes and legends of past centuries at the expense of the common soldier. Death or Glory (DoG) does this, and makes such heroes and legends quite literally deadly on the tabletop. BUT, and this is a big but, they are not unbeatable. If you charge King Arthur into a unit of enemy warriors on his own, with no support or strategy and it&rsquo;s going to hurt - or could even be fatal! But use him as he should be, a legendary fighter, and he will carve his away around a battlefield - just as he does in the movies.<br/><br/>The idea is to use DoG to re-enact scenes from a movie, book or graphic novel, or make up your own encounters using lots of models. Whether you have Leonidas cutting a path through Persian Immortals to save an injured companion, or Jason trying to fight his way through skeletons to the safety of his ship, DoG is perfect for recreating such encounters.<br/><br/>This rulebook loosely covers the Dark Ages, as the statistic cards that are provided are for fairly generic European warriors with chain armour and large shields. There are also two specific lists with statistic cards for Norse and Saxon warriors. Additional supplements and/or downloads will be made available from the Downloads section of this web site.<br/><br/>The DoG rules have now been fully playtested and are being designed, ready for printing. We anticipate that shops will have stock of the rule book in late 2009. DoG will be a full colour, perfect bound 96-page book.<br/><br/>",

We also felt that there was a need for a faster playing set of rules for the period that kept charts and calculations to a bare minimum. Legacy is a flowing game, with the element of surprise and frustration built in to simulate the Fog-of-War using commands issued by dice rolls.<br/><br/>The core rules apply to all the conflicts during the period. You will find that the battle tactics used by the warring nations throughout the period covered by these rules were taught to all officers under the huge shadow cast by Napoleon. With the army lists provided towards the back of the book there are additional rules for the conflicts in which these armies took part.<br/><br/>Napoleonic doctrine would be present at every battle to 1865 and the end of the American Civil War: Johnny Reb and Billy Yank were part of Napoleon&rsquo;s Legacy&hellip;.

        "description": "Operation Orient was a relatively obscure plan conceived by Adolph Hitler and Hiroshi Oshima, Japanese ambassador to Nazi Germany, that set forth a unified strategy for the two great Axis powers.  It called for the seizure of ports at Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and Diego Suarez, Madagascar to disrupt Allied operations across the Suez Canal and the Indian Ocean.  There were plans to invade Siberia in concert with the climax of the Wehrmacht's Operation Typhoon.  In it's most ambitious form, it proposed a land invasion of India by the Imperial Japanese Army, with great assistance from Subhas Chandra Bose and the Indian National Army.  Meanwhile, German forces would seize Egypt and the Caucusus but not stop until panzers could parade in front of the Taj Mahal!  In the end, Yamamoto and the Imperial Japanese Navy won the internal power struggle - the American Pacific fleet and Allied colonies in Asia became the target of the Rising Sun, and Operation Orient became just a footnote in history books.  But what if Yamamoto didn't have his way?  One can only imagine the frightful threat of a truly coordinated Axis effort.  Now you have the chance to rewrite history!<br/><br/>Days of Infamy is a grand strategic simulation, currently in pre-production, that recreates the Pacific Theater of Operations during the Second World War.  It can be played as a standalone game or serve as an expansion to Sturm Europa! to create a truly global conflict.  The combined campaign game is a five-player game, that will introduce a unique arrangement of sides, each with independent victory objectives and only ONE winner, to realistically depict the international and interservice rivalries that threatened to shatter the fragile alliances of all the major combatants of World War II.<br/><br/>PTO Only<br/>Player 1 - Japan (Imperial Japanese Navy, Imperial Japanese Army)<br/>Player 2 - Allies (United States Navy, Commonwealth Nations)<br/><br/>ETO + PTO (Requires Sturm Europa!)<br/>Player 1 - Land Axis (Germany, Imperial Japanese Army)<br/>Player 2 - Naval Axis (Italy, Imperial Japanese Navy)<br/>Player 3 - ETO Western Allies (United States Army, Great Britain)<br/>Player 4 - PTO Western Allies (United States Navy, Commonwealth Nations)<br/>Player 5 - Soviets<br/><br/>Can be combined with Sturm Europa!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Foil is a board game primarily for two opponents. However, the board design allows configurations for more players.<br/><br/>Each player has a source node from which his/her pieces originate. The object of the game is to remove the opponent's piece on his/her source node.<br/><br/>Each piece is a six-sided dice, where each face represents a state. A turn consists of a player using a piece to &quot;act&quot; and then be removed from the board. Depending on the state, the piece can act on:<br/><br/>a) An empty node<br/>b) One of his/her own pieces<br/>c) One of the opponent's pieces<br/><br/>The remaining player's pieces then sequentially back-fill the empty node until the source node is left uncovered. The player can then add a piece of any state to the source node.<br/><br/>There is one exception: the Thrust! In a &quot;Thrust&quot;, a player moves a piece from one node to another. The backfill process on proceeds to the baseline, whereby an empty node is left. In an &quot;Thrust&quot; move, the source node is left unchanged.<br/><br/>The &quot;states&quot; of the pieces are as follows:<br/><br/>1) Neutral<br/>2) Create  - adds a peice of Neutral State to the board<br/>3) Change  - changes the state of any of the players pieces to another state<br/>4) Recruit - changes opponent's pieces of State 4 or less to players own piece of Neutral State<br/>5) Eject   - removes opponents piece of State 5 or less<br/>6) Block   - acts as barrier to other states. Can sacrifice itself to remove other adjoacent opponent's piece of State 6<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A scary mini-wargame for two players.<br/><br/>Two clever necromancers fight one another to conquest the Cave. They possess armies consisting of skeletons, zombies and black knights. But the bewitched place is not going to surrender their treasures easily. Due to the cavern&rsquo;s sorcery, neither necromancer is able to distinguish his own soldiers: all of them look the same. So if he intends to win the battle, he will have to do it almost blind.<br/><br/>MATERIAL<br/><br/>A rectangular 4x5 game board (20 grey spaces).<br/>Six red pieces (monsters) for one necromancer and six black ones for the other. Each set will include one black knight, two zombies and three skeletons. The following symbols will be inscribed on one side of the pieces: a helm for black knights, a zombie&rsquo;s face for zombies and a skull for skeletons.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>At the beginning, the board is empty. Each player (necromancer) chooses one colour and takes the corresponding six pieces (1 black knight, 2 zombies and 3 skeletons). Those pieces will be set face down (symbols hidden). Therefore, the players will not know the identities of the members of their army (until they are required to be displayed).<br/>The board will be oriented so that there is a distance of five spaces between the players.<br/><br/>MONSTERS AND TEAMS<br/><br/>Any evil lord knows black knights are more skilled warriors than zombies, and zombies fight better than skeletons. So, when attacking, a black knight will defeat any other opponent; a zombie will beat a skeleton or another zombie but will be beaten by a black knight, and a skeleton will only defeat another skeleton. When attacked, a black knight will only be overcome by another black knight; a zombie will be beaten by a black knight or another zombie and a skeleton will always lose the fight.<br/>A player can decide to take the risk and join forces by forming groups (teams) of two (2-teams) or three (3-teams) pieces (putting one on another). In that case, the cave&rsquo;s magic determines that 2-teams always fight like a zombie and 3-teams always battle like a black knight, whichever the identities of their monsters may be.<br/><br/>MOVES<br/><br/>Every piece or team behaves the same way:<br/>-Move: orthogonal to an adjacent (and empty) space.<br/>-Attack: diagonal to an adjacent space occupied by a foe. Defeated pieces are immediately removed from the board and successful attackers take their position.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/><br/>A player wins when he gets rid of all his opponent&rsquo;s pieces, keeping at least one of his pieces on the board. If the game ends with all the pieces removed, the result is a draw.<br/><br/>",

Each player should also be provided with about two dozen of counters, on which a nominal value should be set, that any player who happens to be out, may purchase of the winners. If more than six persons sit down to play, a greater number of markers may be cut out of card, and distinguished by figures, as may be agreed on.<br/>Each player proceeds in the game according to the numbers he spins, and pays the fine, or receives the reward appointed. Advances are made by adding the figure turned to that on which the marker stands. Should any player spin a number on which there is already a marker, he must take its place and the other must move one forward. Any player taking more than his due, must go back as many numbers as he took. If he take too few, and the next player have spun, he must remain where he was.<br/>Whatever fines are marked in the list of numbers, must be put into the pool, and the first who makes exactly 150, or `The Jubilee' wins the game; but if he happens to spin above that number, he must go back as may from 150 as he spun beyond it, till he or some one else wins the pool and its contents. Persons going backward in the game are exempted from the fines attached to the figures on which they be obliged to rest.<br/><br/>George IV sits at the centre of the game.<br/><br/>Published May 1st, 1820.<br/><br/>",

Unlike most rummy games with fixed values, a market card is used to track the current value of the Goods cards, which are sold for Prestige at the end of each round in the order set by the number of cards left in hand, giving a strong incentive for players to go out quickly.<br/><br/>This game was originally designed for Cate108's rummy design contest here on BGG.<br/><br/>",

When a player is required to draw a card from their Supply (deck) but cannot because it is empty, the player immediately loses the game. For each damage a player takes through attacks or card effects, they have to discard the topmost card from their Supply to their Junkyard (discard pile).<br/><br/>The game features the tried and tested &quot;Clash Game System&quot; created by Andreas Propst, which features 3 major characteristics:<br/><br/>a) Deck depletion as the primary win condition.<br/>b) A resource system in which you will be building stacks of resource cards to play your non-Resource cards onto<br/>c) Different Zones for different types of cards with specific implications on the cards, depending on which zone they are in<br/><br/>Build up your industry, construct spaceships to attack your opponents or to defend against enemy attacks, train<br/>personnel like ship crews, researchers, diplomats and spies, research new technology or try to dominate through diplomacy <br/>or dodgy schemes and political intrigue.<br/><br/>The possibilities in Space Clash are countless...<br/><br/>Which race will you choose?<br/><br/>The versatile and inventive Terrans, who are able to adapt well to any challenge they might face?<br/><br/>The reptilian warrior race of the Skaargans, with their supreme ability to construct, mend and salvage?<br/><br/>The dodgy and scheming Intrazi, who have perfected the art of telepathy, becoming the masters of secrets?<br/><br/>Or the ancient and mysterious Attrayids who are rather passive but excell in gathering wisdom and knowledge?<br/><br/>Choose your race and lead it to victory by carefully planning your strategy and making the best use of the their<br/>unique strenghtes and abilities.<br/><br/>",

Apart from that you can also initiate an &quot;Outgrowth&quot; of one of your Corals onto an opponent's one. This way you can catch him unawares and while reducing his Coral a bit you can grow yours much larger.<br/><br/>A player also has 4 Shrimps which he must use to &quot;occupy&quot; his Corals by to be able to &quot;feed&quot; them to his Parrotfish. Thse Shrimps also protect the Corals in a small way, adding to their strength.<br/><br/>Last but not least, 30 Special cards can be bought and used throughout the game to give special bonuses or impose penalties upon players. All-in-all it is up to you how you handle your Reef...<br/><br/>",

When a pile is jumped, the top piece is tucked under the jumping piece, leaving the rest of the jumped pile intact.<br/>If a player has no moves on their turn (ie none of their pieces are on top of any piles), their turn is skipped until one of their pieces is uncovered (through other players jumping).<br/>The object of the game is to have only your own pieces on top of every pile.

        "description": "I think to lose Kentucky is nearly to lose the whole game.  - Abraham Lincoln, September 1861<br/><br/>At the dawn of the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Kentucky was officially a &ldquo;border state&rdquo; (neither Union nor Confederate) by decree of the state legislature, but due to the state&rsquo;s strategic location and the divided loyalties of its citizens neither side treated the state as neutral territory.  By the fall of 1861, both Union and Confederate forces occupied Kentucky and, despite the fact that the state had not seceded from the Union, the Confederate States of America had set up a temporary state capital in Bowling Green, installed a governor and added a star representing the state to its flag.  Not surprisingly, a campaign to wrest control of the state from the Union, the &ldquo;Confederate Heartland Offensive,&rdquo; was launched by Generals Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg in the summer of 1862.<br/><br/>The small town of Perryville, located in the central portion of the state, was an unlikely site for the culmination of the campaign, but as the Union forces of General Don Carlos Buell pursued Bragg's Army of the Mississippi eastward under severe drought conditions in early October, both sides made their way to the town in search of the water promised by the Chaplin River and its tributaries.  Once the forces collided near Doctor's Creek on October 8, the Battle of Perryville, the biggest battle fought in Kentucky and, for the number of soldiers involved, one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War, had begun.<br/><br/>By nightfall, the Confederates had scored a tactical victory, as Bragg&rsquo;s army had managed to push Buell&rsquo;s forces back over a mile, but both sides had suffered extensive casualties (over 6,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were dead, wounded, captured or missing), and Bragg, having realized that the number of Union forces in Perryville had been greatly underestimated, would withdraw from the town that night as part of what would ultimately be a total withdrawal from the state.  (Kentucky remained in the Union column for the remainder of the war.)  Buell, roundly criticized for his failures in leadership during the battle (including his failure, due in part to a phenomenon known as an &ldquo;acoustic shadow,&rdquo; to recognize the severity of the battle until very late in the engagement and, therefore, to provide needed &ndash; and readily-available &ndash; reinforcements), found his military career effectively ruined at Perryville despite his strategic victory there.<br/><br/>Perryville:  Bragg vs. Buell, Oct. 8, 1862, a card-driven war game, gives two players the chance to step into the shoes of these generals.  The players must balance military tactics with hand management to determine the fate of the Commonwealth.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The whole game&rdquo; is at stake &ndash; who will be victorious?<br/><br/>",

From the graphics I would guess that the game was made in the 1930&rsquo;s.   Made in England by British Manufacture. Inside of the lid you will find the rules.

        "description": "A simple dice rolling race around Australia in the immediate post-Federation period (1910s). Recorded in National Archives of Australia as first registered and exhibited in 1911.<br/>Start in any state/federal capital. Roll one die to move. Get an extra roll if you land on a state/federal capital (square space). Lose a turn if you land on other towns (large circles). Return to you starting city on an exact roll to win. If a roll would land you on an already-occupied space, you don't move, and lose that turn.  <br/>The map shows the Northern Territory as still belonging to South Australia (not the Commonwealth, to whom it was handed over in 1911). The space for Canberra is named simply 'Federal Capital', and not 'Canberra' and the city of Darwin still named Port Darwin (changed in 1911). This suggests initial creation of the game between c.1903-1910. <br/>There are two known versions of the game, one featuring an illustration of a brown Wright flyer and mounted on a thick cardboard backing and beautiful gilded edging. The later edition featured an illustration of a red and yellow racing biplane similar to a Hawker Hart of the 1920s with a slight variation to the title being 'Around the Commonwealth Aeroplane Game'. The later version was also smaller and printed on lighter cardboard and packaged in a box with a red border and yellow strip. The game boards are otherwise identical, the map not being updated.<br/><br/>",

Each player owns a capital city, which forms their source of power. The players have to conquer other areas and erect buildings to expand their realms, thus increasing their chances to win the game. Battles between the players will be common soon.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to collect seven powerful artifacts, called Tear Stones. There are several ways to get these stones into one's possession: either by conquering certain targets on the modular board or by winning the regularly recurring tournaments or by purchasing the artifacts on the market. Any combination of those ways is possible, making for versatile strategies.<br/><br/>The game is tested and totally playable as it is, but the publisher and designer invites the players to creatively shape gameplay and background story and share their ideas with others.<br/><br/>At present, the game is available in German language only.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a board-game-fox-chase, depicting huntsmen and dogs chasing a fox!<br/><br/>The publisher thinks this game will lift the gloom of a Winter's day.<br/><br/>The Fox is chased along the roads, from 'Going Out' in the left corner, and terminating on the right side, either in the death of the Fox or the 'Throwing Out' of the Huntsmen.<br/><br/>The Totum acts as the die. When spun, it will end on one of two letters; S for Scent, or F for Fault.If an S is spun, the fox moves to the first space on the board from Going Out bearing the letter S. And if F is spun, the fox moves to the first space upwards marked with an F. Players now follow, keeping to these rules. If in Scent, the fox always moves toward the direct road. If he is in Fault, he must be moved upwards and to the left to the next F space on the board. The Fox can only move along the roads. If he is in Fault and it is the next player's turn and he stays in Fault, he has to be moved backwards to the previous F, and so on until he reaches a road where he can move forward as long as he is in Scent.<br/><br/>On arriving at Hope Turning, if the next player spins an S for Scent, that player wins the game by bringing the Fox to his death. But if that player spins an F for Fault, that player is thrown out of the game. The succeeding player now takes his chance on Hope Turning unless the former player, instead of being thrown out, decides to take the Fox to Agony Corner and pay 8 counters into the Pool for the privilege of another try. If he spins an S, the fox is again moved to the S at the end of Turn Off-Again Lane. If he spins an F he is again thrown out and the fox is put back on Hope Turning and the next player tries his luck.<br/><br/>It would appear, but not clearly, that some spaces require putting counters into the Pool and some allow for counters to be removed from the Pool. If all the Huntsmen are thrown out, the Pool stays and another game must be started from the beginning. If a huntsman wins the game, he keeps the Pool.<br/><br/>",

Those who are still in the game show their hands and the highest ranking hand wins. The rank of hands is quite similar to that of Poker.<br/><br/>Many experts say this game was played in the 16th or 17th century in Persia, hence it is a predecessor of Poker. Others claim there is no description of this game till 1890, and since As is not a Persian word but French for Ace, it may only be the Persian interpretation of Poker, using the prviously existing cards.<br/><br/>",

When one character is defeated, the next of the team enters the arena.<br/><br/>Each available character has 2 values: &quot;Endurance&quot; (hits needed to defeat him) and &quot;Aura&quot; (ability to evade attacks/dissipate energy blasts). Each character has his values, although some have the same values (like in the manga/anime series).<br/><br/>Each turn a player follows the sequence: 1st movement, attack, 2nd movement (&quot;hit&amp;run&quot;).<br/><br/>You roll 1 die to know how many squares you can move; then if you are next to your opponent or max. 5 squares away from him, you can attack.<br/><br/>To attack, you roll 1 die and substract the opponent distance from the result; if the result is a positive number, that's the power for that attack (so close combat has no power lessening). <br/>The opponent rolls 1 die for defense: if the result is lower or equal than his character Aura value, then he evades/dissipates the attack and gets no damage. If not, the attack power is deducted from his Endurance. <br/>Then, the attacker can break away (rolling a die and moving).<br/><br/>When one of the caracters' Endurance reaches zero, his player places the next character of his team on the starting position, and the battle continues.<br/><br/>The winner is the player whose character is the &quot;last man standing&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Each set has a plastic container containing six special dice (each die shows a picture of a raven and two to six pips on the sides). Half of the container has a transparent wall to allow players to see their own dice. <br/>The game mechanism is similar to Liar's Dice, with players stating higher and higher numbers of specific faces of dice, until one or the other player is forced to call the other player's bluff (or truthful call). The raven side of the die is treated like a wild card, but once a number of ravens is called, may no longer be used as a wild card.<br/>Sets come as Classic or Gold editions - Gold editions have sturdier containers. The Classic edition has dice with either black or purple pips; the Gold edition has dice with blue pips. In all editions, the ravens are black.<br/>The theme of the game is linked to a fantasy story, which is also on sale at the website.<br/><br/>",

Following the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty of China in 1911, the Tian Di Hui suddenly found themselves without purpose. They could no longer rely on donations from sympathetic locals.  Being unable to resume normal civilian lives after years of hiding, they turned to illegal activities - thus giving birth to the modern Triad gangs.  As the Tian Di Hui spread through different parts of China, it branched off into many groups.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>In this game, compete with other Tian Di Hui factions to collect black market items and sell them to smugglers.  Players take turns purchasing cards from various dealers and collectors (card areas) and build poker hands to challenge for a set number of different valued pots.  The person with the most money after the rush of items completes is the winner.<br/><br/>",

King, Lords and Commons, landlords and merchants, the City and the countryside, bishops and presbyters, the Scottish army, the Welsh people, and the English Fleet, all now turned against the New Model Army. The Army beat the lot.&quot;<br/><br/>Sir Winston Churchill<br/><br/>The New Model Army was created by Parliament in 1645 to defeat the armies of King Charles I in the 1st Civil War. As Lord-General they chose Sir Thomas Fairfax, who had little interest in politics, but his second-in-command was Oliver Cromwell, already a leading member of the Independent Party in Parliament. As a military machine the New Model did all that was desired of it. They beat the Royalists at the Battles of Naseby and Langport, besieged his capital of Oxford and in 1646 Charles surrendered. Parliament needed to reach an accommodation with the King for a Settlement of the Kingdom, but he refused to yield any of his Royal Prerogatives. Secretly, he negotiated with Irish Catholics, Scottish Presbyterians and English Radicals, anyone who could return him to power.<br/><br/>By 1647 agitators elected by the Army rank and file were expressing increasingly radical politics and under Cromwell it had become a haven for religious independents. Parliament proposed to ship troublesome regiments to Ireland, disband others without payment of arrears and establish a Presbyterian Church to suppress religious dissent. In response the Army kidnapped the king and marched on London. Their opponents fled and the Army began its own fruitless negotiations with Charles, but he had other plans; he made an Engagement with the Scottish Duke of Hamilton, promising a Presbyterian Church in England if they restored him to power. In the spring of 1648 Hamilton began to recruit a 36,000 army to invade England,  the Parliamentarian armies in Munster and Wales declared for the King, the Cavalier Sir Marmaduke Langdale seized the border fortresses of Berwick-upon-Tweed and Carlisle, the Navy mutinied, there were pro-Royalist riots across England and major rebellions broke out in Kent and Essex.<br/><br/>On 30th April 1648 the Army Council met at Windsor Castle for a three day prayer meeting where they decided &quot;that it was the duty of our day, with the forces we had, to go out and fight against those potent enemies&quot;. Despite being outnumbered two, three or even four to one the New Model Army beat the Welsh at St Fagans, the Royalists at Maidstone and Colchester and the Scots at Preston. The victorious regiments occupied Edinburgh and London, purged Parliament and brought &quot;Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood he had shed&quot;. They tried him waging war on his people, cut off his head and proclaimed a republic.<br/><br/>Man of Blood is an area movement and impulse game for two to four players recreating the Second Civil War of 1648, the direct cause of the English Revolution and the execution of Charles I. The first player controls the New Model Army; the second the Parliamentarian Northern Association, Irish Army, Scottish Whigs, some lukewarm militia and a mutinous fleet; the third has a loose alliance of Cavaliers, Presbyterians, Welsh, and any ships that desert the Parliamentarians, and the fourth the Scots Engagers and Ulster Army. The Royalists and Scots have more men, but worse generals and variable reinforcements. Players manoeuvre their forces from area to area across the map in order to destroy enemy regiments, capture towns, build up a navy and control the King. It has a 34 by 22 inch map depicting 17th Century Britain from the English Channel to the Highlands and 280 half-inch counters representing the generals, admirals, regiments and warships that fought the war.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This board game is designed to be used by the student after class discussions of the Video Production Process. Up to four students can play the game between classes as a fun way to learn the steps in the video production process as well as see examples of unexpected events that may occur during the process.<br/>The board is divided into three parts - Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production - to mirror the actual process as closely as possible.<br/><br/>Rules The goal of Action! is to finish the game with the most money left. The decisions the players have to make and the event cards they have to draw during the game will affect their budget.<br/><br/>1. Each player receives a game piece and a Decisions-sheet. The various card stacks (Script and Event cards) are put face-down on the corresponding fields on the game board.<br/><br/>2. To determine which player goes first, each player rolls the die. The player with the highest number goes first.<br/><br/>3. The first player becomes bank manager.<br/><br/>4. The first player also rolls the die to determine the scenario (see section Scenarios). The scenario describes the type of video that the players will be &quot;producing&quot; during the game.<br/><br/>5. Each player rolls the die to determine his/her budget (see section Budget) and receives the corresponding amount of money from the bank.<br/><br/>6. Based on the scenario and the rates on the Decisions-sheet (page 1), each player hires staff and rents equipment.<br/><br/>The players mark their choices on their Decision-sheets and pay the total fees to the bank.<br/><br/>7. The players put their game pieces on the &quot;Start&quot; field. The player who goes first rolls the die and advances the corresponding number of spaces in the direction of the arrows. The player performs the Action! specified on the space to which s/he moved:<br/><br/><br/>     On &quot;Draw a card&quot; spaces (indicated by ), the player draws a card from the corresponding pile and performs the Action! specified on the card. The player puts the card back in its pile.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     On passing a &quot;Make a decision&quot; space (indicated by ), the player marks his/her choice on the Decisions-sheet (page 2).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     On &quot;Draw a card and mark the outcome on the Decisions-sheet&quot; spaces (indicated by ), the player draws a card and marks the outcome on his/her Decisions-sheet (page 2).<br/><br/><br/>8. The next player is the player to the first player's left.<br/><br/>9. If a player runs out of money during the game, s/he receives a loan of $ 10,000 from the bank. However, that player loses a day for negotiations with the bank manager (thus receives a &quot;Lose a day&quot; card from the bank which, at the end of the game, will cost the player $ 5,000). If, at the end of the game, the player is able to pay the full amount of the loan back (i.e. by selling the Oscar to the bank), s/he wins a day.<br/><br/>10. The game is over when the first player reaches the space &quot;The Oscar.&quot;<br/><br/>The player in second place receives one &quot;Lose a day&quot; card, the player in third place receives two &quot;Lose a day&quot; cards, and the player in fourth place receives three &quot;Lose a day&quot; cards.<br/><br/>11. The Oscar is awarded to the player who spent the most money on staff/equipment. The Oscar is worth $ 10,000. If more than one player spent the most on staff/equipment, the Oscar prize money is split equally.<br/><br/>12. At the end of the game, each player counts his/her remaining money. Each player also calculates his/her &quot;Lose a day&quot;<br/><br/>(- $ 5,000) and &quot;Win a day&quot; (+ $ 5,000) cards.<br/><br/>The player with the most money left wins the game. If all players end the game without any money left, the player closest to his/her budget wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The player with highest roll gets to go first<br/><br/>* Play continues to next player clockwise from the first player<br/><br/>To Play<br/><br/>* Players begin their turn by rolling the die. After rolling the die, players place their playing piece on the Start space and move the playing piece clockwise the number of spaces indicated on the die.<br/><br/>* When the player lands on a space, they must answer a question or perform an action.<br/><br/>* As a player moves through the first phase, Analyze, they must collect a &quot;A&quot; token before moving out of the Analyze phase. The player must circle the Analyze phase until they are able to collect a token. After collecting a token, they may move on to the next phase.<br/><br/>* Play stops only when a question has been answered incorrectly or the player's token lands upon a STOP space.<br/><br/>* Play continues until one player manages to collect all five tokens.<br/><br/>",

If a player lands in the same space as another player's piece and answers the question correctly, they get that token plus they can take a token of their choice that belongs to the other player.<br/>   7. If a player lands in the Double Feature space and answers the question correctly they receive two tokens of that color.<br/>   8. If a player has all the tokens of that colored space they do not receive another token of that color, but must answer the question correctly if they wish to continue their move.<br/>   9. If a player lands in the Awards Circle, they must answer the question on the card that is of the person to their left's choice.<br/>  10. Once the player has received all twelve of their tokens (3 red, 3 blue, 3 green and 3 yellow) they then roll the die and try to land in the Award Circle. They must have the exact number on the die to land in the Award Circle. Once in the Award Circle, to win they must correctly answer a question drawn from the card of the player to their left's choice.<br/><br/>",

A quick game could be played up to 100 points. A greater point total would be set for a more in-depth game experience.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>1. Each player must roll one die. Whoever gets the highest roll selects a playing piece and places it on a Mission Card Spot. The player with the next highest roll chooses next. This continues until everyone has placed their piece. Note: Players do not get to draw a Mission Card at this time.<br/><br/>2. The player who placed their piece last gets to play first. This follows until the player who placed their piece goes last.<br/><br/>3. The players roll two dice. When the game begins the players must decide which way they will be travelling. On following turns they must continue the direction they were travelling on the previous round. The players may choose to stop moving at any time during their turn. For example, if a player rolls five on the dice, but only need three to get to a Question Spot, they may cease movement on the Spot.<br/><br/>4. The direction of movement cannot be changed until one of the following has occurred: the player lands on a Question Spot; the player lands on a Mission Card Spot; or the player has a Mission Card that allows reversal of motion.<br/><br/>5. Players must land on question spots to be asked questions. The answers will be presented in a multiple-choice format. When a question is answered correctly, the player recieves the number of points printed on the card. The person who moved previously acts as the questioner. If this happens on the first turn, the player who goes last asks the question. The questioner draws a Question Card corresponding to the map grid and the color landed on by the player. There are three levels of difficulty for answering questions.<br/><br/>Level One: Beginning learners would play for the full point total and would have the multiple choice answers read to them.<br/><br/>Level Two: Intermediate play would have the most options; the learner can answer the question for full points by not having the multiple choice answers read to them and for half points if they need to have their answer options read to them.<br/><br/>Level Three: Advanced learners would play for the full point total without having the multiple choice answers read to them.<br/><br/>6. If the player does not answer the question correctly, the remaining players may attempt to jump in and steal the question. If they answer correctly, they gain half the points that the original player would have recieved. If they answer incorrectly, they lose half of the points the original player would have recieved. All other remaining players may attempt this with the exception of the Questioner.<br/><br/>7. After successfully answering a question, the player must move to another map grid before stopping at another Question Spot. This does not apply to players who jumped in on someone else's question.<br/><br/>8. When the players land on a Mission Card spot, they get to draw one Mission card. Some Mission Cards may be saved for later and others must be played immediately. The card should state when it comes into effect.<br/><br/>9. The game concludes at a predetermined win scenario. The game can be played towards a point limit. For example, the first player with 100 points could be the winner. Alternately, the game can be played to a time limit. PLay could be set to end in 30 minutes and whoever has the most points would be the winner.<br/><br/>",

In order to enter a territory, a player must land on the entry point by exact roll. He will then select the dilemma card for that territory. He must read the card aloud and select a choice. He then must check the corresponding number on the Dilemma Answer Sheet. If successful, then the territory is colonized. The player then places the appropriate country's flag on that territory and adds the appropriate number of points to their score. If unsuccessful, the player, with his piece still on the entry point, loses one turn but may attempt to colonize the territory on his next turn. During this time, other players may attempt to colonize this territory.<br/><br/>6. Once a territory is colonized, a player must return to the sea before entering another territory.<br/><br/>7.

The player with the highest<br/>roll goes first and then play proceeds clockwise.<br/>Starting The Game<br/>To start just roll the die and move your game piece clockwise that many<br/>spaces. Draw the card that corresponds to the color space you landed<br/>on. Follow instructions on the card. If you run out of cards for a color<br/>that space becomes a &ldquo;roll-again&rdquo; space.<br/>Winning and Ending the Game<br/>The game ends when a player lands on the finish space. You must land<br/>exactly in the finish space. For example if you are four spaces away<br/>from finish you must roll a four or less to progress further. If they roll<br/>higher their turn has ended.<br/>When the game ends all the players count the cards they have in each<br/>category. For each card category that a player has the most cards they<br/>get one point. The player who reached the finish first also receives one<br/>point.

Place one chip on any circle with a black circle in the middle, this is your initial infection. The player who was last sick goes first (their parasite is closer to the surface). Play will continue clockwise.<br/><br/>Play<br/>A turn consists of two phases:<br/>1) Growth<br/>Some circles have a set of numbers in them. The first number is the amount of parasite chips that grow every turn. If you have at least one chip in the circle, you will add this number of chips to the circle. If you do not have enough chips of your color, you may choose where to grow. The maximum number of chips a single player may have on the board is 50. The second number is the maximum amount of parasites this circle can support. If you begin the turn beneath the maximum, you may grow to the maximum number. If you begin the turn above the maximum, your parasites are strangled and you LOSE the amount of chips you would have gained (down to the maximum, but not below). <br/>Examples:<br/><br/>     Parasite Influidia has 3 chips on a circle with +3/15. This turn Influidia gains 3 chips to be at 6.<br/>     Parasite Betonium has 16 chips on a circle with +2/10. This turn Betonium loses 2 chips to be at 14.<br/>     Parasite Steve has 14 chips on a circle with +3/15. This turn Steve gains 1 chip up to the circle maximum of 15.<br/>     Parasite Rogainium has 11 chips on a circle with +2/10. This turn Rogainium loses 1 chip down to the circle maximum of 10.<br/><br/><br/>2) Movement<br/>Once all your parasites have grown, you may move them. Parasites may move across one black line connecting two circles. Parasites may only move one circle per turn. All parasites must move in stacks of a maximum of 5. You may split your parasites into smaller stacks at any time. The unnumbered circles may only have one stack inside at a time (so a maximum of a 5). Any parasites inside of an  unnumbered circle MUST MOVE this turn or lose one chip. Any parasite moving into a circle occupied by another player begins combat. Combat When one player's parasites moves onto another player's  parasites, they fight. Each attacking parasite kills one defending parasite by sacrificing itself. If the attacking player has more parasites, the remainder now occupy the circle. If the defending player has more parasites, any that are left remain on the circle. If both players have the same number of parasites, all are destroyed and the circle is left empty.<br/><br/>Elimination / Winning<br/>If at any time a player has no more parasites on the board, they are eliminated. The game is over when one player controls all green-colored circles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "64-32 Ranch Roundup is an abstract strategy game system that may or may not employ cards for luck, depending on which of the provided rules are used.  The board consists of a central round-up area and four corner corral areas; all the game pieces begin in the round-up area and it is the goal of each player to move their colored pieces to their own corral area.  Pieces and spaces are numbered, and this can be employed in different ways, again depending on the variation being played, and paper money is included for scoring.  Other games from Wales Game Systems were subsequently given a &quot;64-32 Ranch&quot; western theme, undoubtedly to maximize sales in an era when Westerns were extremely popular.  The game's designer states in the patent files for these games that they are abstract and that any theme could be applied to them.<br/><br/>",

If correct, the player wins the game.<br/><br/>If incorrect, the card is added back to the bottom of the stack and play continues for the other players.<br/><br/>",

George Parker had decided to concentrate on only the company's top sellers (and also to conserve materials). However South American Travel was released anyway because Mr. Parker believed Americans still had a hunger to travel and visit exotic places.<br/>The originally planned metal game pieces were however replaced with cardboard and wood, due to the war effort..<br/><br/>",

The value of each attribute is randomly determined by rolling a die at the start of the game, with each civilization receiving a second cumulative die roll for a specified attribute in which that civilization excelled.<br/><br/>The gameplay involves drawing and trading cards in order to play melds. Playing a meld adds to a player's victory point total and increases the value of an attribute of the player's civilization. Playing a meld also conveys a specific bonus (such as stealing cards or victory points from other players) depending on the type of meld played. The winner is the player with the most victory points after twelve rounds have been played.<br/><br/>This free, online rules set describes the components that you will need to create in order to play. The components include a custom card deck made up of twelve types of cards with nine copies of each card. Six-sided dice are also required for play.<br/><br/>",

No one is very sure why traffic signs would need to know about these things. It's not a Monopoly clone but shares some minor visual elements, presumably in order to ride on Monopoly's popularity.<br/><br/>NOTE: While traditionally credited as a K&auml;rnan game it is more likely that the real publisher is moped and bicycle manufacturer Monark AB and that this is an advertising object. Please note how the persons and bikes are introduced on the box lid. (K&auml;rnan is however the manufacturer of the game.) In the years between 1945 and around 1960 (when the automobile become common) the moped and bicycle markets in Sweden was heated with fierce competition between Monark, Nymans, Husqvarna and other manufacturers. Monark would eventually &quot;win the race&quot; and swallow the closest competitors, first Nymans and then in 1962 Husqvarna's divisions for bicycles, mopeds and boat engines.<br/><br/>",

Political, economic and military struggle between the Noble Houses of the Imperium. Meddle in politics during the Landsraad Council, influencing the Padishah Emperor. Acquire wealth, speculating on Semuta Drug and Pundi Rice prices in the CHOAM. Plan hostile actions against rivals, under the limitations of the Great Convention.&quot;<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>&quot;The game is conducted on 3 boards: on the LANDSRAAD board you can plan political actions; on the CHOAM board you can trade resources for SOLARI (the Imperium currency); on the KANLY board you can plan assassinations, sabotage actions, or even full-scale wars.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Tokens represent commodities (SPICE MELANGE, HAGAL QUARTZ, etc.), or SOLARI (the Imperium currency). Also, there are tokens to represent three NOBLES for each Noble House, and for their soldiers (TROOPERS, SABOTEURS and ASSASSINS). Also there are tokens to represent the special ADVISORS (Mentat or Bene Gesserit) which you could be provided if you met the Emperor's favour.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Cards represent useful situations which could help you during your quest for power. The most powerful ones are you cannot obtain by chance: they are PETITIONS to the Padishah Emperor which he has graciously agreed to concede (or, sometimes, not to concede). Less powerful situations are just acts of FATE.&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay summary:<br/><br/>&quot;Each player will represent a Noble House and will be given three NOBLE tokens: he will use those tokens to attempt actions in each turn. Actions could be political (LANDSRAAD board), trade (CHOAM board) or hostile (KANLY board): to represent that a player is attempting an action, he will put one of his NOBLE in the appropriate slot on the appropriate board. The number of action a player could do in a turn will be therefore generally limited by the NOBLE tokens he has, even if it will be possible to increase it by mean of ADVISORS.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each turn is divided in three phases: LANDSRAAD, CHOAM and KANLY; each to be played on the appropriate board.&quot;<br/><br/>Victory:<br/><br/>&quot;When a player will draw the End Game Fate Card, he will immediately show it, and the game will end. The Noble house with the most SOLARI will win the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

On one side of each number card is a red line. One should try to form sums of 15, using the red lines on the cards to stop a series of numbers in a row or column. You score for formed 15's, for the same numbers next to each other (ex: 5,5,5) and also for number sequences (ex: 2,3,4 or 6,7,8,9). All these actions score points. When the cards run out, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Each full drawing on a large card consists of three main parts. Therefor there are three small cards for each large card.<br/><br/>Both sets of cards are put face down on the playing area. You can choose to mix the large and small cards together in one group, or to have them as two separate groups.<br/><br/>In a turn a player first flips over one of the large cards which will show a full drawing. For example: A bird in a nest on a branch. Then the player flips over a small card, trying to match it with the full drawing on the large card that's already flipped over. In the example mentioned, a matching small card should show a drawing of either the bird, the nest or the branch.<br/><br/>If no match is made, both the large and small cards are to be flipped over again, face down. If a match is made, the player gets to keep only the small card; the large card has to be flipped over again. However, if the matching small card is the last of the small cards remaining for the specific large card, then the player gets to keep both cards.<br/><br/>A player is allowed another turn whenever he/she is able to collect a small tile. If a player collects both a large and a small card, it's the next players' turn.<br/><br/>Should a player overlook the fact that the collected small card was the last one of the set remaining, and flip over the large card so that it is facing down again instead of collecting it, then any player in his/her own turn can still collect this large card. A player doing so has to mention that the large card he/she collects does not have any of its small cards remaining. Collecting a single large card also means that it's the next players' turn.<br/>A player that overlooks to collect a large card does however get another turn since he/she did collect a small card. He/she can still use this extra turn to collect the large card, so other players are warned not to rejoice openly to quickly as this might trigger him/her to do just that!<br/><br/>If a player collects a large card, the remaining large cards have to be shuffled.<br/>Whenever a single player manages to collect a full set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards), all remaining cards (large and small) have to be shuffled.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more cards to be collected. To determine the winner, the cards are counted and scored as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     1 point for each small card<br/>     2 points for each large card (except for the last collected large card; No points for that!)<br/>     3 bonus points for each complete set of cards (1 large card and its 3 small cards)<br/><br/><br/>The player that gets the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The puzzles are hexagonal in shape and fit on a tray board.  The difficulty level of each board is determined by two factors: the number of pieces in a puzzle - 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300 - and the difficulty of the puzzle picture - Levels 1-5, 5 being the most difficult. Refill puzzles are available for all ages and skill levels.  With every purchase of a refill, JAG-GER is a new game&quot;.<br/><br/>Contents listed as 54 score cards, 2 game boards. 2 puzzles (each are 100 pieces).  The box bottom of mine shows a beautiful mountain lake photo with flowers in the foreground and a photo of a Germanic/medieval looking building beside a canal with a covered bridge.<br/><br/>With more than two players, players play in teams.

        "description": "The world's first and only ambigram card game will test your guts, your will and your game strategy while it surprises you with its amazing game cards.<br/><br/>The rules are simple: Each card in your hand contains an ambigram, containing one word when it is read upright, and another word when it is read upside-down (like &quot;Angel&quot; / &quot;Finger&quot;).  You can play either of those two words on either of the two words that are currently displayed on the deck (like &quot;Drink&quot; / &quot;Angel&quot;).<br/><br/>Sure, the first few rounds are simple, since you have lots of different ways to play out the possibilities in your hand, but you had better plan ahead and pay attention to what cards your opponents have, because the game gets trickier in the final few rounds.  Don't get caught drawing a fist full of cards when your opponents are almost out!<br/><br/>To make the game even more challenging, your opponent might zing you at any time by slapping you with a &quot;Double Joker&quot; or a &quot;Double Angel&quot; card that contains the same word in both directions, doubling the chances that you'll have to draw!<br/><br/>Of course, you could plan to zing them back with a &quot;Double Siren&quot;, but don't get caught holding that card in your hand for long, because not only is it twice as hard for your opponent to play on, it's also twice as hard for you to get rid of!  You had better plan ahead, or your scheme to attack at the end when it can hurt the most might come back to bite YOU!<br/><br/>Simple to learn, but filled with plenty of twists (literally), Ambigram! the game provides hours of fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>About the Playing Cards<br/><br/>The Ambigram deck itself is a wonder of modern technology that no human being could have designed alone, even if they possessed several lifetimes to work on the problem.<br/><br/>Instead, a computer was given the task of finding the words to use for the cards.  It was programmed to go through the entire English Dictionary, word by word, and locate 7 words that could all form an ambigram with themselves, and also form an ambigram with every one of the other 7 words that were being located - a total of 49 ambigrams in all.<br/><br/>It took the computer 16 days to go through the Dictionary and return the answer: Angel, Drink, Finger, Joker, Killer, Learn and Siren - the amazing set of words that make up all of the 49 cards for Ambigram! the Game.  Those 49 ambigram cards are joined by a single Wild card, for a total of 50 spinnable round cards that play out differently every time!<br/><br/>",

Dealer shuffles the deck and deals seven cards to the players starting with the player to the left. He then flips the first card of the playing deck over next to the remaining cards.<br/>   2. The player on the dealer's left begins play. They may either pick up the card lying face up or take the top card from the stack. They may choose to keep this card in their hand or return it to the face-up pile on the table. If one of the new cards is taken, one must be discarded in its place. Play continues around the circle.<br/>   3. Players sort their cards according to categories of media type (graphics, video, animation, or sound) or according to informational category (9 categories.)<br/>   4. The winner of the round is the player who is able to discard all of his cards first. Each of the remaining players gets a point added to his score for the cards he has in his hands.

Squares closer to the basket are marked with odds for both a guarded and an open shot.  There is a movement track that runs through the outside squares.  Each player has two &ldquo;court decks&rdquo; and one &ldquo;shoot deck.&rdquo;  Most individual plays are resolved by drawing from these decks of cards.<br/><br/>In normal play, the offense begins with the ball along the outside track.  Both players draw from their court deck.  If the offense has the higher number, the ball can moved (usually closer to the basket) up to the difference between the two numbers.  If the defense has the higher number the ball is moved the difference of the two numbers along the outside track.  If the numbers are equal, special actions such as fouls and turnovers occur.<br/><br/>When a player shoots, a card is drawn from the &ldquo;shoot deck&rdquo; and the shot resolved according to the odds printed on the square where the shot occurs.  The color of the court deck card used to arrive at that square determines whether it is an open or guarded shot.<br/><br/>There are also rules for rebounds, fast breaks, 3-pt. shots, 24 sec. clock, &amp; fouls.<br/><br/>",

(A gap is an area of the interior line for which a defensive lineman or linebacker is responsible.) The coach deals seven of the position cards to each of the players. The coach exposes the play card, waits five seconds, then exposes the gap card. If a player holds the card of the position that is responsible for that gap, he may put that card face down on the table. The players have five seconds to put their cards down after the gap card is exposed. On the command of the coach, any player who puts down a card must turn it over. If the player is correct, he gets a point. If wrong, he loses a point. If a player has no points and is wrong, his score becomes a negative number. Players who put cards down may get a new card from the position deck. The cards that are put down will be collected by the coach. If necessary, the coach will check the results against the play sheets.<br/><br/>The first player to get ten points wins the round and gets to be coach for the next round. The previous coach then becomes a player; however, he will need 12 points to win the round after being the coach. Rounds may continue as time permits.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>64 cards<br/><br/>",

There are many different paths toward achieving this goal, so look carefully at all of your options.<br/><br/>Your goal is to obtain as many assets as you can and wipe out all the other gangs in town. The assets that are available to you are hitmen, dealers, muscle, and businesses. Be ruthless on your way to the top.<br/><br/>HITMEN are used to take out the other assets in the game, as well as enemy bosses. Their fees can be steep, but this is the mark of an expert assassin. Used wisely, hitmen will quickly take the title of your most useful asset.<br/><br/>DEALERS are an easy way to make money in this city. Everyone needs something, and these shady assets are there to supply it to them for a nominal fee. Owning dealers will make you money each turn.<br/><br/>MUSCLE are your strong men, used in a variety of situations. They are your personal bodyguards and can be sent out to any assets you deem in need of some protection. They can also hassle businesses into giving up protection fees, making them invaluable.<br/><br/>BUSINESSES are the most legitimate, and therefore least cost efficient, way of making money. Businesses are in general the most expensive assets in the game, but they are especially helpful because they cannot be targeted by hitmen.<br/><br/>These are the resources at your disposal. If you can use them correctly nothing will stand in your way. But always be on your guard; you're not the only one willing to do what it takes.<br/><br/>Get some friends together and become enemies. Or get some enemies together and become friends. This is a party game full of deceit, betrayel, and the most nefarious of schemes. Fight over territory and businesses, buy out your enemy's assets, and dishonor truces at that pivotal turning point to take all the glory in that final stretch. Let nothing stand between you and total rule.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The group is a VESL class studying beginning automotive. Many of the students are unfamiliar with fractions or have had little practice using them.<br/><br/>Fractions are frequently used in the automotive trade. A mechanic must know which wrenches or bolts are larger than others and must be able to state which fraction is larger when making a comparison.<br/><br/>There are at least four suits based on the denominator of the fractions. The common fractions used in the industry from 1/2 to 1/64 can be used to form suits. The purpose is to use all the available cards by arranging them into suits in descending or ascending order. The suits can be color coded. For every substitution in the sequence, extra points will be given (for instance, 1/8 - 2/8 (1/4 ) - 3/8 - 4/8 (1/2) or 8/16 or 16/32).<br/><br/>If a player fails to use the lowest denominator, then a point will be subtracted. There will be enough cards in each suit to cover up to one inch. There will be extra cards that will be used to cover the points of intersection between suits; for instance, 1/4 - 1/2 -3/4, etc.<br/><br/>These extra cards will allow all suits to be completed in more than one way.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Goobles is a game to help students identify and learn the relational structure of knowledge in a particular domain. Students have difficulty in connecting concepts and creating a sequence of concepts. This game will help students forge ideas about relationships and to build critical thinking skills.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards:<br/><br/>      Category card: an umbrella concept (for example: Newton's Laws, Mechanics, Dynamics, Kinematics, etc.) that can be used to connect two sequences. There are two cards for each category.<br/>     Term card: representing a more atomic concept, such as length, mass, velocity, speed, etc. There are four cards for each term (to increase the possibility of chain building).<br/><br/><br/>Each subsequent player either chooses one of his or her five cards to build a sequence or starts a new sequence and scores following:<br/><br/>      5 points for playing a card with a strongly related concept.<br/>     2 points for playing a category card.<br/>     -1 point for starting a new sequence.<br/>     2 bonus points for playing a card that joins two sequences.<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/>50 cards<br/><br/>",

If the player can find no matches he/she will ask any player by name, for an equivalent fraction. For example: &quot;Adam, do you have an equivalent fraction to 1/2?&quot;<br/><br/><br/>If Adam does have the equivalent fraction, Adam must surrender his card.

This was an era when a man, with very little or no formal education could get very rich in a short time, with a lot of backbreaking work, some good luck and with a highball crew working for him. Many more Gypo loggers also went broke in their ventures due to poor planning, unforeseen expenses, plain old 'bad luck' and a multitude of pitfalls which this game only touches the surface of. The term 'Gypo' refers to &quot;haywire&quot; or make do methods that are not necessarily proper--in other words lots of duct tape and haywire is holding everything together and you&rsquo;re probably not using the right machine or tool anyway but somehow you're still getting the wood out.<br/><br/>",

The first player to discard must discard aces (blue cards), the second player two's (red cards), the third player three's (green cards), etc.<br/><br/>The players say in German how many and what color of cards they are discarding. If a player doesn't have the color to discard for that turn, the player must bluff. The player puts other cards down, but says the color of card for his or her turn. Other players can then say &quot;Ich Zweifle Es&quot;, or I doubt it. The first player to accuse is the one who calls the bluff. A player who is caught bluffing must pick up the whole discard pile. A player wrongly accusing another player of bluffing must pick up the discard pile instead. Play then continues to the next player who must discard the next color in order.

Prestige Points are earned by creating/assembling astounding illusions and &ldquo;performing&rdquo; them at various types of theatres in the city. Strategy, timing and elements of luck all play a role in your rise to prominence, as do the political machinations and jealousy of your peers.&quot;<br/><br/>It's basically a set-collection card game that plays in 30-45 minutes. The suits are four different types of illusions commonly performed by late-Victorian era stage magicians and you'll need an &quot;aha!&quot; idea card of a suit and a card of values 1,2 and 3 of the same suit to perform (put into play) an illusion to earn Prestige Points points. There are 16 different magicians to play, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, optional trait cards, and the all important Events (fate) deck that you both need and dread.<br/><br/>",

Whenever the caller uses one of these words, he/she gets a headache pill (but the conversation continues). <br/>During the conversation, the caller has to try and estimate how much time has passed. When he/she thinks the time is within the chosen limits, he or says goodbye and puts down the &quot;phone&quot;. If he/she was within the chosen limits, he/she gets one, two or three points, depending on the length of the call.

The best deal is determined by the total cost of purchasing the home less the total value of the home.<br/><br/>Each mini-game contributes to the total cost and/or total value of the home which is recorded on the home buyer's contract. At the conclusion of the games, the cost and value of each home is calculated, producing a winner(s).<br/><br/>Each mini-game has a contributory goal to the overall goal.<br/><br/>In Mortgage Mambo, the mini-game goal is to get as many loan offers as possible and then to select from those offers.<br/><br/>In Realtor Roundup, the mini-game goal is to get to the best realtor and therefore get the largest number of buyer incentives.<br/><br/>In Inspection Perfection, the mini-game goal is to increase the cost or decrease the value of your opponents Home Buyer's Contract.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/><br/>House Hunt General Rules<br/><br/>For both single player games and games of two or more.<br/><br/>1. Each player should take a blank Home Buyer's contract. Each player will need a pen or pencil to record results on their home buyer's contract.<br/>   2. Select one Home Profile from the set of Home Profile cards. Each player will use the same home profile as a starting part for their home contract.<br/>   3. Each player then uses a pencil to fill out their home-buyer's contract with the information from the home profile card.<br/>   4. For a complete game, play in the following order:<br/>          * Mortgage Mambo<br/>          * Realtor Roundup<br/>          * Inspection Perfection<br/>   5. You may also play each game by itself or skip one or two of the games. If Inspection Perfection is played, it should always be played last.<br/><br/>Realtor Roundup and Mortgage Mambo Rules<br/><br/>For two or more players:<br/><br/>1. Select one side of the draw box for the game you are playing to pull cards from.<br/>   2. Place the END GAME marker in the middle of the draw box For a longer game, place it closer to the side opposite where you will draw from.<br/>   3. All player tokens begin at START.<br/>   4. Select one player to be first. This is the current player.<br/>   5. The player on the right of the current player draws a task card from the draw box and asks the current player the question on the outside of the card.<br/>   6. If the current player requests a hint, the player on the right opens the card and reads the hint (usually a set of multiple choice answers).<br/>   7. The number of spaces a player may move is stated on each task card and depends on whether the current player got the answer right and whether a hint was used. Follow the directions on the task cards.<br/>   8. When a player lands on a space with directions, the player should follow those directions prior to the next player taking a turn.<br/>   9. When a current player's turn is over, play proceeds clockwise to the next player, who becomes the current player.<br/><br/>For single players:<br/><br/>1. Set up play as for two or more players.<br/>   2. Draw task cards and answer the questions.<br/>   3. If you need a hint, open the task card enough to see the hint while still obscuring the answer.<br/>   4. When you've answered the question, open the card completely to confirm if your answer is correct.<br/>   5. Move your token as directed and record any changes to your home buyer's contract.<br/><br/>Inspection Perfection Rules<br/><br/>For two or more players only.<br/><br/>1. Shuffle Inspection Deck. Each player should take four (4) cards from the deck, making certain not to show the cards to other players.<br/>   2. There are two objectives to this game. The first is to discard all of your cards. The second is to ask other players questions that you think they don't know, forcing them to pick up another card from the pile and to receive a penalty which will affect their home buyer's contract.<br/>   3. Play proceeds as follows:<br/>          * A player chooses a card from his/her hand and asks any other player the question on the card.<br/>          * If the questioned player gets the answer correct, s/he receives the reward specified on the card.<br/>          * If the questioned player gets the answer wrong, s/he receives the penalty specified on the card and must draw a card from the inspection pile.<br/>          * In either case, the questioning player discards the card in the common discard pile.<br/>   4. Play then proceeds to the player on the left of the player who just asked the question.<br/>   5. When one player has no more cards, the game is over.<br/><br/>Ending The Games<br/><br/>At the end of the games, complete the calculations on your home buyer's contract. The person with the best deal wins.<br/><br/>",

The teams do this by landing on the clues and/or stealing clues from other teams.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>1. Put one electron card on each electron space on the board.<br/>   2. Place the mystery element envelope on the mystery element box on the board.<br/>   3. Put the question cards on the question box on the board.<br/>   4. Pick a game piece and place it in the nucleus.<br/>   5. Distribute markers and periodic table folders to each team.<br/><br/>Playing Game - read all directions before playing<br/><br/>1. BEGINNING PLAY - Each team rolls a die. The highest number goes first.<br/>   2. One at a time, all teams must answer a question card correctly to cross from the nucleus to the first shell.<br/>   3. If answered incorrectly, wait until your next turn to try again. You must answer the question correctly to leave the nucleus and start playing.<br/>   4. After your team has correctly answered a question card, move your piece from the nucleus along one of the bridges and remain there until your next turn.<br/>   5. CONTINUING PLAY - On your next turn, roll the die and travel in any direction along that shell.<br/>   6. ELECTRON CARDS - When you land on an electron clue card, pick up the card and share it only with your team.  Use your periodic table to mark off elements that the clue eliminates.  Once an electron clue card is picked up, the space becomes null.<br/>   7. QUESTION BRIDGES - Use the question card bridges to travel to available clue cards in different shells. You must answer the question correctly to use the question card bridge.<br/>   8. ELEMENT SYMBOL/DIAGRAM SPACES - If you land on an element symbol, jump to the corresponding element diagram, and vice versa.<br/>   9. WINNING THE GAME - Once your team thinks they have determined the mystery element, travel back to the nucleus, answering question cards correctly to travel across the bridges and rolling the die. It is not necessary to land in the nucleus by an exact roll of the die.  Once in the nucleus, you may announce your guess and check the envelope. If you are right, you win! If you are wrong, place the card back in the envelope, your team is out and the game continues with the other teams.<br/><br/>",

Each player must reach the finish, or &ldquo;Lights Out,&rdquo; and the player with the fewest calories at &ldquo;Lights Out&rdquo; is the winner.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Caloric Consequences<br/><br/>OBJECT: The object of Caloric Consequences is to get through a day of meals and activities (from Wake Up and Smell the Coffee to Lights Out) with the fewest total calories.<br/><br/>SETUP: Place the cards in the appropriate places on the board and distribute one notepad, one pencil, and one game-piece to each player. The game is for 2&ndash;4 players, ages 21 and up.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>1.           All players roll the die. The player with the highest roll goes first, then the turn passes to the right.<br/><br/>2.           All players start on Wake Up &amp; Smell the Coffee.<br/><br/>3.           The active player rolls the die once during a turn and moves his or her piece according to the number indicated.<br/><br/>4.           The player to the left of the active player draws a card from the stack that corresponds to the space the active player lands on and reads the scenario and the options, NOT the calories.<br/><br/>5.           The active player MUST choose one of the options. (It can be assumed that all of the food and drink options on a card are of the same serving size.)<br/><br/>6.           The inactive player reveals the caloric value of the active player&rsquo;s choice, and the active player records that value on his or her notepad. (Each player should total his or her calories after each turn. Players may use calculators.) The inactive player then reads the remaining caloric values.<br/><br/>7.           If a player lands on Free Time and chooses an activity to do right now, he or she MUST physically complete that activity.<br/><br/>8.           Play repeats according to the steps above.<br/><br/>9.           The first player to reach Lights Out deducts 100 calories.<br/><br/>10.       The game ends when all players reach Lights Out. An exact roll of the die is NOT necessary to reach Lights Out.<br/><br/>11.       To Win: The player with the lowest number of calories wins.<br/><br/>12.       In the case of a tie, the winner can be determined with one of the following methods: flip a coin, roll the die, pushup contest, arm-wrestling, rock-paper-scissors, thumb-war, draw straws, or staring contest.<br/><br/>OPTIONAL: Players may calculate the excess calories they consumed in a day and estimate how much weight they would gain in a year if they made the same choices in life that they made in the game with the equations below:<br/><br/>total calories &ndash; 2,000 = excess daily calories<br/><br/>excess daily calories x 365 &cedil; 3,500 = yearly weight gain<br/><br/>LONG GAME: Play can be lengthened by circling the board more than once.<br/><br/>CARD GAME: To play as a card game, players take turns reading cards to each other, reading one card per turn, going in order from Breakfast to Dinner. Players choose options and calculate calories as in regular play.<br/><br/>",

By having the most political influence in a country, a player controls its government and may use its economic, diplomatic, and military resources to crush his enemies. But alas, rival factions wait in the shadows, ready to seize power. Push your citizens too far, and you might find yourself in front of a firing squad.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player may either 1) play an event card or 2) activate a country. Each player has a fixed set of event cards, allowing him to manipulate the geo-political landscape throughout the game in a myriad of ways. When a country is activated, the governing party can improve the economy, call for diplomatic sanctions, raise an army, engage in political maneuvering, seek international influence, and more. Rival parties have a chance to oppose every action, so unpopular actions may come with a heavy price.<br/><br/>After each country is activated once, the regions are scored. The game ends when every country has a representative in the League of Nations, a player reaches a certain number of victory points, or a party rules a certain number of countries.<br/><br/>This luckless game was inspired by eggertspiele's &quot;not-quite-politically-correct game of tactics, agitation, and plenty of interaction,&quot; Global Powers.<br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of a family of Goblins and the other, a party of adventuring Raiders. The Raiders break into a house occupied by the Goblins in search of treasure... and mayhem quickly ensues.<br/><br/>The subtitle of the game is &quot;A Light Hearted Game of Homicide for the Less Discerning Gamer,&quot; and most of the mechanics revolve around fighting and killing. The referee is needed to adjudicate the hidden movement which is most prominent in the early phases of the game.

Each player takes a pawn of his prefered color and places it on Paris. Each one then draws a destination card that he keeps secret. On each turn the player moves his pawn with the die and upon arriving in another city he has to answer a question that earns him a colored token; if he answers this correctly he may advance again, otherwise he passes. When a player has tokens of four different colors he has to race to his destination city. The player who reaches his destination first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a board where the players move their pawns and six 18 piece puzzles (that form a tennis racket), one puzzle for each player. When the player's pawn lands on a space with the same color they can take a puzzle piece from the stock. If they land on a different color they have to take a trivia card and if they answer the question correctly they may also take a puzzle piece. When they land with their pawn on an exchange space they have to exchange one of their puzzle pieces with an opponents piece. The player who finishes his puzzle first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

After months of fighting, the Unions 15th  Combined Army commanded by Marshall Jean Baptiste, managed to break the Morphean siege lines among the hills and mountains of the sprawling Blade River valley.<br/><br/>The Blade River valley ran for hundreds of miles, and at dozens of locations throughout it, fierce battles took place for possession of key locations.  Bridges, power-plants, military training bases, and transportation docks were its lifeblood and the focal point of the fighting.  The 15th CA was reinforced by Union shock troops and mechs, enabling them to push the Morpheans back and eventually out of the valley area.  Mustering it's reserve units, the Morpheans responded in force, not willing to concede defeat to the inferior humans.  Wave upon wave of Morphean aero-fighters and bombers swept up the river valley in a final attempt to re-secure their dominance.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Bomber Run on Blade River is a 1-8 player game where the player or players take on the role of the skeletal Morphean robots with their aero-fighters and bombers, or the defending Union force with their missile equipped infantry squads, armored walkers, anti-aero guns and counter-fighters.<br/><br/>Attack on Blade River Valley is a free PnP consisting of a 9 page rulebook, 4 map pages (when all are combined), and a sheet of unit counters.  In addition, the player will need about 6-8 d6.<br/><br/>The game was designed to be played at work station or table, depending on how many of the map pieces the player/s wish to use.  When all the map pieces are placed together they cover an area the size of 4 sheets of 8.5x11 paper.  The simplest form of the game uses just one sheet (To be added shortly).<br/><br/>",

All players can move all pawns. The choice of pawn and direction is limited by two coloured dice. After rolling them, you have to move a pawn of one's colour along a line of the other's colour.<br/>    Sekundus Ludus. You roll dice to move along a path. Depending on the field you reach, you either gain or lose sticks. If you reach the finish with insufficient sticks, you have to do another round.<br/>    Tertius Ludus. An easy roll-and-move game, in which you have to get around the board with 3 of your 4 pawns. Similar to Pachisi, you may return other pawns to the start, too. The mechanic that makes the game special is the unlimited number of rolls you can make each turn. If you choose to roll another die, you can add the new score to your movement rate, but if you have bad luck, you lose everything and can't move this turn.<br/>     Quartus Ludus. A card game based on the Rock-Paper-Scissors mechanic. A joker beats rock, paper, and scissors. Every time you lose to another card, your pawn is advanced. The one who reaches the end fist, loses the game.<br/><br/><br/>",

The first player turns over two cards. If one card is a vocabulary word that correctly fits into a sentence of the other card (for example sun and When it's hot, the _____ shines in the sky), the player gets to keep both cards and continue with his/her turn until he/she doesn't find a matching pair. If the cards do not match, the player must turn the cards face down again and the next player takes a turn. The rest of the players continue the game in the same manner.<br/>The game is played until all the cards have been matched and there are no remaining cards. The winner is the person with the most cards at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>32 cards<br/>Sixteen of the cards will contain a single vocabulary word.

Romantic Sensations is a card game that combines and reinforces our senses of touch, taste, scent, sound, and sight to create a wonderful romantic experience.<br/><br/>To start, players read the list of prizes--romantic, sensuous activities to be enjoyed together. The cards are shuffled and dealt. Players then take turns picking a card from the deck, reading it aloud, and responding. Some cards ask for verbal responses, positive and supportive. Others suggest gentle touching, some playful, some subtle and ambiguous. When like cards are matched, they are placed down. The first player to match the required number of cards wins.<br/><br/>Note: the game box includes two small bottles of lotion (&quot;sensuous massage lotion&quot; and &quot;bath gel&quot;) in addition to the question card deck.<br/><br/>",

The start player draws a Seller card to see what they have to sell and the selling price for the item and then a Spectator card to see if they draw a person willing to buy whats for sale. If they get that combination of an item and a willing seller the player takes the amount of money shown on the Sellers card out of the 'bank'. Some cards show 'no sale' There are also two 'pretty girl' cards, one will buy and one will sell. There is also a 'constable card' which if drawn, the player drawing the card is immediately arrested and so losses his/her turn.

The game is played in two phases. In the first players alternate placing two pieces at a time with their color showing; any squares may be occupied except the center. In the second phase players alternate moving one piece into the empty square.<br/><br/>A capture is made by sandwiching a single opposing piece between two of one's own. The captured piece is turned over. If at least one capture is made the moving piece may be moved back to the space it came from if that will result in additional captures.<br/><br/>There are two different versions of the game, depending on which rule one uses for the case where a player cannot move because they have no pieces adjacent to the empty space. In version one the player may take any of their pieces and place it in the empty space, but even if they capture they cannot then move it to its original space. In version two the player may turn over a piece adjacent to the empty square; in this case if captures are made the piece may be moved into the empty square if it can make further captures.<br/><br/>In either version the game ends when a player loses by having fewer than five pieces.<br/><br/>The game may also be played by three players using cubes with three colors on them; each player starts with eight of these.<br/><br/>",

A player has ten seconds to study a card that shows players past and present in action and is then asked a question about the card, chosen by the roll of a die. If the card is answered correctly the card is kept, if not it is returned to the box. The most cards held after ten minutes decides the winner. Cards are real photos of players, with extra information like how many caps the player has, the year of their International debut and what shirt number they wear. Hard core fans can put their knowledge to the test--especially if their powers of observation let them down. The game is presented in a smart cube box and is a perfect gift for Man U fans who already have everything.<br/><br/>",

Just like the movies, there's a bunch of wires and you don't know which one to cut.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, one wire is removed from the deck and is the solution to the final puzzle.  During a turn, players play Stress cards on each other trying their nerves and each round the player with the least amount of stress gets to see the remaining Wire's dealt that round and has an opportunity to guess.  If no one guesses correctly after the third time through the deck, everyone loses as the bomb explodes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Triablo is a strategy game of capture with special interlocking pieces, for two or three players.<br/><br/>Two players, White and Red, each have 10 pieces, called singletons, of their color which can move in any of the three directions they point to, any number of empty spaces. The singletons are triangular and can interlock with/capture enemy singletons at which point they form a doublet.<br/><br/>A doublet can move any number of empty spaces in any direction, but can only be moved by the owner of the covering piece.<br/><br/>A king is presented as 2 interlocking singletons of the same color and can move 1 space in any direction. Instead of moving, the king may abdicate his crown (covering piece) to another same-coloured singleton any number of empty spaces away in any direction.<br/><br/>An enemy piece is vulnerable to capture if three or more tips of the attacker's colour point towards it in unobstructed line of sight; one of these pieces must make the capture. Singletons can only capture enemy singletons, which they cover to form a doublet. Doublets and kings can capture any enemy piece by replacement to remove them from the board.<br/><br/>A player loses if their king is captured, cannot move or abdicate, or if there are less than three pieces under their control.<br/><br/>There is also a three player variation.<br/><br/>",

It has scope for role playing, planning and playing with matchstick cannons and toy soldiers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;To work best it needs around 10 people ideally in a club setting (ie. A hall and several tables), though it will work with less, down to two players and one table (if you just play the battle game part).&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The players are divided into teams of 2. There are enough briefings for six teams, though it is easy to ad teams. Ideally you need an even number of teams, but that isn&rsquo;t essential.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game is played in three distinct phases: 1. The Arms Exhibition - buying the weapons for the next war. 2. Evaluation and Doctrine - testing the new weapons and deciding how they will be used. 3. Battle - the acid test of both equipment and doctrine.&quot;<br/><br/>The Battle phase consists of each team matching a force of miniature infantry figures against another team's matchstick-firing model cannon. The cannons are acquired by the team's by way of an auction held during the Arms Exhibition phase. A team's model cannon must be operated in accordance with the doctrine drafted by the team during the Evaluation and Doctrine phase of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a remake of &quot;The Euro Game&quot; shopping and sums by MAJORA.<br/>For children from age 7 and up, the game teaches them how to deal with money and especially how to manage it. They&rsquo;ll learn how to do a number of every day errands such as shopping, going to the bank, recycling, using a cash machine and crossing the street safely so they travel between the various places. The game is meant to be both educational and fun, so children can learn and grow, by doing things that usually belong to the domain of adults.<br/><br/>From the author: &quot;Designing this game was a totally different challenge from inventing my other games. Actually, the game was meant to be a remake but when I started working on it, I made so many changes the game became a completely new one!<br/>I tried to preserve the simplicity of the original game and keep the bills and coins the center of attention. New features were introduced, such as recycling and crossing the street safely. I hope this game is a source of fun and learning for all children and their parents. Have fun!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hell on Wheels: Platoon Level Tank Tactics Game.<br/><br/>From the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;The purpose of the game is to simulate the tactics and command and control problems facing individual tank troop/platoon commanders. Of necessity, such a game cannot expect to cover fully all aspects of tank combat at this level, and therefore I have chosen to gloss over the detail of the tank gun Vs armour battle, in favour of a more detailed communications and reactions system. Everything is very simple, but it is very difficult to do the simplest things.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game requires a minimum of two participants, Control and Player. The Control determines a fixed (or semi-fixed) defence for the player to fight through. Since such actions are likely to be fast and furious, there is often plenty of opportunity for Player and Control to swap roles. The Player is the commander of a single tank troop/platoon of whatever type the scenario dictates. These rules are written with the European campaign, 1944 in mind, but the structure can be applied to almost any tank engagement, with some small modifications.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;With more players, there is scope for larger games of up to squadron level, preferably with different units with their own terrain model. The back-to-back, two sided game<br/>is also possible, but not recommended, since the detail necessary for correct interaction slows the game down considerably, and in my tests, the presence of a 'live' enemy made absolutely no difference to the players. It is recommended that when playing the higher level games, the ratio of 1:1 Player to Control is maintained if possible.&quot;<br/><br/>The game can be played with 1/300, 1/200, or 1/76 scale tanks. Each turn represents about 20-40 seconds. Each player represents one platoon/troop commander.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stock ~ Split is an economic game designed to teach players about the stock market. The game board has a slider to keep track of stock prices, allowing for variability between plays. Players move about the board by rolling dice, but different places offer different movement, depending on what was rolled (an even or odd for example.) Players buy and sell stock as the game progresses - there is no credit allowed in the game so if a player runs out of money then he or she is eliminated. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to eliminate your opponents' warriors by strategically attacking them with your men. To accomplish this, you must engage the services of the neutral team (also called the Robot Team). Beware! Because your opponent gains control of the neutral robots on his turn. Both opponents move toward the center power source. Here they many choose to regenerate their forces or decide upon a strategic super attack. Look out! The unseen move can propel you or destroy you. Never give up... comebacks are always possible. Maybe you will be the next TRILOGY master.&quot;<br/><br/>Each player gets a team of six markers, and there is a third &quot;team,&quot; that is the neutral robot. Each turn, players can move one of their pieces and one of the robot pieces. Pieces can move or jump other pieces. Jumping an opponents' piece or a robot piece eliminates that piece. Moving to the center dot on the board allows a player to generate another piece or take an extra turn.

        "description": "From the box:<br/><br/>&quot;The makers of Trilogy now bring you an exciting NEW card game of skill, luck, strategy, and memory.<br/><br/>Reveal 4 is a fast moving battle of memories in which individuals or teams match mind power to see who can be the first to &quot;Reveal 4.&quot; Watch out! Just when you think you are about to win,  your opponent can cunningly pull the rug out from under you. Rules are included for the basic game and advanced games.&quot;<br/><br/>Published by Ellis and Frazier Games<br/><br/>In Reveal 4, two teams of partners are dealt four cards each. First the cards are dealt face up, and then are turned over for no one to see. Players then take turns drawing from the &quot;Trade&quot; pile, which allows them to turn over cards and trade them with other players' cards, as well as mix up theirs or someone else's hand, or trade with the draw pile. When a player thinks (s)he has a complete set of four cards, the player announces it and turns their cards over. If the cards are four of a kind, the player gets a new hand. Otherwise, they lose their next turn. The first team to successfully reveal two complete sets wins.<br/><br/>",

Fans of the Whack-A-Mole carnival game found on Jersey Shore boardwalks will be familiar with this game's manic bonking action. As each of the skunk heads on the playing field light up you have to ding them with the padded Plunk-A-Skunk mallet to score points. Bang away and skunks taunt and praise you with phrases like &quot;Time is running out&quot; and &quot;You're awesome.&quot;<br/><br/>Electronic game, home variant of the popular arcade/funfair game where small creatures (usually crocodiles or gophers) pop in and out of holes in the board, and the players score points by hitting (&quot;plunking&quot;) them with inflatable mallets. This variant uses skunk faces that randomly light up; the player scores points by hitting a skunk face when it is illuminated.<br/><br/>Mildly amusing fun, with limited replay value, and fresh batteries are a must.<br/><br/>",

The magnets of each team are polarised in reverse, so you cannot affect your opponents players with your rod. The rod is used to drag your players across the board, thus allowing you to push the puck around.<br/><br/>The game board is a smooth hardboard surface, marked out with an ice hockey pitch, and a basic raised surround to stop the puck going out of play.<br/><br/>Good fun - lots frantic action!<br/><br/>",

Each force is commanded by one or two Heroes, and features a number of Troopers and/or Vehicles. In the advanced game mode, players can select armoury cards to provide their units or their whole force with unique abilities.<br/><br/>Crystal Core features simulated parallel play through the use of command cards, which are selected simultaneously by each player, and define what actions are available for that round. Players must devise a plan for each round, and execute it with a focus on army-cohesion and maneuvering for prime position to achieve victory.<br/><br/>The game also provides a superior wargaming experience by eliminating several of the upkeep actions associated with wargames, including model-per-model movement, excessive dice rolls, and army wide actions, thereby providing maximum entertainment in a modest timeframe.<br/><br/>",

Foregoing the more traditional board games which sell for five and ten dollars and more, we would take our pencil and paper and a pair of dice and develop a game of our own.  This way, we could make the game suit whatever mood we were in.  Being avid sports fans like yourself, we often developed different sports games that we could use to capture the excitement of real sports.  So over the years we gradually accumulated the rules for dice games in nearly every popular sport.&quot;<br/><br/>Includes the following games:<br/><br/>     Dice Baseball<br/>     Dice Football<br/>     Dice Basketball by Players<br/>     Dice Hockey<br/>     Dice Basketball - Scholastic Quarters<br/>     Dice Soccer<br/>     Dice Baseball - Team Play<br/>     Dice Basketball - Professional<br/>     Dice Bowling<br/>     Dice Wrestling<br/><br/><br/>",

It initiates youngsters to board games and develops concentration and dexterity.<br/>Insecto is an ideal travel game with 2 interesting ways to play:<br/><br/>BUZZY BUZZY BEEZ<br/><br/>Bees go from flower to flower all day long in search of the precious nectar.  At the end of the day, it is a race to return to the nest.  Which bee will be the first to enter the nest?<br/><br/>Each player advances his bee the number of flowers indicated by the number on the die.  Every time a bee stops on a flower where the tail end of a caterpillar is found, this bee must slide down to the flower where the head of the caterpillar is found. Every time a bee stops on a flower where a butterfly is found, this bee must follow the butterflies to the other flower.  But take care to the spider webs or your bee will skip a turn!  The first bee to enter the nest wins the game.<br/><br/>VEGGIE LAND<br/><br/>Ladybugs are very useful in a vegetable garden as they feed on harmful insects.  VEGGIE LAND is a simple game that is captivating, yet easy to play for kids 3 years of age and up.  It does not require any reading or counting skills.<br/><br/>On his turn, each player rolls the die and moves forward to the next vegetable illustrated on the die.  On certain vegetables, there is a spider!  If a player stops on a vegetable with a spider, he must skip a turn.  But if a player stops on a vegetable with a ladybug, he plays again!  Then, a few vegetables come in pair.  If a player stops on pair of vegetables, he moves forward to the next single similar vegetable.  The first ladybug (player) to reach the vegetable cart wins the game.<br/><br/>",

If the batter misses the ball, the pitch can be a strike if it stops in front of a small rise in the pitching track.

It demonstrates the importance of the Lean production, in other words, it shows the concept of producing in a Lean way. This concept was originated with the Toyota Production System and aims at increasing the speed of the processes, eliminating waste and reducing costs.<br/><br/>In the game, the players are presidents of companies which need to produce their products and sell them to the clients. These clients, however, only buy from companies that offer the lower prices. To offer competitive prices, they will have to improve their factories, which present limited production capacity and serious quality problems. The secret is to produce faster, better and with a lower cost. The person who achieves the greater total income is the winner.<br/><br/>Manufactura may be played by all employees who are part of the productive area of a company, or by those who are just curious about its operational system. With this game, they will all learn and know the Lean culture and its advantages and benefits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Climate Game is a game which when played with strategy, negotiation and diplomacy, challenges its players to save the world from imminent destruction. With everyone&rsquo;s effort and awareness, the emission of carbonic gas can be reduced before it is too late.<br/><br/>This game is both one of competition and of cooperation. It promotes competition because the player who emits no carbonic gas at all is the winner. But, integrated work of all the other participants is essential in order not to exceed the gas limits of the greenhouse effect that the planet can put up with. If this limit is exceeded, the Earth&rsquo;s temperature will have risen to a level where human life is not possible and everyone dies/loses.<br/><br/>Therefore, participants must have a good degree of knowledge regarding gas emission and the greenhouse effect and also be very good at negotiating and formulating strategies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This newspaper-themed board game was based on 1931 movie &quot;Five Star Final&quot;. The game includes a large (30&quot; x 17&quot;) and heavy board, five player tokens, 40 Service Tokens, a deck of yellow Assignment Cards, and a deck of white News Cards.<br/><br/>Players take Assignment Cards from the Editor that show events underway around the board. They then choose how to travel there: by foot, bus, elevated, taxi or subway. By foot is slowest but reaches everywhere; subway is fastest but can mean an additional walk to many locations.<br/><br/>To complete an assignment, reporters first must arrive on the spot by exact roll of either two dice or one of the two. If they fail to land on the space two turns in a row, they have missed the story and must head back to the office. However, if they stroll back, they get a chance to draw an Assignment card on any other Assignment location on which they land, getting partial or full credit for that story instead.<br/><br/>Players who do land on their Assignment locations must then try to draw a News Card that matches their assignments, drawing twice a turn until they do. When they do draw the right match, they normally get one Service Token, but none if sent to Rewrite, and two if labelled Front Page. Then they head back to get another assignment. First player to get five Service Tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

No artistic talent required . . . just your imagination!<br/><br/>It all starts with a roll of the dot cube and then the dots are connected by random lines using the connect cube. Once everyone has their unique squiggly line in front of them, play begins. Players have 60 seconds to transform their wavy and wacky line into a picture. They can be as simple or detailed as they want. When time is up, each player explains their drawing to the other players. This is where you may fall over laughing as you listen to some real nonsense! Once each player has had chance to explain what they drew, voting begins. Each player votes on only one other players drawing using a voting card.<br/><br/>The voting cards offer either a descriptive praise or a nuance of criticism such as &quot;put that in a doggie bag&quot; or &quot;a monkey can do better&quot;. Each card also has a point value and players give them to each other based on their picture and description. It&rsquo;s hysterical!<br/><br/>SQUIGGLE Connect recently won a National Parenting Publications Gold Award!<br/><br/>(from manufacturer's website)<br/><br/>",

He invented a game that only the cleverest would win and confronted the dragon with a deal: freedom of the village if der Mueller won, or enslavement of der Mueller if Gruenaugen won. Gruenaugen, feeling he was superior, naturally accepted.<br/><br/>Der Mueller facest the hardest test of his life but overwhelmed the dragon with his strategy and won. Der Mueller returned to the village a hero. Gruenaugen was never seen again.<br/><br/>A strategy game for two players. The object of the game is to capture 5 of your opponent's gems.

It is based on the chinese three monkeys of wisdom.<br/><br/>One player is blind but knows all (with 3 cards) and must tell the mute player how to mime the phrase to the deaf, without saying to the mute what he is miming, but HOW to do it, and the blind cannot see if the mute mime it correctly.<br/><br/>The deaf players (having iPods or similar things) don't hear what the blind is saying, so they must try to understand the blind's message according to the mute's mimes. If a blind player hears a correct element, he indicates the mute a deaf got a good answer and points are scored.<br/><br/>",

Every card represents an specific action (jab, hook to the body, duck, clinch, etc) that can be linked to another action (jab-cross-left hook...) or countered by specific actions. The round lenght is commanded by the number of cards left in the pile. The match ends when one of the boxer's stamina reach zero (you lose one stamina point for every  punch you get), or by instant KO (one KO punch) or TKO (three knockdowns in a single round).<br/>There are 8 diferent types of punch, 4 dodge moves + 2 cancel moves making a total of 14!!! possible actions per boxer.

        "description": "Chariot Arena is a Grim Trojan board game based on the chariot races of Roman times and the first of Grim Trojan&rsquo;s Downloadable Board Games.<br/><br/>To keep the game fun for different levels and ages of players, optional rules have been created (the alternate rules follow the official rules).<br/><br/>This board game is very loosely based on historical records about chariot races. With that said, never forget the game is a board game and as such has been modified to keep game play fun. The arena is based (again, loosely) on Rome&rsquo;s largest and oldest circus, Circus Maximus (called a circus because of the oval shape).<br/><br/>Attacks are allowed to simulate the whipping and bumping that occurred in a chariot race and the curves are more dangerous in the board game because they were in the real races.<br/><br/>Chariot Arena has two different playing boards to allow for better game play. The larger board comprised of four pages<br/>with smaller hexes was designed for a larger group of players and for those who enjoy longer more detailed game play. The<br/>smaller board comprised of two pages with larger hexes is designed to allow a smaller number of players to have more<br/>interaction in few laps and its charts are less complicated. Try both and play the one that best suits your style of play.<br/><br/>As each player takes their turn, they must first move their pawn 6 hexes. They then have the option to stay where they are or roll 2d6 (two six sided dice) and moving their pawn across the board one hex at a time the number of hexes shown on the dice. Movement can be forward left, forward right or forward. Moving a pawn backward on the track is not permitted. Only one<br/>pawn can occupy a hex at a time. If a pawn is in your way, you must move around it. The player also has the option to move<br/>the pawn less hexes than indicated on the dice (example: a player rolling 10 can move only 7 hexes if they wish). If a pawn&rsquo;s path is blocked by other pawns and it is impossible to move forward while moving the base 6 hexes, the player must choose which pawn to stop behind. The player and the owner of the other pawn must both roll from the Accident Chart.<br/><br/>",

Each set of adjacent 4 squares is grouped into a quadrant, and labeled from A to Y, starting from the top, left hand side quadrant. Each square in a quadrant is numbered from 1 to 4, starting from the top, left hand side square.<br/><br/>One player is allocated the 6 quadrant in the top-left hand side of the board as his home sector, and the other takes the 6 quadrant in the bottom-right hand side of the board as his. The remaining 13 quadrants form the neutral sector. The corner quadrants in each player's home sector are their respective home quadrants.<br/><br/>Each player receives 45 points to create stars in the galaxy.<br/><br/>Quadrat Z is very much a game of cat-and-mouse. As in many wars, you have some idea of an opponent's strength and general location, but very little about the exact composition and location of his forces. Hence, the value of intelligence gathering should not be underrated.<br/><br/>Strategy will vary from game to game, but a major focus should be on the capture of stars: without them your forces will not grow, and , in the long run their lack will certainly cause you to lose. Think carefully about the initial layout of stars, and place your ships to capture the maximum number of points as soon as possible. Try and maintain a balanced force of ship sizes. Movement is hidden, and fairly rapid shifts of forces from one quadrant to another are possible. Remember that in combat the aim is to have the largest combined force - not necessarily a single, high value ship. A single, large strike ship may penetrate enemy lines and take out the opponent's home base... but if he sees it coming he may have time to regroup and knock it out. Spreading your ships out too thinly in a quadrant could also be problematic in combat.<br/><br/>",
