        "description": "A gateway naval strategy game with no reinforcements on the way. Players take the helm of a fleet they construct at the beginning of the game to sail around the map, seize islands, and loose cannons on the enemy. First to control 6 islands or be the last ship sailing is claimed to be the newest Old Salt and is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Players can opt to play with or without faction abilities but will construct a fleet in a draft selection at the start of the game. There are 5 ship types players can choose from with limited coins to purchase ships with. On a player's turn, they have the option to sail, fire cannons, seize islands, and if playing with faction abilities will have access to 3 more unique abilities. Players can do these actions in any order as long as they don't exceed maximum sail distance (3 tiles unless sailing over tradewinds), don't fire more times than their ship's health points and have the gold to pay for what they want to do.<br/><br/>Players are allowed to sail up to three ships on their turn a distance of 3 tiles unless assisted by a known trade wind that grants a bonus of 2 tiles of movement. Position your ships carefully as the broadside of a ship and stern/bow impact game play and firing options on and off turn.<br/><br/>Players fire at the enemy by counting the tiles to the enemy ship and rolling that amount or more. On the die is a blank side which if rolled, results in an automatic miss. Cannons aren't perfect weapons so sometimes it's best to use faction abilities to finish off an enemy ship. When a player destroys a ship, they will take the mast off the ship they destroyed and use it in a future transaction to seize an island or turn in at the top of their turn for a bounty reward.<br/><br/>In order to seize an island, a players ship must be adjacent to the island in question. The transfer of ownership costs 2 gold plus 1 gold for each enemy ship that occupies that island within the area (two tiles of the island). The player must also turn in a mast belonging to the island's current faction owner. If all costs are met and paid for, the transfer of ownership is immediate and the first to 6 islands is pronounced the Old Salt and the winner of the battle.<br/><br/>The faction abilities add a new level of replayability and strategy to the game as each faction has 3 abilities that are unique to them and their theme. Players can construct their fleet to offset a particular weakness of the faction or to enhance a strength of theirs. New players are encouraged to play their first 3 rounds without factions in order to gauge their comfortability before adding in the additional abilities and layer of depth this game can reach while still being excellent for those unfamiliar with the wargaming genre.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Commies! is a semi-cooperative 4-7 player card game in which each player controls a faction in the government and your ultimate goal is to amass enough supporters to seize power and all the riches that come with it. To do this, you must either form a coalition with 1-2 other players to stomp out the traitors, or you can scheme against everyone and seize power in the vacuum.<br/><br/>Each plot features five rounds, and during each round a faction plays one card face down, usually a power card featuring boots for Bolsheviks or fists for Mensheviks. One card is swept away into the State Secrets folder to be revealed at the end of the plot and the remaining cards are simultaneously revealed. After five rounds are completed, the State Secrets folder is opened and all cards are resolved. If boots outnumber fists, the Bolsheviks win the plot. If fists outnumber boots, then the Mensheviks win the plot. The losers forfeit their supporters to the corresponding winners in the tableau and another plot begins.<br/><br/>During the rounds, players may choose to play a leader card at any time to promote a player from the Mensheviks to the Bolsheviks. You can play a leader from your faction to increase your chances of being in the winning coalition, or you can play a leader from another faction giving players the chance to ruin the counter-revolutionary plots of their friends.<br/><br/>Commies! Will the Party Ever End?<br/><br/>",

Every year, the King evaluates the competition and makes one new wish, if one of the players' employees can realize it, good for them, the King gets pleased and let them work fine. If one employee do not make a task he was demanded for, someone might go to jail.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the King will designate a successor to the throne, according to his own values (in the beginning of the game, players decide what kind of king they want to play with, choosing among five possibilities: there is one neutral, one that gives more value to religion, one to military, one to commerce and one to politics).<br/><br/>At the end, the player with more victory points is proclaimed the new Glorious King. The other players also get a job close to the king, being the Jester, the Horse Keeper and the Eunuch.<br/><br/>",

It is something else to actually be in the position of making the hard decisions yourself, which this game enables us all to do.<br/>-- Jim Craft, SES, formerly with HQ USMC<br/><br/>In this game, you command MAG-23 during its seven-and-a-half-week long deployment on the island of Guadalcanal. You begin with two squadrons &ndash; Marine Fighter Squadron 223 (VMF-223) and Scout Bombing Squadron 232 (VMSB-232). Ahead is a trial by fire. You will face the highly maneuverable Japanese A6M Zero fighter, G4M Betty bombers, D3A Val dive bombers, and B5N Kate torpedo bombers &ndash; and other aircraft.<br/><br/>During your time on Guadalcanal, you manage your forces from Henderson Field. You will be reinforced by pilots and planes from the US Army Air Forces and US Navy. Your main advantages are the ruggedness of the Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat, the Australian Coastwatchers, a primitive radar early warning system, and &ndash; above all &ndash; the determination and unwavering fighting spirit of your Marines.<br/><br/>&quot;Guadalcanal was the only place on earth where you could stand up to your knees in mud and still get dust in your eyes.&quot;<br/>-- Capt. Marion Carl, USMC, Guadalcanal Ace<br/><br/>You will face the jungle, nightly bombardments by Japanese naval ships, infantry reinforced by the &ldquo;Tokyo Express&rdquo;, dysentery, dengue fever, and malaria. Japanese artillery will regularly shell your airfield, sometimes hitting your planes, fuel stores, runways, and bivouac.<br/><br/>Your hold on Guadalcanal is tenuous. The Marines have a perimeter of a few hundred meters around the airfield. You are frequently under fire. The runway is pitted from shelling, making every take-off and landing a risk. Your pilots must drive the enemy back from the perimeter. If they fail, Japanese infantry will overwhelm the Marines and storm the airfield.<br/><br/>The survival of the Marines on Guadalcanal depends on your planes and pilots. You must intercept Japanese raids, strike at enemy ground targets, and bomb and strafe enemy ships. You will face the cream Japanese aviation, including some legendary aces like Junichi Sasai, Toshio Ōta, Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, and others.<br/><br/>Your deployment on Guadalcanal begins when you land on the newly opened Henderson Field on Thursday, 20 August 1942. You fly your first mission the next day. It ends when MAG-23 hands off its mission to the next Marine Air Group and departs for Esp&iacute;ritu Santo on Monday, 12 October 1942.<br/><br/>Your pilots will wage battles over land, in the air, and at sea to protect Henderson Field, the focus of both sides in the conflict. It will be tough. So many US Navy and Japanese ships will be sunk off the northern shores of Guadalcanal that the waters will come to be called &ldquo;Ironbottom Sound&rdquo;.<br/><br/>MAG-23 Guadalcanal is engaging, fast-playing, fun, and easy to learn. Most missions can be completed in less than fifteen to twenty minutes. This game is not a simulation of air-to-air combat between individual fighter planes, nor is it intended to be a realistic depiction of the air war; it is an entertaining and educational air war game that allows you to experience the conflict on Guadalcanal &ndash; as if you were there.<br/><br/>This game is for both experienced and novice war gamers alike. Though dice play a role, the outcomes depend on you. How many of your pilots will make it through to the end? How many will become aces? Will you defeat the Japanese and keep Guadalcanal in American hands? Or will you fail and see Henderson Field overrun by Japanese infantry?<br/><br/>Available in every Amazon site worldwide -- some popular links:<br/>US: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MAG-23-Guadalcanal-Solitaire-Historic-Wings/dp/B0BTYQ8X2G/?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/MAG-23-Guadalcanal-Solitaire-Historic...</a><br/>UK: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/MAG-23-Guadalcanal-Solitaire-Historic-Wings/dp/B0BTYQ8X2G/?tag=article-geekdo-21\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/MAG-23-Guadalcanal-Solitaire-Histor...</a><br/><br/>THE LOGBOOK, a companion add-on (optional) game aid, is live:<br/>US: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.amazon.com/The-Logbook-MAG-23-Guadalcanal/dp/B0BW385D5L?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/The-Logbook-MAG-23-Guadalcanal/dp/B0B...</a><br/>UK: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BW385D5L?tag=article-geekdo-21\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0BW385D5L?tag=article-geekdo-21</a><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is a hex and counter game with various optional rules and conflict models.<br/><br/>A novelty that sets this game apart is the inclusion of an optional Card Driven Mechanism that ensures that one game is never like the other.<br/><br/>The Scenario pack 1 introduces 7 &quot;case study&quot; files: each comes with its own setup, map and counters. They are mostly proxy wars fought during the Cold War or other lesser known or explored conflicts like Indo-Pakistani war and a hypothetical campaign about a Soviet amphibious assault on a Turkish coastal town in the Black Sea during the 70s.<br/><br/>The Unit Database has over 240 units from all over the world. There is quite a bunch of ready to print counters and maps but you can easily add more using the home printer friendly scenario packs or counter pack.<br/><br/>",

At this game each player represents a nurse at a job center, and one day they are called to start a work at the hospital on a random medical field, where they have to fulfill tasks.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game each player is given a secret Identity Card (each of them related to a different field where you can work at, and each of them of different colour).<br/><br/>A deck is then formed with all the other cards (Task, Situation, Character and Item cards) shuffled. Each turn the player on turn has to draw a new card from the deck, add it to his hand (unless it's a Situation card, in which case it's resolved inmediately. Usually it's an event which changes something on the game, like shuffling all Identity cards of the players and re-dealing at random), and finally has to play or discard one card from it's hand.<br/><br/><br/>     Task cards can only be played (face down near the Identity card of that player) if it's a task of that type of work (it's of the same colour). If the card doesn't match your Identity card colour it has to be discarded.<br/>     Characters and Items are played to make it's special action.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to have 5 Task cards of it's colour wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each state shows how many electoral votes it is worth, how many phases must be spent to capture it and which demographics it represents.<br/><br/>The game turn begins with each player plotting their campaigns. When all the players have recorded their moves, the players campaign simultaneously.  The campaign round consists of twenty-two phases. Players who have plotted identical campaigns in a state cancel each other.<br/><br/>After the third campaign phase and at the end of every campaign phase thereafter, each of the ten demographics catagories are calculated. Players who have the majority of the available electoral votes receive six extra phases to campaign in the states represented by the demographic won.<br/><br/>The game continues until forty electoral votes have been locked in as uncontested victories by all the players or until a target number of game turns have been played. Players total electoral votes won and the player who has 270 is the winner. If no one has 270, the last place finisher is eliminated and that player's electoral votes are doled out to whoever finished second in those states. This process is repeated until someone has enough to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Players assume the role of a villager, with unique scores in Strength, Agility, Intellect and Presence. Players collect XP by defeating monsters, which they use to purchase new skills and attack cards to add to their deck. Over the course of the game, each player's character becomes more and more powerful with a unique combination of skills and attacks at their disposal. Once enough XP is earned, each player's villager will become a hero, gaining increased attributes, more health, and a unique special ability.<br/><br/>Can you overcome all obstacles to make a hero capable of stopping the monster horde?<br/><br/>Even though Heroes of Darkwell plays like a cooperative game, it is, at it's core, a competition, as the player with the most XP from their monster pile wins the game and receives the title &quot;The Hero of Darkwell&quot;.<br/><br/>",

On November 29th, 1807, Queen Mary the Mad, prince John VI, and the whole Portuguese crown fled to Brazil and continued their rule remotely. Their decision to move the Brazilian capital from Bahia to Rio de Janeiro created conflicting alliances among the families in Bahia. Should they be loyal to the crown and the new capital of Rio de Janeiro, or be allied to the former capital of Bahia when exporting their goods?

Technically neutral during WWII, Sweden still offered her assistance in the wider defense of her Nordic neighbors through the formation of Frivilligk&aring;ren (the Volunteer Corps). Though this corps was demobilized in 1940, Swedish volunteers continued to see action during the German invasion of Norway and later during the Continuation War allied with Finland and Germany against the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>The 16 scenarios in Action Pack #15: Swedish Volunteers include all 14 from the original release, which have been updated using official layout and terminology, and in some cases updated for balance, as well as two additional scenarios, one previously published by Friendly Fire and one brand-new scenario. These cover a variety of actions from the Swedish defense of M&auml;rk&auml;j&auml;rvi, Finland in 1940 during The Winter War to Swedes united with Norwegian and British forces in Norway during Operation WESER&Uuml;BUNG to battles against Soviet forces during the Continuation War of 1941-44.<br/><br/>Swedish Volunteers also features a half-sheet of new counters with Swedish personnel, support weapons, guns, and concealment counters in a new unique color, and six pages of rules containing Scenario Special Rules, designers notes, and the historical background of the force.<br/><br/>Action Pack #15: Swedish Volunteers contains:<br/>&bull; 120 1/2˝ counters and eight 5/8˝ counters<br/>&bull; Chapter Z rules (pages Z85-Z90)<br/>16 ASL scenarios:<br/>&bull; AP144 Ten-Ton Tank &ndash; 4.5 turns, 27 February 1940, M&auml;rk&auml;j&auml;rvi, Finland<br/>&bull; AP145 The Swedish Voluntary Corps &ndash; 5.5 turns, 2 March 1940, M&auml;rk&auml;j&auml;rvi, Finland<br/>&bull; AP146 Absolut M&auml;rk&auml;j&auml;rvi &ndash; 5.5 turns, 10 March 1940, M&auml;rk&auml;j&auml;rvi, Finland<br/>&bull; AP147 Frivilligkompani Benckert &ndash; 5.5 turns, 16 April 1940, Kongsvinger, Norway<br/>&bull; AP148 Beacon Of Hope &ndash; 5 turns, 30 April 1940, Selbu, Norway<br/>&bull; AP149 Lions And Tin Men &ndash; 4.5 turns, 2 May 1940, Os, Norway<br/>&bull; AP150 Norwegian Edelweiss &ndash; 6.5 turns, 17 May 1940, Stien, Norway<br/>&bull; AP151 Probing Korsus &ndash; 6.5 turns, 4 March 1942, Jandeba, Russia<br/>&bull; AP152 Through Mud And Blood &ndash; 8 turns, 18 April 1942, Shemenski, Russia<br/>&bull; AP153 Across The Rio Grande &ndash; 7 turns, 16 May 1942, Jandeba, Russia<br/>&bull; AP154 Mexico And Morocco &ndash; 5.5 turns, 25 May 1942, Jandeba, Russia<br/>&bull; AP155 Katyusha Variations &ndash; 5 turns, 21 June 1944, south of N&auml;&auml;t&auml;l&auml;, Finland<br/>&bull; AP156 Swede Revenge &ndash; 5 turns, 25 June 1944, Tali, Finland<br/>&bull; AP157 Trap By Mishap &ndash; 5.5 turns, 26 June 1944, Tali, Finland<br/>&bull; AP158 Rather Uncoordinated &ndash; 6 turns, 26 June 1944, Tali, Finland<br/>&bull; AP159 Day At Night &ndash; 5 turns, 28 June 1944, Tali, Finland<br/><br/>Designed for the aficionado, Action Pack #15: Swedish Volunteers is not a complete product and assumes the buyer owns the core Advanced Squad Leader game system.<br/><br/>",

This game emulates the features, behavior and even problems of real life classic cars. At the same time, it simulates the main features of real life road rallying, like road books, checkpoints, weather changes, hazards, service areas, assistance cars, overtaking other cars on the road, etc.<br/><br/>This is a strategy game with a great component of logistics, just like in a real life car rally. Fuel and tires management play a great part on this game. Properly understanding the road book and going the right way is crucial to succeed in this game, as it is in real life car rallying.<br/><br/>This game has an initial setup phase, where each player contributes to the construction of the board, by tile placing road segments - this makes every game play unique.<br/><br/>Each player manages 2 cars (one competition car and one assistance car), having to select the features of the competition car and what each car will carry. There are dice to influence weather conditions and car malfunctions. There are cards with car features (like sport suspension), car accessories (like fog lights) and consumables (like fuel). The cars are moved by using fuel cards, depending on its feature and accessory cards and influenced by the weather conditions and malfunctions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the designer:)<br/><br/>Triumph of Fascism: The Spanish Civil War 1936&ndash;1939 is a two-player a Card Driven Wargame: a board game integrating the political and military spheres of a historical conflict, with cards driving the action. Players assume the side of RED (Republican forces &ndash; the elected government) and BLUE (anti-Republican forces/ &rdquo;Nationalists&rdquo;/ Fascists / Francoists &ndash; those seeking to overthrow the elected government) in the Spanish Civil War (SCW). This epic conflict involved the toppling of a democratically elected government, its replacement by a totalitarian regime, significant foreign intervention, a major component in the march towards WWII and a struggle for control of Spain.<br/><br/>Each side begins enlisting its political &ldquo;camps&rdquo; (BLUE: Nationalist Army, Carlist, Falange and Army of Africa, RED: PCE, Republican Army, UGT, Anarchist, POUM, Cataluonia and the Northern Autonomous Governments ) to build their national armies and by gaining support from foreign powers (BLUE: Germany, Italy and Portugal, RED: Britain, France and Russia) to improve their resources to wage the conflict. Players will also decide their resource investment in force preparation: there is an &ldquo;untried columns&rdquo; mechanic very similar to one first utilized by Panzergruppe Guderian.<br/><br/>There are three phases to a game turn: Strategic, Action, and Logistics.<br/><br/>The Strategic Phase requires players to &ldquo;spend&rdquo; their Action Cards (think of ACs as currency) planning their turn, influencing political dynamics (enlisting support of &ldquo;camps&rdquo; and &ldquo;foreign powers&rdquo;), impacting the battle for hearts &amp; minds, pursuing alternative historical foreign policy paths and shaping the air and naval war. Additionally, players construct a Hearts &amp; Minds (H&amp;M) pool. The H&amp;M pool is supplemented during the turn by wide variety of actions and events (reflecting the vagaries of support for both sides); the more friendly H&amp;M blocks placed into the pool, the greater the chance of gaining dominant control of Spanish provinces.<br/><br/>During the Action Phase, players utilize their respective decks of Action Cards (ACs) to activate units for movement and combat, implement events (receive reinforcements, etc.), conduct a range of political operations, generate replacements or strategically redeploy units. And, in a twist from other games in the Paths of Glory genre, players must plan out their play of ACs in advance: players secretly specify the order of play of their ACs (&quot;the AC stack&quot;) and allocate one AC to &quot;the AC reserve&quot;. Limited air operations occur during the Action Phase.<br/><br/>During the Logistics Phase, players addresses attrition, rebuilding units, determining province control and other odds and ends. Province control is a function of controlling Provincial Presence Locations and the Provincial Capital and making a successful Province Allegiance Attempt (H&amp;M blocks have an important effect). One key H&amp;M dynamic is a random draw from the H&amp;M pool, placing those H&amp;M blocks on provinces and a variable ending to the phase; players are not quite sure &ldquo;when the music will end&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The campaign game is playable in about six to eight hours, while a shorter introductory scenario takes between two and four hours. The game is won by controlling key geographical locations (ex: dominant control of provinces and control of urban areas), which generates victory points.<br/><br/>Triumph of Fascism is somewhat of a sequel to Triumph of Chaos (ToC). Changes versus ToC include inclusion of: <br/>&bull; A less-abstracted air and naval components<br/>&bull; A significant hearts &amp; minds mechanic <br/>&bull; More of an emphasis on the buildup to the conflict<br/>&bull; A foreign policy track; allowing for a wider range of outcomes the conflict could take<br/><br/>Both games utilize the Paths of Glory game engine, supplemented by a significant political &ldquo;game&rdquo; component, which has its roots in Days of Decision and Persian Gulf: Battle for the Middle East.<br/><br/>Originally planned release date was Spring 2015.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>Following the collapse of the Russian Empire, Estonia declared its independence. To secure this new freedom, the Estonian Army fought a valiant defensive campaign against vastly superior forces on two fronts. With the help of its western allies, most notably Britain, Finland, Sweden, and Denmark, the brave Estonian Army rapidly built up its strength and experience while fighting furiously for every meter of ground. They successfully held off the Soviet Western Front offensive, as well as crushing the Estonian Red Army, the Red Latvian Riflemen, and multiple Baltic-German armies between 1918 and 1920. Their triumphant bid for freedom established the Republic of Estonia&rsquo;s sovereignty amid the quagmire of World War One&rsquo;s aftermath and the Russian Civil War. On Feb. 2, 1920, the Treaty of Tartu finalized their independence. The mouse roared, and the birds of prey fled.<br/><br/>The Mouse That Roared is a supplement for the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series, with 10 new scenarios portraying the key battles that enabled little Estonia to fend off the Russian giant and establish her independence from Russia for the first time since the Great Northern War in 1710. We also provide you with 165 new playing units depicting the Estonian military and Red Russians, Red Estonians, and Red Latvians from the Civil War period.  The Mouse That Roared is not a complete game: ownership of Infantry Attacks: August 1914 is necessary to provide the rules, charts, markers and game boards.<br/><br/>The Mouse That Roared is sold in two formats: printed with laser-cut counters, and via .pdf download.  For the latter, the playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a unique faction of robots with the objective to build a civilization while attacking and defending against other robot armies. It's a 3-4 hour, constantly evolving game of world domination that rewards aggressive gameplay and clever strategy.<br/><br/>Stunning comic book style artwork immerses you in this world of hack-and-slash robots. The art is showcased on the revolutionary new Command Card mechanic, which brings a level of strategy to the game that even new players can pick up only a few turns into their first game.<br/><br/>-STORY-<br/>The world of Kingdom Bots is set far into the future. Mankind has vanished, leaving behind only relics and rubble. Machines that were once built for menial service have developed self-awareness and evolved to become the new form of dominant life upon the earth.<br/><br/>Like-minded robots found new kingdoms. Diggers who now worship rocks. Maintenance droids who now assemble patchwork monstrosities and builders who can only see one blueprint for the design of new bots. The different ideologies fall into conflict. But instead of learning from the mistakes of the fallen empire that created them, the robots find themselves driven by the old programming. To build. To grow. No matter what&hellip; or who is in the way.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s left of the world is yours for the taking.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Autumn, 1739. Fierce economic competition between Britain and Spain has broken into open war: the War of Jenkin&rsquo;s Ear.<br/><br/>As His Britannic Majesty&rsquo;s naval commander-in-chief in the Caribbean, your duties have suddenly multiplied. Their Lordships at the Admiralty demand action. Parliament expects the speedy conquest of Spain&rsquo;s New World possessions &ndash; ALL of them &ndash;&nbsp;but is unwilling to supply men and ships. That would require the adoption of methods suitable only under a &lsquo;French Despotism&rsquo;. Before you utter them let it be known that your objections are unpatriotic and un-British. Meanwhile, the powerful Planters&rsquo; Lobby is insisting you make defending their islands your top priority, while the equally powerful Traders&lsquo; Lobby is demanding convoy protection and simultaneously accusing you of &lsquo;pressing&rsquo; merchant seamen into service aboard your ships.<br/> Or, can you honourably serve the great House of Bourbon, whose scions rule France and Spain? The English heretics have unjustly fabricated a war. They are jealous of Spain&rsquo;s greatness and desire her colonies for their own. For years they have paid lip service to the international laws of commerce while breaking those same laws at every opportunity. Of late, His Most Catholic Majesty had graciously agreed to accept arbitration for so-called &lsquo;wrongs&rsquo; done to British traders, waiving compensation for similar wrongs done to Spain. But when she offered payment, the English dogs slapped Spain&lsquo;s hand aside, saying it was not enough! This insult will not go unavenged. The King has ordered you to secure our trade routes and has issued letters of marque for the harrying of British merchantmen &ndash; let their own methods be used against them! In the fulness of time, our brother France has promised his support.<br/><br/>Control the seas and you control the fate of the New World. Whichever side you choose, glory and honour &ndash; and prizes galore &ndash; are yours for the taking. Provided you avoid court martial and disgrace.<br/><br/>Yellow Jack is a naval war game for two players, set during the years 1739-1743. It explores the roles of the navies of Britain, Spain, and France in the Caribbean. Scale is &ldquo;operational&rdquo; &ndash; that is, the playing pieces represent squadrons of as many as four ships, rather than individual men-o-war. Other counters represent leaders (good and bad), &ldquo;light&rdquo; forces such as frigates and galleys, and &ldquo;formations&rdquo; that allow you to concentrate your forces.<br/><br/>Tactical themes are eschewed in favour of operational issues: keeping your forces in fighting trim, being at the right place at the right time, &amp; dealing with a mounting list of instructions, orders, and unfilfillable mandates from your Government. Combat, though abstracted, takes into account leadership, the class and condition of your ships, and of course the Weather Gauge. In an Age of Sail, wind and water conditions are critical, even at the &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level. Movement uses a point-to-point system where costs change with the wind and you will often be unable to go where you desire. Actions are &ldquo;simultaneous&rdquo;, but unlike many naval games, plotting is not required. Special features of Yellow Jack include the Hurricane Season, amphibious assaults and land campaigns, and the Yellow Jack itself &ndash; Yellow Fever.<br/><br/>Time Required: 3 hours for a Minor Scenario; 1 weekend for the Campaign Game. As a bonus, there are also scenarios for 1744-1748, when the Caribbean struggle became submerged in the greater War of the Austrian Succession; these allow an Extended Campaign covering 1739-1748.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>6 die cut counter sheets &ndash; 720 counters &ndash; including the naval forces of Britain, Spain, and France, plus Pirates (no Caribbean naval game is complete without Pirates). One of the counter sheets includes all the important naval leaders who participated in the War of the Austrian Succession; another consists of land units &ndash; all the regiments that fought in the Caribbean. There is also a sheet of generic markers.<br/><br/>37 wooden disks representing &ldquo;task forces&rdquo; (boxed game only; regular counters are also supplied to represent these items).<br/>48&rdquo; x 54&rdquo; map depicting the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Carolinas coastline.<br/><br/>1 series rulebook, 1 exclusive rule book, 2 scenario/OOB books, 1 set of charts &amp; tables, historical commentary. 1 set of display cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "553 years in the future, seven colonies have been established on seven different planets throughout the galaxy. United Earth is stretched thin and has lost significant diplomatic and economic control over the 89 years since the first colony was established. Thanks to recent technological advances, a new planet, Albion, has suddenly become accessible through the construction of a series of space bridges. With this new access, United Earth has issued the Albion Initiative, which rewards the first pioneer that can successfully reach Albion by purchasing, constructing, and traversing four space bridges from their home planet. Once a player reaches Albion, they win the game.<br/><br/>In order to earn sufficient in-game capital to purchase the necessary bridges, players control a spaceship that they will use to accumulate wealth and to strike fear into the hearts of their fellow gamers. Players can complete a series of missions, buy and sell commodities on the intergalactic commodities market, and engage other players in combat in order to pilfer their stores.<br/><br/>Each turn taken consists of three parts: Tile Placement, Movement &amp; Transactions, and Refueling.<br/><br/>Tile Placement: At the beginning of each turn, players must draw one Navigation Tile and place it in a space that connects it to that player&rsquo;s game piece via the lanes on existent pieces. Through the placement of the Navigation tiles, the game board takes shape as game play progresses. Also, this means that no two play-throughs will utilize the same game board.<br/><br/>Movement: After the tile is placed, players can then move their ship onto spaces that are connected to their game piece. In Bridges to Albion, players can only move as many spaces as they have fuel to reach. Each fuel cell displayed on their Ship&rsquo;s Console can be used to move one space. Each ship comes equipped with room for three fuel cells (an amount that can be upgraded eventually).<br/><br/>Missions:<br/>Each player starts the game with three mission cards. These missions can be completed at the player&rsquo;s discretion. Once a mission is completed and the corresponding reward is received, a player can choose to draw another mission card. A maximum of three mission cards per player is allowed. Mission rewards increase with each mission completed, so completing more missions is more lucrative. However, when a player is prepared to traverse their Bridges, any incomplete missions will incur a 500c fine for each Mission Card that the player retains. Mission Cards may not be sold, but players are allowed to conduct one-for-one trades between themselves throughout the game.<br/><br/>Combat:<br/>Any time during the game that two ships attempt to inhabit the same space on the board, a combat event is initiated. In a<br/>combat event, each player rolls one die. The player with the highest die roll wins, and the loser then must pay the winner the amount indicated on the pricing list. Ties are awarded to the non-attacking player. Battle losses are based on the number of missions the losing player has competed, and the more missions a player completes, the more they stand to lose in a fight.<br/>Each ship&rsquo;s weapons systems can be upgraded, allowing the player to roll more than one die in a combat event. The first<br/>weapons upgrade allows the player to roll two dice, and the second upgrade allows them to roll three. The sum of all<br/>applicable dice rolled is compared to the foe&rsquo;s total sum.<br/>It is possible for players to negotiate prior to a combat event being initiated in order to avoid the potential damage.<br/><br/>Transactions: Once a player arrives to a planet, they are free to conduct any business that they so choose. The Intergalactic<br/>Commodities Market provides an opportunity to buy commodities on one planet and then sell those same commodities on<br/>another planet for a profit. Each ship has a limit of 5 commodities, an amount that can also be upgraded. Ship upgrades can be purchased either on planets or in space.<br/><br/>Refueling: When a player has conducted all of their business, and is finished with their turn, they can then replenish their<br/>fuel supply. Players are not required to purchase any fuel cells if they choose not to, but once they do (or decline to), their turn is then concluded.<br/><br/>Bridges:<br/>In order to reach Albion, players must construct and traverse four Space Bridges beginning at their home planet. Once<br/>purchased, players may place them in the outlined tiles. If a Navigation Tile has not been placed in a space, the Bridge may not be constructed over that space. Once (and not before) a player has built all four of their Space Bridges, other players have the opportunity to attack and destroy them. Once the player reaches Albion, they have won the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>When France fell to the Germans in June 1940, she possessed a strong force of tanks and armored vehicles &ndash; many of them technologically superior to those of the Germans. Yet even better tanks and guns had been designed. Some of these existed as prototypes, and some had even entered production but had not reached front-line troops in significant numbers.<br/><br/>Panzer Grenadier: 1942 - The Defense of France gives the French Army the chance to deploy these weapons against the German invaders.  The high-velocity 47mm APX anti-tank gun did appear in time for the 1940 campaign, but only in very small numbers &ndash; not enough to influence the course of the campaign. That&rsquo;s not the case here, and the French also receive the planned new versions of the Somua S35 medium tank (the S41), Char B1bis heavy tank (the B1ter) and the new AMX38 light tank, all armed with the tank version of the APX gun and with larger turrets and crews than the earlier models.<br/><br/>And there&rsquo;s more, starting with the 75mm TAZ 39 anti-tank gun, the big brother of the 47mm APX, and the 90mm anti-aircraft gun, usable in an anti-tank role as well. The French also receive some additional first-line infantry, and the fully-tracked Lorraine 39 armored personnel carrier to bring them into battle. And finally, the Germans receive a battalion&rsquo;s worth of the PzKpfw 747r &ndash; the Soviet-made T34 in German service.<br/><br/>But how to use all this heavy gear?  1942 - The Defense of France includes a set of 10 scenarios (that&rsquo;s as many as some publishers will give you in what they call a &ldquo;complete&rdquo; boxed game), taking place as a small story arc in our Long War alternative history setting.  Would the improved French armor and anti-tank guns have made a difference? You get to answer that.<br/><br/>1942 - The Defense of France is a supplement for Panzer Grenadier: 1940 - The Fall of France. It is not a complete game: ownership of 1940 and Kursk - Burning Tigers is necessary to play all of the 10 scenarios included.  1942 - The Defense of France also includes 88 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SIDELINE FOOTBALL by FTP Sports Games is a full simulation of the game of Professional or College football.  The game engine is designed around an individual player's ability or inability to win battles or one-on-one matchups.  Each play from scrimmage calls on one or more players to make a play that will influence the result.  Offensive players will block, read defenses, read holes, get open, pass, catch and run, all in an attempt to make a positive play for the offense. Defensive players will play the run, tackle, hit, rush the passer, sack the passer, defend pass routes, intercept the ball and force fumbles all in an attempt to make a positive play for the defense.  The task(s) on each play and the player(s) involved are determined by a GAME CENTER Chart which serves as the centerpiece for game play. A double-sided Play Result Card deck is used in conjunction with the GAME CENTER to determine who is involved on the play and what the result of the play is.  Nearly all plays from scrimmage come from the Play Result Deck, GAME CENTER Chart and individual player cards.  Long Gains, Special Teams, Trick Plays, Turnovers and Injuries get their results from a series of supplemental charts.  On any given play, an offensive player, defensive player or a combination of the two can influence the result.  This gives each individual game a full flavor of the quality of the players from both teams as each individual player will be involved in many play results.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Can your Hero solve the ever shifting Maze of Minos? <br/>In ancient times, the legendary artificer, Daedalus, built an elaborate and confusing structure for King Minos of Crete. Daedalus had so cunningly designed the Maze that he barely escaped its ever shifting walls after building it, so he left a secret trail of stars to mark the way out.<br/><br/>Every season, King Minos would imprison several Heroes within the Maze to be hunted by the Minotaurs and beasts within. With aid from the gods, your Hero will race through the Maze of Minos, avoiding the Minotaurs, to discover three stars of Victory to win.<br/><br/>Maze of Minos is a turn based strategy board game with two phases of play: the maze construction phase and the maze escape phase. During maze construction each player will place tiles and walls, in turn, to challenge the other players during the escape phase. During the escape phase the players will utilize the abilities of the Gods through cards to navigate the maze, avoid Minotaurs and collect Victory Stars. The Game is won when a single player discovers three stars belonging to other players. The game is for two to six players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If the &ldquo;balloon had gone up&rdquo; in Cold War Europe during the 1980s an offensive by the Warsaw Pact and Soviet forces across the North German Plain in West Germany would occur. The central sector of the NATO front here was held by the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) supported by West German forces.  The terrain along the frontier with East Germany was dominated by the Luneberg Heath, an area marked by swamps, rivers and forested terrain that favored the defenders. Once through here, however, the terrain opened up to flat land that stretched to the Dutch and Belgian borders. A breakthrough here by the Communist forces would also certainly lead to a collapse of any NATO defense of West Germany, and a likely defeat by the forces of the Free World.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

Live fast and die hard on Hell's Highway. Can you survive the Devil's Run?<br/><br/>There are four main types of vehicles: Bikes, Trikes, Buggies and Cars. Each of these vehicle types play differently due to how they drive, their weapons and their arcs of fire. The game has story driven missions which are a mix of full throttle racing and maximum carnage vehicular battle, with an immersive ruleset to make you feel like you're a part of the post-apoc action. You use three, six and ten sided dice, statlines and modifications to represent every aspect of the game from scenery effects, shooting, ramming and sideswiping, to using equipment like Nitros, Oil Slicks and Smoke Screens.<br/>A battle between the Hunters and the Questing Knights...who will win...who will even survive?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The clandestine Project for the Assessment of Latent Psychic Ability Control and Awareness (ALPACA) is seeking talented operatives. Players will compete head to head against another candidate to see who will move on to become a full-fledged member of Project ALPACA.<br/><br/>Project ALPACA is a quick round-based two player strategy card game. In the game, players attempt to have the highest Strength value by playing psychic Ability cards that benefit them in the round. Each round is played simultaneously, so players must try to deduce their opponent's plays.<br/><br/>Project ALPACA is played over 10 rounds in which players attempt to achieve the highest Strength value. Each player has a small deck of 10 Strength cards [1 - 10]. Each player starts the round by flipping over the top card of their Strength deck, revealing the top card. The player with the highest Strength value wins the round, scoring a point. After 10 rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>To make things more interesting, players have a psychic Ability deck they will use to change the outcome of the round. This includes changes such as adding to their Strength value, subtracting from their opponent's Strength value, or even reversing the win condition, making it so that the lowest Strength value wins.<br/><br/>",

The NATO forces, however, would be defending in terrain that was well suited for defense. A key element for Soviet success would be the quick capture of Nuremburg, where key roads intersected.

You may play as many cards from your hand as you would like on each of your turns.<br/><br/>The game is won when all the players left alive agree that they are on the same team. They then reveal their team to all players.  If they are correct, victory is achieved. However, if they are wrong, all living players are dead and all other players are alive and gameplay continues.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's shuffleboard from the future! Flick your Blinks across the table to score points, and take advantage of your opponent's mistakes to further your lead. You'll need accuracy, timing, and finesse to win this kinetic tabletop game.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Blinks begin the game as unscored Flickers, which appear as a spinning white light. Set three Blinks aside, then evenly distribute the remaining Flickers to all players. Assign each player one of three colors: magenta, cyan, or yellow.<br/>Take the Blinks you set aside and long press them. This will turn them into Floppers, which appear as fully colored Blinks, periodically cycling magenta, yellow, and cyan. Long pressing a Flopper when alone will return it to a flicker.<br/>Turning a Flicker into a Flopper<br/>Take all three Floppers and combine them into a single cluster. Place the cluster about 3 feet away from the players (i.e. the other end of a short table) and in front of a backstop such as the game box. The further away you place the Flopper, the more challenging the game will be.<br/>Creating a cluster of Floppers<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Players take turns sliding their Flickers towards the Flopper. Attaching to the Flopper will score the Flicker for the team color being displayed. A scored Flicker that has been connected displays a single dot of its scoring color and an entire half Blink of the current Flopper color. That Blink is now an extension of the Flopper, so Flickers that attach to it will score for the color of the Flopper.<br/><br/><br/>Some Flickers may not attach at all when thrown: these are left where they are. They are still active, and may be knocked into the cluster by other players&rsquo; Flickers.<br/>After every Flicker has been thrown, pull the unattached flickers aside, then separate the scored Flickers. This will make them display their scored color. Count the amount of your color and add that to your score tally. Double-clicking a Flicker in this state will reset it back to an unscored Flicker, ready to be distributed to players and thrown in the next round.<br/>                                                                                                         <br/>WIN CONDITION:<br/>The first player to reach 11 points is the winner. If two players end a round with 11 or more points, the player with the most points in total is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The battle for the Hegemony of the seven seas is about to begin.<br/><br/>Impersonate one of the four power-hungry captains and lead your ship to the archipelago chosen for the challenge. Create your winning strategy and hit your opponents with cannon shots to conquer the coveted Black Bones title.<br/><br/>Everything is permissible to attempt to sink the enemy and his rabble; cannon shots, effect balls, lasers and even unleash the wrath of the terrible kraken.<br/><br/>For all the forks, what are you waiting for? Don't be a bilge rat.<br/><br/>Raise the flag and set the dust on fire, glory awaits you.<br/><br/>A fighting and strategy game based on turn mechanics.<br/>Opponents fight in an area divided into squares trying to defeat each other.<br/>Using cards or resources they find by exploring the board.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/>A game is divided into rounds of play. In your turn you can move your vessel trying to find the  Cannonball tile to attack.<br/>Then it will be up to the other participants and then back to you and so on until a player gets the win. Use your cards to move and act from your vessel.<br/>During the first round, no offensive action can be taken !!!<br/><br/>MOVEMENT<br/>During your round the vessel allows to move in a straight line, in an orthogonal or diagonal direction in the number of boxes you want. When you finish a move by stopping on a covered tile, uncover it and play. Once done, the tile must be removed from the board. You can also stop on a box that does not contain tiles, in which case nothing will happen. You have the right to at least one move per turn, if you have Additional Movement cards you can make other moves. You can make moves and offensive Actions in the order you prefer, alternating them as many times as you want based on your possibilities.<br/>For example: your vessel can move three spaces, find a Cannonball tile, use an Additional Movement card and move three more squares, shoot an opponent, play another Additional Movement card by moving five more spaces and end up on a box finnding a Fog card.<br/><br/>IMPASSABLE BOX<br/>A vessel cannot cross or stop on a space occupied by another player or on a Rock tile.<br/><br/>OFFENSIVE ACTIONS <br/>To shoot or take offensive actions by using the cards you have find a Cannonball tile.<br/>You can decide to shoot whenever you want but you CANNOT have more than one cannon ball at the same time, so if you already have one and find another in the next round you are forced to fire a shot immediately. You can shoot along a straight orthogonal or diagonal trajectory from your position. You can shoot enemy vessels or destroy Rock tiles visible from your location.<br/>You can use the cards to change the effect of your shots.<br/><br/>HIT SHOTS <br/>When you get hit by an opponent vessel, without you being able to defend yourself with the cards you have available, you must place a hit marker on your score card.<br/>ATTENTION!!! With three hits you are out of the game!<br/><br/>WIN THE GAME <br/>The last vessel in the game wins the battle.<br/>ATTENTION!!! Should the tiles in the game end and there is not yet a winner, all the remaining vessels have to be placed at their respective starting points, all the tiles, including the Cannonballs set aside, reshuffled and the game board set up again to continue the battle until only one remains!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We give players all the cards. They cannot change their order. On his turn, the player can place a pair in front of him and activate it. Then he draws one card from another player and if he has completed another pair, he can also put it out and activate it. At activation, each pair provides a special skill and provides victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are fewer cards left in the hands than the number of players. If there is someone left with the Konik Morrski card, that player automatically loses without counting points.<br/><br/>The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

A &quot;Challenger&quot; starts the game by flipping over a category card such as &quot;When I drink Tequila I...&quot; They then challenge each person at the table one by one by flipping over a letter card which has a random letter of the alphabet on it. The first person (between the challenger and the person they are battling) to shout out a word or short phrase, fitting the category and starting with that letter, wins the letter card. They then move on to the next person at the table in a clockwise rotation. After everyone at the table has been challenged the &quot;challenger&quot; passes the letter cards to the person on their left and now that person is the new &quot;challenger&quot;. They flip over a new category card and play continues in the same pattern.<br/><br/>When all letter cards have been played, this concludes round one. Everyone counts their letter cards and the person with the most cards wins that round. Keep a tally of the winner and shuffle the letter cards to start a new round. You can play as many rounds as you like until the group decides they are done playing or you run out of category cards.<br/><br/>The answers you give to each category card do not have to be truthful, but they do need to make sense. For Example if the category is &quot;When I Drink Tequila I...&quot; and the letter is &quot;S&quot; you can answer &quot;Streak!&quot; even if you have never actually done that. If you answered &quot;Shoe&quot; that does not make sense with the category and the group takes a vote on if it fits or not. If they say it does not fit you re-do this battle by putting that letter card back into the deck and flipping over a new letter.<br/><br/>When all rounds have been played the person who has won the most rounds (has the most tally's) is the ultimate champion!<br/><br/>",

Same-colored stones with orthogonal adjacency are connected.

Cutting stones are four stones in the following generic crosscut configuration:<br/><br/>OX<br/>XO<br/><br/>On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point, if possible. If that created a crosscut, swap the placed stone with different adjacent enemy stones that share a crosscut with it, until that stone is no longer part of a crosscut.

Yet, they still remain rather maneuverable during battle.

With strong Defensive Save and Morale stats and multiple wounds per figure, they can withstand enemy attacks very well. They are also formidable on offense, gaining special bonuses with their Champion&rsquo;s Wrath ability, which grants Critical Blow and forces the enemy to become Weakened if they roll any 1s when making Defensive Saves against their attacks. Truly a strong unit to have on the battlefield.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Become a leader of the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement demanding votes for women! Be inspired by history or choose a different path as you conduct actions,  grow the movement of supporters and ultimately win the vote!<br/><br/>Suffrage is a card based board game about the iconic and pivotal struggle for women&rsquo;s suffrage in early 20th century Britain and Ireland. Each player takes the role of one of six historical women, all interesting and important personalities in the movement. The goal of the game is to acquire a large enough movement and persuade enough male MP&rsquo;s over at Parliament to support the cause of votes for women. The game consists of 110 cards and 60 custom suffrage supporter miniatures.<br/><br/>On each turn, players choose 1 of the available action cards. Depending on what kind of action is chosen, some supporters will join the movement, while others will leave. Suffragettes for example will gladly join the cause, planting bombs and conducting sabotage, while Suffragists instead support peaceful actions, slow and steady. Similairly, the upper class women and the working class women support - and reject - different actions. It is up to the player to choose which path is most efficient, based on the available action cards.<br/><br/>Once a large enough movement is gathered, the player goes to the Parliament, where - based on the size of the movement - a certain number of MP's (Members of Parliament) will either vote YES or NO to the demand of women's right to vote. A player wins the game by getting at least 10 YES votes.<br/><br/>",

It shrugs off attacks with its thick shell while phasing through the Void to activate multiple times per turn, shredding the Heroes with each slash!<br/><br/>A Challenge Pack is a new themed set of cards with a terrifying new Enemy and a nightmarish new Mission designed to give the Heroes an extra challenge. These cards are all used together for the included Mission; but can also be added to your card decks to increase the challenge across your normal games of Shadows of Brimstone as well. Many of these new cards are marked with a Challenge Icon, to be easily identified as extra dangerous.<br/><br/>Challenge Packs reward players for having a robust collection of Enemies and Expansions; and contain several Threat cards that include a mix of various Enemies from across the game. Some of these Threat cards even add new bonus ability to the Enemies on the card for thematic ways that they can work together to crush the Heroes.<br/><br/>The following Expansions are highly recommended to get the most out of this Challenge Pack (though these sets are not required to use this Supplement, most of the Threat cards included in this Challenge Pack do use various Enemies from these other Expansions):<br/><br/><br/>     Swamps of Death core set<br/>     City of the Ancients core set<br/>     Blasted Wastes OtherWorld deluxe expansion<br/>     Flesh Mites enemy pack<br/>     Void Swarms and Void Hive enemy pack<br/>     Dark Stone Scorpions XL enemy pack<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These Prisoners are referred to as &ldquo;isolated.&rdquo; The active player decides who will be affected. The Light Eater&rsquo;s target can be any isolated prisoner, including the prisoner who drew it. After resolving this effect, the active Player flips the Light Eater tile and places it as a pit (if they are still lit).<br/><br/>Pathbreakers: When a Pathbreaker is drawn, the active prisoner must place it so one of its faces points at them. Pathbreakers do not attack when revealed. Once placed, a Pathbreaker is motion-activated like a Wax Eater, attacking when a player moves into or out of its line of sight. However, a Pathbreaker&rsquo;s line of sight is limited to the two directions of its faces. When a Pathbreaker attacks, it turns every tile in a straight line from its faces into a pit regardless of walls, pits, or open spaces.

Unlike other Relics, however, each animal ally is also represented by 2 figures that move around the board (1 for the starting side and 1 for the upgraded side) and interact with enemies.<br/><br/>During setup, the starting ally figures are placed on the starting space along with their investigators. From then on, allies move on the board, either following investigators or on their own, attacking enemies, luring monsters away from their tutors, taking wounds instead of investigators, allowing them to reroll, and protecting them against enemies.<br/><br/>Allies do not count as figures for game purposes (for example, effects like Psychotic Outbreaks that state &ldquo;Move to the nearest space with at least 1 figure&rdquo;. Allies are ignored for this effect), instead, they count as tokens and have their own set of rules for moving. Whenever an investigator leaves a space where there&rsquo;s an ally, loyal as they are, that ally may follow them (even if the investigator is not the controller of the Relic). In addition, investigators in control of an ally may move their pet companions up to 3 spaces as a free action. This is particularly important, as the placement of each ally is crucial to achieve maximum benefit out of their effects.<br/><br/>The connection between animals and their tutors is undeniable, and so, just like with the other Relics, as the investigator&rsquo;s insanity rises, their ally&rsquo;s behavior reacts accordingly. Upon reaching the 3rd insanity milestone, the card is flipped, reflecting their tutor&rsquo;s insanity and a new, upgraded, behavior from their allies. Their figures on the board are also replaced with their upgraded counterpart to represent their state. Conversely, if the investigator is killed, their ally is removed from the board, as they run away in despair.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Ferocious armies of Seljuk Turks are on the doorstep, ravaging the border cities of the East and sending yearly raids and campaigns into Roman lands. Beset by political intrigue in Constantinople and assuming command of a fragile military, Romanos has only a short time to assemble the largest Roman army in over a century to drive off the forces of the Sultan Alp Arslan before the Empire collapses. <br/><br/><br/>Seljuk&mdash;Volume VI in Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s Levy &amp; Campaign series&mdash;brings players into the challenges of medieval logistics and maneuver across Asia Minor during the clash between Orthodox Christian and Muslim power in the lead-up to the climactic Battle of Manzikert. Players will assume the role of either the Eastern Romans or Seljuk Turks as they seek to make their mark on this historic land. Asymmetric victory objectives and new and unique additions to the Levy &amp; Campaign system mean a dynamic game of cat and mouse between these two great powers.<br/><br/>The Seljuks are on the offensive with vast numbers of Turkic horse, speedy mounted units adept at ranged combat with composite bows. A loose alliance of local vassal states loyal to the Sultan&rsquo;s cause and steppe tribes from central Asia unite under one banner to ravage the Roman state and carry off bounties of loot back to their homelands. The Romans field a much more heavily armored contingent of infantry and mounted Tagmata, but their frontier garrisons, the Themata, are few and not easily replaced. The Romans will have to use these stationary units judiciously to either defend against Seljuk ravaging or protect the walled towns and cities of the Empire from Turkic siege.<br/><br/>And both sides have to confront the very real possibility that some of their allied Lords might switch sides&hellip; Can one final, epic clash make the Seljuks think twice about conquering Anatolia, or can the Muslim armies of the East win one of their greatest victories and capture the Emperor of the Romans on the field of battle?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dark Omen is a unique role playing board game. It brings together elements of your favourite games growing up, with game mechanics which the industry has never seen. Dark Omen immerses players in a tangible world with an enthralling story, epic characters, and stunning artwork.<br/><br/>We call it an Adventure/Roll Playing game, but it is much more. Players set forth in a lost Nordic time, and are faced with strategic decision making, resources management, epic battles, and puzzle solving.<br/><br/>It is a 2-4 player cooperative game, explored campaign style through a variety of quests.<br/><br/>What makes Dark Omen special?<br/>Well, there are several mechanics, which are not found in any other game.<br/><br/>The Unique Obstacle System:<br/>The Dark Omen board has several transparent, moveable layers underneath the main (top) board. These layers move independently. Each layers has markings on it which represent the obstacles, or maze-like walls, which dictate how players can move around the board. From the view of the top board, the Obstacles (or walls), move underneath. In essence, this means that the board state changes throughout the game, and no two play throughs are similar.<br/><br/>The Rune Throw system:<br/>At intervals during the game, players reach into a bag of Runes (4 sided tokens), take 5 pieces (of 16 total), and drop them on the board. Since there are 64 total possible sides of Runes, no two Rune Throws are the same.<br/>Players then select a card from the Rune Cards, which correspond to the Runes which they have thrown.<br/>The Rune Cards are a powerful handicap system which effect players in significant ways. These effect movement, battle, resources management, and much more.<br/>The Rune effects stay in play for several Omens, so players need to adjust their strategies accordingly. Sometimes this can be a real pain, sometimes it makes things much easier. <br/>This is a very dynamic system, and is individual for each Rune Throw, Omen, and play-through.<br/><br/>Action Points:<br/>Players have 6 Action points each per turn, which they can use  to move on the board, for battle, and most other game activities. Players don't need to use all of their AP at once and can choose to alternate spending AP during the same turn.<br/><br/>Morale Points:<br/>In addition, each player has a number of Morale Points, which are tracked on their character board. Morale Points are heavily integrated into battle, overcoming board obstacles, and solving puzzles.<br/><br/>Battle:<br/>Battle in Dark Omen is done by dice rolling, and incorporating  weapon and armor buffs. Battle has two stages: 1) Attack Roll, where players roll their dice against the dice of the enemy. The outcome of the Attack Roll leads to the Damage Roll, where the winning player (or enemy) rolls for damage against the other. Ties normally lead to no Damage Roll, however many game elements lead to advantages for ties, and other battle situations.<br/><br/>Win and Lose conditions:<br/>Dark Omen has 4 chapters, each with 5-6 Omens (Quests). The goal of the game is play through all of these adventures, without losing to the Darkness. Each failed or succeeded Omen affects the Darkness meter. If the players lose too many Omens, then the Darkness vanquished, and the game is lost. By completing Omens, players hold the Darkness at bay, and can even move the meter to the light.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The newly instated Emperor Nero has commissioned a House of Poison to eliminate his rivals, but its Poisonmaster, Locusta, has other plans. Prepare yourself for a thrilling, competitive experience that combines strategy, deception, and a large dose of poison. Step into the world of ancient Rome, where you&rsquo;ll embark on a quest to secretly complete contracts by deftly manipulating the Poison and Favor pillars of your opponents. Unleash your strategic prowess and set up cunning chain reactions&hellip; while expertly sabotaging the plans of your rivals. House of Poison is based on a Narrative Artbook of the same name.<br/><br/>To play, grab your player board and action guide. You will first select a unique character card and draw 1 of 7 secret contracts. Players will take 2 actions per turn, which can be directed at opponents or used for yourself. Your options include: giving Favor, giving Poison, using powerful board actions, or unleashing your unique character abilities. You can also complete Contracts during this step. When you complete a Contract, you will earn victory tokens - but don&rsquo;t be too obvious about your schemes, or other players may guess your Contract and steal it from you!<br/><br/>The first player to 4 victory tokens kicks off the final round. The remaining players have a chance to match or exceed that count with one more turn. Players then reveal their token values (between 1-5 points). The player with they highest point value wins! The fate of Rome hangs in the balance, and only the most cunning and resourceful will emerge victorious. This is a game for 3-8 players, and can run 20-60 minutes, depending on the player count.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

In order to preserve the species, you must ensure breeding within each habitat.<br/><br/>During the game, you select animal tiles and dice, where the dice represent food for the animals. The color of the dice must match the habitat color of the animal tiles. Each turn provides crucial decision-making where you need to consider whether to draft a die of a certain value or ensure an animal tile which may not be available again.<br/><br/>At game end, for each area of connected tiles of the same habitat, you score points for the sum of your dice of that color. However, points are only awarded if dice values of 1 or 2 are placed on certain &ldquo;family&rdquo; tiles within the habitat! Over the course of the game, you will also build watchtowers, which will score you points for all three dice adjacent to them. To make your park even more spectacular, you also aim to collect as many different species as possible, with increasing points awarded for greater variety. Finally, the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>After a few plays, you may challenge yourself by playing with three (of 18) mission tiles. While they offer the potential for a higher score, they also raise the difficulty level of the puzzle.<br/><br/>Spectacular provides simultaneous play and ensures interaction between the players, as your opponents&rsquo; decisions will affect which tiles and dice are available for you. The game also comes with asymmetric player boards (on their backs).<br/><br/>Spectacular offers simple rules, quick set-up, short playing time, engaging puzzles, and can be played by 1 to 6 players with little downtime, even with higher player count.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It was the first British two seat light day-bomber to have an effective defensive armament. The DH.4 proved a huge success and was often considered the best single-engine bomber of the War. It was flown by a number of famous British and American aces, such as Frederick Cotton and Charles Bartlett. Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

Plant charges to destroy your objective, assassinate a target or grab vital intel, then fight your way to safety before reinforcements arrive.<br/><br/>Or play as the defenders, carefully setting patrol routes so your sentries can spot raiders in the shadows, utilise guard dogs, officers or even the dreaded Gestapo and make use of informants and intercepted transmissions to thwart the attackers&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>All fighters have a 180 degree field of vision, so cannot see behind without turning. Enemies are not visible in the darkness and must be detected before you can react to them.<br/><br/>The attackers start each mission creeping forward through the night, aiming to stay covert, timing their movement to sneak behind patrolling sentries. If they are careless, or a sentry turns at the wrong moment, the defenders may detect them and grow suspicious, closing in and eventually raising the alarm.<br/><br/>At this point the defenders get reinforcements and can open fire on the raiders!

The player who does this best, wins the game.<br/><br/>Flow: Untamed Rivers is a strategic tile-laying game in which players take turns placing a tile on the rainforest board. This gradually forms a river labyrinth, in which you always have to be attentive so that you don't miss a chance for yourself or overlook one of your fellow players. Each player has only 3 Lair Tiles, which can be used to build Territories. Therefore, it is important to carefully weigh up when to use them and when it is better to wait. However, if you wait too long, it can be too late and you end up with only one or two Territories. In addition, each player has one Reservation Marker, which reserves a field of the rainforest board until the end and can be worth its weight in gold if placed on the right field.<br/><br/>The game was beautifully illustrated by the Brazilian artist Victor Sales, who, of course, has a very personal connection to the Amazon region.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Persian Empire, the Greek city states and the mighty Pharaonic Empire of Egypt fought for dominance in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea. The people from all of these empires see the gods as their allies and trust them as supporters for their cause!<br/><br/>The game series &ldquo;History of the Ancient Seas&rdquo; is the ultimate journey through these exciting times. Build new fleets in your city to explore unknown lands, conquer islands and build a great empire.<br/><br/>DIES IRAE is a three player game. The challenge in a three player game is that gamers face a constant two versus one constellation. All three players have to fight on at least two fronts at the same time and have to keep a close eye on both opponents. The worst case is they are in an armistice which means they could both focus on you. Each player should avoid this situation at all costs. Which god will help their people the most in the struggle of dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean Seas?<br/><br/>Your goal is to become the leading empire in the known world. To achieve this, you will need to build armies and fleets to increase your military might, expand trade routes, conquer islands and provinces, develop your military skills, economic efficiency and culture, while always keeping an eye on the wealth, happiness and stability of your people.<br/>    <br/>The game is played in highly interactive micro-impulses. The heart of the game system is the action cycle: The players choose one of the eight possible actions. Actions chosen by a player can&rsquo;t be chosen subsequently by the next player. The number of possible actions is limited each turn.<br/><br/>War or peace: That is your decision! You can expand your empire by leading your people to war! But war is costly and the outcome is uncertain. You can lead your empire to the golden age of civilization by keeping the peace and bringing stability and wealth to your people without following the path of war. Offer terms to aggressive enemies to distract or delay them, but always be prepared to defend your empire.<br/><br/>You will move your 3D wooden playing pieces (representing fleets and legions) across the beautifully illustrated map from the Hellenistic main land and islands to the shores of Persia in the east and the northern part of the mighty empire of the Pharaons to expand your trade network and increase your trading status.<br/><br/>",

Just line up the short edge or long edge of any of these maps to any other map in the series to create your own Forward Edge of the Battle Area.<br/><br/>SIX SCENARIOS ARE INCLUDED, depicting actions described in or implied by the narrative in the Novel Storm and Steel.

The game includes an adventure book (which contains the story and the rules), game counters, and a map used to resolve combat. Players create and customize their characters, follow the adventure making decisions that will influence the course of the story, and use map and game counters to resolve combat against the enemies that will be encountered along the way. The game can be played by a single player, as a choose-your-adventure book with a more tactical combat system behind, or by a group of up to 4 players working together in an RPG experience.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>At the rim of the explored world lies a volatile land known as The Frontier. Horrific beasts born of nightmare appear out of thin air, devouring any living thing in their path. The weather and landscape too, are capricious and unpredictable. A scalding day may be replaced in a matter of moments by a raging blizzard. Where there was a verdant forest a day ago, now may be a vast desert. Now you are tasked to recover a stolen idol, a trinket, seemingly of minimum value. But Saleeb, the merchant prince, wants it back and is willing to pay a hefty fee. The only problem is that the trail of the idol goes deep into the uncharted regions of The Frontier.<br/><br/>",

Players select an army from one of ten army lists, ranging from fantasy staples such as Dwarfs and Orcs, to more unusual races such as the insectoid T'lekkan and the Sea Elves. Depending on the size of the game and the choice of army, players can field a force containing as little as twenty five minis or as many as a hundred.<br/><br/>The game uses a streamlined movement and combat system which presents many tactical challenges without bogging the players down, allowing a game to be played in around two hours. D6's are used for most of the mechanics, along with a deck of regular playing cards for the miracles system. Rules for scenarios, weather, terrain, habitat, etc., help create a narrative feel to God of Battles.<br/><br/>The rulebook is a 285 page full-colour hardback and contains all of the rules, all ten army lists, all of the background to the world of Aren, painting guides for each army, and a sample battle report. It is fully supported by a range of miniatures produced by Wargames Foundry and many of the armies are compatible with miniatures produced by other companies.<br/><br/>",

Alien probes have crashed on Earth, but their existence remains kept from the public at large. Governments and corporations vie for control of the technology laden in the salvaged wreckage. Players take control of 1 of 4 factions, each with a distinct play style, and battle for control of the alien technology on the field in order to win.<br/><br/>After selecting a faction, players choose from several units to field a small squad of troops. From there, they construct a small deck of enhancements to draw from during play. The gameboard is variable as players randomly divide up terrain plates and take turns placing them before choosing the location of their base. Combat is streamlined with quick resolution. Units that are killed are cloned and released back into play, after a few rounds delay, to rejoin the fight.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When your home is the forest, preparing for winter isn't all fun and games. At least not until this year, when Fox proposed to his woodland friends a grand contest: Who will weather winter best? In this charming, light-hearted game of Fierce Friendship and Frosty Fortitude, take on the role of Squirrel, Bear, Deer, Rabbit, Beaver, or Fox. Optimize your actions each turn and explore, build shelters, forage for food to stash away, and hunker down before bad weather strikes. As winter approaches, you'll even direct the falling snow, transforming the map to a wintry landscape. All the while, you'll be strengthening your bonds of friendship to earn powerful bonuses.<br/><br/>Gameplay details: Players gain points by foraging for and stashing away food, playing friendship cards, and hunkering down before weather events. Using an action-point allowance system, players move their pawns around the board, forage, build shelters, and manage their hand of Friendship Cards, which provide mini-objectives to pursue. At the end of each turn, players roll Snow Dice to determine how many snow tiles to place onto the board around your animal. Placing a snow tile renders that space impassable, so players must be strategic with their placements. Gameplay includes a press-your-luck mechanic involving predicting when certain seasonal events will strike. Game is turn-based, but animals may play certain abilities on each others' turns, keeping everyone engaged no matter whose turn it is. Placing the last snow tile triggers the final round, after which all scoring occurs and the player with the most points is declared the winner of winter!<br/><br/>Replayability: The game has high replayability due to asymmetric animal characters, a modular/evolving board, and multiple proven strategic paths to victory. Further, because Hunker is a highly approachable game with a good mix of easy-to-learn rules and strategic depth, it is an excellent gateway game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Now the Hunt for Blackbeard is on again. As Blackbeard, you must select your anchorage carefully, as you&rsquo;ll need all your guile to survive. Will you cash in for the diversions of a pirate&rsquo;s life, or return to acts of piracy as your money runs out? The hunters are coming&mdash;evade them, or prepare defenses and risk luring them in? As the Hunters, how long can you afford to press your stable of informants and arm your expedition? You know Blackbeard: he will not sit idle. His ambitions may expose him, but he is getting stronger day by day. How will you approach&mdash;a flushing strategy, or a precision strike? Be careful, as your quarry is apt to bite!<br/><br/>Hunt for Blackbeard pits two players against one another as hunter and hunted in a fast-moving game of detection, deception, and confrontation.<br/><br/>Hunt for Blackbeard is a two-player boardgame that portrays the effort in 1718 by the colony of Virginia and the Royal Navy to track down the notorious pirate Blackbeard (Edward Thatch) as he sought refuge in colonial North Carolina. It features the historical events, places, and personages involved in Blackbeard&rsquo;s demise 300 years ago, and the real-world challenges of &ldquo;golden-age&rdquo; piracy and pirate hunting. Players. One player takes the role of Blackbeard and the other the pirate hunters. Blackbeard seeks to commit acts of piracy or to enjoy a pirate&rsquo;s life while remaining free. The hunters try to discern Blackbeard&rsquo;s plans to thwart his piracy. The game may end in a battle in which either the hunters capture Blackbeard or the pirate wins by seizing a hunters&rsquo; ship as his prize!<br/><br/>Sequence of Play:<br/>In each of up to four turns, players draw secret tiles that gradually reveal opportunities for Blackbeard to pursue his piratical aims and for the hunters to interview informants who may know of Blackbeard&rsquo;s whereabouts.<br/><br/>The players next commit Action pawns behind their screens to prepare defenses, sail, scout, or plan piracy. Blackbeard then secretly records any changes to the information on the main map. As the hunters take their turn, they inspect markers on the map&mdash;often secretly&mdash;as they seek Blackbeard, his camp, or any wake of his passage. Blackbeard will not know how much the hunters have learned before they strike!<br/><br/>Combat ensues if hunters catch up with Blackbeard&rsquo;s sloop. If Blackbeard remains unchallenged at the right location, he carries out his piracy, placing gold cubes onto tiles among those drawn. Blackbeard can win through piracy while evading the hunters. But if a boarding action occurs, the winner automatically takes the game, enabling the pirate to win by girding for a fight and luring the hunters in.<br/><br/>-extract from publisher description, with a correction from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the depths of Victorian Europe, circa 1898, a chilling presence looms &mdash; vampires are on the prowl! You and up to 9 friends play as members of a legendary vampire hunter's guild, forming the last line of defense against the encroaching undead menace. But as the night creeps on, can you determine which of your fellow guild members can be trusted, and which are actually vampires themselves? Investigate and assassinate as you stake your way to the top in this fast-paced evening of betrayal and deception. Last team at the table wins!<br/><br/>Staked! is a social deduction game for 6-10 players, with most players acting as vampire hunters, while a few others are acting as secret vampires. The hunters have superior numbers, but no information. The vampires are fewer, but know each other, and can coordinate attacks.<br/><br/>Each game consists of multiple rounds, with each round consisting of two phases: the Mingling Phase, followed by the Dining Phase. In the Mingling Phase, players discuss suspicions and cast votes for other players, using a series of voting tiles, which keep their vote obscured. Once the votes have all been cast, play moves to the Dining Phase, where votes are revealed. Depending on the votes, 1 player is eliminated, becoming a Ghost, and 1 player is elected Alpha Hunter, granting them special abilities in the next round.<br/><br/>Staked! was designed specifically in an attempt to improve upon traditional social deduction game shortcomings. Eliminated players have much more agency through Ghost actions. There is no narrator required, so everyone plays. Rounds keep moving, and maintain tension, through the use of timed discussion phases. And players can choose between the simpler base game, or a more advanced and engaging play mode, featuring character abilities.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BORD is a two-player game of area control and dice battles between viking armies. BORD is also a viking word that meant &quot;the side of a ship&quot; (as in &quot;starboard&quot;) or &quot;a plank of wood&quot; (literally a board, as in &quot;board games&quot;). BORD distills the wargame experience into a short, yet strategic game that takes less than an hour to play.<br/><br/>BORD is played on four hex boards. These hex boards have a grid of half-hexes (shores) and whole-hexes (high ground or low ground), and they are used to set up one or more islands (different set-ups for different games). The eight objectives &mdash; grassland, marsh, woodland, and stronghold &mdash; are then placed on those islands. Each objective has two sides: light or dark. One player is light, and the other is dark. You control an objective when your side (light or dark) is face up. To take control of an objective, you must have the most armies adjacent to it at the end of a turn, after which you flip it so that your side (light or dark) is face up. You score victory points at the end of each season (summer and winter) for each objective that you control. At the end of the second season (winter), the player who has the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>Each of your armies has an objective shown on it: grassland, marsh, woodland, or stronghold. If your army is adjacent to that objective, you get the bonus shown on that army: dice, action points, or victory points. Dice are used in battle. Action points are used to land, move, and battle. Victory points are used to win the game. You can choose to settle (discard) an army to earn a victory point. (This represents a viking becoming a farmer.) You get a new army at the beginning of your turn, but only if you have fewer than six armies. Thus, settling an army when you have only six will get you a new army next turn, but you might leave an objective unguarded in the meantime...<br/><br/>Battles are won by rolling dice (one die for each army on, or adjacent to, the battleground). You roll additional dice if those armies are on high ground or adjacent to their stronghold. If the attacker gets the highest roll, the defender flees to sea and cannot land again until the next season, but still counts as one of that player's six armies. If the attacker does not get the highest roll, nothing happens, so the risk of attacking is that you might waste your turn. To win the game, you might not need to battle at all, but winning the right battle at the right time might be the difference between winning and losing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chaos Reigns is a five-color deck built around cascade, from Alara Reborn.<br/><br/>Planechase was originally released in 2009. This deck was released in 2012.<br/><br/>Planechase is a card game and a variant of Magic: The Gathering with an emphasis on multi-player games. The set utilizes new oversized Plane cards, cards that are based on various locations (Planes) within the Magic multiverse, to modify the rules of gameplay.<br/><br/>To play a game of Planechase, each player needs his or her own planar deck, consisting of at least 10 different oversized cards. The players may also use a &quot;shared planar deck,&quot; which requires ten cards per player. Players cannot use more than one plane with any given name. When the game begins, the player going first reveals the top of his or her planar deck (or the shared planar deck), which is the plane the game starts on. Each plane card has a name, a type, one ability that applies at all times (either to all players or to whoever is the turn player at the time), and one &quot;Chaos&quot; ability.<br/><br/>Players also need a six-sided die, called the &quot;planar die.&quot; Each Planechase pre-constructed deck comes with a &quot;planar die&quot; that has four blank faces, one &quot;Planeswalk&quot; face with the &quot;Planeswalker&quot; symbol, and one &quot;Chaos&quot; face with its own symbol unique to Planechase. During a player's main phase, that player can roll the planar die, with three possible outcomes. A blank roll of the planar die does nothing. If &quot;Chaos&quot; is rolled, the &quot;Chaos&quot; ability of the current plane card triggers. If the &quot;Planeswalk&quot; symbol is rolled, the player &quot;planeswalks away&quot; from the current plane (put it on the bottom of its owner's planar deck) and he or she reveals the top card of his or her planar deck, which becomes the new plane that has been &quot;planeswalked to.&quot; A player can roll the planar die as many times as he or she likes, but successive rolls cost an additional one mana for each time the planar die has been rolled this turn.<br/><br/>Other than the above, the normal rules of the game are followed, and Planechase can be adapted to any multiplayer variant.<br/><br/>Planechase 2012 introduced the &quot;phenomenon&quot; card type. A player may have up to two different phenomenon cards in his or her planar deck, which cannot have the same name. When a player planeswalks to a phenomenon, he or she follows the instructions on the card, then immediately planeswalks away from it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Berestechko 1651 is a game for two players simulating the third day of the battle of Berestechko, fought on 30th June 1651 between the Zaporozhian Cossacks, led by Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and aided by their Crimean Tatar allies, and a Polish-Lituanian army under King John II Casimir, near the Styr river in Volhynia It was one of the largest land battles of 17th century Europe.<br/><br/>The game is a small-footprint simulation intended to give a quick and easy representation of the battle, focusing on good preparation of attacks and on when and where to withhold, retreat, rally and reorganize. The game lasts two turns. In each turn players alternate performing &ldquo;impulses&rdquo;, in which they activate units and/or gather coordination and reorganization commands. In each turn each unit can be activated up to two times. A turn ends when all units of one  player have been activated twice. Once the second turn ends, victory is assessed, although an automatic victory can happen before the end of the two turns if certain conditions are met.<br/><br/>-description from developer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After the Seven Years&rsquo; War, the forces of revolt and revolution gathered strength. First there were protests in the 13 American colonies as well as a minor rebellion in Louisiana, and a short but sharp guerilla war in Corsica. The great powers though continued on, making a few concessions but assuming their power was unbroken. Then came Lexington, where British regulars and American militia traded shots. In the end, the British lost the American colonies, but avoided losing territory to France and Spain. France, having bankrupted itself aiding the Americans, underwent a revolution that is often considered the dawn of the modern age.<br/><br/>The French Revolution was complicated, confusing, violent, and inspiring. It was an age of wonders and nightmares. It also would have ended if not for the French army. The combination of post-Seven Year&rsquo;s War reforms and the transformation of the army from an instrument of the Bourbons into a citizen&rsquo;s army made it a formidable force. Warfare in this age blended old and new tactics. Linear formations in the style of Frederick II continued, but with a greater use of skirmishers and light troops. The French mastered this new style of warfare and won a series of sweeping victories that undermined the old powers and ushered in the bloodiest and most fevered war of the era.<br/><br/>Battles included are...<br/><br/>Borgo - October 8, 1768 &ndash; &ldquo;Europe is watching you.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Kagul - August 1, 1770 &ndash; The Glory of Catherine<br/><br/>Bunker Hill - June 17, 1775 &ndash; &ldquo;Another such would have ruined us.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Long Island - August 27, 1776 &ndash; &ldquo;If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Princeton - January 3, 1777 &ndash; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine fox chase my boys!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Germantown - October 4, 1777 &ndash; &ldquo;Form!

The 4 new hordes also features unique strategies and play-styles: for instance the Sinklings conceal themselves entering play face-down, while the Broods will fill the backline with Brood tokens that are essentially additional minions!<br/><br/>For the alliance, not even contemplating the four new pre-made decks, one fundamental change is that you must exhaust an ally in order to move it, giving even more meaning and depth to the positioning of your allies. <br/>Cards are also designed with more potential combo's than ever, allowing for the power level to reach higher ceiling... something that you absolutely need given the brand new difficulty system that is designed around 3 variations of every single horde card, at 3 different power levels.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Wherever people gather, competition - and love of competition - appear.<br/><br/>Even the lone mind seeks the stimulus of games, and in a sense the opponent is still the same. It is always fickle Fate - or our own limitations! - that we are trying to defeat. Games rise and fall in popularity, appear and disappear. Inventiveness, and love of novelty, are always modifying the old and devising new. Games have lives, histories, and family trees. Few of us today have heard of the medieval mine men's morris; but millions of hours are spent on bridge, and chess, and Monopoly - and millions of dollars at poker or roulette. This book covers games that the reader will have seen or heard about - family games and social games, games played for fun, and games played for profit. But it includes, too, many that will be strange: games from foreign countries and ancient times. All are presented through a unique blend of text and illustration. Here the reader can learn not only the secrets of bridge or chemin de fer, but also how to play pachisi or nyout, lasca, or hex, or go. In addition to clearcut, concise rules, the players and equipment each game needs are listed, while the guide on pages 316-317 groups games together according to the number of participants they require. With a little thought, then, it is easy to arrange and even improvise to try an unfamiliar game - whether to make a party go, or to keep a houseful of children quiet! This book will tempt the reader to relax and experiment. It will let him soon settle those old rules disputes. It will be a friendly guide to those games that &quot;everyone else seems to know&quot;. We believe that it is unique - a unique aid to leisure. It is, in fact, the major reference book of how to play the games of the world.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Valour at Casa Berardi covers the actions around Casa Berardi by the only all French-Canadian unit, the Royal 22nd Regiment.  Commonly called the Vandoos, this unit distinguished itself during World War II.  Casa Berardi features a historical map and 4 scenario mini-campaign.<br/><br/>This four-scenario pack is played on an 18 x 24, 1&quot; hex custom map, revolving around the French-Canadian Royal 22&eacute; (Vandoo) Regiment's advance towards the &quot;CIDER&quot; crossroads and their valiant defence of Casa Berardi against the Fallschirmj&auml;gers of the 1.Fallschirmj&auml;gersdivision.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>CASLO-1 Onwards: The Vandoos were tasked with advancing up the Orsonga-Ortona Road and capture the &quot;CIDER&quot; crossroads. The Vandoo's C Company, under the command of Captain Paul Triquet led his men towards the crossroad, when they came under heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. Unable to move, the Vandoos were raked merciless by the unrelenting fire and soon casualties began to mount.<br/><br/>CASLO-2 The Only Safe Place: Supported by the tanks of the Ontario Regiment, the Vandoos set out towards their objective of the &quot;CIDER&quot; crossroads. In their path were men and panzers units of the elite German 1st Fallschirmj&auml;ger Division, who raked the Vandoos with heavy mortar and machine-gun fire. As the Vandoos' casualties started mount, Captain Triquet ordered his men to the only safe place - the stone manor house of Casa Berardi.<br/><br/>CASLO-3 They Shall Not Pass: Captain Triquet and what was left of his company, along with three Ontario tanks, and Royal Canadian Horse Artillery's FOO, Lieutenant McDonald gathered about the stone manor house of Casa Berardi ready to receive the Fallschirmj&auml;gers attack. Wait long the French-Canadians did not have to wait. The Germans launched piecemeal attacks from the north, east, and out of the gully to the south.<br/><br/>CASLO-4 Valour at Casa Berardi: At 07.30 hrs, the Vandoos started out for Casa Berardi under heavy shellfire, crossing the &ldquo;Gully&rdquo; at a point deemed &ldquo;its least formidable&rdquo;. Once across, &ldquo;C&rdquo; Company, under the command of Captain Paul Triquet, was ordered to perform a right flanking manoeuvre, which would enabled the remainder of the Battalion to attack Casa Berardi from the front. &ldquo;C&rdquo; Company, apart from Captain Triquet himself, was reduced to a fighting strength of two sergeants and fifteen men, armed with small arms, and a woefully low on ammunition; while the accompanying Ontarios, under command of Major &ldquo;Snuffy&rdquo; Smith, had four tanks left- two of them bogged in the thick mud nearby. Captain Triquet decided that with the Germans to the front, on the flanks, and in behind them, &ldquo;The only safe place was on the objective itself!&rdquo; and with these slender resources, organized his defences against a counter-attack; issuing the order Ils ne passeront pas (They shall not pass!). Surrounded, the handful of men drew back from the crossroads; however, the battle was not yet done. The Germans persisted in trying to overrun the handful of French- Canadians lodged around the farmhouse; launching infantry and tank attacks piecemeal against the Vandoos, as they arrived..<br/><br/>",

This also enables figures which have been based on different frontages, for use with a variety of rule systems, to be used together. The rules are simple enough that players who have not previously encountered them &ndash; including wargaming novices of any age &ndash; can be taught the basics in  fteen minutes or so and then learn the rest &ldquo;on the job&rdquo;. &quot;<br/><br/><br/>A new English Civil War set, called &ldquo;To the Strongest! For King and Parliament.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Battles fought using the TtS! rules can be fought with model soldiers, on a dining room table and won or lost in less than two hours. The rules also support huge battles, with several thousand figures and up to five players a side.<br/><br/>A grid enables players to completely dispense with measurement, and so permits the game to move along at a cracking pace. Miniatures can be in any scale from 2mm to 5mmm and based for any of the common wargaming rules systems. To the Strongest! games use a unique activation system driven by either playing cards or chits. This system introduces uncertainty to a battle; in some turns a unit can move four or five times, and in others not even once. The same deck is used to resolve shooting and melee.

        "description": "PopCats Fighter is a 1v1 Take-That and Hand-Management card fighting game inspired by 80&rsquo;s retro arcade games!<br/><br/>Select your favorite PopCat Fighter character, with unique Purrks and Super Moves, to be your champion against your opponent. Build colorful Combos by connecting Move Cards from your hand using COLOR/SHAPE to build the strongest Combo you can, while avoiding making it too vulnerable to your opponent's Defensive abilities!<br/><br/>The more Combos you play, the stronger they get! The more Move Cards you add to your Combo, the higher chance you have to gain a valuable resource called Energy.<br/><br/>Energy can help you get the most out of the abilities in your Cards, it can help you Counter Blocks, and even Draw Move Cards! Spending your Energy drawing cards is a great way to add some extra Moves for your stronger Combos, otherwise you will have to wait until after your #3 Combo to draw some new Move Cards on your own. That's assuming you survive Round 1!<br/><br/>Danger slowly creeps up as your Health gets closer to zero, but fear not as you can unlock Raging Furry Mode that will give you an instant Bonus that might just give you the edge you needed to survive!<br/><br/>This is a medium weight game with layers of strategy. Select your PopCat Fighter from our roster that is made up of 8 contenders like Spawrkles, Purrserker, El Tigre, Catana, Ki-10s, Claw-Fang, Apuma, and Clawdette! All characters come with 2 unique Purrks, and 2 unique Super Moves.<br/><br/>1v1: 45-60 Minutes<br/><br/>Game is set to re-launch on Kickstarter September 2021! If you would like to demo the game now, find PopCats Fighter on Tabletop Simulator's workshop!<br/><br/>",

You received notice that a terrible storm is coming and you must harvest everything before the storm destroys your crops!<br/><br/>This is a solitaire card game using only 12 cards (18 cards come with the game for more variability, and all cards are different).<br/><br/>Remove the &quot;switch&quot; card and mix the remaining 17 cards.<br/><br/>Now deal down 11 cards and add the &quot;switch&quot; card, mix these 12 cards and deal them down in a 3x4 grid making sure all cards are oriented the same way, easily done by looking at the back of the cards.<br/><br/>1  2  3  4<br/>5  6  7  8<br/>9 10 11 12<br/><br/>Put the rest of the cards away, you won&rsquo;t be using them.<br/><br/>Your goal is to save your crops by removing every single card from the tableau, otherwise you lose.<br/><br/>You begin by carefully observing the cards....<br/><br/>On every turn you will be removing two cards from the tableau by &quot;activating&quot; a card, and removing both the card activated and the card it affects (either due to arrows or instructions). If removing cards by an &quot;arrow&quot; action, the activated arrow card needs to be directly adjacent to the card it affects, either horizontally or vertically, otherwise the action does not take place.<br/><br/>Some cards mention &quot;positions&quot;. Be aware of cards referencing positions 1, 4, 9, and 12.<br/><br/>The &quot;Switch&quot; card gives you the option of switching the position of two &quot;other&quot; cards, then eliminating a card from either side of it. If the &quot;switch&quot; card is activated and there is no card directly adjacent to the right or left of it, the switch cannot be activated.<br/><br/>It's not as simple as it seems, you'll have lots of options, and one mistake can cost you!<br/><br/>Will you be able to save your crops before the storm?<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.DualBrainGames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.DualBrainGames.com</a><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Crackling with dark energy, these automaton warriors march to war, brandishing their Slayer Axes to smite gods and men alike, while the deafening roar of their Fel Horns echo through the mountains, whipping their legions into a frenzy of rage.<br/><br/>Feljeagors are perhaps one of the deadliest enemies in the game,  dispatched to bring ruin on the world of men. Brutish suits of animated Thunderforged armor, they cannot be reasoned with or stopped. They continue to fight until they are literally smashed apart; and that is no easy feat. With a hefty Armor 4+ and Defense of 4, these constructs are terrifyingly durable. Their Slayer Axes have the potential to cut even the toughest of Heroes down to size. But one of  the main features of the Feljeagor Slayers is the bellowing roar of their Fel Horns, buffing themselves and all other Enemies around with Rage tokens that can give them extra Combat or allow them to shrug off damage. When the Thunderforged warriors march  to war, there can be no doubt that Ragnarok is upon us!<br/><br/>3x Large Enemies, Cards, Rules, and Mission<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "High in the Carpathian Mountains stands the crumbling Castle Fier. Once home to a powerful warlord, the castle cast a dark shadow across the nearby villages, until crusaders attacked with sword and flame to put an end to its menace. Though history passed into folklore, the ruins of Castle Fier remained shunned by all as a cursed site. Now, horrors have been seen moving at night. An army gathers. Something has awoken in the ruins. With the political situation in the surrounding region becoming increasingly unstable, France, Prussia, Britain, and the other powers have dispatched their best agents to investigate the ruins, eliminate any threats, and acquire any treasures that could prove useful in the ongoing fight against the harvestmen&hellip; and each other.<br/><br/>The Carpathians: Castle Fier is a supplement for The Silver Bayonet: A Wargame of Napoleonic Gothic Horror, in which the special units must fight their way through the ruins of a menacing haunted castle. It features two campaigns &ndash; one competitive and one for solo or cooperative play &ndash; as well as new monsters to fight, soldiers to recruit, and treasure to unearth.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A book of 15 small games, some including boards, that were published in remembrance of game designer Piero Cioni.<br/><br/>&quot;In June 2019, a great friend and colleague, Piero Cioni, left us prematurely, and many Italian authors wanted to create this work that, in addition to remembering and paying homage to him, wants to make a small contribution to the organization that has supported him in his latest days and which offers daily assistance to cancer patients and their families: the ANT Foundation.<br/><br/>&ldquo;In this volume you will find Fifteen Games with Piero. Many times we have found ourselves around a table with Piero, exchanging ideas with him, and we would like to do it again. But Piero is no longer there and so we turned to his games, to the ones we loved most, &quot;talking&quot; with them to create new ones. They are therefore not Piero's games but they are, perhaps, the games that we could have designed together.&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;Nel Giugno del 2019 ci ha prematuramente lasciati un grande amico e collega, Piero Cioni, e molti autori italiani hanno voluto realizzare questa opera che, oltre a ricordarlo ed omaggiarlo, vuole dare un piccolo contributo all&rsquo;organizzazione che lo ha supportato nei suoi ultimi giorni e che quotidianamente offre assistenza ai malati di tumore e alle loro famiglie: la Fondazione ANT,&rdquo; scrivono nella prefazione i promotori dell&rsquo;iniziativa.&ldquo;In questo volume troverete Quindici Giochi con Piero. Tante volte ci siamo trovati intorno a un tavolo con Piero, a scambiarci idee con lui, e vorremmo farlo ancora. Ma Piero non c&rsquo;&egrave; pi&ugrave; e allora ci siamo rivolti ai suoi giochi, a quelli che abbiamo pi&ugrave; amato, &ldquo;parlando&rdquo; con loro per crearne di nuovi. Non sono quindi giochi &ldquo;di&rdquo; Piero ma sono, forse, i giochi che avremmo potuto progettare insieme&rdquo; concludono.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PMC 2640 is the third wargame made by Assault Publishing and deals with warfare in the 27th century. Although there are plenty of sci-fi wargames, PMC 2640 has many interesting features which make it unique and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>PMC 2640 is designed as a &lsquo;true company scale&rsquo; wargame, which means that it runs smoothly both with a few as well as a few dozen units on the battlefield. This was achieved by eliminating sophisticated, but unnecessary special rules, and limiting the number of counters to morale markers only, represented by D6 dice. The ruleset itself is compact and elegant, written in simple, &ldquo;international&rdquo; English, leaving no place for vagueness and multiple interpretations. On the other hand, PMC 2640 offers countless possibilities, as the rulebook contains a few dozen of unit entries, six scenarios and seven terrain generators, all of which ensure that no two games will look the same. The classic alternate activation (with small balancing modifications) makes the game fast and addictive.<br/><br/>The unit/team is the basic element of the game and all parameters are given for the whole team, with the number of soldiers modifying just a few parameters (Firepower, Assault and Morale, to be precise). We do not worry about equipment of individual soldiers. Rifle team is a rifle team, whether they use assault rifles, lasers, neutron blasters or any other similar weapon. There are only two requirements: they units have to be Recognizable and Cool-Looking! This allows you to prepare and field the coolest teams you can, with sarges, medics, war correspondents or whoever else you wish, as long as there is no doubt what unit the miniatures represent.<br/><br/>PMC 2640 does not feature a typical point value system. Instead, all units are grouped into Tiers which correspond to their level of training, experience and equipment. What is more, the battles have their own Battle Tiers, which specify the sum of all Unit Tiers and limit the number of units of specific Tiers. Low Tier battles are clashes of unreliable greenhorns, while high Tier battles feature lots of specialised, deadly troops.<br/><br/>Another feature of PMC 2640 is morale system. Morale is not a 0-1 value (didn&rsquo;t pass &ndash; passed) like in the most games, but instead troops under fire get suppression points. When the number of these points becomes high enough, the unit gets suppressed and later broken. To make things more interesting, every lost soldier means a reduction of the Morale parameter, so like in real life, the units with half of the soldiers down usually have little combat value. But even troops which haven&rsquo;t suffered any losses can sometimes be forced to retreat &ndash; though killing a few enemies always helps!<br/><br/>PMC 2640 focuses on tactics and proper use of even the slightest advantages the commanders have at their disposal. Terrain pieces are not just decorative dioramas, but play a very important role. They may hide your troops from enemy line of sight, provide them with a defence bonus and/or boost their firepower &ndash; definitely something to take into account. Additionally, some of the terrain pieces can be demolished, and buildings or barricades may become deadly traps!<br/><br/>One the most interesting component of PMC 2640 is its campaign system, which resembles those featured in skirmish games. Instead of a chain of several scenarios, the players develop their PMCs by playing standard battles. The commanders gain funds to recruit new troops and develop their companies, while the units get experience, upgrades and trauma, all of which affect their performance in later games.<br/><br/>And if you want to try something different than typical competitive battles, PMC 2640 allows for solitaire and cooperative games! These are described in a separate chapter with additional rules, six dedicated scenarios and new special units (insurgents and space bugs). Solitaire/cooperative games might not be perfectly balanced (which is probably impossible), but are intended to be as cool and fun as possible. Whether you wish to crush a rebellion of disappointed miners or evacuate civilians attacked by oversized bugs, you will find these games challenging and unusual compared standard battles.<br/><br/>The PMC 2640 rulebook is the first product of Assault Publishing to include an original background story. It contains a brief history of the future from 22nd to 27th century, a description of the rise and fall of the corporations, the genesis of PMCs, and many other events which allow you to get immersed in the world of the year 2640.<br/><br/>PMC 2640 is designed for scales between 15mm an 28mm, with 15mm as the default one. However, there is a possibility of using smaller scales (like 6mm, 10mm) using minor modifications included at the end of the book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Skydice we are two architects who are going to build a big city. Each arquitect must erect skyscrapers and improve the city skyline by making them bigger, but we must also try to improve our opponent's buildings in order to claim them as our own. To determine who owns each piece, some parts of the skyscraper will have the lights turned on, while the others will be turned off.<br/><br/>To achieve this, arquitects must stack dice vertically and horizontally in a fashion that will resemble, at the end of the game, a beautiful skyline with lights turned on and off, like a New York City night postcard.<br/><br/>The goal is to score more points than the adversary. The final score will depend on the number of skyscrapers we own, their height and the value of the dice. The top dice in each skyscraper is the one which determines who owns the building.<br/><br/>This game is designed for 2 players (or 4 players playing with 2 teams). Each player must roll 6 dice from their supply and one action dice. The latter indicates which action to play - start a new skyscraper, improve an existent one or demolish, and from the six-dice-roll the player must use only dice with the same value. There is one restriction, though, there cannot be two skyscrapers with either the same height or the same value next to each other.<br/><br/>Occasionally some special modifiers - King Kong, Godzilla, Hospital... - can be used to protect or increase the value of the skyscrapers.<br/><br/>Rules incorporate a solo variant for 1 player and another one for 3 players.<br/><br/><br/><br/>En Skydice somos dos arquitectos que conjuntamente vamos a levantar una ciudad, erigiendo nuestros edificios y mejorando en altura tanto nuestros edificios como los de nuestro rival (que pasar&aacute;n a ser nuestros). Los trozos de edificio de un jugador se distinguir&aacute;n por tener las ventanas apagadas, mientras que los del otro por tener las ventanas encendidas.Apilando los dados iremos formando edificios de distinta altura, de forma que el conjunto de edificios formar&aacute; un vistoso skyline (conjunto de rascacielos) con sus ventanas apagadas y encendidas como si fuera una postal nocturna de Nueva York.<br/><br/>El objetivo del juego es conseguir el mayor n&uacute;mero de puntos. Para ello, se tendr&aacute; en cuenta el n&uacute;mero de edificios de nuestra propiedad, la altura de los mismos y el valor de los dados de esos edificios. El &uacute;ltimo dado (dado superior) de cada edificio es el que determina el propietario del mismo (jugador con ventanas encendidas o jugador con ventanas apagadas).<br/><br/>El juego est&aacute; pensado para 2 jugadores (o 4 jugando en 2 equipos) Cada jugador tira 6 dados de su reserva y el dado de acci&oacute;n, realizando la acci&oacute;n indicada en &eacute;ste (construir, mejorar o demoler), para ello deber&aacute; utilizar todos los dados de un mismo valor, a su elecci&oacute;n, obtenidos en la tirada. Tambi&eacute;n se podr&aacute;n utilizar en ocasiones modificadores especiales como King Kong, Godzilla, Hospital... que proteger&aacute;n o dar&aacute;n m&aacute;s puntos a los edificios.<br/><br/>Las reglas del juego incorporan una variante en solitario para 1 jugador y otra para 3 jugadores.<br/><br/>",

The Allies, who determined this to be an offensive based on the Schlieffen Plan, set up as planned a line of defense along the Dyle river in Belgium. However, the German main force, the Army Group A's armored forces, broke through the Ardennes forest, contrary to the Allies' expectations, and advanced behind the Allied forces and advanced quickly in Northern France towards the English Channel.<br/><br/>The Rise of Blitzkrieg simulates the Fall of France. One player is the German, the other the Allies, and the game starts with operations plans. Can the German player trap the Allied player who knows the historical facts? Can the Allied player use its military strength to stop the German invasion? This game challenges the players' operational skills.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The emphasis in Blood Red Skies is on controlling a large number of planes at once. Action in the game is fast-paced, with no pre-plotting or book-keeping required. A smallish game of Blood Red Skies, with six planes per side, can be fought in forty-five minutes or less.<br/><br/>A force is comprised of iconic World War 2 fighter aircraft using the dynamic &lsquo;Advantage&rsquo; system. Opposing pilots can also use card-based aircraft traits, doctrines, Ace skills and theatre rules to make the most of their planes and fighting environment.<br/><br/>The Battle of Midway starter set contains everything you need to get playing, including rules, tokens, dice, game cards, and crucially 12 highly detailed Warlord Resin aircraft with which to battle.<br/><br/>The Grumman F4F Wildcat When the US Navy and Marine Corps entered the Second World War, they had only one effective fighter aircraft available to them: the F4F Wildcat. Fortunately, the Wildcat proved more than equal to the task of holding the line.<br/><br/>The Mitsubishi A6M2 &lsquo;Zero&rsquo; The Mitsubishi A6M Zero was a fast, modern fighter, but had no armour for the pilot. When the Zero (derived from the Japanese name Reisen - meaning Zero Fighter) was in the hands of aggressive and well-trained pilots this weakness was rarely apparent.<br/><br/>The US aircraft are provided in blue-coloured resin and the Japanese in white/cream, making your squadrons easily distinguishable and able to launch into furious tabletop dogfights even before you touch paint to model.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players need to have skill, attention and a bit of luck in order to gather on the board the three parts that are needed to complete each profession drawing. Besides the different drawings, the background color for each profession is also different in order to help the younger players to identify each of the parts for each of the professions so they can easily put together the complete set.<br/>The winner will be the one who can complete the most profession drawings.<br/><br/>",

I do not recognize the meaning of the word.&quot; &ndash; Margaret Thatcher April 1982, start of the Falklands War<br/><br/>In April of 1982, Argentina invaded the British sovereign territory of the Falkland Islands, in the South Atlantic. The Argentines had long claimed ownership of the islands, which they called Islas Malvinas. The unforeseen attack and occupation sparked international outrage, and Great Britain quickly mobilized a naval task force to retake the islands, 8,000 miles from home. Relying on the &eacute;lan of their professional and highly trained military personnel, the combined air, sea and land forces succeeded against the odds, victorious less than 80 days from the Argentine seizure of the islands. For the British, it was no less than a spectacular feat of arms.<br/><br/>A Feat of Arms is an expansion module for Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical: Heroes of the Falklands. Play 12 scenarios on six new X-Maps, including a new Port Stanley Map for a revised take on Operation Rosario, the initial Argentine invasion. Other new terrain includes rugged hills&mdash;for new battles on Mt. Harriet, Wireless Ridge and Sapper Hill&mdash;and a grass airfield, for the SAS&rsquo;s audacious raid on Pebble Island and the ferocious final action of the Battle of Goose Green. Across the islands, the bold British Paras and Royal Marines fought well-armed Argentine Army conscripts and Marines defending vital terrain and counterattacking upon lost ground. The conditions were harsh, with most of the fighting done at night, among minefields and under heavy mortar and artillery fire.<br/><br/>The Falklands War was a test of mettle.

Additionally the system allows you to have aliens and androids that act in an un-human fashion and not as men in rubber suits or tin cladding.<br/><br/>The rulebook also contains four diverse scenarios illustrating the flexibility of the system and appendices on models and figure availability for the game, and SF combat literature as a source of scenario ideas.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Charles Grant's The War Game is a classic set of rules for &quot;old school&quot; miniature wargaming. The rules first appeared as a series of articles in Tradition magazine, a UK production aimed at painters of miniature soldiers. The published version is a 191-page hardcover book.<br/><br/>The era covered by the rules is vaguely the Seven Years War, generally known as the &quot;Horse and Musket&quot; era. One interesting feature of the game is that rather than strictly portray the historical era, The War Game invites creating fictional armies of the period so players can give their own grandiloquent names to their units and paint them using their own uniform designs.<br/><br/>The scales used for the game are pretty fuzzy. The miniatures are used singly, i.e., not mounted in multiples on a base as in most miniature wargames. An infantry brigade of two regiments is roughly 100 single figures. Maneuvering your units can be tedious, but it's easy to adopt any formation.<br/><br/>The War Game not only provides a set of rules, but each chapter provides a great deal of philosophy behind the rule with the actual game mechanics stated simply at the end. For example, the actual rules for moving infantry are very simple, but Grant takes four pages, with a lot of reasoning and reference to historical sources, to come to them.<br/><br/>The War Game is far from concise. However, it's not just a set of rules, it's a great read from one of miniature wargaming's founders.<br/><br/>",

Whatever you find in the wasteland can be used to upgrade your weapons and armor, or as currency in the cities.<br/>Pirates, mercenaries and psychos attack the cities in an attempt to conquer them, to loot and steal as much scrap metal and technology as possibly can.<br/>Intro:<br/>The Last Mechs is a cooperative exploration game for 1 to 4 players, a dungeon crawler set in a post-apocalyptic future. Includes a campaign mode that will guide you through the adventure with a comic book illustrated by David Daza. <br/>Aside from the campaign, every hero will have their own short comic that narrates their personal stories, which you can unveil by searching for clues in the cities.<br/>With highly detailed pre-assembled miniatures ready to play.<br/>You can choose from 4 different heroes: Paul &ldquo;The Legend&rdquo; a former army man turned mercenary, Karl the mechanic with his D-Sherpa droid always by his side, Lorna and her large modified cargo Mech, and Gork the smuggler.<br/>The Last Mechs includes some RPG elements, since the heroes attributes include Mech piloting, repairing, exploring, and communications, and they can learn new skills by spending experience points.<br/>There are different phases in TLM:<br/>A travel phase, when one of the heroes must guide the group while trying to avoid the grave dangers that plague the wasteland.<br/>A search phase when you may look for scrap, electronics and cables (the most valued resources), or even find standard or lost tech weapons and armor that you can repair. Additionally, different adventures and events unrelated to the campaign may trigger during your journey.<br/>By the end of the travel phase, if you haven&rsquo;t reached a city, you must set camp on the dangerous wasteland and take shifts to guard the camp.<br/>During the guard phase, the heroes will decide how to split the guard rounds and will solve events in the dark of the wasteland. Also, the mechanic can repair the Mechs and the droid can build ammunitions.<br/>Your party will earn fame the longer you stay in the wasteland, which will give you benefits in the cities, but the danger levels will increase the longer you venture into the wasteland, making it harder for your team to survive.<br/>The few cities that still stand have metallic labyrinths that protect them from enemies, which you must pass through to access the cities.<br/>In the cities you will have access to: (depending on the city)<br/>1- Canteen: Find clues about your story and rumors.<br/>2- Doctor: Heal your heroes.<br/>3- Mech garage: Repair and upgrade your Mechs and equipment.<br/>4- Tattoo parlor: To get temporary boosts for your skills.<br/>5-Supplies: Purchase weapons and ammo.<br/><br/>Kickstarter Prelaunch:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/juegorama/last-mechs?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/juegorama/last-mechs?re...</a><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(Just a heads up though, life may be short and death unnatural).<br/><br/>To do that, you will need to gain popularity points by bribing or manipulating the voters. It comes at a cost of increasing depravity of public life and so the doomsday clock is set in motion! If you don't seize power before it reaches 100, the people will storm the palace gates and hang everyone.<br/><br/>The increasing depravity may not be all bad news. When the Depravity Meter reaches 70 there will be an opportunity for one of you to seize power as the leader of the revolutionary movement that will soon swallow everyone. Players can also seize power with the generals in a Coup d'&Eacute;tat or with Priesthood or with Business.<br/><br/>    winning conditions depend on the number of players<br/><br/><br/>Each player holds seven cards and plays 2 per turn. These and popularity can be used to buy cards from the Republic deck or to spite and stop the other players which raises the depravity which, as Depravity Meter reaches 70, gives one more opportunity, for those holding the Spirit of the Revolution card, to seize power as the leader of the people. There is a variety of cards in the deck, some can be used out of turn in reaction to another player&rsquo;s play adding more dynamic interaction to the game (you can foil someone else&rsquo;s plan by assassinating the Judge they needed to gain an Judiciary Institution with a Black Ops card, for example).<br/><br/>Like in politics, the effects of one&rsquo;s actions are not always 100% predicable: dice rolls) and as the Depravity Meter goes up past bomb-marked fields, the player causing the depravity has to draw a card from the Shit Happens deck which may adversely affect just them or everybody at the table (the logic being that the misdeeds withing the party affect the image of the whole party).

Whether baker, banker, teacher or housewife, these brave civilian men and women showed that resistance was not futile, rallying under the flag with the Croix de Lorraine. With less training and equipment than regular forces, and scrounging whatever they could, the Maquis carried out a shadow war on many fronts: printing and distributing underground propaganda, sabotaging enemy networks, aiding Allied pilots who had crashed behind enemy lines, and sending valuable intelligence to the British, risking their lives and retaliation, until France was finally liberated in December 1944.<br/><br/>Warfighter WWII: Expansion - #46 Maquis features Resistance fighters with missions and skills which reflect their methods of guerilla warfighting, with scrounged-up weapons and gear, stealthy movement, and unconventional objectives.

The limits of science have been overtaken, and now they wonder what can be done with their magnificent gifts. In order to counteract those who use their powers for the benefit of evil, her Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, has decided to act, and has enlisted the philanthropist and chemical engineer Ernest Solvay, to recruit the most loyal and capable men to her cause. So began one of the most exciting and bloody wars humanity has ever known.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/>Attack and beat your rivals.<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/>92 cards and rules.<br/><br/>PREPARATION<br/>The game can be played by any number of players from 2 or 5.  <br/>Divide the cards into three stacks:<br/>1- Scientists.<br/>2- Countries.<br/>3- Combats. <br/>Shuffle the three stacks separately. <br/>Deal the following cards to each player: 2 scientists, 2 countries, and 6 combats.<br/><br/>CARD MANAGEMENT<br/>Keep the unused stack of combat cards separately and face down on the game table, when the stack has no cards left, shuffle the discarded cards once again.<br/>The unused scientist and country cards should not be used.<br/><br/>YOUR HAND<br/>Before you start playing, each player must put their Scientist and Country face up on the table:<br/>Scientists&rsquo; cards: Two allies to attack with. The first value corresponds to the damage caused, and the second to the turns the player must rest after each attack. <br/>Countries cards: Places where you attack, the sum of the value indicates the life you have.<br/>Combat cards: Don&rsquo;t let your rivals see them.<br/><br/>BEGINNING AND END OF THE GAME.<br/>You can decide who starts however you chose, and follow in turns in a clockwise direction. At the end of each turn, you can&rsquo;t have more than 6 cards in your hand. The player who outlives the others is the winner.<br/><br/>STAGES IN EACH TURN<br/>Each turn has three stages:<br/>1- Combat action. You can use combat cards once only, if you don&rsquo;t want to combat, you can use your turn to discard the cards you don&rsquo;t want. <br/>2- Scientist action.

Its implementation is &quot;opaque&quot; &ndash; or black. This kind of system may exchange matter with its environment. The term originates from military signal engineering and originally designated enemy equipment that was not meant to be opened due to the danger of booby traps.<br/><br/>Similarly, or not at all, this game is new and different each time you play it. You know for sure that you will put some time in, and hopefully get some fun out of it. Rest assured, however, that no incendiary devices are included.<br/><br/>This game originates from the urge to create a versatile modular sandbox simulation of a boring Euro game, also known as cube-pusher, or JASE (just another soulless euro), with the aim to re-create any of these games, and mashing them up as preferred, or not. Luckily, it got a bit sidetracked in development and while I hope, or fear, its ancestry still shines through, it became more of a beast of its own.<br/><br/>Blackbox consists of a large number of Modules, all of which plug into the Proto Module, and the exact composition of which decides how the game you play this time actually works, which mechanisms you will get to use, how you will score and a variety of other variables.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Are you a hero?<br/><br/>Battlestations is a character-based adventure game of simultaneous ship-to-ship and boarding combat in space. Players work together against the forces controlled by the referee. Battlestations can be played as one-off missions or as part of an ongoing campaign. You'll track character's positions on the spaceship layouts and the ships' positions on the hex map. The action in Battlestations is literally character driven. If you want the ship to turn or speed up, a character has to take an action to make is so. If you want the ship's guns to fire at an enemy ship, a character has to take an action to fire the guns.<br/><br/>This is the rulebook only. You will need the full boxed game to play.<br/><br/>",

Command groups of regiments in climactic engagements or play the role of a commando on a secret and sensitive mission.<br/><br/>Put yourself to the test in 16 BattleTech, 3 BattleForce, and 2 MechWarrior scenarios from the Fourth Succession War.&quot;<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This scenario pack wasn't reprinted by FanPro, and doesn't appear to be on the list of possible reprints from Catalyst Game Labs as at Jan 11, making it difficult to find. Unlike the later BattlePack: Fourth Succession War, the scenarios are drawn predominantly from the BattleTech gamebooks and expansions, rather than the series of novels that covered the Fourth Succession War.<br/><br/>Despite having &quot;Volume One&quot; in the title, there doesn't seem to have ever been a Volume Two.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;RUS: Age of the Vikings&quot; is a strongly themed military and economic strategy wargame set in Viking Age Russia, in which up to 5 players compete to become Czar of the Rus.  It deliberately sets out to marry the elegant inclusivity of Eurogames with the thematic gameplay of a classic Amerigame.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose 6 of 9 Actions that drive the game.  Will you send out Envoys to engage in Diplomacy, Harvest your crops, Trade with foreign powers, Construct settlements, invest in Culture &amp; Technology or Recruit troops to engage in warfare?  The player who chooses the Action gains a bonus, but all other players simultaneously take part in each Action Phase that is chosen.<br/><br/>It is possible to win the game without ever engaging in warfare, but for those who prefer blood, combat uses a Tactics Card system which means you have to out-think your opponent to beat them in battle.<br/><br/>As in history, Politics Cards provide a random element, introducing new Kingdoms (like the Muscovites or the Golden Horde) or triggering good harvests, famine and ultimately the Black Death.<br/><br/>The first player to score 8 Victory Points wins the game, but if the Black Death is triggered before this happens, all Kingdoms are hit by the plague.  The survivors then take stock to see who is the most powerful in the new world that emerges.<br/><br/>With virtually no down-time and multiple routes to victory, RUS: Age of the Vikings provides a dynamic strategic experience within a playing time of about 30 mns per player.<br/><br/>",

The raid, conducted as revenge for the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor four months earlier, caused little damage but was a harbinger of the destruction from the air that was destined to befall the islands of Japan&hellip;<br/><br/>By 1944, US forces had seized island bases in the Marianas close enough to Japan to employ the new long range B29 Superfortresses in a high-stakes strategic bombing campaign against Japanese industries and cities. So began the short (late 1944 until August 1945) but incredibly destructive life of the United States Army Air Force&rsquo;s (USAAF&rsquo;s) 20th Air Force.<br/><br/>Your objective as you take command of the 20th Air Force in September 1944 is nothing short of reducing Japan&rsquo;s cities, large and small, to smoldering rubble! To do it you&rsquo;ve got the powerful and sophisticated B29, in ever increasing numbers and with flight crews improving in combat and navigation skills, and a research effort you direct to develop more and more sophisticated weapons. While initially you must focus on clearing the sky of Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) fighters and blasting Japanese war industries with high explosive bombs, eventually you will develop incendiary bombs which rapidly reduce Japan&rsquo;s combustible wooden and paper cities to ashes, and their dispersed war industries to ruins. Simultaneously, demolish her ports and kamikaze bases, and mine her waters. In the meantime, research marches on, perhaps you will obtain the ultimate weapon, the Atomic Bomb? Hopefully you will, because you are in a race against time &ndash; if Japan can hold out long enough the US will have to launch &ldquo;Operation Olympic&rdquo;, the costly planned invasion of Japan, and your strategic bombing campaign will have failed.<br/><br/>",

Be that nobody and become a somebody.<br/><br/>Grim(m) World is a solo open-world card game set in the fairy tale world of the Brothers Grimm. Here you play an ordinary person who sets out to experience adventure. The player is not told how his journey should look like. He is free to decide where he goes and what he wants to do. Maybe he wants to accumulate trade and wealth? Or does he want to make a name for himself as a bounty hunter? Maybe he also wants to save Little Red Riding Hood from the bad wolf or even help the wolf hunting Little Red Riding Hood. The world reacts and changes based on your decisions. Are you ready for this adventure?<br/><br/>Grim(m) World is based on the OWCS (Open World Card System). The OWCS is a system to simulate an Open World as a card game. An encounter deck with multi-use cards serves as a random encounter, as an object deck, it triggers quests, dice rolls are simulated, it defines prices for trading and it simulates the time in the game world. An additional quest deck simulates the living world in the game. Depending on the time in the game, new missions appear or disappear, events happen or the world changes. Additionally, your own character can be leveled up and becomes stronger and stronger as the game progresses. The battles in the game are fought on a grid field laid out with cards. Your hand cards serve as life points and determine the character's possible actions during a fight.

Their goal was to show there was no loss in morale among the insurgents since Osama bin Laden's death. They attacked Afghanistan forces with RPG's and suicide bombers, with a high focus on government buildings. Their increased numbers were due to a prison escape 2 weeks earlier from Sarposa Prison, from which they gained skilled fighters and bombs experts. Fighting commenced over several days, ending when Afghan police forced a little over two dozen Taliban militants back into a hotel, where Afghan police opened fire from rooftops, showing the Insurgents that they will not allow the Taliban to rise back to power in Kandahar.<br/><br/>Warfighter Modern Expansion - #50 Kandahar  includes Afghanistan Soldiers, Weapons, Missions, Objectives, and Locations specific to this Battle as well as Elite RPG Teams, and Suicide Bombers.

When Katrina Steiner gave them a contract, the Hounds wasted no time becoming one of the most feared and respected merc units in the Inner Sphere.<br/><br/>It was not the first or last time that the fate of the Kells would become intricately bound up with House Steiner. Morgan Kell helped to save Katrina's life during an assassination plot even before she became Archon. Then it was an inheritance from Katrina's husband Arthur, a cousin of the Kells, that permitted the brothers to finance their dream of founding a merc unit. Much later, Patrick Kell gave his life to rescue Melissa Steiner, heir to the Lyran throne and Hanse Davion's fiancee, when she was kidnapped by agents of the Draconis Combine.<br/><br/>The Kell Hounds played key roles in Davion history, too. They were there when Yorinaga Kurita killed Ian Davion on Mallory's World. They held off the Second Sword of Light long enough for Davion forces to recover the Prince's body, but Kurita escaped.<br/><br/>From that day, Yorinaga Kurita and the Kell Hounds were destined to face one another in a series of climactic battles. When Morgan and Yorinaga dueled in one of these, a legend was born. The mystical nature of that battle left Morgan so shaken that he disbanded most of his regiment and joined a monastery.<br/><br/>The Kell Hounds survived under the leadership of Patrick Kell. After Yorinaga killed Patrick on Styx, Morgan Kell came out of exile to rebuild his unit. He knew it was only a matter of time before he and Yorinaga would meet again on a day of final reckoning.<br/><br/>The Kell Hounds is a scenario pack containing 11 BattleTech, 2 BattleForce, and 2 MechWarrior scenarios. It also provides personality profiles on the principal members of the Kell Hounds, a unit roster, and a history of the unit.&quot;<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>These scnearios cover the period in time between the formation of the Kell Hounds and the opening of the Fourth Succession War. It also contains more scenarios than preceeding scenario packs, despite being only 63 pages long.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Leipzig, fought in 1813, is one of the largest conflicts ever and involved many countries / kingdoms fighting against each other.  This included a coalition of Russia, Prussia and Austria committed to defeat France and its allies, forging a domination of Europe that would lead to the Nationalism of Germany. While historians have drawn a myriad of contrary opinions about who were the good guys and bad guys, the battle encircles the city of Leipzig with 500,000 man armies facing each other.<br/><br/>The sheer size of this conflict can truly test a designer&rsquo;s skill when representing it at a battalion level. However, Leipzig is actually a series of smaller battles fought west, east, south and north of Leipzig as the Coalition armies concentrically move toward the City. La Bataille de M&ouml;ckern 1813 is the battle north of Leipzig.<br/><br/>M&ouml;ckern focuses on the raging struggle for this northern town which guards the passable roads to Leipzig moving south. As such, Napoleon entrusted the defense to Marshal Marmont and his VI Corps. In addition to veteran troops, Marmont has conscripts and sailors recently removed from the ports. Supporting Marmont is the III Cavalry Corps of de Casanova.<br/><br/>Coming down on this position is the Coalition&rsquo;s Army of Silesia commanded by Marshal von Bl&uuml;cher. This army has a Prussian Corps, a Russian Corps and a Russian Cavalry Corps. The Prussians are fresh from several victories including holding Berlin. The Russians are somewhat smaller units given their casualties in 1812. However the Russians have a strong contingent of Cossacks and line cavalry.<br/><br/>The player will note immediately the differences in the Coalition formations and how each must be managed to achieve success. The French, Prussians and Russians Corps all operate a little differently injecting some real historical significance to the simulation and advancing the player&rsquo;s skills as Corps Commanders.<br/>Marmont held and lost the town of M&ouml;ckern several times in this battle while the cavalry of Casanova held back the Russians. The fighting was intense, and continued into the dusk and evening hours.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/><br/>New rules for the players to consider are the effects of Elite Units, Landwehr skirmishing, Russian Dragoon&rsquo;s abilities, improved towns, dusk combat, the loyalties of certain units, command structures and plundering. Besides the historical battle, four scenarios are included. These provide for a cavalry on cavalry only battle, inspired attacks by von Bluecher and the ability to jump into combat for the struggle of Moeckern itself.

        "description": "PLEASE NOTE: This game description is out-of-date and needs to be updated.<br/><br/>Sturm Europa! is a strategy game for one to five players that depicts World War 2 in Europe. Euro-style wooden pieces are used to depict resources, that depending on placement, represent air, land, and sea units. Each player has a privacy screen that creates &quot;fog of war&quot; by keeping resources and units not on the front line hidden.  Sturm Europa! will distinguish itself from other games of the genre in these key areas:<br/><br/>Playability:  The entire war, Fall 1939 to the bitter end (Spring 1945 or later), can be played in 6-8 hours. No hexes, no counters, and low luck.<br/><br/>Scale:  The map board employs area movement over land regions but the low unit density allows players to realize the full impact of mobile warfare and appreciate the daunting size of Mother Russia without slowing game play unnecessarily.  A unique front-reserve combat system allows for operational level details like blitzes, assaults, encirclements, feints, static defense, and defense in depth which are normally lost in grand-strategic simulations.<br/><br/>Units:  Units are not only rated by movement, but attrition, assault, and blitz strength.  Elite units are created by combat experience, events, and tech research - introducing an extra dimension as units are upgraded and downgraded throughout the war, reflecting varying levels of experience, training, leadership, and technology.<br/><br/>Production:  Sturm Europa! goes beyond the standard model of linking military production to a GDP estimate.  Nations must mobilize to achieve full wartime production but it takes much more to wage war than just massive production lines.  Manpower, oil, steel, and even trained pilots are all tracked without ANY bookkeeping through an innovative system of collecting resources as strategy cards are played.  Resources are consumed by prolonged offensives so logistics plays just as much a factor as unit strength.<br/><br/>Strategy Cards:  Sturm Europa! is a card driven game (i.e. Paths of Glory). Events introduce historical and political events in a realistic fashion while eliminating scripting and &quot;look up&quot; rules.  There is a tangible cause-effect relationship to every event and nothing occurs in a seemingly random or ahistorical manner.  Players play the cards - the cards don't play the players.  Most importantly, the core mechanic of tough gut-wrenching decisions which make CDGs so fun is still preserved.<br/><br/>Technology: Players can customize their units to fight the style of war that best suits their strategy. Germany can develop the He 100 long range fighter that greatly improves their chances in the Battle of Britain. The Americans can develop a heavy-medium tank instead of sending Shermans to get chewed up by King Tigers. Tough decisions will have to be made to implement new technologies though. New designs don't just start rolling off the assembly lines without causing a shortage of replacements on the front line while the factories retool and crews retrain...<br/><br/>TENTATIVE COMPONENT LIST:<br/>(1) 867x668mm six-panel mounted map<br/>(4) storage boxes<br/>(4) player mats<br/>(500) stickered wooden blocks<br/>(150) 2&quot; double-sided strategy tiles<br/>(1) embroidered draw bag<br/>(84) intel and technology cards<br/>(150) 5/8&quot; punchboard counters<br/>(10) custom 6-sided dice<br/>(1) 16-page full-color rulebook<br/><br/>Can be combined with Days of Infamy<br/><br/>",

The P-51s were used by the USAAF's Eighth Air Force to escort bombers in raids over Germany. The RAF's 2 TAF and the USAAF's Ninth Air Force used them as fighter-bombers, roles in which the Mustang helped to achieve air superiority in 1944. This aircraft was used in North Africa, Mediterranean Sea and Italy. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft included John Landers, Williams Saks and Spurgeon Ellington.

It ended the dominance of German aviation, known as the &ldquo;Fokker Scourge,&rdquo; and gave air superiority to France during the battle of Verdun. The Nieuport 11 performed well in combat thanks to its excellent inherent speed, rate&ndash;of&ndash;climb, and agility.

Is it worth the risk?<br/><br/>Then, the Development Phase carries out the battle for survival. Each soldier in play has different stats and actions to use in combat, and each side has their own items to turn the tide of the game. Watch out! Some cards represent events of the Russian Winter, which will reduce the Life Pool... Even worse! In the interlude of the rounds, the white hell falls and will take some soldiers... But don't worry! Reinforcements will arrive.<br/><br/>Rounds continue until one of the Sides decides to surrender, or until the Final Breath round, where the final soldiers will attempt their last shots, or die trying.

In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card they like, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as they like; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!<br/><br/>",

A high rank allows you to issue orders to other players but also makes you a target for assassination if discovered. If your rank is low you can try to bluff.<br/>With limited ammunition and information, you will have to use wits and trickery to identify your allies and outsmart your opponents in this suspenseful social deduction game for 5-12 players.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each player starts with two secret cards: an Identity and a Rank, as well as 3 Health and 1 Ammo tokens. <br/>Play proceeds in turns, with each player having 2 Action Points to spend. There are several Actions players can take in their turn to increase their Ammo, give it away, or spend it to shoot other players. A special action called &quot;Issuing an Order&quot; or simply &quot;Order&quot; is also available, where a player can attempt to force another player to either carry out one of the aforementioned Actions, or privately show which side they are on.<br/><br/>However, the recipient of an Order can refuse, in which case the two players secretly compare Ranks, and the higher Rank wins out.<br/><br/>A player is dead when they lose all of their Health Tokens. A dead player does not reveal their identity, but can make a final statement. Their Rank and Ammo are given to the player that killed them.<br/><br/>Play ends when either the Usurper has gained the highest Rank in the game, or all players have passed. The Loyalists win by outnumbering Rebels at the end, and vice-versa. In case of a tie, the highest Rank breaks the tie.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The series&rsquo; action begins in 1985, and brings to life the troops, tanks, artillery, and aircraft of that time period, as conflict erupts around the globe.<br/><br/>These Core Rules are designed to be used with every game in the series, and so, once learned, you will be able to play any game in the series. Individual game Volumes (also called Modules, but each is, in fact, a complete standalone game) may add rules for use in that module, and individual scenarios may introduce rules that apply only to that scenario. But the Core Rules remain the same.<br/>When in doubt, Module Rules override the Core Series rules and Scenario Rules (SRs) override both the Core Series and Module Rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The East Germans were well prepared to attack and conquer West Berlin. Every step of the process was thoroughly planned. The Battle was to take no more than three days. From the crack Friedrich Engels Guard Regiment to the 1st Motorized Rifle Division &ndash; as well as paramilitary forces of the Socialist Unity Party, East Germany was ready. The Soviets had their own elite force of the 6th Separate Guards Motor Rifle Brigade in East Berlin, ready to join the fight. And, if anything went astray in the plans, the massive 35th Motorized Rifle Division was 10 miles away to the west and available to intervene if needed. The Warsaw Pact forces massively outnumbered the isolated NATO forces.<br/><br/>But NATO was not ill prepared for what might come. The well-equipped and famous &ldquo;Berlin Brigade&rdquo; of the US Army, The Berlin Infantry Brigade of the UK, and The Forces Fran&ccedil;aises &agrave; Berlin from the French Army. Three strong brigades fully armed with tanks, infantry fighting vehicles, and artillery. In addition, the numerous, if less well equipped, West German Police forces were to stand with their NATO Allies. It would perhaps be a stiffer fight than the East German planners were envisioning. The Stage was set.<br/><br/>The Enemy is at the Gates is the second installment of the Modern War series using the well-regarded Company Scale System. Players will fight this might-have-been battle using mostly companies at 500 meters a hex scale. Each turn is 2 hours, and the game uses a &ldquo;chit-pull&rdquo; system that makes for both unpredictable face-to-face play as well as an excellent solitaire experience. The maps are painstakingly and meticulously drawn by Antonio Pinar providing perhaps the best major urban map ever made. Greg Sarnecki is also on board to provide the most exacting order of battle also ever made for this campaign. This is the ultimate game of modern urban warfare on a massive scale. As befits a game on modern war, air power, helicopters, electronic warfare, chemical weapons, and sabotage will be included as well. Using all your weapons effectively will determine who wins the battle for Berlin!<br/><br/>&ndash;Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Dozens of orcs, humans, elves and dwarves swarm the city asking for a chance to settle and develop their neighborhoods, but of course you are not just being a good neighbor: When they finish the city gates, the city will be over and a new mayor will be elected. If the residents that came for your help control the streets and neighborhoods, your place on the throne will be granted.<br/><br/>Each turn in Baa&rsquo;Beel the main player must buy one of the available tiles (buildings, houses or natural), then place one of their tiles in the map of Baa'Beel. Then the second player moves two inhabitants from their pool to one house in the city. In this moment, the adjacent inhabitants that don't get along with the races of the new inhabitant leave their houses, e.g., elves make dwarves leave their houses, humans make elves leave their houses, etc.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players control the houses in which they have the majority of inhabitants and the buildings for which they have the most adjacent houses controlled by them. Players obtain points from controlling houses and buildings, as well as for certain tiles, and whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thirteen official plexes grace the continental jewel that is India. The largest is the Bengali Mahaplex with over 274 million citizens living within its walls. And every last one of them is a fan of Fury! Developed decades ago as the very first exotic Slaughterball team, Fury is a perennial favorite not just in India, but in all 72 metroplexes. Their distinctive feline beauty and grace, coupled with the savagery of their gameplay, has earned them a place in seven of the last ten Slaughterbrawls.<br/><br/>Fury&rsquo;s greatest strength, their savage claws that can rip other neohumans to shreds, are also their greatest weakness. These felinoids are very inept at handling the ball, and their razors are the worst shooters in the league. Fortunately, Fury razors are also the fastest, so they can usually get pretty close to the goals to take easy shots.<br/><br/>So, you&rsquo;re not going to win on goals. You better pounce on your opponents and do some damage. Thanks to the Savagery skill, you&rsquo;ll be racking up the slaughter points. Don&rsquo;t save those reactive cards (Penalty, Lost Momentum, etc.). You need to be sacrificing your cards to send opponents to the Slaughter Box early. Soon enough your opponents will team up against you to eliminate your butchers and slashers. So, attack with them early and often.<br/><br/>",

Their focus is on &quot;adding games,&quot; including Nim, Hackenbush, and Kayles.  The inclusion of many examples helps the reader to put the mathematical analysis to immediate use.<br/><br/>In Volume 2, the authors have a Change of Heart and bend the rules of Volume 1 to apply them to games that may continue indefinitely or in which &quot;winning&quot; is not necessarily making the last move, such as Cut-cake and Loopy Hackenbush.<br/><br/>In Volume 3, the authors examine Games played in Clubs, giving case studies for coin and paper-and-pencil games, such as Dots and Boxes and Nimstring.<br/><br/>In Volume 4, the authors present a Diamond of a find, covering one-player games such as Solitaire and ponder subjects and questions such as, Purging Pegs Properly, Pursuing Puzzles Purposefully, and What is Life?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epic monster pack for Deep Madness.<br/><br/>It rises majestically before you, enthroned on its towering rocky seat. A scepter crowned with otherworldly fire burns like a maddening beacon in the night, its multitudes of thick, meaty tentacles coiling, curling, and whipping against the slimy, barnacle-encrusted stone of its dais. Staring in wonder at its magnificence, you can't help but sink to your knees. Tears well up over your eyelids and streak down your face. Reaching a hand up, you wipe them away and wonder briefly how your hands became streaked with blood.<br/><br/>Around you the world shimmers and shakes, reality slowly fracturing as the king's court assembles from the cracks in-between the worlds. The creeping courtiers pantomime and cavort, their movements flowing into an eldritch play that would drive even the sanest person into gibbering fits. You begin to laugh, clapping your hands, as your face starts to harden. A symbol shimmers in the air: the sign of the king.<br/><br/>As the courtiers collect you to offer you as a gift to the king, you realize that all of reality is nothing but a stage, and life a production of little more than sound and fury. Meanwhile the audience, beings beyond time and dimensions, look on in laughter and callous impassivity. As the king begins to feast you realize you desperately want to weep, but you can no longer move your mouth to make the sounds. Your face has become a rigid mask. Leaning down, the king removes it for you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You can play Monstrology with 2-8 people. Each round takes about 5 minutes, with a recommendation of at least 2 rounds per player. The game requires both sides of your brain to work together, as you'll have to blend your imagination and deduction skills in order to succeed.<br/><br/>At the core of the game are 84 illustrated imaginary monster cards, depicting some of the most beautiful, strange, unique monsters you have ever encountered. The game also includes twelve taxonomy boards that will allow you to categorize and identify these delightful, unsettling creatures.<br/><br/>A simplified explanation of the game:<br/><br/>1. One player - the &quot;subject&quot; of a monstrological investigation - randomly and secretly selects an imaginary monster from the deck of monster cards.<br/><br/>2. The subject fills out a &quot;taxonomy board&quot; in order to give the other players (the &quot;investigators&quot;) a sense of his or her monster.  The subject cannot communicate with the other players in any other way - no facial expressions or hand gestures!<br/><br/>3. The subject places his or her monster in a lineup with other imaginary monsters (i.e. more cards).<br/><br/>4. The investigators attempt to deduce which monster belongs to the subject. Lively discussion ensues as the investigators attempt to convince each other that &quot;this monster looks like he'd prefer flies to gerbils&quot;, or &quot;are you kidding? that monster would be terrible at babysitting!&quot;<br/><br/>5. The more investigators who select the correct monster, the more points the team scores.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The tea ceremony lies at the heart of Japanese culture, giving life the most essential and elemental concepts of hospitality, respect, and Zen philosophy. There, they believe that tea, which came from China in the 13th century, resolved the health problems of the Buddhist monks who drank it. Over the years, the tea ceremony evolved to offer the samurai a place of calm, far from the chaos of the battlefield.<br/><br/>In The White Castle: Matcha, you will have to deal with a new place in which to influence the court using new members of your clan. Having members of your clan in good seats within the Chashitsu (tea room) will help you achieve a greater level of influence within the court of Himeji. Also, you will have one additional action each round. Will that be enough?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is designed by Max Brooke (Star Wars: X-Wing 2nd Edition, Legend of the Five Rings RPG) with Luke Eddy (Star Wars: Legion).<br/><br/>Generational Storytelling<br/>In Stonesaga, you unfold the epoch-spanning story of the people of a remote glacial valley, guiding multiple generations of characters who make a life there amidst harsh conditions, wondrous mysteries, and giant monsters.<br/><br/>Each game session covers one generation of people within a society, continuing from the last and permanently changing the valley in various ways based on in-game events and the players&rsquo; decisions.<br/><br/>Cooperative Survival<br/>Stonesaga follows a certain rhythm: faced by a new opportunity or crisis, the people of the valley must meet their society&rsquo;s new needs. Meanwhile, the valley&rsquo;s other inhabitants &ndash; immortal beasts &ndash; will seek to fulfill their own needs as their instincts dictate. You will have to navigate both sets of challenges, using might, dexterity, conviction, and awareness to survive as a tribe in the wild.<br/><br/>Crafting &amp; Building<br/>Stonesaga introduces a completely new discovery based crafting mechanic. Do you think that a sharpened stone and stick could combine to create a spear? Use the crafting action and find out. You will need to discover the properties of various crafting materials as you expand your crafting &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; knowledge.<br/><br/>Work together as a community to build your village together. From a simple fire pit and tent to a forge and library, create a civilization that lasts the generations.<br/><br/>Exploration &amp; Discovery<br/>Stonesaga rewards exploration and chooses to let you experience the world in a unique way each play session. Working on the established rules of the world, you will discover unique materials, monsters, and areas of the world that you won&rsquo;t be directed towards. Stonesaga lets the curious and inquisitive thrive.<br/><br/>Persistence<br/>Designed for drop-in, drop-out play and flexible playgroup availability, Stonesaga can be played by one group from start to finish, played with a rotating cast, or even passed between groups seamlessly. Components are sometimes permanently altered, but never removed or discarded entirely.<br/><br/>",

On the box it says The GRANT Building.<br/><br/>A simple simulation of an football game. The game has taken 14 years to develop, but it is so simplified you can learn to play it in just one minute.<br/>The equipment consists of two boards, three wooden dice, five wooden pegs, a &quot;Bakelite&quot; football and a 10 yard marker.<br/>First - Call your play (line plunge, off tackle, end run...)<br/>Second - Throw three dice and the results are always read from low to the high number. 5-4-1 will read 145.<br/>Third - look on the Signal chart to see what happens to the ball.<br/>The player must gain 10 yards in four downs or lose the ball.<br/>When the ball touches or goes over the Goal Line it is a Touchdown.<br/><br/>I have the Game and played the game with my friend Mike about every night doing the football seasons, from 1943-1952.  I feel it was a fantastic game and very simple to play, and there were over 1500 different combinations of plays you could make, which made it a very realistic game.  If you would like a copy of the game, just e-mail me, you would need to suppy about 5 push pins, and a 10 yard marker, and marker for the football.  This game is very rare, as it was made in 1941, but to me still a great game, also you would need 3 dice.<br/>jdlaughead@gmail.com<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dubbed &quot;A Tactical Sailing Game&quot;, Windshifts uses a novel game system combined with unusual components to recreate international yacht racing.<br/><br/>The board is randomly created as the race develops using 19 plastic map cards that lock together. The race is in three segments; a windward leg, a downwind leg, and then another windward leg to the finish line. As portions of the race are completed, the map cards from that segment are returned to the draw pile to be reused later in the game.<br/><br/>There are no spaces on the board. The direction and strength of the wind are indicated by lines on the plastic map cards. The distance a ship moves is determined by the wind strength and the ship's bearing in relation to the wind direction.<br/><br/>The ships have clear plastic bases with a numbered wheel mounted in the center. The ships' bases have lines molded into them that are aligned with the lines on the map cards to establish the bearing of a ship. As the ship is moved across the map, the wheel in the center turns, and each number on the wheel indicates one unit of movement.  On a map card with strong wind indicated a ship bearing on a beat, broad reach or downwind moves 4 units or one complete revolution of the wheel.  A beam reach bearing generates 6 units of movement.  On a map card with light wind indicated, the movements are half.<br/><br/>A plastic &quot;windshadow&quot; card is used to determine when an opposing boat is in &quot;disturbed air&quot; - this differs based on whether the boats are on the downwind or windward (upwind) leg.  The sail of a ship will cause the air downwind (behind) of it to move in weak chaotic swirl patterns, the sail effectively blocks the wind from supplying power to any other boat following downwind  within about 1 1/2 boat lengths.  In the game, the &quot;windshadow&quot; card is used to determine if one boat has blocked the wind from powering another boat.  If this is the case, the movement of the blocked boat is reduced.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes one of each player piece, and puts them behind the screen in front of him.  One player is Tod, the other NO.  Tod chooses 2 of his 5 player pieces and puts them on the table in front of his screen.<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Each player secretly chooses 2 of his player pieces, excluding those placed in front of the screen (i.e. on turn 1 Tod has a choice of 3 pieces, NO a choice of 5).  The player with 5 pieces may not choose the exact pair in front of the screen of the other player (either one may be chosen, but not both pieces).  The chosen pieces are simultaneously revealed, and put in front of the player screens.<br/><br/>Resolving Movement<br/><br/><br/>     No pieces match.  Each board piece that corresponds to a selected player piece may move one space.  (Four board pieces move)<br/>     One piece is matched. Each board piece that corresponds to a non-matched, selected player piece may move up to two spaces.  (Two board pieces move).<br/>     Both pieces match.  No board piece is moved.<br/><br/><br/>Board pieces are moved in the sequence given in the Set-up Table, by the player who selected the corresponding player piece.  Each board piece moves from point to point on the grid.  No piece may pass through another piece or share a grid point.<br/><br/>The player with 4 player pieces in front of his screen now puts all his pieces behind his screen.<br/><br/>The turn sequence is now repeated with players choosing two of their remaining player pieces, simultaneously revealing them and doing any allowed moves they choose.<br/>Play continues in this way until one or other player wins the game.<br/><br/>The Story of the Nibelungenlied<br/><br/>The Nibelungenlied is an epic poem written in Germany about 1200AD, though its sources are far older.  It tells how the peerless prince Siegfried from Xanten in the Netherlands, comes to Worms to court the beautiful Kriemhild.  However, King Gunther and his two brothers jealously guard their sister Kriemhild.  Gunther wishes to win the hand of Brunhild of Iceland, but she will only marry the man who can win three contests against her mighty strength.  Gunther and Siegfried strike a pact, whereby Siegfried will help Gunther win Brunhild's hand and in return he may marry Kriemhild.  Using his magic cloak, Siegfried secretly assists Gunther to defeat Brunhild, both on the field and in the bedchamber.  Unfortunately, Siegfried keeps Brunhild's ring and girdle, and ultimately bestows them upon his wife Kriemhild.  A small grievance leads the queens to fight, the ring and girdle are produced, and Brunhild is humiliated.   She enlists Hagen, the chief vassal of Gunther, to help her get vengeance, and Gunther and Hagen murder Siegfried while out hunting.  Kriemhild swears to exact revenge, marries the recently widowed King Etzel (Attila the Hun) and finally invites Hagen and her brothers to Attila's court, where in a crescendo of battle and blood, everyone dies and honour is redeemed.<br/><br/>Siegfried and Brunhild are clearly destined for each other, and in older versions of the story he is betrothed to her, but is bewitched away by Kriemhild.  The Natural Order would be that Brunhild is won fairly and that Siegfried may marry any woman that he chooses.  The forces of Tragic Destiny twist the natural order so that Brunhild is tricked by Gunther and Siegfried, or that Hagen and Gunther murder Siegfried to obtain his magic cloak.<br/><br/>",

Buy low, sell high, but stay alert and watch out, or the bottom might drop out and you might not get a chance to jump off!<br/><br/>Players move around the board. With each move the prices of the fourteen items change. Players take their turns as fast as they can with two people moving at once so prices change rapidly. Any player can buy or sell at any time regardless of whose turn it is to move. Sales are kept track of with pegboards with rows for each item. When a player makes a transaction it isn't finalized until the proper peg is moved. If the price changes in the middle of the transaction the player is bound by the new price. The richest player at the end wins.<br/><br/>This is a very fast paced game with a lot to keep track of. You have to be sharp or you'll be left behind.

        "description": "More Battle for China is an expansion set for Battle for China, a simulation game on the &quot;War of Resistance Against Japan&quot;, produced by the Microgame Design Group in 1999. The original game covered the period from 1937 to 1941. This expansion kit covers the period from 1942 to 1945, completing the Pacific War, and on into the 1945-49 Civil War period.<br/><br/>There are three scenarios in this expansion set:<br/><br/>Pacific War (1942-45): The Pacific War scenario can be played on its own or as an extension of the Basic game. In this scenario, the Chinese player will control all KMT, CCP, Western Allies, and Soviet units. The Japanese player will control all IJA and puppet troops units. Optionally, there may be a third player who controls all CCP units.<br/><br/>Civil War (1946-49): For two players. The board has been cleared of foreign invaders; now begins the fight to determine who will rule the Chinese people.<br/><br/>Campaign Game(1937-49). For two or three players. Play begins in mid-1937 with the Basic Game, continues on until the Japanese surrender in China, and thence to the end of the resumed civil war between the Nationalists and Communists.<br/><br/>There are two 8.5 x 11&quot; half-maps extending the original map north to Siberia and south to India. 140 additional counters add more Communist Chinese, extra Japanese, Western Allied and Soviet units.<br/><br/>The expansion kit was once made by the Microgame Design Group, which is now defunct. The components of the kit are now made available as a free download by the game's designer.<br/><br/>June 2009: The expansion kit has been included in &quot;Battle for China Deluxe&quot;, a special edition of the game by Fiery Dragon Productions. The package includes:<br/><br/>- 44-page integrated rulebook for all three games, with coil binding<br/>- two red dice<br/>- 12 cards for the various charts and tables for the three games<br/>- 5 sheets of counters, for a total of 480 counters - consisting of the three sheets for the original game, and two new ones for the expansion. Counters might still be a bit thin for some tastes (but then they would not fit in the box) but the diecutting is good.<br/>- 3 maps, the original 11x17&quot; central map plus the north and south 8x11&quot; extensions (Siberia-Manchuria and Siam-Burma-India, respectively). The North map matches up well and obviously. For the South map the area north of Burma-1 is Burma-3, and the area north of Burma-2 is Burma-4. The unnamed area north of India-8 is Nepal and is impassable.<br/><br/>This was the last version of Battle for China to appear before the Decision Games edition of the basic 1937-41 game in late 2009. Production of the deluxe version is limited, fewer than 125 copies I believe.<br/><br/>When the Decision Games edition appears, the designer will post an updated and integrated set of rules and charts here, along with homemade redrawn extension maps to fit the larger 22x34&quot; map. The counter sheets provided here do not need to be changed, but be advised that the counters in the Decision Games edition have been changed to iconic style, with a different format.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An ambitious card game based on elements of Hearts, Bridge, Spades, and Pinochle. The deck consists of six suits ranging from 0 to 15, a High Rooler card, a Low Rooler card, and two blank cards.<br/><br/>The game is usually played with teams. Players bid in five-point increments from 170 to 300. After everyone passes once, the winner chooses two trump suits. High Trump beats all other suits, even Low Trump. Low Trump beats all suits but High Trump. The Roolerz now take their positions as least powerful, yet most valuable cards in their respective trumps.<br/><br/>Gameplay proceeds like most other trick taking games. Ordinarily, the highest card in the lead suit wins the trick. The only exception is when trump is played. In that case, the highest trump card wins the trick.<br/><br/>The blank card may be played at any time, regardless of what suit was led or how many cards of that suit the player has.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, points are tallied. Points are only given to players who have the following cards: 15 (scores 15 points), 14 (scores 10 points), 10 (scores 10 points), 5 (scores 5 points), and the two Rooler cards (30 points each). All other cards are worth zero points.<br/><br/>A team is set if it fails to win as many points as it bid. The first team to reach 1000 points wins.<br/><br/>For 2-, 3-, and 5-player games use a dummy hand. In 4-player games there are two teams of two, and in 6-player games, there are two teams of three.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Covers the unique situation in Iraq during WW2. The recent coup could provide the Germans with a ripe opportunity to step into the Middle East. The Iraqis requested German support when the British violated an agreement made in 1931 restricting British troops on Iraqi soil. Instead, the British created a major airbase at Habbinaya, east of Baghdad. In late April, the Iraqis began attacking the airbase with their 70 aircraft, 28 artillery guns and 20mm AA. The small British force had only obsolete aircraft to defend with and opposed by 5000 Iraqi troops. However, the Iraqi morale was low and it was hoped that the Luftwaffe would change this. Thus, began a month long battle. Hitler was preoccupied with events and only agreed to sent a &quot;token&quot; force to support the Iraqis commanded by Captain Junck. Junck had the job of stopping the advancing British relief force, destroying the Habbinaya airbase and raising Iraqi morale so their troops would occupy it.<br/><br/>The game comes with 150+ counters, various air displays, ground movement charts, ground and air units, 24 cards and 15 pages of rules. Both players will secretly plan their aircraft and ground units and hope everything then works out during the game turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Manufacturer:<br/><br/>THQ is a study of a less known Jacobite Rebellion, the '15. In 1714, Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart monarchs, passed away. Her successor by law was the German George Augustus Welf, Elector of Hanover, who became King George I. But the new regime was far from stable. Only the Whig Party - the forerunners of the Liberals - supported him. He consigned the Tories (the later Conservative Party) to the political wilderness for their part in making peace with France separately from the German states in 1713. The overt supporters of his rival, James Edward Stuart - the Jacobites - were forced to flee or go into hiding.<br/><br/>George took the blame for most of the country's ills following the late War of the Spanish Succession. He relied too much on his Whig friends, which on the one hand gave Parliament more power over royal affairs than ever before, and on the other, encouraged many who would not otherwise have done so to support the Jacobite Cause of restoring the Stuart dynasty. One such man was John Erskine, Earl of Mar, late Secretary of State for Scotland, but now unemployed. Mar belonged to no party (if you except the Earl of Mar's Retirement Assurance Association, which was more of a special interest group) but he was identified with the old Tory regime and had ties to the Scottish Jacobites. He offered his services to George, only to be publicly snubbed. Frustrated, he traveled to Scotland, and began to fan the flames of rebellion.<br/><br/>Scotland had suffered a political union with England in 1707, for which Mar was largely responsible. A persuasive man, he now began to organize a coalition of those opposed to the Union and those opposed to King George. The Loyalists, led by the Whig Duke of Argyle (who had ironically opposed the Union) were alarmed, but the Government took no notice, its members still scrambling for &quot;places&quot; under the new Administration. With the heather aflame, on the 6th of September 1715, the Royal Standard of the Stuarts went up on the Braes of Mar, before a crowd of 600 that would shortly swell to over 12,000. But, as the Standard went up, the gilt ball on the top of the flagpole fell off&auml;<br/><br/>",

Play takes place in 3-dimensional space, and players must first detect opponents with sensors before firing on them. Optional rules provide for realistic movement (the basic rules ignore conservation of momentum), decoys, hyperspace movement, and gravitational wells.<br/><br/>At least two versions of the rules were printed, one in 1973 and one in 1974.<br/><br/>",

Upheaval features an exciting campaign system, giving players new strategic choices as they guide a band of green troops through battle after battle, guiding their experiences and upgrading their abilities and equipment until they either become an elite force or are destroyed and replaced by new green troops.<br/><br/>Available exclusively in digital download format, Upheaval is a 48-page PDF written by Jason Lauborough, designer of the original &AElig;therverse and featuring art and fiction from the &AElig;therverse print rulebook. The game leverages aspects of the revolutionary &AElig;therverse army design system to provide a highly flexible upgrade path for units as they progress through the game. The gameplay portion of Upheaval features a revised and pared-down version of the &AElig;therverse rules, optimized for small-skirmish play between two to four small units of troops (roughly 8-30 models per army).<br/><br/>Upheaval is suitable for sci-fi play of military or &quot;gang warfare&quot; variety, historical and modern skirmishes, and fantasy war band campaigning. The PDF also contains options for adding even more detail to your campaigns, as well as providing rules for creating units that are already experienced, allowing for &quot;one-off&quot; games to be played between interesting armies without having to go through a full campaign system.<br/><br/>Upheaval's gameplay rules are ideal for 2-4 players, and the campaign system supports as many players as desired.<br/><br/>Upheaval is fully supported by the Triskelegames.com website, including an active forum community, and will receive periodic free updates through the release of the semi-monthly &AElig;thergate Newsletter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Babylon's Burning is a near-future, post-apocalyptic skirmish game combining a gritty, atmospheric setting with rules that are both easy to learn and highly realistic.<br/><br/>The year is 2025 - 10 years after the Hit, the catastrophic meteor impact that tore society apart and set in motion a chain of events that left cities in ruins and 95% of the world's population dead and buried under a blanket of dust and ash. The survivors have banded together for mutual protection, resources are scarce and every other group is either a threat or an obstacle.<br/>The background of the Babylon's Burning game is it's core - not a few paragraphs tagged on to the rules as an afterthought. You're introduced into the game with an extensive history of the Hit and an overview of the world of 2025 and drawn in further with the extensive fiction and the beautifully rendered and atmospheric original artwork that appears throughout.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are detailed but intuitive. This is a skirmish level game suitable for anything from a handful of troops to forty or so miniatures per side. Squads, solo elements (officers, snipers, medics and runners) and support weapons move according to a variable initiative system - there is no waiting around twiddling your thumbs while your opponent moves their entire force and the system is perfect for games with more than 2 players.<br/><br/>While it uses a fictional setting, Babylon's Burning recognizes the realities of modern combat. In order to come out on top, players need to keep moving, pick their targets well, take advantage of suppression and, most of all, utilize the terrain of tomorrow's shattered cities. This is a game that rewards players who ask themselves &quot;what would I do?&quot; - pushing blindly forward in tight formations is a good way to get very dead, very quickly.<br/>Another advantage of the realistic setting is that there are no &quot;super units&quot; - in the confines of a dark alley, a nail-studded baseball bat is as deadly a weapon as any other...<br/><br/>The game accommodates a wide selection of faction types - Enclaves, Street Gangs, Mercs, Scavs, Ghouls, Culties, Mobs and Syndicates - all of them complete with their own restrictions and advantages. These factions don't just look different; they play differently too. From well armed Enclave militia built around a crack corps of pre-Hit professionals to street kid gangs moving about the table with dizzying speed on skateboards and roller blades, Babylon's Burning allows the player to choose the faction that best reflects their style of play.<br/><br/>FEATURES -<br/><br/>100 pages - looks great in color or black and white<br/>Full-color counters and burst templates<br/>Quick reference sheet and record sheets<br/>Extensive scene-setting fiction by Jay Forster<br/>Beautiful artwork by Elena Vanin, Jim Campbell and Craig Humpston<br/><br/>REVIEWS -<br/><br/>&quot;The first thing to strike me was the very well produced and laid out format&hellip;the rules themselves are well thought out [with] plenty of examples interspersed in the text [and] are framed by an engrossing piece of fiction.<br/><br/>The best point of the rules is simply the fact that they are generic in their outlook - they are intended for use with any figures on the market, so they are not bound to a specific company's miniatures. This is a bonus, because you can use any figures you want, unlike some systems that insist on the sole use of 'official' figures.&quot;<br/>(From the WARGAMES DIRECTORY review)<br/><br/>&quot;The background material is very plausible and I think well researched as to the possibilities of this occurrence actually happening. I&rsquo;ll not go into details about the background but lets just say it is indeed refreshing from the old nuclear exchange routine and I do think quite believable.<br/><br/>Gives a multitude of campaign and scenario options&hellip;the gaming possibilities are endless and I have admiration for these guys for the concept being a quite in depth look at what could happen in the near future, and I surmise a lot of thought and research must have gone into the whole planning of the background.&quot;<br/>(From the WARGAMES FORUM review)<br/><br/>&quot;We've been playing it, and loving it. The game is complex, detailed and easy to learn.&quot;<br/>(From the APOCALYPSE FICTION review)<br/><br/>&quot;Well produced and nicely laid out...the rules are supplied with a hefty set of appendices detailing the various forces that battle within the futuristic world of Babylon's Burning. There is no need to go out and buy an army book. There is plenty of choice here to keep you interested.&quot;<br/>(From the MINIATURE REVIEW review)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Mikugames website:)<br/><br/>Germany launched their operation Barbarossa against the Soviet Union in June 22nd, 1941. Finland, now a co-belligerent with Germany, took the opportunity to take back the areas lost to the Soviet Union as part of the bitter Winter War peace terms. The almost 200.000 men strong German &ldquo;Armee Norwegen&rdquo;, operating in northern Finland is part of Hitler&rsquo;s operation plan Barbarossa. Finland and Germany are fighting two separate wars against the same enemy. Finnish units reached their objectives in late December, 1941, and a static period in the war began (also called the &ldquo;Trench War&rdquo;). In the summer of 1944, the Soviet Red Army launched a major offensive in the Karelian Isthmus after the withdrawal of the German &ldquo;Heeresgruppe Nord&rdquo; from the Leningrad area. This time the Finnish units couldn&rsquo;t hold back the thrust. Viipuri (Vyborg) was lost and the situation was critical. The largest battle in the Northern Europe took place in Tali-Ihantala, where German Stukas supported the Finnish units. Like a miracle, the Finns and Germans managed to halt the Soviet onslaught, and because Stalin was eager to reach Berlin before the Americans, he decided to withdraw a number of units from the Finnish front. Finland was again saved by the bell.<br/><br/>The Game<br/>The second game of the trilogy is the largest. Now the Germans make an entrance with a wide variety of units and special rules. The Soviet side gets the Guards units as well as numerous of new air unit types. The grande campaign 1941-1944, can take up to 155 turns! Relax, in the middle of the campaign, approximately from Jan. I '42 to Jun. I '44, there will be a special feature, called the Position War (Entrenchment War), which will speed up the playing considerably.<br/><br/>There are also two shorter scenarios included, that suites very well for introduction; the 1941-scenario (Jun. IV '41 &ndash; Dec. IV '41 = 26 turns) and the 1944-scenario (Jun. II '44 &ndash; Sept. I '44 = 12 turns). In the 1941-scenario, the Finnish/German side has an advantage, while in the 1944-scenario, the Soviet side has an advantage.<br/><br/>Unit Counters<br/>The game will include twelve countersheets in a total of 3.192 die-cut unit counters!

It is loosely based on the novel, &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell.  One player takes on the role of the animals.  The other player takes on the role of Farmer Brown. The goal of the animals is to kill Farmer Brown, while the goal of Farmer Brown is to kill the animals.  The game was a wargame that included some role-playing elements, namely the creation of Farmer Brown allows for differential strengths and weaknesses.  For example, the player can choose to have a fast but weak farmer or a slow but powerful one.  The decision on what characteristics Farmer Brown has will have a major impact on game play and players can alter these characteristics to re-balance the game when played between opponents of differential ability.  The player using the animals, however, is stuck with the predetermined characteristics.<br/><br/>Animal Reich attempted to bridge the gap between role-playing games and wargames, much as Steve Jackson attempted to do with Melee and Wizard some ten years earlier.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Britain Stands Alone 2nd Edition simulates one of the greatest &quot;what ifs&quot; of all of history, the German invasion of Great Britain.  Historically, the RAF won the Battle, and Adolf Hitler called off the invasion, sending his forces east in a fateful decision to attack the Soviet Union in 1941. In Britain Stands Alone, players are under no compulsion to repeat this, and instead the decisive campaign of World War II will take place on the shores of the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>Since the map covers all of England, and not just the historically-planned invasion beaches around Dover, the players have enormous freedom to explore other possibilities. Would East Anglia be a better landing site than Kent? Or the West Country? Maybe the Germans would want to make a direct attempt to seize the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth? All of these possibilities, and many more, are within the scope of Britain Stands Alone.<br/><br/>In addition, Britain Stands Alone comes with a wealth of further variants. The Germans might have enhanced naval forces, such as the famed battleship Bismarck joining the Kriegsmarine a year early, or the Germans might have lost fewer torpedo boats and destroyers in the previous campaign for Norway.  Maybe instead of using nothing but jerry rigged river and canal boats for landing craft, Germany manages to develop purpose-built boats similar to the LCT's employed by the Allies in World War II. On the British side, there are variants for greater Free French involvement, including by elements of the French navy, more arms from the Americans, and more tanks.<br/><br/>The original edition of Britain Stands Alone, published by GMT Games, remains popular, yet is now out of print.  The Lock 'n Load Publishing edition will not be a straight reprint, but a major upgrade of a title already held in high regard.  Players can look forward to incorporation of all errata to date, fresh development, additional validation of all systems, and even more variants.<br/><br/>",

If you attempt the dare, the other players debate whether they believe you have successfully completed the dare, in which case you receive a financial reward.<br/><br/>If you land on a &quot;Major Dare&quot; space, you read the description of a dare and its value.  You then draw a &quot;Dare or Not&quot; card which will read either &quot;You're a Legend&quot; or &quot;You Wimped Out&quot;.  The former means you win the dare value, but the latter means you have to pay out the dare value.<br/><br/>There are other random element spaces as well as veto cards you can win to exempt you from losing out on Major Dares.<br/><br/>I infer that the the major dares written on these cards were ones attempted on a Australian television program, on which this board games appears to be based.  e.g. &quot;Bullet Proof: You have been asked to test the new jacket at the firing range! - Win or Lose $500<br/><br/>Made in Australia - as seen on 7 (Channel 7?)<br/><br/>",

Also includes a &quot;stratigraphic column&quot; of rock formations from surface to the deepest depths.<br/><br/>The base map includes lease blocks such as a National Forest, a Navajo Reservation, a State Park, other federal lands, and private (&quot;fee&quot;) land blocks such as farms or ranch property. The rules, included in the journal article, for drilling costs, leasing, drilling results. The rules list the oil price as $3 per barrel, with no mechanism for price fluctuation, indicating how long ago the game was designed, and how it would need to be updated for today's world.

During the turn, the player rolls a die and takes a Black card and a White card randomly.  Then the player reads both cards and shows them to the opposite team. Then he acts (he can speak, but not say the key word) to his team until they guess the word written in the card in the time established by the die.  Team A tries to guess the word while team B measures the time and checks that the player or team A don&acute;t break the rules.

You must use your best strategies along with the luck of the dice in order to win!<br/><br/>Rings and discs are used in Quatrix. When a disc and a ring are combined, they form a PiP (piece inside piece). Squeezing the ring with the disc inside allows the player to move both pieces together. There are two sets of PiPs in each color, seven pips in each set, and two sets of dice.<br/><br/>All the playing pieces are set up as PiPs on the starting tracks. Players will separate their PiPs as the game progresses. The first player to get his or her pieces reassembled as PiPs across the finish line of the same color wins the game.<br/><br/>Rings, discs, and PiPs can move horizontally and vertically backwards and forwards, but never diagonally. Pieces can jump rings and discs, but you may not jump over a PiP of the opposing color. The board is 7 squares wide by 11 squares long, and has a starting track on each end, and a finish line on the opposite side of the board six tracks away.<br/><br/>(From the instructions)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Progressive Mancala was invented by Ralf Gering on September 3, 2004, in Bad Breisig, Germany. The game uses a rule which reminds of Progressive Chess.<br/><br/>The game was implemented for online play at games.wtanaka.com on January 28, 2010.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Progressive Mancala is played on a one-rank mancala board which numbers eleven holes. Initially there are five stones in each hole. There is also a common goal which is adjacent to the central hole of the board. Both players sit on the same side of the board in front of it. One player is called West, the other East.<br/><br/>East starts to the game and plays from right to left. West sows from left to right.<br/><br/>On each turn a player empties a hole and then distributes its contents into the following holes, one by one, in his direction. If he reaches the end of the board, he continues to distribute the stones by first dropping a stone into the Goal, then into the holes starting from the opposite end of the board. That is, he circles around the board.<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last distributed stone) are picked up and then distributed as usual in multi-lap games.<br/><br/>The move ends if the last stone is dropped into an empty hole or the goal.<br/><br/>For each move that a player has terminated in an empty hole, his enemy must make a bonus move (bonus moves are compulsory).<br/><br/>If the last stone is dropped into the goal, the player captures its contents including the last distributed stone. The captured stones are stored. Dropping the last stone into the goal never results in a bonus move for the opponent.<br/><br/>The player who captured most stones is declared the winner. Draws are impossible because the sum of all stones is odd.<br/><br/>Expert Variant<br/><br/>Good players may take a board which has 17 holes. Again, there are five stones in each hole at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

Now, you too can have no life and be the sort of nerd who even furries snicker at: a grognard, a wargamer. This and more is all yours for cheap as free with TOYMALLET 40 Cents!&quot;<br/><br/>(from author's webpage)<br/><br/>Beneath the parody, this is a simple but playable miniatures wargame. Two players take turns moving, shooting, and assaulting with their miniatures armies, which can be made from almost any kind of miniatures or toys. Everything is fitted into three broad categories (squads, commanders, and tankmecha), with some options for further characterization by special rules (extra armour, flight capability, etc). All combat is resolved by rolling six-sided dice, and all measurement is in terms of Lengths (any length unit the players agree on - the game accomodates miniatures of any scale if you chose a sensible length of a Length). The winner is the side that after six turns have accumulated the most Happy Time Fun points, which are earned for seizing objectives and killing enemies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game for 2 players. You need 1 set of Nestortiles.<br/><br/>Each player chooses 5 colours and takes the corresponding tiles.<br/>One player begins by placing a tile valued 1 on to the table. Then the players continue alternately.<br/><br/>On his turn a player puts 1 to 3 (dependent on the move type) tiles onto the table. There are 6 possibilities to extend the building:<br/><br/>(Floor tiles are tiles directly on the table, wall tiles are vertical tiles and top tiles are horizontal tiles not touching the table)<br/><br/><br/>    Floor - A tile directly on the table touching at least one other tile.<br/>    Corner Wall - Two adjacent vertical tiles with an inbetween angle of 90&deg;, both touching a floor tile.<br/>    Single Wall - A vertical tile touching at least one other wall tile. It also has to touch a floor or top tile.<br/>    Tunnel - The top tile has to touch exactly one wall tile, and may additionally touch one or more top tiles. On the opposite side of the touching wall side another wall is placed.<br/>    Single Top - A top tile touching at least 2 wall tiles.<br/>    Corner Top - A top tile touching at least 2 other top tiles but no wall tile. On every side not touching another top tile a wall tile is added.<br/><br/><br/>There are some additional restrictions for the moves:<br/><br/>The players have to use the tiles colour by colour. Only if the first used colour is completely placed on the table, the next colour may be used. So if there is only one tile remaining in a colour the player can only place one tile in his next turn.  The colour by colour rule is meant to be for the tiles of one player. Example: Player A starts with a yellow tile. Player B continues with two green tiles. Now player A has to continue with yellow until all yellow is used. Only then player A may choose his next colour. (Same for player B with green)<br/><br/>Each placed tile has to touch at least one tile with the same or a smaller value.  The dots of the top tiles always must be on the top side. So it is not possible to have a top directly above a floor.<br/><br/>A player wins if he places all 30 tiles on the table.<br/>A player loses if he has no legal move (Beware of tiles with small value).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tilting dice<br/>by James Ryan<br/><br/>Tilting dice is a two-player abstract strategy game designed for use with Nestortiles. Players construct a modular board and then strategically position their dice to make a capture. When two dice connect, the die with the highest facing side wins.<br/><br/>SET UP:<br/><br/>1) The board:<br/>Each player picks two colors of Nestortiles and takes all the tiles of those colors. The rest of the tiles are shuffled face down and patched together into a 6x6 grid. The grid is flipped over, revealing the pattern of pips. This will be used as the game board.<br/><br/>2) The dice:<br/>Players now use their twelve Nestortiles to assemble two dice in any way they please.<br/><br/>3) Placing the dice on the board:<br/>Players now place their dice in the corners of their own side of the game board with any side face up, so long as it does not match the number of the tile the die is on. Who ever is start player should place his or her dice first, giving the second player a chance to evaluate the position and place his or her dice accordingly.<br/><br/>Example: In one of Eva's corners, there is a tile with four pips. She may place either of her dice in this corner, so long as it is not showing 4 pips on its top face. Once she places both of her dice, it will be Nestor's turn to place his. Then Eva will make the first move.<br/><br/>Players may decide turn order in any manner they like. Start player will alternate each round.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/>The first player to &quot;capture&quot; one of the other player's dice wins the round. First player to win 3 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>1) Moving dice:<br/>When players take their turns, they move one of their dice three times. Moving a die means &quot;tilting&quot; it on to the next space forward, backward, left, or right, so that the top face of the die becomes the side facing that direction.<br/><br/>Example: Eva will play first. She decides to move her die that shows a green 5 on top. First, she will move it one space forward. Eva now tilts the die forward so that the green 5 faces forward and the die rests squarely on the next tile forward.<br/><br/>Now this same die shows a blue 2 on top and she wants to move this one space to the left. She tilts the die to the left so that the blue 2 is now the side facing left and the die lands squarely on the next tile to the left..<br/><br/>Now this die has a blue 5 on top, and Eva wants to move it one more space forward, so she tilts the die forward, moving the die onto the next tile forward so that his blue 5 faces forward, toward her opponent. Eva's turn is turn is now over.<br/><br/>At no point during a player's turn may they move their die back onto a tile it has already touched during the same turn. This means players cannot retrace their path or repeat moves during the same turn.<br/><br/>Dice may not be moved diagonally. Dice may not be rotated.<br/><br/>2) Making a capture:<br/>When two opposing dice are in adjacent squares, their facing sides are compared. The die with the highest value on its facing side captures the other and the round is over.<br/><br/>Example: One of Nestor's dice shows a 4 on one side. Eva is able to move her die so that it ends on the space adjacent to this side with a value of 5 facing Nestor's 4. Eva's 5 beats Nestor's 4, so Eva wins the round.<br/><br/>Dice cannot be captured &quot;in passing.&quot; In other words, the sides of dice are not compared for a capture unless a player has completed all three moves of his or her turn. If dice are in adjacent squares on the first or second move of a turn, there is no comparison of sides and no capture.<br/><br/>Sometimes, a die will end a turn on a &quot;matching&quot; tile. A die is said to be on a matching tile when its top face is of the same value as the tile. When a die is on a matching tile, all of its outward facing sides double in value for as long as the die remains on the matching tile. This means it may capture a die showing a side of greater value than it would normally be able to capture.<br/><br/>Example: One of Eva's dice is on a matching space, and its outward facing sides show values of 2, 3, 4, and 4. Because she is on a matching tile, their values are now 4, 6, 8, and 8. As soon as she moves off the tile, their values will return to normal.<br/><br/>Let's say Eva ended her turn on a matching tile that is adjacent to one of Nestor's dice. His die shows a 6 facing hers, and her die shows a 4 facing his. Ordinarily Eva would lose the round in this position, but because she is on a matching tile, the value of her 4 doubles to an 8. Her 8 beats Nestor's 6 and she wins the round.<br/><br/>If dice are compared for capture and their values are equal, no capture takes place on that turn.<br/><br/>STARTING A NEW ROUND<br/><br/>Once a capture has been made, players collect their dice and prepare for a new round. Players should decide before a game begins whether or not they want the ability to remake their dice between rounds. Unless otherwise stated, dice should retain their composition for the duration of the game, and the board should likewise remain intact for all 3-5 rounds.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has won three rounds and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

(Each player controls 6 of the 12 animals.)<br/><br/>The object of Junishi is to move one of your 6 animals into your opponents Gate, which is located at the opposite end of the board, in between your opponents Spawn Areas.<br/><br/>Players begin at either end of a board comprised of 19 circles arranged in a hexagonal pattern. <br/> At the start of the game there are not any pieces on the board. Any pieces that a player wishes to use must be &quot;spawned&quot; in one of the Spawn Circles on that players side of the board.  <br/> Players may move the pieces that they already have on the board either by moving them into adjacent circles or by jumping over friendly pieces.<br/> Players also may use their animals to capture their opponents animals by jumping over them.<br/><br/>Junishi is a simple and fast paced abstract strategy game that is easy to learn and usually plays in under 20 minutes. It comes in a little cloth bag that also serves as the game board<br/>and it can be carried in any pocket that is big enough to hold a pack of gum.<br/><br/>Junishi is a complete game that can be expanded by combining it with its sister games Zodiakos, 12 Moons, and Neteru.<br/><br/>(source : the publisher)<br/> Integrates with:<br/><br/>    12 Moons<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Zodiakos<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Neteru<br/><br/><br/>",

Keirin is a sport where the riders are following a derny (a motorcycle) before they are released in their race. The game is played with 6 riders and 6 different colours and a derny, multiple coloured dice and a track of 60 squares long.<br/><br/>In 2012, Anki added a Print and Play update. The main differences are:<br/><br/>a) There are 9 racers now, like real in keirin races, instead of six. However, for a shorter game, you can drop some riders (the ones with the highest numbers). Playing with 6, 7 or 8 riders is ok.<br/><br/>b) You do not need a lot of different coloured dice. You just need as many dice as racers, that is, nine dice.<br/><br/>c) The motorbike now takes part in the game, even if it's just in the first turn. It is not there &quot;just for the ambiance&quot; anymore.  The rule foir the first throw of rider 1 has also changed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Working Title- Unpublished Prototype)<br/><br/>Overview<br/>In this game players take the roles of the &quot;Great Houses&quot; of the land. Over the course of several generations, those in power change. Players try to influence succession and match their House's resources to the interests of the True Power in the land (often not the actual monarch). By adding new family branches, using carefully arranged marriages, and managing grants players raise their prestige in the hopes of seizing power after the inevitable downfall of the monarchy.<br/><br/>Basic Play<br/>Each player has a house display representing their larger political family. BRANCHES make up that family, beginning the game with a same number of small family branches. Each branch is represented by a card with a branch name and spaces for GRANTS. Grants represent offices, industries, resources, contacts and so on which that part of the family has control of. There are six kinds of grants: Influence (INFL) which generates the currency for play and the five areas of control: Activism (ACT), Intellectual (INT), Religion (REL), Society (SOC) and Warfare (WAR). Grants, represented by tiles, can move around throughout the game. Some branches may also have special abilities which allow special actions or modify the values of the grants attached to them.<br/><br/>During each turn, players may add a new branch to their House Display. Since they only may have five branches at a time, they will eventually have to Marry or merge two of those houses, creating a new branch. Each turn players gain currency in the form of influence, bid to add a branch, support those in power, and take actions. Some actions can always be taken, while others require the use of particular grant types. At the end of the turn, players check to see which Royal currently holds sway in the realm. Players score VPs based on the interests of that Royal and how well their various branches and grants match those.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Powerplay is played on a 4x4 game board. Each player has 4 round-shaped and 4 square-shaped tokens numbered from 1 to 4. The tokens have two sides, one of them with a black frame. On a turn, a player places one of their tokens on a free space on the game board. When all spaces have been occupied, it's time to check the effects of each token on the opponent's neighboring tokens. The square tokens work horizontally and vertically whereas the round tokens work diagonally. A token is considered conquered if the score of the pieces surrounding it is higher than its own value. It is then turned onto its black framed side. The winner is the player with the most points (i.e., a higher difference between the points of the pieces they conquered and the points of your pieces conquered by the opponent).<br/><br/>Originally published in spielbox 1991 #6.<br/><br/>",

Both players must agree on the grid size before the game starts.<br/><br/>There are 2 phases on the game:<br/><br/>1- Negotiation phase<br/><br/>A random player starts by telling a number. Then the other player must tell a higher one or pass. The process is repeated until one of the players passes.<br/><br/>The player that 'passed' is called 'LOW', and the other player is called 'HIGH'. Write down the last number reached during the negotiation. This number is the called 'LIMIT'.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>A: 70<br/>B: 120<br/>A: 143<br/>B: Passes<br/><br/>A is 'HIGH', B is 'LOW' and LIMIT = 143<br/><br/>2- Playing phase<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. Each game lasts a number of turns equal to (m+n)/3 rounded up. A turn is considered a player's move (not 2 players).<br/><br/>Starting with 'HIGH' players take alternate turns removing an entire row or column of cells from the grid, by drawing a line on it. The line must go through at least one square which doesn't already have a line. It is forbidden to draw a line so that it leaves the board with no 'unremoved' cells remaining.<br/><br/>When all the turns have been played, the game ends.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>Several rectangular groups of 'unremoved' cells have been created. Multiply the size of all the groups to calculate the score.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>The following groups have been created: 1,1,2,2,3,6. Score= 1 x 1 x 2 x 2 x 3 x 6 = 72<br/><br/>If the final score is higher than LIMIT, the 'HIGH' player wins. Otherwise, 'LOW' wins.<br/><br/>Designer notes<br/><br/>TAU was evolved from OMEGA while teaching my students how to multiply in binary base. It uses Linkage's fewer/more idea. I recommend starting with boards of m+n = 20..30. Trivial sizes might be interesting only from a mathematical point of view. I recommend the shortest side to be at least 1/3rd of the longest one. Squared boards are particularly interesting.<br/><br/>Thank you, Russ Williams and Nathan Morse for the corrections.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At its core, &quot;The Age of Sovereigns&quot; is a military strategy, but the game is not limited strictly to combating. An important part of gameplay is the construction of buildings (common and special buildings, 26 total). Due to these constructions players can multiply their wealth and / or fame, along with the development of the army.<br/><br/>The game is divided into various stages. In the era of &quot;Kingdoms Rising&quot; players gradually get bonuses specific to the kingdom. In the era of the &quot;End of Times&quot; all events are resolved. These two steps constitute the main part of the game, when the players give a variety of orders and fight. In the era of &quot;Destiny&quot; victory points and fines are scored.<br/><br/>The dice are not used during the battles, so the game is not that much random ;)<br/><br/>The game has low downtime and relatively short playing time (30 minutes per player).<br/><br/>",

Same objective as draughts: to eliminate all your opponents pieces, and same rules as draughts / checkers -- jump over opposing pieces to capture. But Quadraughts requires a lot more skill and strategic nous.<br/><br/>Unique 13 by 13 square grid board with 4 sets of different coloured draught pieces.<br/><br/>For 4 players or 2 teams, for all the family, aged 6+<br/><br/>Players: 4 (or 2 playing 2 colors each)<br/>Board: 13 x 13 squares alternating black and white. Some squares have coloured spots.<br/>Pieces: 12 each player (in 4 distinct colors)<br/>Placement: The pieces (men) are placed on the squares on the first three rows in front of each player, on the appropriately colored spots.<br/>Moves: Men move diagonally across the board on the black squares, one square at a time, in a forward direction. Kings (see below) may move forwards or backwards.<br/>Commencement: The players decide who should begin and players take it in turns to move, in a clockwise direction.<br/>Capture: A piece is captured by jumping over it and removing it from the board. Several pieces may be captured in a single move by making successive jumps with a single piece. The men captured do not all have to be of the same color. If a capture is possible, it must be made. Failure to do so results in &ldquo;huffing&rdquo;, the removal of the offending piece by the opposing player.<br/>Crowning: A man which reaches the farthest row of the board, ON A SPOTTED SQUARE is crowned as a king by placing a second man on top of it. It can then move both forwards and backwards. If the man lands on a square (on the farthest row) that is not spotted it returns to any spotted square of the first row of the board to begin again. If all the spotted squares on the first row are full than the man moves to the nearest spotted square to the first row.<br/>End: The game ends when three players either lose all their men or can no longer move.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with 20 randomly drawn tiles (if playing with 2-4 players; 15 tiles otherwise) and one Freechoice tile. The remaining tiles are mixed face-down on the table.<br/><br/>Playing at the same time, players reveal their tiles and try to create valid equations crossword-style in their own playing area. A Multichoice or Freesymbol tile can be used as a different operator or number in intersecting equations. At any time, a player can return an unwanted tile to the stock in exchange for two newly drawn tiles. If a player uses all of his tiles in one or more equations, then he declares &quot;Done&quot; and draws four new tiles from the stock. Players can rearrange tiles any number of times to incorporate new tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends if a player wants to swap when fewer than two tiles remain in reserve or declares &quot;Done&quot; with fewer than four tiles in reserve. The player who has used all tiles in equations when the game ends wins. If no player fits this description, then players sum their tiles in hand (with a Freechoice tile worth ten points), and the player with the lowest sum wins.<br/><br/>",

It is your job, as Author of your own story, to populate it with characters. Each character's vitality is worth so many points to the story. At the end of the game, the Author whose characters have the greatest total vitality wins the game.<br/><br/>Sounds simple enough? But it can't be that easy. It isn't.<br/><br/>In The Magical World of Disney Epic Card Game, you're sharing your storyline with other Authors. There may even be multiple storylines at once. Characters come and go from various locations, each having a different effect on the story. The locations themselves might even change right out from under the feet of your characters.<br/><br/>Characters might be unexpectedly shifted around. Objects and other characters can affect the story. Not to mention Effects, Events, and Spells that can change everything in a blink of an eye.<br/><br/>You could have Snow White and Cinderella go up against the Queen of Hearts and Cruella DeVille. The Seven Dwarfs could even team up with the evil Jafar to battle The Hunchback of Notre Dame with Lightning McQueen.<br/><br/>You can download everything for FREE!

Foreign businessmen called Taipan, have settled here to capitalize on the growing trade routes through the oceans of the Far East.  From the southern tip of Nippon down to Makassar, the Taipan are making large profits.  But with any lucrative endeavor, criminals, smugglers, and pirates seek to take advantage of weaker prey, making these waters very dangerous.<br/><br/>You have just arrived in Hong Kong and taken out a loan to get your new Trading Company started.  You have a ship and a crew.  All that is left is to command your ship through the trade routes of the Far East and be the first to pay off your debt to win the game.<br/><br/>Playing the Game:<br/>At the start of the game, each player chooses a special Captain Card with a special ability, they also receive a small amount of starting funds, and their Debt that must be paid off to win the game.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their ship throughout the Eastern Seas trading goods between different ports, Hong Kong, Singapore, Makassar, Nagasaki, and more.  At the start of the game, players will only have a small amount of funds with witch to buy cargo.  Balancing they're purchasing of cargo, choosing the best place to sell the cargo, upgrading your ship, and using their Captain's special ability will give the players the best chance to win the game.<br/><br/>In addition to making the best choices, players will have many events that can change each players strategy.  Cities may have events that alter the value of goods at that port.  A fire in a city may make wood very valuable there for a short period of time.  A gold mine may create an over abundance that dives the price down making that city a prime place to get gold at a good price.  Also, Pirate Tokens placed on the game board hold a great risk of loss of cargo, a damaged ship, and upgrades that will have to be repaired before they can be used again.  But winning a battle against pirates can also grant the rewards or plundered cargo.<br/><br/>Who will be the first Merchant to successfully navigate these dangerous waters, pay off his debt, and win the game?<br/><br/>",

Cooperatively, players traverse the island, facing hazards and hunters, until the final showdown, where they will battle a villainous dog and recapture their ship.<br/><br/>The game is card and dice driven. It features 12 different pirates, each with a skill and a knack to differentiate them. Players will have to conserve resources, use their skills and make the right team-based choices to survive this challenging game.<br/><br/>Play it solitaire or with up to 6 players.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY SYNOPSIS<br/><br/>Each pirate begins with 10 points of fortitude and one item given to them at random. With each new turn, the players (the crew) decide together if they will rest or traverse their current location.<br/><br/>If the crew rests, they may perform skills, such as searching for items, foraging for rations or simply resting and recovering lost fortitude.<br/><br/>If the crew traverses, they must each spend fortitude points to do so and then draw cards from the island deck until they reveal a new location card, at which tine the turn ends.<br/><br/>While drawing cards, the crew will encounter hazards from lava bursts to mischievous monkeys and possibly even pirate hunters. When hunters are encountered, the crew will do battle. Battle is a series of dice rolls used to do damage and deplete each side of its fortitude.<br/><br/>The goal is to reach the end of the progress track (crossing the island) and hold a final showdown with the villainous dog who stole you ship and left you stranded on Terror Island.<br/><br/>",

Egyptian reinforcements (the Nearin) appear once the camp is successfully attacked.  The game is eight turns long.<br/><br/>Forces are chariots, infantry, baggage and Ramesses himself.  Movement is by rectangular areas, with special rules for the camp.  Combat is resolved by dice; The Ramesses unit (following his own account of the battle) can overthrow the enemy easily, but is badly outnumbered.  The victory level is decided by how many chariots the Egyptians capture and how much baggage the Hittites take and if they can capture the Pharaoh himself.<br/><br/>This was the 2012 subscription bonus game for members, but will be available from the publishers.<br/><br/>",

They can only do this if they are the player leading the battle, and only if they were also leading in the previous game turn.  Sending out the Beast Hunters means they surrender the lead (to the player on their left)<br/><br/>At the end of the turn that that player regains the lead, their Beast Hunters return with a Beast (top card from the pile).  They can use this Beast to fight the enemy, but only if they have their Beast Hunters with their army (not out beast hunting), as they need these to goad the Beast into battle<br/><br/>It is best to use Beasts to attack players who have no Beasts themselves, or whose Beast Hunters are out looking for monsters, as they will have to defend using their Troops rather than a Beast<br/><br/>Beasts can fight Beasts, using standard Clang! fighting rules, and Beasts can fight Troops, again using the standard rules, but only red attack bars can affect Beasts, so they are hard to defeat.  If a player has fewer than three red combat bars amongst the hand of four Troops they have to choose from, they are doomed to lose, so it is best to pick the three weakest Troops to send to their destruction<br/><br/>Some Beasts have Special Attacks - these could depend on Troops having a certain level of bar for a skill such as Bravery or they all run away from the beast, or could mean looking at the Troop pictures so for instance any Troops without shields cannot defend themselves against the Special Attack and are defeated<br/><br/>Beasts can help turn the tide of battle, intimidate other players, or add a final blow to win the war, but Beasts themselves do not count towards Troop totals so if your Troops are defeated you lose<br/><br/>Components:<br/>BLOODTHIRSTY BEASTS gamebox<br/>Beasts (1 deck of 16 cards)<br/>Beast Hunters (1 deck of 6 cards)<br/>Instructions (1 deck of 3 cards)<br/><br/>",

It was a close and at the same time complete victory for Rommel.  His forces made their way around the flank of the British Gazala Line and met with initial success.  But after a few days the Germans found themsleves encircled by a strongly entrenched British Brigade, the 150th, which sat astride the German supply route.<br/>Rommel came close the throwing in the towel, within about a day, before clinching success by finally forcing the 150th Brigade to surrender first and open the supply route.  Immediately after beating the 150th Brigade the Brtish armour decided to make a final effort to beat Rommel in the Cauldron.  They failed and Rommel turned the tables on them.  So much so that almost 90% of the remaining British armour was destroyed and gave Rommel his opportunity to take Tobruk and move past the Egyptian frontier wire and towards Alexandria.<br/><br/>All units modeled as battalions, companies/batteries.<br/>Hexes represent approximately 2km of terrain.<br/>Each turn represents 2 hours of ff daylight or 2-4 hours of night.<br/><br/>This game comes with: <br/>&bull;Armored Knights North Afrika Rules <br/>&bull;(9) 11x17 Scenario Cards <br/>&bull;Numerous Player Aides and Examples <br/>&bull;Game Turn Record Track for Venezia <br/>&bull;Game Turn Record Track for Battleaxe <br/>&bull;(4) Full Color Order of Battle Charts <br/>&bull;Full Color Battleaxe Order of Battle Chart <br/>&bull;Very Sturdy box <br/>&bull;Approximately 1000 double sided unit counters and markers<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Retreat to Woodbury Falls takes place days after a catastrophic yet preternatural tectonic plate shift left the land riddled with sinkholes and worse... a collapsed society.<br/><br/>On the board you control three different survivalist leaders on their quest to take over competing base camps. Players survive by gathering and trading resources to recruit other survivors to their own camps and exile those who hold them back.<br/><br/>Once players have recruited an efficient survival group and have equipped themselves with enough tools and utilities by way of deck building they can move towards the final goal... take over a rival base camp.<br/><br/>Retreat to Woodbury Falls utilizes the popular deck management mechanic but still allows players control of physical board pieces. The most unique aspect to the game is building a deck based around card combat. You will be able to select different class survivor cards throught the game. You will find synergies and combos between the survivors and the items you equip to them both during deck building and combat. Yes, You actually get to use your deck in combat against other players to win the game!<br/><br/>Retreat to Woodbury Falls is an easy to learn game that still maintains a high level of strategic command and decision-making.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>A long ranged minion that can hit hard from a distance at a medium cost. This minion can be hired by any Ten Thunders Crew. This Minion is best used away from the main fighting. It has some very good tricks to get shots in but only has bash in melee. It has a couple of good zero point actions to bolster its attacks and also a 1 point action called Take Aim. This is a (1) action focus strike giving you a positive flip on your shot but can only be used once per activation.<br/><br/>The best thing about this model is that its ranged attacks are usually further than an opposing minions range. This enables you to move it in to place to cover your melee fighters. Remember to use the Threading the Needle ability by moving it with something like a Torokage as it can effectively shoot through the model to the enemy. Remeber the Take Aim will usually be your first shot and then decide whether you need to use Reading the Wind if you have low cards in your hand or if the model you are shooting at is in cover or the Spell Yajiri with the second attack to bolster its damage or cause non living models to slow down.<br/><br/>",

They all can place political factors in the boxes in the various areas on the board and attack other player's factors (using a standard wargame CRT). Some players have other options: the Provisional Government can announce an offensive against the Central Powers, the General Staff can try for a coup in a given area, and the Bolsheviks can try to seize power, which may result in their getting control of some areas (and ends the game regardless).<br/><br/>Each player has a different set of moderate and decisive victory conditions. It is possible for more than one player to achieve a victory condition. Negotiations are encouraged by the rules.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to create a electronic circuit that uses all 5 of the following components: a Battery, a Resistor, an Inductor, a Capacitor, and an LED bulb. However, to make things more difficult, everyone will be competing on the same circuit board.<br/><br/>Players take turns uncovering circuit board tiles and placing their electronic components along the conductive paths. But be careful! The Voltage on the Volt-a-Meter fluctuates as components are played. If the Voltage gets raised too high, you might cause a destructive power surge.<br/><br/>Use Solder pieces to create pathways and make new connections. Not all 5 of the electronic components need to be your own, and you can attempt to piggyback off of your opponents' placement.<br/><br/>CiRKiTRY does not require prior knowledge of electronic engineering to play.<br/><br/>",

This Game was designed for the 24 hour contest - May 2013<br/><br/>&quot;They said it would be easy, you thought it would be simple, go and collect flowers to sell at the market - what could go wrong!?  That was until you met the Rats, no ordinary rats - these are definitely of an unusual size, but they are nothing compared to the fearsome Scorpions.&quot;<br/><br/>Players take turns to roll the dice and spend those points on drawing cards.  There are four decks to choose from, each deck costs a different amount to draw a card. The more expensive the cards the greater the value of the flowers in the decks, but the higher the risk of drawing a scorpion and leaving with nothing.  Players must decide whether to risk it and draw from the more valuable decks or play it safe with a cheap deck that guarantees they earn at least some money.  Rolling a double on the dice will let you choose between 2 cards so should be safer, but do you keep trying for a double or take the bonus for leaving without uncovering a Rat.  Ending your turn lets you sell your flowers at the market for coin, and at the end of the game whoever has the most coin wins.<br/><br/>",

Players compete on a board made of four random map pieces which means the game changes every time you play. Terrain features have various effects on play: water is impassible, buildings provide permanent protection, while hedges and barrels provide temporary cover. To win the game, you must either eliminate all opposing tanks or spend a full turn atop The Hill. Either way, you must survive to win.<br/><br/>",

The redux version comes in a small tuck-box and contains only the 56 cards and the rules. In order to play with this version who will have to provide your own dice, gems and markers.

        "description": "Title Chase Football is another fast-paced game using may of the techniques used in Title Chase: Basketball this time in the arena of American football. The game focuses on team building, getting into the playoffs and winning it all. Like its predecessor, Title Chase: Football should not be confused with a simulation. It is a game meant to pit players against each other and as such can be completed from the start of the season to the championship game in less than an hour.<br/><br/>The first half of the game is a card-driven game where you build up your team by improving aspects of the game, winning key games and gaining ground in the standings. Not every team can make the playoffs but is it worth it to you to avoid the dreaded cellar spots in each division? Do you build a powerful dynasty? Can coaching and luck to carry you through? Or maybe you just decide to rely on your defense to lock the opponent's down. The way that you build your team is up to you.<br/><br/>At the end of the regular season, the game switches to a full-on dice game using the teams you created during the regular season. Teams match up for playoff games where your dice are the ones you labored to improve earlier. As your dice are expended in each quarter, the game gets more and more tense and often it comes down to one final toss of the die.<br/><br/>Although the game does not use hard and fast statistics and has no built in way to produce them, I find that it really scratches that sports itch that I used to spend hours on back in the day with Statis-Pro Football and Football Strategy. With Title Chase Football Carla &amp; I can play it together even though she has only a passing knowledge of the sport. The game is meant to be played by players of all levels of sporting knowledge and still be fun.<br/><br/>",

There are cards added and some removed to keep the size a standard 52-card deck. It is played with a special deck of cards, most of which are standard playing cards in the regular suits of hearts, spades, clubs and diamonds, but printed with some additional information such as point totals.<br/><br/>The available points vary between 50 and 450 for each round, randomly determined as printed on a card turned up before each round. The player with the most tricks and the player with the fewest tricks at the end of a round score the available points. If there is a tie for most or fewest, then no one scores the points for that position. The standard game has nine-card hands, so at least one person will always score the points. A standard game is played to 1,500 points, but players can agree to raise or lower this total as they see fit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rally racing with Gears! This expandable board game features fast paced, full contact racing set on the desert world of Terra Nova. Race around the track, burn rubber to pull ahead, jump over terrain, shoot your opponent if he gets a bit to far ahead, take a swipe at him with your vibro blade or push him in the wall. All this along with spin-outs, skids and rattled pilots bring the exciting world of Gear Rally racing to your table top. Includes a new fast and easy to learn ruleset with lots of rule and game play examples.<br/><br/>Badlands Rally uses D6 dice to resolve both opposed and unopposed actions. Each model, called a Gear, has a number of Attributes that distinguish its own special characteristics and advantages in the game. Players must choose what combination of attack, special movement or other actions will lead them to victory. Dice mechanics allow for quick resolution of these actions through simple rolls of varying numbers of dice depending on the modifiers that apply. All modifiers either add dice to a roll or subtract them. There are two kinds of roll: A Roll and a Check.  A Roll is an unopposed test which uses a simple comparison of dice to an Attribute for a number of successes.  A Check is an opposed test between players that uses the high dice in a roll and adds a bonus based on the other dice compared to an Attribute. In each lap of a game a Gear may resolve between four and six actions depending on player choices. A standard match is 2-3 laps.  Variable Gear upgrades, Gear choices, and Scenarios allow for an almost infinite variety of game conditions. Additional Gear data cards are provided that allow player to use almost the entire Heavy Gear line of miniatures from Dream Pod 9 to add even more variety to their games. Up to Eight Gears can race at once with two to four players being the norm.<br/> The box set includes rules booklet, full color hex map, 4 easy to assemble racing gear miniatures of the Rally Viper, Rally Pitbull, Rally Jerboa and Rally Ferret cast in pewter with plastic hex bases, 8 double-sided datacards (Rally Viper/Viper II, Rally Pitbull/Pitbull II, Rally Jerboa/Jerboa II, Rally Ferret/Ferret II, Rally Grizzly/Mamba, Rally Cobra/Chasseur MkII, Rally Sapeur/Iguana, and Rally Hunter/Dart Jager), assorted counters (rattled tracker gears, rattled, rally, damage, and upgrades) , 2 double-sided quick reference cards (rules and weapons/upgrades), and 6 dice. The double-sided Rally Grizzly/Mamba, Rally Cobra/Chasseur MkII, Rally Sapeur/Iguana, and Rally Hunter/Dart Jager datacards can also be used to proxy in other similar size gears from the Heavy Gear Blitz and Arena miniature lines.<br/><br/>",

The competing Slashers don't interact directly, but the Writers have the ability to hinder or help other Slashers with the placement of new weapons, or, more importantly, manipulating the horde of Pawns (Victims) that populate the Slasher film tableau.<br/><br/>You say that you love the idea, but that you don't have miniatures for a game like this? No problem! Included with the game are printable paper miniatures... you get 5 distinct Slashers, a Cop, and 4 distinct Pawns. Print as many Pawns and Cops as you need, snip, fold, glue, and you are all set! Also included are printable Weapon counters, and Pawn Special counters that introduce twists to the game like Phones (self-explanatory,) Beer (dangerous for Pawns), and Hysteria (AHHHHH!!!).<br/><br/>Whenever a Slasher ends his/her movement in contact with a Pawn or Cop, the Slasher must conduct an attack. If the Attack is successful your Slasher removes the Pawn from the board, earning Collection Points.<br/><br/>Collection Points translate into ratings, or popularity, for the Writer&rsquo;s Slasher and Slasher story line. So, earning Collection Points in the game, while preventing rival Slashers from collecting points when you can, is how you can win the game.<br/><br/>Not recommended for children under the age of 16. This is meant to be a fun game, based on a movie genre, and does not take itself seriously... still, the subject matter may not be appropriate for everyone.<br/><br/><br/>",

With 8 duelists, 20 Styles, 12 Weapons, and over 120 Action cards the possibilities are nearly endless.<br/><br/>Duelist cards are placed in play head to head. All four character sides have a separate offense and a defense rating from 0-6. Each player draws their starting hand and the game begins.<br/><br/>During a turn a player draws two cards and can perform two actions, a Move and a Strike. A player may Move their duelist by either rotating 90 degrees or stepping diagonally - maintaining contact with the opponent. Striking requires that you line up one of your Duelist's attack angles toward his opponent. Both Movement and Strike actions can be modified by offensive cards in hand.  After a Strike is declared the opposing player may play defense cards from their hand to mitigate or even cancel the damage. If the Strike is successful the attack value is compared to the defense value and the difference is the damage dealt to the opposing Duelist. Each Duelist starts out with 40 hit points. The last Duelist standing wins.<br/><br/>",

In this example, the question may be &quot;Who would win in a fight?&quot; Now is the time that it is revealed and the two players begin the debate. Players may do anything in their power to get the other players to vote for their side. Points are earned by winning a debate and voting for a winner.<br/><br/>What's The Question? is a great game for any crowd.

Hire your gun out to farmers being pushed off their land by a local cattle baron, or go to the aid of the town&rsquo;s lawman who has to ride out to where a group of stagecoach robbers are reputedly hiding.<br/><br/>Part board game, part RPG and great for use with miniatures, Gunman&rsquo;s Law breaks new ground by using a multi-purpose Fast Action Card deck to determine everything from a shootist&rsquo;s speed and accuracy, reaction to danger, damage done and effect of that damage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brangle is a party game for four or more players. The game is played with a deck of 54 cards, each with three topics or categories written on one side. One player draws a card and selects the first, second, or third category (by choice or convention, depending on which set of rules is used). The player then names something that belongs to the category, prompting the next player to do the same, and so on. Play continues in this fashion until a player cannot give an answer in a reasonable amount of time (typically about 2 seconds) or repeats an answer previously used during the round. Once a player loses the round, they place the card in front of them, and draw a new card to begin the next round. The player with the fewest cards in front of them after 54 rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The rules included in Brangle offer suggestions for modifying gameplay. One example is to play an &quot;elimination game&quot; in which players are removed from the game after accumulating three cards. The last player remaining is the winner. It is also suggested that the game can end after a predetermined amount of time (30 minutes) instead of playing through the entire deck of cards. Another suggestion is to allow players to choose which of the three categories on each card they want to play, rather than always choosing the first, second or third.<br/><br/>Creative or unusual answers and responses are highly encouraged. An excerpt from the rules: &quot;For the category, &ldquo;things that roll&rdquo;, a creative answer could be &ldquo;stones&rdquo; (Rolling Stones), &ldquo;Rick Astley&rdquo; (Rick Roll), or &ldquo;spring&rdquo; (spring-roll) &quot;.<br/><br/>Brangle was created by a small group of US Marines and RAF Airmen in Afghanistan in 2011, and later developed into a commercial product by a member of that group after his service was completed in 2013.<br/><br/>",

In reality is what you can expect from a board game that came on a cereal box, but it has a lot of charm and richness of details in the drawings and graphic design.<br/><br/>There was another Ralston&acute;s TMNT cereal box board game called &quot;Adventures In Turtleopolis&quot; that came out during the same time, but it didn&acute;t have art as nice as this nor as much TMNT thematic enemies and elements such as the Technodrome or the sewers.<br/><br/>",

A capture can be executed onto any enemy piece or stack. In both cases, capture occurs by replacement; the enemy piece is removed and the friendly piece is put in its place.

No formation can be strong everywhere though, and advancing and retreating can be equally important. Expand around your opponent's placements and leave your options open while closing off your opponent's. Outflank lasts between 30 minutes and an hour on average and plays either two player or four players in teams.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/><br/>Outflank is themed towards medieval pike warfare, advancing in formations linked back to their starting formation and attempting to find the weak spots in enemy formations.<br/><br/>The theme is light since the game is an abstract.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Starting from fixed positions, players build out formations to surround and entrap their opponent using limited number of actions each turn. With seven actions a turn you can advance or withdraw cards from the field based on the number of soldiers on the individual tiles. You can also use your actions to draw additional tiles or mercenaries that can augment your cards for further costs. The aim of the game is to take four of your opponent's tiles in a four player game and 6 in a four player team game (combined total with your ally).<br/><br/>",

Like their other teams inspired by classic literature, Chemozoic Incorporated contracted Honeydew Labs to create this team genetic template. And while the athletes certainly look the part, their traits and skills have made it difficult to rack up the victories necessary to snag the championship.<br/><br/>The Gruesomes as a team rely on their resilience and sheer strength to dominate opponents and survive attacks. Unfortunately, they lack the hand-eye coordination and speed to have full access to all possible Slaughterball strategies. Indeed, their shooting game is perennially inadequate. Even so, previous coaches have managed to build them into a respectable foe over the course of a season by training them with new skills and concentrating on the strategies explained below.<br/><br/>Coaching the Gruesomes is a challenging task, but your victories will be that much sweeter knowing it was your coaching ability, not the athleticism of your athletes, that won the day. They are slower and less accurate than other teams, and as such you cannot rely on a shooting game to win. Instead, you should doggedly attack your opponents, even taking risky chops to knock them down. You should be chopping every turn. And get everyone moved toward the center of the pit as soon as possible. Field coverage is imperative for the Gruesomes, so they are always in range to attack someone.<br/><br/>Your athletes&rsquo; resilience will help them stay out of the Slaughter Box, and the great Brawling values will usually result in chop success. Once you have your opponent on the ground, send your slashers and butchers over to foul them on the ground and then cancel any Penalty cards with the Scare Ref skill.<br/><br/>Interrupt cards are very important to your fouling strategy, so be sure to cycle through your hand quickly. If you don&rsquo;t have any Interrupt cards, discard your whole hand to find some. Being able to attack prone opponents and get four extra dice is paramount. Especially when you can avoid Penalties.<br/><br/>",

You will navigate your chieftain pawn around the map while generating and spending site-located resources (food, wood, wine, and gold) to amass an army and build the roads for them to travel. As you choose where to deploy your your defenses, Caesar and his generals begin a slow buy inexorable march from Rome, taking city by city until nothing is left. Do you race to the front? Or do you hunker down and wait for the final battle? Or do you use one of the small selection of political action cards to collaborate with the invading forces and hope for the best?<br/><br/>Make sure Caesar tells the world about you and your tribe as he executes his campaign of glory, and guarantee your place in history.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Board game Football is a simulation of the real sport football (soccer). Each player has 11 figurines (10 players and one goalkeeper). In one move player rolls two dices, black determines how many fields one figurine moves and white for how many fields moves the ball. The ball can be moved only if a figurine of a player is next to it. When figurine player is moving  - it can push the ball with it. At the end of its movement ball can be 'shot' to another own figurine or into the net. When the ball figurine enters the 'goal' that is score. The opponent puts the ball on the center of the board and begins new action. Players agree on how long the game lasts.<br/><br/>",

Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.<br/><br/>About The Confederate Rebellion:<br/>The Confederate Rebellion army has seen death and destruction ravage their states.  Beaten by the Union during the Civil War, the leaders of the Confederate States of America have abolished slavery and joined forces with all men and women of the South.  Their fight against a stronger and more advanced enemy has ignited a strong love of state and government.  The CSA generals fight side by side with their men and want nothing but the complete destruction of the Union army.  They use surprise assaults and gorilla warfare to even the odds against much more powerful foes.  Their men and women are supplied by Dr. Carpathian Industries allowing access to deadly and corrupt weapons.  Rumors of Voodoo magic and the undead fighting alongside Rebel troops have been whispered about for years.<br/>Wild West Exodus is a Sci-Fi Wild West Miniatures Game set in an alternate history wild west. Strange technologies corrupt the land and death lurks at every corner. RJ-1027, the infamous power source created by Dr. Burson Carpathian is the catalyst behind the constantly escalating arms race between the factions that make up Wild West Exodus.<br/><br/>About Wild West Exodus:<br/>Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.<br/><br/>The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.<br/><br/>Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.<br/><br/>Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.<br/><br/>This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.<br/><br/>No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.<br/><br/>",

What they call the fountain of youth has now kept them alive for hundreds of years endlessly searching for the source.  Their influence over the Mexican people and robust army has pushed them to the door step of the country&rsquo;s boarder.  The men of the Golden Army know of only one thing.

An effort has been taken to bring the play of these games into the 21st Century. Rather than moving all units at a time, players swap impulses, moving an unknown number of units at a time. There are also options to turn the game into a card-driven system complete with random events.<br/><br/>My inspiration for creating this new rules set was the vast (and I do mean vast!) number of supplemental units and maps created by the folks at the Imaginative Strategist. The goal was to create a system that was fully backward compatible with the classic games, but provide a more interactive and suspenseful experience with the option to play with armies from all the nations fielding substantial armies during World War 2.<br/><br/>",

We've taught kids how to play wargames on this: a 11-year-old and two 13-year-olds. It's also a good game to start a novice wargamer on. It's not too complicated and the rules are pretty easy. A better question is &quot;Why would two old wargamers who've played all the monster games design and play a game like this?&quot; Because it captures the ebb and flow of the East Front, it's playable in 2 hours, and the outcome is rarely decided until the final turn if the players are evenly matched. It's pretty likely that neither player will quit in 1942 or 1943 either. But enough of that.<br/><br/>The map is 11 x 17, and there are about 75 counters of equal game-play value, but of widely varying &quot;flavors&quot; from the &quot;5th Ski Brigade&quot; to the &quot;Stalingrad Front.&quot; The map is a grid of squares, somewhat resembling a checkerboard over which the map has been superimposed. Movement is along rail lines and overland, but bad terrain cannot be entered. Turns are quarterly. Combat is resolved without dice, and the CRT varies from turn to turn. There are subtleties in strategy and movement that become more apparent after a couple of games.<br/><br/>Rules are on-line for inspection. See the publisher's web site.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TOLZENAU, GERMANY, 6 April 1945: As the war wound down in its closing days, the supply of rations to German soldiers, even among the elite of the 2nd Marine Division and 12th SS Hitlerjugend remnants, began to break down. Things got so bad that the average landser of these units had to rely on the generosity of the local population for food. Facing these hungry, and likely war-weary German soldiers were well-fed, well-equipped men of the 11th Armoured Division. Despite the dire situation, local Hitler Youth units turned up the last cadre of soldiers, tasked to hold the Weser River Line with local FlaK elements in support. And although the Hitlerjugend teenagers had received less training than their predecessors, they were still fired with the fanaticism that those outside of the world of the Hitler generation could not fathom&mdash;and these young boys were well-led by hardened combat veterans. The combination, along with the nickname Panzer-Teufel (&ldquo;Tank Devils&rdquo;) the unit hung on itself, would soon surprise the British, unaware that these boys embraced a philosophy, printed in their pamphlets, with concepts including, &ldquo;killing is a sport&rdquo; and &ldquo;killing is your duty.&rdquo; And the ultimate, &ldquo;Panzer-Tuefel always shoots first! The man who shoots first lives longer!&rdquo; In the Stolzenau area the soldiers of the 11th Armoured did not fare well, and received a clear message that the Germans intended to hold the area&mdash;via the fierce resistance put up by the teenaged SS Panzergrenadiers of 3, 5, 7 and 10 Kompanies, SS-Ausb.u.Ers.Btl.12.HJ supported by light Flak and 88mm Flak from the RAD battery 5./280.<br/><br/>ATS Across the Aller is all about the war in Northwest Europe in 1945&mdash;with new color die-cut counters in one of the most eclectic collections since Berlin Red Victory!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CS&amp;C is a unique design of miniature gaming for land warfare during the Napoleonic Era.  Unique, in that unit movement and fire/combat is regulated by the use of a grid square marked playing area.  No tape measuring or movement rulers are used.  Unit movement and other actions are limited to the cost of a unit&rsquo;s available Actions Points during each turn phase, as determined during a turn order's sequence of play.<br/><br/>The basic command level is the brigade (consisting of several infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons and/or artillery batteries).  At the end of a turn, one or more Brigade Morale roll(s) are made to determine that brigade's willingness to continue the fight (number of rolls is based on the number of units destroyed or currently in &quot;bad order&quot;).  The roll(s) determine if that Commander retreats 1 or more squares.  The command radius (in squares) is always determined from the respective brigade commander's position or unit objective square (if orders achieved). If a unit starts a turn within &quot;Command Radius,&quot; it allows the unit to be issued an order cube, otherwise it must use all of its movement for the turn to try and get back in command.  An experienced player can control a division or corps with little difficulty after only playing the game a couple of times.<br/><br/>Players provide their own miniatures and terrain, using any size scale and basing of miniatures (generally 6mm to 28mm range).  The general rule figure scale is based upon a 60:1 scale for infantry/Cavalry.  The gaming area can be marked by various methods to show grid square designated areas.  An optional grided gaming mat can be used as the terrain base.<br/><br/>The initial release of the rules covers the campaign conflict between France and Austria in 1809 (but other nation units from different theaters of operation and time frames fought can easily be adapted for play).  There's also a special section for set up of tournament style battles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shatra (шатра), also known as Altay Shatra (Алтай-шатра),  is a cross-over between chess and checkers, which is based on a traditional game of the Altay region whose exact rules were lost. It was re-created in 1960 by Saveliy Yakovlevich Pahayev, a professor of the Gorno-Altaisk Research Institute of History, Language and Literature. In 1974, some reasearchers of this institute &quot;improved&quot; the rules and, in the following year, the first tourna&shy;ment was held in the capital of the Altay Republic. The game soon became a popular mindsport in the Altay region and is also play in Khakassia, Tuva and Buryatia. There were over-the-board  tour&shy;na&shy;ments in Russia (Besh-Ozek (Altay), Chernogorsk (Khakassia), Elo (Altay), Gorno-Altaysk (Altay), Kosh-Agach (Altay), Kyzyl (Tuva), Onguday (Altay), Shebalino (Altay), Ulan-Ude (Bur&shy;yatia)), Ust-Kan (Altay), and Yabogan (Altay).<br/><br/>In addition, there is another &quot;Shatra&quot;, which is a little bit more chess-like and, which is mostly played outside of Altay. It was invented by Vladimir Leonidovich Taushkanov in the 1970s who helped to finalize the Shatra rules in 1974, but went a step further. The older variant popular in the Altay region can be called &quot;Shatra I&quot; and the slightly newer variant, which is today almost exclusively played outside of the Altay region (mainly in the European part of Russia) &quot;Shatra II&quot;. There is also a four-sided variation of Shatra I that can be played by four players.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to mate the opponent's king (biy). Besides the king, Shatra I has 16 pieces, which move like Russian checkers men. In Shatra II there is a king (biy), a queen (bat&iuml;r), two rooks (tura), two bishops (jalk&iuml;n) and 11 pawns (&scaron;atra). Capturing is in both variants mandatory and by jumping similar to checkers. The board has a very unusual shape and was influenced by Chinese Chess (the autonomous Altay Republic borders to China). It has a battlefield, a ditch, a gate and a fortress.<br/><br/>Shatra I can be played online at Abstract Games (a Russian site) and Shatra II at Chess Variants Game Courier. Recently a book was published about Shatra I. Draws are possible and might be substantial similar to checkers and chess, particularly in Shatra I, if the game is played by masters. However, in Shatra I tournaments at Abstract Games, which are played among weak amateurs from Russia, Belarus and Germany, only every 15th game ends in a draw. In Shatra I, there are 400 possible board positions after ply 2. The branching factor is similar to chess.<br/><br/>",

A strength chit is drawn during combat to determine the exact combat value of the unit; the strength chit once pulled is hidden under the unit to increase the &quot;fog of war&quot;.  The Second Battle of Kharkov is the perfect gaming situation to entice players into the world of strength chits.<br/><br/>Spring Prelude is a simulation of the failed Soviet offensive to recapture that city, and the subsequent German counterattack, during the spring of 1942, which produced the last great pocket of Soviet prisoners.  Players conduct operations as either Soviet Direction Commander Semyon Timoshenko, or as the German commander of Army Group South, Fedor von Bock.<br/><br/>The game is based primarily on &quot;Kharkov 1942: Anatomy of a Military Disaster&quot; by David Glantz, with some order of battle enhancement by George Nafziger, and maps based on post-war USGS surveys (which were themselves taken from wartime Soviet surveys).<br/><br/>It's a battle not often covered by other titles, and features actions where both sides were attacker and defender.<br/><br/>The game scale is 3 miles per hex and one day per turn.  Units are primarily German regiments and Soviet divisions.  Components include two 22&quot; x 34&quot; maps (total area 44&quot;x34&quot;), and 700 1/2&quot; counters, including over 350 units.<br/><br/>Scenarios include:<br/><br/>1. Northern Pincer: This historical scenario uses a portion of one map as an introduction to the full campaign. It provides players a look at one thrust of a two-part plan designed to capture Kharkov. The goal of this scenario is to study the true threat to German intentions posed by the Soviet forces east of the city. Lasts 6 turns (12-17 May), one map.<br/><br/>2. Izyum Salient: This is the full historical campaign, covering both offensives, as the battle flows back and forth across the steppe. You can use all the bells and whistles for this one. Lasts 16 turns (12-27 May), both maps.<br/><br/>3. Aggressive Timoshenko: This is a hypothetical situation that assumes the Soviets are ready to attack on the original planned kick-off date. The scenario plays the same as the historical campaign, but is shifted to 8 days earlier. The initial setup is slightly modified and some German reinforcements take longer to arrive. Lasts 20 turns (4-23 May), both maps.<br/><br/>4. Passive Timoshenko: This is another hypothetical situation that places the Soviets on a stronger footing. The scenario postulates that Timoshenko did not propose his attack plans to Stalin who himself was more occupied with other sections of the front. In this case, FRIDERICUS is launched as planned by the Germans against a dug-in and defensive-minded Soviet force. Will there still be a pocket? Lasts 10 turns (18-27 May), one map.<br/><br/>New rules include:<br/><br/>&bull; The effect of rain, mud, and swollen rivers on the early stages of the battle.<br/>&bull; Stacking of Soviet units is different than that of Axis units.<br/>&bull; The addition of headquarters is used to portray the Soviet command structure in a more accurate way.<br/>&bull; Air missions are expanded to cover interdiction sorties.<br/>&bull; Soviet doctrine restrictions reflect the rigidity of the Soviet command structure in the early years of the war.<br/><br/>The game designer, Greg Blanchett, has a folder on Consimworld (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dd4d844/831\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dd4d844/831</a>).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Following the fall of Rhodes, the Knights of St John rewarded Suleiman&rsquo;s magnanimity by harassing Turkish shipping and commerce from their new home in Malta. In 1565, Suleiman sent his generals to finish the task he had left incomplete more than 40 years previously. The Turks laid siege with a force that reached 60,000 in number. They would exterminate the 500 Knights of St John defending the island and wipe the Order from the face of the earth &ndash; or so they thought.  If ever there was an &lsquo;against the odds&rsquo; situation then this was surely it.<br/><br/>Waning Crescent, Shattered Cross (WCSC) recreates the incredible events that occurred on this small Mediterranean island and changed the course of European history. Using cards to drive events, WCSC is a relatively quick playing, moderate complexity simulation. Players must decide whether to try to build their hands to a size that might deliver a decisive blow or to use their cards to gradually wear down their opponent. And the play of cards complements the management of resource including supply, artillery, men and even honour. Acts of treachery, torture and atrocities will contrast starkly with acts of heroism, rousing speeches and even the celebration of Saints Days in the midst of horror and terror.<br/><br/>Along with the full 2-player campaign scenario, there is also a short/learning scenario and a 'bot' controlled solitaire variant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "S&atilde;o Paulo State had a rich railway history! Through the rails of several Railways Companies were transported an important portion of the State&acute;s wealth. Many of these goods were transported to the major cities of S&atilde;o Paulo, cities from other States and others ended up down the hill and delivered to the ships from Santos Port, from where they journeyed to remote places. Amongst the carriage of this wealth also traveled over the rails passengers wagons, at a time when distances were tricky to overcome by steam locomotives which slowly crossed valleys and plains. <br/>From a broader view, it is possible to state 8 companies excelled in this endeavor:  Cia. Sorocabana de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Paulista de Estradas de Ferro, Cia. Mogiana de Estradas de Ferro, Estrada de Ferro Araraquara, S&atilde;o Paulo Railway, Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil, Estrada de Ferro S&atilde;o Paulo-Minas and Estrada de Ferro S&atilde;o Paulo-Rio. Each of these railway companies had their own height but, after the Government&rsquo;s decision to prioritize the road transport, they decayed over time. Nowadays, little remains from many of them but stations, warehouses and rails hidden by the tall grass and oblivion. They were vandalized, destroyed and gone leaving no sign of the passengers, products, wealth and history. Sad closure of a rich and beautiful story.<br/><br/>Ferrovias de S&atilde;o Paulo brings all railways companies in full operation, where products have to be transported through the cities or sent to Santos Port to meet the needs from other destinations. Players have to move their train compositions, buy and sell products, transport them to several railways of S&atilde;o Paulo State while negotiate with other players through their &ldquo;Agent&rdquo;. The market constantly changes the value of the products so players will have to prove their abilities to explore the best time to buy and sell goods. Additionally, players&rsquo; &ldquo;Agents&rdquo; will have to negotiate with other players &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;, as well with the &ldquo;Negotiator&rdquo;, an independent agent controlled by all players. <br/>Each player start with 1 train composition represented by 1 Locomotive and 1 Train Wagon. Throughout the game, players will be able to improve both their locomotives and train wagons to become more efficient and acquire other train compositions. Finally, players can also buy shares from several Railways Companies, shares from Mining Companies (essential for the Coal Market) and shares from Telegraph Company. <br/>Ferrovias de S&atilde;o Paulo is an economic game where the most successful player claims the victory by holding the biggest amount of money. More than a game, history will come to life as players revive the time where people and history were transported in old wooden train wagons, pulled by steam locomotives which insisted on meeting the challenges of S&atilde;o Paulo territory.<br/><br/>We wish you all a safe journey.<br/><br/>",

The revenge of winter is upon us. I fear some may not make it out alive...&quot;<br/><br/>In Frostbite, players collect resources and assemble huts, but must be wary of the bitter cold while doing so. The weather changes constantly and the temperature keeps falling. Players must endure until the final shelters are created!<br/><br/>Each player has five action points per round to use for migrating, scouting, hunting, gathering wood, crafting shelter, and raiding other clans. Players migrate by moving their clan member tokens. They may gather wood only in forest regions and may hunt only in regions with wildlife. Hunting success is determined by die roll. When failing to kill wildlife, a card is drawn to determine the direction it runs away, possibly into another clan's territory. Once players have enough resources, they may build or upgrade shelters.<br/><br/>After each round, cards are drawn to decrease the temperature in different areas. Clan members die if they occupy a region that is too cold, but this may be mitigated by fur coats and shelters.<br/><br/>Only the clans that complete their villages will survive and claim victory.<br/><br/>",

In this game you will control one of these nations and either fight for the continued sovereignty of Georgia or attempt to reclaim lost territory and remake the Soviet Block. Crisis in the Caucasus is a 1-2 player Hex and Counter wargame that plays anywhere from 90mins-120mins. There are two scenarios featured in the game one that is the historical conflict between these two nations in 2008 and a hypothetical campaign that occurs in the near future, a conflict that could have potential major repercussions for the world and plunge us into World War 3.<br/><br/>The gameplay is fast and uses a pretty innovative damage allocation system. The game plays smooth with the turn allowing both players phases to be able to move units and react to the other players offensives or crush an enemy strongpoint in a combine assault. In the historical scenario the Georgians will be trying to make an assault on the break away province of South Ossetia's vital city before the intervention of the Russian military pours into south Ossetia and puts the Georgians on the defensive. In the hypothetical scenario the game starts off the same but at the beginning of each new turn the initiative player rolls on the event table to see if there is Nato intervention or CSTO intervention, if Azerbaijan joins the fight for the Georgians and how many militia units get spawn in South Ossetia. This allows the player to see what would have happened had nato gotten involved and tried to stop the take over of a prospective nato member.<br/><br/>",

Your resources should be spent quickly before they get stolen or disappear. Manage your position and cards carefully, or you might be the next one to fall victim to the void!<br/><br/>In Avoid the Void, you win by controlling the last remaining alien race.

The resource cards' effects will often dramatically shift the landscape of the game. Some will give your spaceships permanent boosts. Some will alter the shape of the galaxy's sectors directly. Some will sabotage your opponents' attempts at survival. It's up to you to manage what you're dealt and steer clear of the black holes that will eat you alive.<br/><br/>",

Battle and Strategy cards help add some strategy to this dice-based game.<br/>As they occupy and rule these castles, cities and/or lands, players collect cards and accumulate points. Points are used to purchase new units or pay ransom for captured units in battle. <br/>The player with the most city and castle cards wins, after a predetermined number of rounds has been played.<br/><br/>",

When the six-shooters go off, which gunslinger will be left standing?<br/><br/>A Town Called Showdown is a card and dice game for two to four players. Steeped in theme, tension builds as the gunslingers either pace their way down a street (two player) or in a saloon (3-4 player).<br/><br/>Based on the tension level, Players can play from their hand of five cards. Gear up with weapons and health that give your gunslinger the edge when the shoot-out happens. Bystander cards are played as they gather in anticipation of the shoot-out; some are there to help the gunslingers by adding bonuses and dice to their pool, others to hinder by removing benefits or changing die results.<br/><br/>When the eventual shootout happens, players fire using their &quot;six-sided shooter&quot; dice - adding and subtracting for bonuses from bystanders and modifiers. Hit your opponent enough times to remove him or her from the competition.<br/><br/>Gun down an opponent to earn a victory star. The player with the most victory stars at the end of three shoot-outs is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legacies of Blood is an expansion set for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle that was published by White Wolf in 2005. The bulk of the set focuses on the Laibon, a sect of African vampires introduced in the Vampire: The Masquerade sourcebook Kindred of the Ebony Kingdom.<br/><br/>Four of the Laibon legacies are presented as standalone clans in Legacies of Blood: the Akunanse, Guruhi, Ishtarri and Osebo (bloodlines of the Gangrel, Nosferatu, Toreador and Brujah, respectively). Each of the set's four preconstructed starter decks spotlighted one of these four legacies.<br/><br/>In addition to the support for the Laibon, Legacies of Blood booster packs also introduced a number of new cards for the bloodlines that had already been introduced in earlier sets: the Ahrimanes, Blood Brothers, Daughters of Cacophony, Gargoyles, Harbingers of Skulls, Kiasyd, Salubri (and their antitribu), Samedi and True Brujah.<br/><br/>Due to the sparse information on the Laibon (and, to a lesser extent, on several other bloodlines) in material published for Vampire: The Masquerade, nearly all of the crypt cards in this set feature characters who were created for V:TES rather than characters who were adapted from the roleplaying game. The same also holds true for Ebony Kingdom, a later expansion set that focused more specifically on the Laibon.<br/><br/>The crypt card Kisha Bhimji was omitted from this set due to a printing error; the crypt card Uzoma (intended to be exclusive to the Osebo starter deck) was accidentally printed for inclusion in booster packs in its place. Kisha Bhimji was later given out as a promotional card at tournaments.<br/><br/>",

Influence is measured in terms of INFLUENCE points. Different hands of cards acquired during the game will score different INFLUENCE points and the player with the highest number of INFLUENCE points wins at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of a common shuffled DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved.<br/><br/>At the beginning of a cycle of turns (from player back to the same player), the top card from the DECK is drawn and placed face up. Players can then take turns to bid and acquire this card using Oinks of the same element. The lowest bid is 1 Oink and players who pass will not be eligible to bid again in the same cycle of turns. Players may not bid for more than what they actually have in Oinks but the number of Oinks each player has can be hidden from other players during play. Each subsequent active bidder must offer a higher value than the previous one. The highest bidder gets the card and the next card is drawn from the DECK.<br/><br/>While the rest of the unsuccessful bidders get back their bids, the amount of Oinks from the successful bidder is divided equally among the rest of the players. This is so UNLESS one of the players is holding on to a card whose FACE VALUE corresponds with the value of the bid or the unit value of the bid E.g. In a bid of 28, 8 is the unit value. If more than one player has cards with the corresponding FACE VALUE, they share the bid amount equally. If any player has more cards of the same corresponding FACE VALUE than others in this situation, he/she will get the entire amount from the bid. After dividing among the players, any remaining amount will be pooled to be accumulated for the next bid. If any division of the bid amount cannot be resolved, it will remain in the pool.<br/><br/>Each time a player bids an amount with a unit value of 0 (E.g. 10, 20, 30), another card will be drawn in addition to the first one in the next bid as a set. Cards in a set cannot be bid separately. Players can bid using a mix of Oinks belonging to any element corresponding with the cards within the set. All acquired cards are placed in front of the players in clear view for others and a player may not bid an amount which has a unit value that corresponds to one of the FACE VALUE belonging to one of his/her cards. The game ends when there are no more cards to bid.<br/><br/>INFLUENCE points are calculated in terms of sets. For each single card, 1 point, each set of 2 cards of the same FACE value, 4 points, each set of 3 cards of the same FACE value, 9 points and a full set of 4 cards of the same FACE value, 16 points. A set of 5 cards of sequential numbers belonging to the same element will receive 25 points, for 6 cards, 36 points, 7 cards, 49 points, 8 cards, 64 points and 9 cards, 81 points. In the case of a tie, the player with more Oinks wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player in Zosimos is given four gems of five different colors (20 gems total) to start. The 24-card deck of potion cards sits in the middle of 2-4 players. On a player's turn, they peek at the top card of the deck and make a bid using gems of the same color for that card. Each card represents one of the colored gems and a number between 1-6. Numbers 1-4 have one potion on a card of a single color; numbers 5-6 have two potions of a single color.<br/><br/>When a player makes a bid for a card, they are bidding with the gems they currently have. When all players but one has passed, the final bidder reveals the card and either pays the difference if they bid over the number, or gets paid the difference if they underbid the number. The card is free if their bid is exactly the same as the number.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players multiply the number of potions on their cards by the number of gems they have of that color, then add the colors up. It becomes very important to try and bluff your opponents into losing all their gems or allowing you to grab a card for cheaper than you should have gotten it.<br/><br/>",

This aspect of the game features modified Churchill and Sherman tanks, the &quot;funnies&quot;, such as the anti-mine Crab variant and the emplacement-busting AVRE.<br/><br/>Second, Operation Deadstick was the codename for an operation by airborne glider troops of the British Army that took place on 6 June 1944 as part of the Normandy landings. The objective was to capture intact two road bridges in Normandy across the River Orne and the Caen Canal providing the only exit eastwards for British forces from their landing on Sword Beach. Intelligence reports said both bridges were heavily defended by the Germans and wired for demolition. Once captured, the bridges had to be held against any counter-attack until the assault force was relieved by commandos and infantry advancing from the British landing zone.<br/><br/>This set includes new scenarios, maps and all the combat counters needed to play out King Red and Operation Deadstick.<br/>Ownership of the ATS Rulebook and standard system markers is required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ogoola Karuta Deutsch 1-48 is a German version of a 400-year-old Japanese card game called Hyakunin-isshu Karuta. The game is sometimes described as intellectual martial arts. It is about listening and being extremely focused and fast, just like the Samurai with their swords. Only here you fight with cards instead.<br/><br/>The game is comprised of two decks of cards, the Reader deck and the Player deck. Cards in the Reader deck contain short poems or poetry quotations while cards in the Player deck contain only the second part of these poems. To begin the game, a Reader is chosen (or you may opt to use the Reader app) and the players are divided into two teams sitting on opposite sides of the table or play area. The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poetry quotation on their cards and the player that finds the matching card first takes that card and puts it aside. If the card taken was on your opponent's side, you must give one card from your side to your opponent. The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).<br/><br/>The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185). In order to win the war, you need a strategy. Place the cards you are familiar with close to you (in the beginning it is normal that none of the cards are familiar). If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field. Since the reader or app will always read the complete quotation, you do not need prior knowledge of the poems. Strategically place the playing cards in a way that you can find and take them quickly such as laying them alphabetically or categorize them under the same first words.<br/><br/>Ogoola Karuta Deutsch 1-48 is not a translation of the original Japanese game. In this first edition, we have selected 48 of the well-known classical poems written by famous German poets in German. The quotes include poems by Goethe, Rilke, Heine, Eischendorff, Schiller and so forth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>A board game about parliamentary politics.<br/><br/>Partitocracy focuses on the relationship between the parties, the voters, represented in the game by voter groups, and their interactions, both through legislation and media outlets. Each player is in charge of a Party, decides what gauge of the ideological spectre they want to represent, fight with other parties to be the preferred option for their voters and all of it while establishing alliances to reach government and develop their own policies.<br/><br/>This is a game for 2 to 5 players, and a regular game should last between 2 and 3 hours. Players handle a party by spreading its influence among the voter groups they want to represent, and from which they will gather the voters from. By playing actions and presenting laws in favour of these groups they will collect victory points, but at the same time it will grant voters to the groups affected negatively by those laws by altering the status quo, thus with every law the government pushes in their interests, the more likely that the opposition manages to gather a majority in the next election.<br/><br/>Turns represent a year, and in it several rounds are played. The main resource for the players come in the form of cards, and they can use it for either pay for actions or laws, to trigger the event the card includes or to fire up or cool down the public opinion. Every four turns (or earlier if the government's budget is turned down at the end of every turn) an election round is called and the players have to assemble a new government.<br/><br/>The other pivotal element is the stability of the country. Player's actions and random events modify the stability and how well the country as a whole works (unemployment, security, social integration, etc). This bar is bracketed between two values: Welfare on the low end (how bad things can get before people start rioting on the streets) and high end (how much bureaucracy and government intervention can cap the growth in good times). The stability can never get past the Red Tape value, and if it falls below the Welfare the board advances in the revolution track. If it's not properly handled, it's possible (though not easy) to trigger a civil conflict that ends the game and the winner is decided by which of the most extremist factions got more popular support.<br/><br/>The game is not so much a pure simulator but one that pretends to replicate the flow and the narrative that you can perceive in any country with a parliamentary government environment, and to such extend we believe we have achieved so.<br/><br/>",

Japanese landings at the Kra Isthmus in the north went virtually unopposed and their ground troops advanced steadily southward. On December 10th the Allied battleships Repulse and Prince of Wales were sunk with great loss of life by Japanese torpedo bombers.<br/><br/>The first line of resistance for the Allies was at Jitra in the north of Malaya. Holding on here meant the major airbase at Alor Star would allow Allied fighters and bombers to restage and possibly launch attacks on the Japanese bases, thereby keeping the enemy at bay and away from Singapore. One of the main positions of the Allied defensive line was at the village of Nangka, just a couple of miles to the north of the town of Jitra. The first big battle in Malaya was about to be fought.<br/><br/>Each copy of Jitra Jitters is composed of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     One 11 by 17 inch map with game record-keeping tracks and terrain identification.<br/>     60 un-mounted double sided units.<br/>     One set of 8 page rules.<br/><br/><br/>Infantry and Heavy Weapons units are battalions, all other units are companies. A hex is a third of a mile across. Each turn represents one hour of time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For hundreds of millions of citizens of the Sino-Soviet Union, Iosef Stalin is the Supreme Leader, whose wisdom will guide them to victory. For the enemies of the SSU, the name means death. Many of the SSU&rsquo;s early heavy tanks were named after Kliment Voroshilov, the Defense Commissar. When it was time for a new and improved series, who better to name it after than the Supreme Leader himself?<br/>The &ldquo;Aleksandr&rdquo; is the latest version of the IS-5, mounting two impressive Tesla Guns that fire on the same target. The result is devastating again any type of target but particularly against armor. The vehicle is presented here in its Babylon pattern camouflage, as observed around Mesopotamia circa 1947.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BARBARIANS &amp; EMPIRES - OCCIDENT ARENA, takes you and your fellow players to the ancient world at the beginning of the third century BC. In this edition you are fighting for the supremacy in the western Mediterranean and Western Europe, the geographical area which the Romans and Byzantines designated as Occident. In the western Mediterranean powers, the Greeks, the Carthagians and the Romans compete for hegemony; in the north are powerful nations such as the Celts, Germans, and Dacians, who, if they are not at war to each other, aspire to the warm, sweet and rich regions of the South. The Iberians fight for their own survival. It was the time shortly after the Celtic storm on Rome, done by Brennus and after the death of Alexander the Great. It was the period of the Punic wars, followed by the beginning of the Germanic invasions of the Cimbri and Teutones, which once again placed Rome at a great danger. They were defeated only by consul Marius after his military reforms. Now you play for the supremacy in the Occident in those last pre-Christian centuries, in which the gates of the Roman Temple of Janus were only closed once. Choose your people and win!<br/><br/>While playing, you have to successfully develop several skills to win, namely those of a military strategist, a prudent economist and a skilled diplomat. Increase your empire revenue through urban development, conquests and through your navy, which dominates the trade revenue in sea zones. Use your diplomats and support your army leaders or trade with other players, instigate revolts, gain neutral provinces peacefully, manipulate the opposing army commander, or send huge sums of money to support your allies. Secure your domains by garrison troops and fortifications. Build powerful armies, recruit the best of your people to increase the performance of your army, and develop strategies to force your powerful enemies to their knees. Hope, that Fortuna favors you. May the gods be with you!<br/><br/>Reach the supremacy of your nation in the Occident. You can achieve this dominance by leading the victory-chart at the end of 8 rounds or you can eliminate one of your adversaries in a Deathmatch by conquering his last province. Several winners in different order categories are possible. If a last province of an opponent has been conquered by your army, you place one of your markers on the skulls on the game board. No matter how the game evolves, you are one of the game winners, as long as you do not lose your last province, too. Any player remains in the game until he has completely lost his last province (does not apply to the nation of BRITANNIA, they stay always in the game!)<br/><br/>",

Dice are also used to try and block shots, fight, and attempt penalties. Other actions involve moving team member figures on the board. Players also have cards to play that enhance the actions they take on their turn. After taking their turn the player advances their game clock token to keep track of game length.<br/>After 3 periods of play the player who scored the most goals wins.<br/><br/><br/>",

Mirroring the way the band builds performance sets in real life, you'll arrange themed subsections (called Blocks), using the right songs in the right combinations to earn the most Applause Points. However, Broken Strings and Technical Difficulties might disrupt your plans...<br/><br/>Carder Harmonies is a card game for 1-3 players (competitive or collaborative mode available for multiplayer games). Using various Song cards covering the entire discography of the post-hardcore band La Dispute, players use their hand of 3 cards to populate Set Blocks with Songs, abiding of course by that Block's special conditions (a variety of song counts, allowing songs of only certain records, or heavy/soft dynamics). When a Block condition is met, that Block becomes closed and those songs are safe from the banes of Technical Difficulties, Broken Strings, and other immediate action cards in the deck.<br/><br/>New to the game in 2nd edition are Block Modifiers, a type of card to add additional restrictions to a single block, granting bonus applause at the end of the game for achieving the listed goal or costing you the same amount upon failure.<br/><br/>Once all their Set Blocks are closed, players then tally their Applause Points, accounting for a Song's individual worth, any special conditions granting bonus points, and a streak of consecutive Songs from the same record. Solitaire players aim to surpass a given Applause threshold for their chosen difficulty level, while 2 player mode has the players aiming to score higher than their opponent.<br/><br/>",

Each player tries to pair four chickens of the same color along with a rooster and feed to complete a Chicken Run.<br/><br/>The game is fast paced&ndash; compete against other players to fill your chicken coops and complete your runs- the first to reach ten points wins. But watch out for action cards though as other players can steal or eat your chickens right from your coop.<br/><br/>While Chicken Run is simple, it is full of energy and excitement that develops as players attack one another with varmints, protect their coops from attacks with guard dogs, and trade with other players for the cards they need to complete a Chicken Run.<br/><br/>",

Out in the distant void, ancient enemies sense weakness and band together to bring down those who defeated them and sent them running. Humanity's only hope is to reach once more for the furthest stars, discover new worlds rich with resources, and build a new Empire that can survive for another thousand years.<br/><br/>Deep: Enemy Frontier is a highly asymmetric sci-fi strategy game for 2-4 players. Each player takes a unique role during a period of intense conflict in our quadrant of the galaxy. The Empire seeks to shore up its weaknesses and once more establish itself as the dominant force in the galaxy. The Usurper threatens to bring the Empire down from within and establish a free and open society ruled by the people rather than a dictator. The Rival sweeps in from the remote edges of the galaxy, a coalition of aliens burning with revenge against an Empire that conquered and harried them over the past hundreds of years. The Captain throws himself out into the stars, to explore and have grand adventures, his exploits broadcast to the entire Empire; perhaps his fame will lead him one day to sit upon the throne of all humanity...<br/><br/>",

Three dice are white, one is blue and one is red. The Blue Die represents your hero; each White Die that rolls below or equal to the Blue Die does one damage to the Enemy. The White Dice that roll above the Blue Die do damage to your hero.<br/><br/>If the Red Die rolls over the Blue Die then the Enemy you're attacking gets to activate their ability. This can be anything from an energy shield that protects the Enemy to a devastating counterattack or more.<br/><br/>When you defeat an Enemy the Hero that you used gets to level up and heal, get stronger or gain powerful loot. Each Hero has two abilities that they can use to increase the chances of success. The only thing is that you have to choose which ability you want to activate, and you can only activate it once per game.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to take out all of the Enemies before your opponent takes out all of theirs. You can play solo, too!<br/><br/>",

After the initial Axis invasion, things are getting heated in a hurry between the Tigris and the Euphrates. The Allies and SSU have now realized that the third Bloc wouldn't have committed so many forces for anything other than a prime objective. If the Axis sought oil, they would have attacked elsewhere like the Arabian Peninsula or Iran's oil fields. They sure are in for more than sand and old ruins, aren't they? NDAK forces have finally found their target: an isolated outpost on the outskirts of the desert held by a handful of French Foreign Legionnaires in an area crawling with Spetsnaz. Only the Luftwaffe boys can mount the fastest strike ever to take this objective before anyone else: Operation Kondor.<br/><br/>This new expansion for Dust 1947 describes all the Luftwaffe forces, with new characters, vehicles, Platoons, etc. With the Operation itself come three short stories by Andy Chambers himself, a must read for every Dust fan!<br/><br/>",

A muddy field waited for the battle to begin.  Near the small village of Agincourt, two armies faced each other in the chill of the early morning.  Archers, Footmen, Scouts, and Cavalry ordered themselves for battle.  The land was the prize that was sought.  The cost must be paid in blood.  Welcome to the Fields of Agincourt.<br/><br/>Agincourt is a combative tile-placement game for 2-5 players.  The map will form as the game is played, with each player fighting for position for the final battle.  The goal of the game is to defeat your enemies and claim the most victory points.<br/><br/>Playing Fields of Agincourt consists of two game stages:  <br/>Marshalling the Troops:  Players take turns placing tiles, recruiting troops, and claiming Bastions.  Once all the tiles are placed, the Final Battle will begin.<br/>The Final Battle:  Players are vying for superior battle positions within Bastions.  Contested Bastions are resolved one at a time, with the winning player receiving victory points.  The player with the most victory points will win the game.<br/><br/>",

Players direct their tribe to build, battle monsters, and explore new territories. As a God, players can choose to be Benevolent, focusing on building their tribe or giving gifts to other tribes, or Malevolent, striking down the resources and Heroes of their own or that of other tribes.<br/><br/>The game combines elements of 4x with a deck building mechanic. Each game play is designed to be unique, with multiple characters, a modular map, and several actions for each player to choose from each turn. The race to claim the throne is won by the first player to achieve 12 Victory Points. You can choose to expand your tribes through villages and shrines, build a magnificent temple and collect tributes, go the battle route and fight monsters, take a balanced approach or more.<br/><br/>Deities Domination is a versatile game, designed to maximize replayability. While players may have temporary setbacks, no one is eliminated from the game, and the structure of the game allows for recovery from asymmetric distribution of power, giving players the ability to recoup from disadvantageous situations.

To gain control of a news cycle (ROUND), the player must gain a majority of the available viewers, be the only one left with viewers, or be the only one left with credibility. Win three news cycles and you have successfully pushed your agenda changing the public's opinion.<br/><br/>Each player starts the round with 2 Credibility Cards, 1 Collusion Card, 7 viewer chips, and 1 Action Card. These are the tools that are used to push your agenda.<br/><br/>There are six Credibility Cards, each with their own action, that are used to affect viewership or credibility. On your turn, you may choose to take an action of any Credibility Card whether you have that card or not. If you lose both Credibility Cards, you no longer have a reputable opinion and are out for the round.<br/><br/>Viewer chips represent how many people believe in your movement. Each player starts with 7 viewer chips. If you gain 20 viewer chips, then a majority agree with your opinions and you win the round. If you lose all of your viewer chips, then you have become no longer relevant and are out for the round.<br/><br/>If a player does an action of a Credibility Card that they do not have, then they are susceptible to being called out for their Fake News! If correctly called out for Fake News by an opponent, the player loses one of their Credibility Cards. If incorrectly called out for Fake News by an opponent, the opponent loses a Credibility Card.<br/><br/>Management of both viewers and credibility are key to success. Focus too much on credibility and a player could lose all their viewers. Focus too much on viewers and a player could lose all their credibility.<br/><br/>To turn the tide of the game, a player can use a Collusion Card. Collusion Cards come with a higher risk because it requires a specific set of Credibility Cards. Yet the reward is well worth it because the player gets to follow through with a special action.<br/><br/>As you become close to winning, the media has more watchful eye on your actions forcing you to draw a hidden Scrutiny Card. Scrutiny Cards change the way you play the game possibly forcing you to play truthfully or to play as a full on liar.<br/><br/>Once you have won three news cycles and successfully pushed your agenda, you get to tell your fellow melancholy media members what is now commonly accepted as truth i.e. &quot;It is considered rude to greet a friend without using excessive JAZZ HANDS&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the early morning&rsquo;s mist, the clatter of the tumbril&rsquo;s wheels on the cobblestone echo through the streets of Paris. It brings a gruesome feast -consumed in rhythmic chopping- the National Razor is the gluttonous ouroboros of the revolution. Over the paranoid whisperings in the breadlines, and plastered rumors on the broadsheets, you sense that the revolution hangs by a thread. Will you be able to draw it back from the abyss, or will the final thump on the scaffold see your head in a basket?<br/><br/>Giving careful homage to the themes of the period, play one of six factions vying for dominance of revolutionary France. Each faction has eight historical leaders to choose from and five unique asymmetrical agendas to push though in an attempt to gain control of the revolution.<br/><br/>The game includes mechanics to coerce obedience, punish betrayal, or cooperatively reach mutual goals- allowing players to pick a path forward that best suits them. Each agenda proposed comes with a pool of 'largess' for players to distribute to win support for their machinations. Conversely, successfully sending an opposing faction's leader 'to the Chop' gains them, in addition the points scored, the trophy of a head on a pike.<br/><br/>National Razor is played in five rounds. Each round begins with players simultaneously selecting a leader for their faction and secretly choosing what their faction will focus on that round. All players then reveal their leaders, and the leader with the best rank becomes the First Citizen to begin the game play.<br/><br/>On a player's turn they can play any number of follower cards, buy improvements and titles, but they must play one of their five Agenda cards.  Agendas come with a pool of Largess -follower cards- that the active player proposes to give to players if her Agenda passes. Players then simultaneously vote on the fate of the Agenda using  Yes and No cards and may add modifiers if they feel particularly strongly about the outcome.<br/><br/>Player decisions also advance a token along the Terror Track. When a Terror hits, the game state changes in unforeseen ways that encourage and reward aggressive behavior. The most aggressive behavior being attempting to send an opposing faction leader 'to the Chop.' This is done by proving that your incriminating evidence is legit by naming what the faction's chosen focus for the round is (thereby showing you have successfully infiltrated their faction). If the opposing faction is able to show the named focus from their unselected pile, the Chop attempt fails. If the named focus is correct however, the opposing faction leader is removed from the game, the accuser gets the bounty listed on the deceased character's card, and gains a  trophy card showing a head on a pike to demonstrate how brutal their faction is.<br/><br/>After all factions have taken a turn, the round is over. All players with leaders still alive reveal their chosen focus, gaining the special benefits they provide. If its the 5th round of the game, total VP's are added up, with the highest being  deemed the victor.<br/><br/>",

Dirt Track Saturday Night is the game of Sprint Car, Supermodified and Stock Racing on dirt ovals which take place all over America. You set up your car to be tuned for the track conditions. Tracks can be wet and mushy all the way to dry and abrasive with other conditions in between. Choose your gear ratios, suspension setting and tire selection and your wing angle if the car has one; then go like hell. The playing surface is a three foot by four foot rectangle. You can buy and print pre-made tracks or make your own living diorama with the information provided in the rules. Included in the rules are all the charts you'll need to run a single race or, one night of racing where you have to do well in order to make it into the feature event, or run a full season of events to determine the winner of the season championship. <br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>On their turn, players roll two d6, which determines how far they can move. They can move one more space beyond what they are entitled to move, but doing so carries a chance of spinning out and/or crashing. Maneuvers can be performed to pass other racers, but the more fancy the maneuver, the more likely the car will not successfully execute it. Players must fight to gain and maintain the lead for 6 laps, after which the winner is determined. <br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The earth&rsquo;s defensive shield was activated, but it is only strong enough to withstand the enemy&rsquo;s main laser for a short period of time.<br/><br/>Our only hope rest on a small fleet of terrestrial spaceships that were orbiting the earth, ill prepared for such a moment of crisis. These ships&rsquo; crew now holds the most important mission of their lives: attempt to destroy the enemy ship while simultaneously keeping the earth&rsquo;s shield functioning, in an effort to avoid the end of all humankind.<br/><br/>MECHANICS<br/><br/>During the match, the players must prepare the crew (roll dice) and take them to perform various tasks on the ships (modules). After all player ships have participated, the enemy turn will begin, during which the enemies will attempt different actions against the player ships or planet earth depending on the Strategy Card that has been revealed.<br/><br/>After each round, the state of the game must be checked to determine whether the match has ended, be it in favor or against the players. If the match has not yet ended, another round is prepared, advancing the marker on the portal to another dimension to the next counter, among other things. The game will inevitably end when the marker on the portal to another dimension reaches the last counter and cannot be moved any forward at the end of the round.<br/><br/>The players must use the limited amount of turns at their disposal to try and prepare their ships and improve them as much as possible, with better modules and more crew, in order to be victorious. Achieving good synergy between the modules of a ship and maintaining good communication with companions might result in a seemingly impossible task being successfully completed.<br/><br/>The earth is counting on you! Good luck!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imperial Germany laid down her last dreadnought in January 1915, and never completed her. But planning continued for new classes of battleships, battle cruisers, armored cruisers and scout cruisers. All understood that they could not possibly be built during the course of the ongoing First World War, but would be laid down afterwards.<br/><br/>Reflecting the lessons first of the battles of the Falklands, Coronel and Helgoland Bight, and eventually those of Jutland, the new German designs continued to emphasize protection. At the urging of sea officers, the new ships also now carried armament equal to that of the British, and would make much higher speeds as well.<br/><br/>Across the North Sea, the British Admiralty had no clear idea of what the Germans might be planning to build, but could state with certainty that they and other potential enemies would continue to improve their warships. New British dreadnoughts would carry ever-more-powerful armaments, including a new, secret 18-inch gun.<br/><br/>Jutland 1919 is a supplement for our Great War at Sea: Jutland game, studying these drawing-board battleships that would never actually be launched. It includes background essays, forty new scenarios, and 80 new silky-smooth die-cut playing pieces (60 double-sized &quot;long&quot; ship pieces and 20 square ones). It is not playable by itself; you&rsquo;ll need our Jutland game and High Seas Fleet book to play the scenarios. You can, of course, just read the essays and fondle the pieces without owning either. We won&rsquo;t tell.<br/><br/>New pieces include three classes of German battleships designed but never built: a fast battleship with eight 15-inch guns, a battleship with ten 15-inch guns in five turrets, with three of them in a unique triple-stacked arrangement. And an even larger ship with 16.5-inch guns. There are two new classes of battle cruiser, one with 15-inch guns, one with 16.5-inch guns. And two variations on the fast armored cruiser proposed after the Battle of Jutland, one with ten 8.2-inch guns, and one with twenty (20) 5.9-inch guns. Plus there are additional scout cruisers and destroyers.<br/><br/>The British for their part receive their improved but slower Queen Elizabeth class, with ten 15-inch guns, and the massive ships proposed to carry eight 18-inch guns apiece, based on the Hood design but slower with battleship-scale protection. Plus their own fast armored cruiser.<br/><br/>These are powerful new ships, and now you can lead them into battle.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mr. Rhee: Surviving the Nightmare World is a 3-6 player asymmetrical card game, where the one plays the hero and the many are the villains. As a Villain, spend Greed to recruit and send your evil minions to take control of locations throughout Nightmare World from the innocents -- or use your character specific win conditions to seize the day. As the Hero, use Hope to gather Fight, Charisma, and Magic to hold out for six rounds -- the day and night of the Three days of Darkness that are consuming Nightmare World -- using your team and abilities to mitigate damage... and set the Villains at each other&rsquo;s' throats. Fast-paced and wickedly fun, this game plays in about 30 minutes. Will you take over the Nightmare World, or just survive it?<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Gameplay starts with the hero determining which villain should play first. That Villain spends Greed to recruit Minions, and place them in Locations. Placement happens either secretly (face-down where they will do team damage), or with fangs bared (face-up where they may single out a specific victim among the Innocents, Heros, or opposing Villain&rsquo;s Minions). However, Greed is flipped to Hope, so the more actions a Villain takes, the more the Hero will be able to counter. The Hero then uses Hope to move to locations, and gather Fight, Charisma, and Magic. Each Hero abilities card costs more Hope than the previous, so the Hero determine what skills are worth the cost.<br/>Once the alternating sides of Villain and Hero have each taken their turn, any Locations with conflict are resolved. This time, the starting Villain may choose which Location resolves first. The Innocents fight the Minions with the help of the Heroes, who now use their skills of Fight (brute force against the opposing side) Charisma (persuading a Minion to turn on his allies) Magic (targeting a single Minion to attack) while the Villains strategically use their Minions abilities and brute strength.<br/>When the conflict is concluded, so is the round, and the fight begins anew. Either the heroes use their skills and special powers to hold off the terror for all 6 rounds (Day and Night of &ldquo;The Three Days of Darkness&rdquo;), or one of the Villains meet their asymmetrical win conditions to take the city by force, rule the world, and win the game!<br/><br/>Theme<br/>In the graphic novel series NIGHTMARE WORLD we learn that once upon a time an Archangel named Lucifer, incensed with what he saw as a tyrannical reign over all Creation by God, organized a revolt coup that he hoped would give him control of Earth and all humanity. It failed. As a result, Lucifer and the angels who followed him were banished to the bowels of the Earth as punishment, forever banned from Heaven and Earth. Realizing that the numbers were on his side, Lucifer has since spent years organizing a plan for revenge &ndash; this time relying not just on the Fallen Angels, but also recruiting Lilith and her countless demon spawn, Cthulhu and the Great Old Ones, rallying them together as part of one concentrated effort to occupy Earth and take control of Creation in a campaign of monstrous terror dubbed &ldquo;The Three Days of Darkness.&rdquo;<br/>In the spin-off graphic novel series TALES OF MR. RHEE we learn that humanity is not without its defenses against the forces of darkness, both with the street-fighting magician Mr. Rhee as well as the covert cabal of magicians known as The P.R.O.M.I.S.E. Group. When &ldquo;The Three Days of Darkness&rdquo; erupt across the world, The P.R.O.M.I.S.E. Group, dedicated to the &ldquo;Permanent Reduction Of Monsters in Society Everywhere&rdquo;, emerge from the shadows to join forces with Mr. Rhee and a collection of other heroes who know they may not be able to win, but are nonetheless willing to sacrifice everything to make sure the forces of darkness won&rsquo;t either.<br/>Written by horror comic master Dirk Manning &ndash; who also serves as a consultant on this game &ndash; NIGHTMARE WORLD Volumes 1-4, the NIGHTMARE WORLD OMNIBUS, and TALES OF MR. RHEE Volumes 1-4 (so far) are all published by Devil&rsquo;s Due Publishing and available anywhere comics are sold.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, only one student will be accepted. Manage your grades, social life, and influence with teachers to gain resume points. The player with the most resume points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 4 Freshman event cards, and draft them. In a two-player game, the players will draw 6 Freshman event cards and discard 2 of them. Then, the players take turns playing cards from their hand. The card's event occurs. Then, the player gains a number of action points. Each action point can be spent on one of the five actions. Players can socialize to gain friends that can be used to purchase club leadership, granting an immediate and yearly bonus as well as Resume Points. Players can also study to gain one of four stats that can go towards test correcting a class, another action. Correcting a class to an A provides a teacher influence bonus as well as resume points. A player can also chat with one of eight teachers to gain teacher influence with them. This influence can be spent on a special ability or on gaining a recommendation letter that is worth a significant amount of Resume Points. Finally, players can relax to reduce their stress. This is important because a high amount of stress will cause breakdown, resulting in lower happiness that increases stress at the end of every year, and a detention that causes a loss of Resume Points.<br/><br/>Players also manage secret goals in the form of Essays. Each player is dealt two Essays at the beginning of the game, and can complete them at any time to draw an additional essay. All essays are worth points at the end of the game. At the start of Junior Year, players may also elect to take the FUN, a standardized test that costs Stats to take. The FUN result is determined by a die roll, and can result in a large resume point bonus, or nothing at all.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Predators, also known as yautja, are an alien race that is best known for their hunting of the most dangerous prey in the galaxy, including humans and xenomorphs. These Hunts, as they are known, are done for honor, sport, and as a rite of passage for young Predators looking to become adults in their own right.<br/><br/>They are a sentient race that is humanoid in appearance, but larger than most actual humans in size, standing well  over  seven  feet  tall  and  weighing  300  lbs  or  more  in  many  cases.  They  breathe  an  atmosphere  that  is  similar to Earth&rsquo;s, though with a higher degree of nitrogen. Their faces have been seen to have quill-like hair on their brows, cheeks, and chins. Their mouths have four mandibles they use to help communicate or to show emotion,  several  sharp  teeth  used  to  tear  flesh,  and  a  small,  thin,  snake-like  tongue.  Their  elongated  heads  have a crown of thick bone and end in a mass of long appendages that have been nicknamed dreadlocks.<br/><br/>As  with  humans,  their  skin  color  can  vary  from  light  to  dark  hues,  as  well  as  striped  and  mottled  patterns.<br/>While  primitive  and  tribal  in  appearance,  their  technology  is  extremely  advanced.  Their  armor  and  weapons  <br/>are made from an alloy that is resistant to even the corrosive effects of a xenomorphs acid blood. Most of them <br/>mount a plasma caster on their shoulder; a powerful energy cannon able to kill most of their enemies in a single <br/>shot that utilizes a high-tech, triple targeting laser to track their foes. Other weapons include combi-sticks, which are collapsible spears, and smart-disks that can eliminate multiple enemies in a single throw.<br/><br/>On their left arm, each yautja wears a wrist-gauntlet which allows them to access many different systems. It controls their cloaking ability, access and remote piloting control of their ships, local terrain layouts, and even contains  a  miniature  nuclear  explosive  to  ensure  that  their  technology  doesn&rsquo;t  fall  into  their  enemy&rsquo;s  hands.  <br/>Some more evolved Predators even incorporate a second set of wrist-blades or even more weaponry packed into them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Markers are removed from the board if they are surrounded by their opponents markers, or have one or fewer neighbors.<br/><br/>This means that games of Kansho are often won or lost on a single critical move that can occur at any time during the game. Players must therefore play with precision and cunning in order to be victorious.<br/><br/>The rules of Kansho are few and simple to grasp but a great deal of practice and skill is required in order to master the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

New technologies have been developed which allow interstellar star pilots to overcome challenges like stellar debris, warped space, and black holes. Mass production has finally brought the costs of these technological marvels down enough to be accessible to the private sector, and like any good space civilization you capitalize on the opportunity.<br/><br/>In Kepler Run, you play an independent space runner attempting to win the most riches for yourself by being the first to fulfill lucrative contracts the fastest. You'll need to put all of your runner know-how to good use, and with a little bit of planning and luck, you can be the first to complete your Kepler Run.<br/><br/>In more detail, Kepler Run is a card-drafting and route-planning game. Each round, new cards are revealed. In turn, players draft a card and decide whether to add it to their ship as an engine, add it to the board (the run) for points, or discard it for fuel modules. After each player has drafted two tiles, in turn players attempt to make it as far as they can, crossing from one side of the board to the other. Players collect points depending on how far they get and on which objective they complete along the way.

        "description": "Ancient Rome, IV century A.D.: it is a stormy period in Roman Empire, the quiet of past centuries is only a memory and the struggle for the title of Emperor is increasingly harsh.<br/>In the Capital of the Empire, the most important &quot;Gens&quot; do not miss a chance to try to increase their power, to be able to influence the new Augustus as much as possible. Despite political instability, each faction wants to enlarge its possessions and is not afraid to face also armed clashes, with bloody battles later forgotten in the windings of the official historiography... Meanwhile, the Arena and the gladiators are important faces in the fight for the power: the people worship their idols!<br/><br/>Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome is a strategy and combat board game, set in a period where the power of emperors is often challenged by ambitious province governors or by smart military commanders. In Rome, the Senate is torn apart by the struggle among the various factions, while the people can be influenced by the charisma of the heroes fighting in the Arena. You will have to balance the development of each settlement, the conquest of new territories (even through military battles) and the growth of the skills of your Hero, so to control the most of the Eternal City&rsquo;s seven hills: only in this way it will be possible to dominate Rome and, perhaps in the future, even the entire Empire...<br/><br/>In Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome, each player will command a powerful Roman dynasty and will have to struggle to gain the domination over the Capital of the Empire: build barracks and farms and expand your influence on the &ldquo;domus&rdquo; on the seven hills of Rome, but do not forget to use your resources to erect a temple in honor of one of the deities! In return, you will have incredible relics for your hero, as well as unique powers for gaining an advantage and defeat your rivals. But do not underestimate the Arena, if you manage to accumulate more glory, the whole city could be yours, but if you were defeated... well, in Rome the losers have a short life!<br/><br/>Anno Urbis - The Fight for Rome offers exceptional components, many miniatures and the 3D models of the seven hills of Rome, true focus of the game and whose conquest will determine the winner. Next to them there is also the Gladiator Arena, in which the players&rsquo; fighters will compete to the death to increase glory and influence of their faction. The union among resources management, cards and combat make this game unique, but also the historical accuracy is important: indeed, we tried to rely on really existed events, characters and places, to allow players to immerse themselves in a sometimes neglected, but also fascinating and glorious, historical period.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Why bother facing a potential enemy tomorrow, when they can be turned into ash today.<br/>This game captures some of that sense of desperation, but remains simple in its implementation.<br/><br/>As such, there are three actions to choose from each turn: bomb one planet, search a general area for enemy colonies nearby, and search two planets for enemy colonies to confirm their specific location.<br/><br/>The galaxy is a dark forest, filled with ravenous enemies.<br/>There can only be one victor.<br/><br/>",

They then turn the timer and everyone writes down words they can form from the revealed cards, trying to come up with the longest word.  When time is up, the player with the longest word scores the length of their word; tied players all score.

        "description": "Ignite is a fast-paced game where you race to destroy opposing forges by commanding your minions to ignite, attack, and combo your way to victory!<br/><br/>As the Forgemaster, your task is to construct a powerful lineup to destroy the enemy's Forge. When your Forge takes damage, remove that many cards from the top of your Forge, placing them into your Scrapheap. Once an empty Forge takes damage, it's destroyed and that player loses the game.<br/><br/>Your Forge consists of 30 Minion cards, which behave like most monsters in games in the TCG/CCG genre: they have cost, attack, and health values, and can attack each other or a &quot;life total&quot; (an opposing forge). The playboard features a place for the players deck (Forge), destroyed minions (Scrapheap), Energy used to summon minions, and summoned minions (Lineup). The core mechanic of the game is Ignite: all Bot cards Ignite. When a Bot Ignites, players roll the two Ignite Dice (d6) to determine which target is hit and for how much. The Bot has Ignite Values, displayed on the bottom in three flames, which display how much damage is caused by the explosion.<br/><br/>There are two parts of the turn: Attacking and Building. During Attacking, players can attack with any number of their Minions against any opposing Minion or Forge. If there is a Forge Guardian (minion on slot 1), that Minion must be attacked and destroyed first. The second part of the turn is Building, where players can spend Energy to summon Minions, or draw cards. Players start their turns with 4 Energy, with the first turn of the game starting with only 2 (2 player only), and players start the game with 5 cards in their hands. Minions typically have one of two abilities: Summon or Scrap abilities, which occur when the minion is Summoned or Destroyed respectively. The deck is full of Bots which Ignite, and Forgelings, which can be combined with them to Ignite more often or power up Ignite abilities. For 3+ player games, player sit in a circle, play proceeds clockwise, you can only attack adjacent players, and Ignites hit both adjacent players! To start, simply place your shuffled Forge on your game board, along with 4 energy, then draw 5 cards.<br/><br/>For more you can find the website at <a target='_blank' href=\"https://ignite.cards/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://ignite.cards/</a> and the rules at rules.ignite.cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The brotherhood of the Night&rsquo;s Watch has pledged to keep Westeros safe from all the horrors that live north of The Wall. Forsaking any life they might&rsquo;ve had before joining, they are entirely committed to their vows. Within their number are the Builders. They maintain the fortifications in and around The Wall, as well as all the arms and armor used by the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Their forges create some of the best and hardiest gear, including the valuable crossbow. While there are the massive ballistae that act as siege weapons, as well as the Scorpions that are light enough to be taken to battle afield, they also create hand-held crossbows. They heavily train with them, becoming a fighting force of their own. Next month, Night&rsquo;s Watch players will be able to add the Builder Crossbowmen to their forces. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how they operate.<br/>Being the ones that built the crossbows, the Builders are also experts in their use, having trained intensely with them. This results in the to-hit number for their crossbow attack being a 3+ and rolling seven dice when at full ranks, and even when one rank has been destroyed. The power in these &ldquo;little instruments of death&rdquo; is so great that they can attack at Long Range and apply Sundering. The crossbows aren&rsquo;t the only armaments the Builders have. They also can go into battle wielding longswords. While they are competent in their use, the Builder Crossbowmen would still prefer to reach out and touch the enemy at range. And, if an enemy wants to do them engage via a charge, the unit&rsquo;s Ready! Aim! Fire! order lets them get an extra attack in before the enemy closes in.<br/>On the defensive side of things, the unit shows their weakness. With a Defense Save of 6+ and a Morale value of 7+, this is a unit that really does not want the enemy to attack them. Their moderate speed of 5 also means that they can&rsquo;t outrun most enemy units wanting to chase them down. However, the Builder Crossbowmen would really hope that their last-ditch attack thins the enemy ranks as much as possible.<br/>The Builder Crossbowmen are a perfect unit for Night&rsquo;s Watch players who want to add some ranged attack damage to their force. They should be kept well away from the enemy, but within range of their trusty crossbows. Supported by units able to take a melee hit if necessary, they can do a lot to bring victory to the Black.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The heart of the system is about bidding for and using Tempo Points: commanders must trade off speed of action against the ability to have greater control over all units.<br/>The game includes a number of scenarios from the three covered conflicts to give players a good idea of how big the various armies are and how they are organized.  It uses a variable scale, so smaller and bigger armies, battles and tables can all be accomodated.<br/><br/>",

Two to four players can choose different ways to invest, such as the property investment, building up their own business to win the best possible contracts, investing time to level up their professional knowledge in a tech tree, making investments in bonds and so on, all to build the most efficient investment portfolio.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Shifting Realms:Darkness Revealed comes with 2 additional realms bringing the number of realm combinations to 35 with 210 board layouts.<br/><br/>The two new realms in Darkness Revealed are Knossos and Gehenna.  Each realm comes with a board, structures, story cards, and task cards.  The new realms introduce new synergies, mechanisms, and components to the base game.<br/><br/>Knossos, the undiscovered land of the minotaurs, introduces Search tiles and Labyrinth walls.  Players need to search areas of the board to recover treasure before structures can be built in the realm.  Players can place Labyrinth walls to block movement and building adjacency.  Players also start the game drafting story cards which ramps up the first few turns of the game.<br/><br/>Gehenna, the dark land of the demons, offers players ways to directly interfere with the other players. Building Demon Towers enables players to capture opposing players units for victory points.  Many of the story cards in this realm enable players to move opponents&rsquo; units within the realms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Random Ground Asset and Naval Vessel tables are also included. The solo game relies on regular playing cards to generate unknown hostile aircraft and ground assets, so prepare to be surprised!<br/><br/>The Mercenary Air Campaign:<br/><br/>Manage a group of fictitious Mercenaries as you purchase aircraft and ordnance, select missions, get paid and attempt to survive! This campaign runs on the basic Missile Threat rules, and is aimed at solo play but can easily be a co-operative game. Players start with a selection of pilots and a pool of funds and must purchase aircraft and ordnance from a weapons market. They then use what they have to fly available missions and if they succeed: get paid.<br/><br/>The Mercenary air campaign is all about the &quot;rule of cool&quot; - you won't be limited to light attack aircraft, but rather any aircraft around in your chosen theater, period and faction. The campaign uses the Complete Aircraft &amp; Ordnance List provided with the Missile Threat rules, and allows you to buy and fly many of the more unusual or lesser used aircraft from the last 60 years, as well as the regulars.<br/><br/>The Mercenary air campaign has 3 difficulty options, ranging from easy mode with 4 pilots and a sh*tload of cash, to the hard mode of a lone wolf pilot with the last of his savings.<br/><br/>There are 5 different periods to choose from: 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s+<br/><br/>Each period has 5 different theaters to play in: Balkans/Eastern Europe, Central/South Africa, Middle East, South America, and South-East Asia<br/><br/>Each theater has 2 factions you can work for: Either the government or the rebels.<br/><br/>In this way there are 50 different options for playing the campaign. You could be working for the rebels in South America in the 1990s, or working for the government in the Middle East in the 1960s. Each option has a customized random aircraft and ordnance table to reflect the period, theater and alignment. That's 100 D66 tables!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If you do, then All Things Zombie &ndash; Evolution is not for you.<br/><br/>Think of all the great and not so great Zombie movies and television series. Remember how many Zombies the heroes killed? I&rsquo;m betting you don&rsquo;t, but I bet you remember how they interacted with other survivors and how they finally overcame the obstacles in their way. In short, you remember the Story.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s what All Things Zombie &ndash; Evolution is all about, the Story; your Story.<br/><br/>All Things Zombie - Evolution sweeps you up and sticks you right in the middle of a catastrophic zombie outbreak. Who you are when the outbreak occurs is just as important as where you are. Because unlike other zombie games, where the zombies have been around for a while, you won&rsquo;t be able to tell the humans from the zombies until maybe it&rsquo;s too late. Because it&rsquo;s all happening to you just like it would on Day One.<br/><br/>Confusion, chaos, and lack of information are just some of the challenges you&rsquo;ll face when the world starts to crumble. Will you have what it takes to survive the first 30 days?<br/><br/>THEN WHAT?<br/><br/>All Things Zombie - Evolution starts on the first day of the Outbreak, but then let&rsquo;s you continue your life, building your very own future. It&rsquo;s a game where every detail has been covered, as you first escape the soulless creatures that threaten you, then hunt them down and take back what&rsquo;s yours. On the way you&rsquo;ll find that your most dangerous enemies aren&rsquo;t the zombies, but are your neighbors and sometimes your old friends.<br/><br/>Play All Things Zombie - Evolution solo, cooperatively against the game, or head to head against one another.<br/><br/>Play it as a one off game or part of an ongoing campaign.<br/><br/>Play it on the Tabletop or on the Battle Boards we've included.<br/><br/>It doesn&rsquo;t matter which way you play it, as the goal of All Things Zombie - Evolution is to rebuild the world, as you knew it; except maybe this time with you in charge.<br/><br/>Inside you&rsquo;ll find:<br/><br/>Color card stock counters and two full color 8&rdquo; x 10&rdquo; Battle Boards.<br/><br/>Three classes &ndash; Survivor, Ganger, or Militia, each with different goals and opportunities.<br/><br/>Attributes, Skills, and more, that are used to define your Characters and make them unique.<br/><br/>A light-book keeping Campaign System to reward you when you do well and punish you when you don&rsquo;t.<br/><br/>A variety of Zombies, from the old school Shamblers to Smarties and Ragers.<br/><br/>Pre- generated scenarios that can be played alone or played together to build your Story.<br/><br/>A fully populated Post-Apocalyptic town for you to adventure in.<br/><br/>All this and much more.<br/><br/>And we didn&rsquo;t even mention the Werewolves, Aliens or Vampires.<br/><br/>All Things Zombie&hellip; Still THE Zombie game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Eternal City's End: The Battle for Rome, September 1943&quot; is a solitaire or two player World War II wargame, designed by Roberto Chiavini, that portrays a series of &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; based upon the historical situation following the Italian Armistice that was signed September 8th, 1943. Starting from the historical positions of the Italian and German formations, one player, as the Italian, must try to save Rome from falling into German hands before the arrival of American paratrooper reinforcements to support them in rescuing the Eternal City from Nazi occupation. This wargame can also be played with a German opponent, or from the German perspective as an alternative solitaire play wargame trying to secure the Eternal City before the arrival of the American paratroopers. Historically, the Germans declared Rome to be an &ldquo;open city&rdquo; after the surrender of their former Italian ally.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Explore the second U.S. National Park and Michigan's first State Park in search of historical and natural treasures with this set of 5 games.<br/><br/>Match Me if You Can is an Author's Cards-style card game. Choose natural treasures, historical treasures and/or locations around the Island, then collect the most cards in similar groups by asking for cards from other players or by picking up discarded cards.<br/><br/>The Nature Hike has you searching for the route that will allow you to spot the most natural treasures each turn. Pick a card, roll the die to determine how many habitats you can visit, or if you have encountered an obstacle and must discard cards. A variation adds more player interaction by inviting you to collect observations from other players.<br/><br/>The Scavenger Hunt is a cooperative game where players work together to find a pre-determined set of treasures before Winter arrives. Each turn, roll the die to move toward a revealed Scavenger Hunt destination while observing natural treasures along the way. When you get to the destination, if you can match the hiding place card of the historical treasure there, you collect the treasure. If you can't match it, another player can pick up the treasure later, or give you the card you need to collect it. You exchange natural treasure observations for more hiding place cards. You may also encounter events along the way, either obstacles, opportunities, or a change of season.<br/><br/>The Hide and Seek game tests your memory as each turn reveals the hiding place of historical treasures on the Island that you can collect...if you remember where they are. Each turn, you can add a card to your hand, play a new movement option (that lets you move around the Island faster or slower, depending on the season), play event cards on other players (to slow them down), move to new locations while observing natural treasures (which add points to your score), and hunt for historical treasures (by flipping over a hidden location card around the board - if you are at the location on the card, you keep the treasure and score). Whoever finds the most treasures usually wins.<br/><br/>The Treasure Hunt has you playing the sleuth, asking questions of the other players in order to discover the treasures they have hidden around the Island. Using the same movement and event rules as The Hide and Seek game, this game gives players many opportunities to score points: Visit locations on cards in your hand to score and gain special abilities useful in the hunt. Play historical treasures from your hand to score and help everyone know which treasures are not hidden. Ask yes or no questions of the other players to determine the location and the treasure they have hidden on the Island. Guess the treasure and location correctly to score big, or lose a little if you're wrong.<br/><br/>Choose the experience you want based on the available players (2 to 8 people can play), the amount of time you have, or how much you want to think. While some of the games share common rules and themes (for example, each game features some sort of nature observation), each is a separate game. Cards have information about the Island you can read as you play, though knowledge about the Island is not required to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For example, the actions fly, sail or collect sample can be blocked, a biohazard is ignored or a treat action is done in that region.<br/><br/>At the begin of each turn, the current player rolls their blue die. That die allows to do a special move to a region where the green die has the same symbol in that turn once.<br/><br/>The four action cards have special effects which cost a number of dice from the CDC.<br/><br/>Zone Pass lets a player bypass the blocks from the green dice, Incubator allows to put removed infection dice back into the bag, Subsidy enables additional treat actions and Quarantine makes it possible to ignore biohazard symbols.<br/><br/>After each epidemic, the green dice are rerolled.<br/><br/>",

Extremely cumbersome to move, and poorly armored, the Stone Thrower more than makes up for it in offensive power. The Thrower has no upper limit to its range, lobbing boulders over troops and terrain to land where needed.<br/><br/>The Builders are one of the traditional institutions of the Night&rsquo;s Watch. Due to the nature of their institution, these Brothers are adept at repairing buildings as well as constructing siege engines. The Builder Stone Thrower is one of these contraptions, used to guard the Wall from Wildlings and other threats. This expensive piece of equipment is a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield and opponents will be foolish if they don&rsquo;t react to their presence on the table.<br/><br/>Tactical Points<br/>This is a very rules-intensive Unit, take some time to read through it carefully. Some exceptional rules they have are:<br/>They never roll Panic Tests. -They never gain Condition Tokens.<br/>They may only attack once per round, so taking the Combat Zone on the Tactics Board is rarely useful.<br/>Use the Stone Thrower&rsquo;s range to your advantage and force your enemy to take an offensive position.<br/><br/>Be careful! If an enemy unit is within Long Range of your Stone Thrower Unit, they are not eligible to being hit by your boulders.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>2 Builder Stone Thrower Miniatures on Large Solo Tray<br/>2 Unit Cards<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(In a two-player game, you use only five of each color.) When you're the active player, you take 4-7 cubes from the supply (based on the number of players) and show which cubes you've taken to the guesser, who then hides their eyes. You distribute the cubes as you wish between the two cups, with some cubes (including possibly none!) being hidden underneath each cup and at least one cube on top of a cup. The guesser then opens their eyes, sees (some of) what's being offered, then chooses one of the cups, either right or left, keeping everything on and underneath that cup, while you keep the cubes from the other cup.<br/><br/>After two complete rounds in which each player has been the active player twice, you tally your score based on what you've collected. Some colors increase in value for each one you've collected, but then zero out if you've collected too many; other colors score little to nothing until you've collected a bunch of them. Who will end up with the highest scoring collection?<br/><br/>",

Once it climbs up to the surface, it flies across the night sky terrorizing citizens with its deadly gaze.<br/><br/>The Lindwurm is a snake-like scavenger feasting on fresh graves. Its scales make the beast nearly invincible, while the poisonous bite keeps would-be monster hunters at bay.<br/><br/>This set contains two highly detailed, ready to play miniatures, along with all the character and item cards necessary to use them in the game, plus two game scenarios.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>&bull;&nbsp;2 Highly detailed plastic miniatures<br/>&bull;&nbsp;6 Character cards<br/>&bull;&nbsp;5 Item cards<br/>&bull;&nbsp;1 Rulesheet (two new scenarios included)<br/><br/>",

Pull back on the spring-loaded lever and release to fire the plunger into the back of the ball - sending it towards home plate.<br/>     With your left-hand, pull on the Batter's Line to raise and lower his arms and the bat. With your right-hand, pull back on the home plate lever to rotate your Batter's hips and swing through the ball.<br/><br/><br/>How to score:<br/><br/>     If you hit the ball to a Catcher, Fielder, or Pitcher before it hits the ground - you're out!<br/>     If you ground hit the ball to a Catcher, Fielder, or Pitcher - you hit a single. (StrikeZone uses ghost runners to run the bases).<br/>     If you ground hit a ball past everyone - you hit a double or a triple based on where it rolled off the edge of the field (as marked by a 2 or a 3 on the field).<br/>     If you hit a fair ball in the air past everyone and above The Blue Monster - you hit a homer!<br/>     For an extra fun rule twist, we recommend giving human players (whoever's pitching or on defense) the ability to catch a ball in mid-air. Catch the ball before it hits the ground or the basement wall and save a run!<br/>     Strikes, balls, foul balls, outs and hitting the Batter with a pitch all follow traditional baseball scoring rules.<br/><br/><br/>How does a player win:<br/>Just like in Baseball, a player to score most in thier innings is a winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are two ways of playing it - an easier and a more advanced mode.<br/><br/>The game has a spinner and tiles with characters. The characters are represented on the tiles multiple times in different environments and poses. The goal of the game is to find and get as many tiles as possible.<br/><br/>In the basic game mode, children first mark the back of the tiles. They can draw their unique markings, shapes and doodles that will help them remember what is on the other side. The tiles are then placed face-down. In the second part of the game they spin the spinner and find the character that the arrow points to among the face-down tiles. The player with the most tiles at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>In the advanced game mode, extra tiles are added, with only some tiles marked, and additional rules apply that make the game even more challenging.<br/><br/>The rules include additional variants for a single player and cooperative gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At its core, Pineapple is an intense truth or lie game in which you present your fellow players with extremely deep prompts. Some will be lying, and it is your job to find the liars. Don't be afraid to get serious or awkward or weird with your prompts as the goal is to learn more about people you've known for a long time &mdash; or those you've just met.<br/><br/>One person is the Prompter each round, while the rest are Responders. Pass out one card to each Responder face down. If you're a Responder, you look at this card secretly, and if it's a &quot;Truth&quot; card, you must tell the truth, and if it's a &quot;Lie&quot; card, you must tell a lie. All lies must be complete lies, and all truths complete truths. However, there is one exception: The Hybrid. If you receive this card, you must tell a true story that occurred in a fictional universe and try to pass it off as your own.<br/><br/>Once all the Responders have checked out their card, the Prompter provides a prompt, whether using the included Prompt cards as inspiration or reading a question directly off one. Each Responder now responds. As a Responder, if you do not feel comfortable answering a question, you may tap the X card in the middle of the table. This signifies to the table you are out this round. Keep your card face down.<br/><br/>After each Responder responds, the Promoter can ask two Responders one follow-up question, after which the Prompter must now locate the liars and the hybrid.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionEmulsion is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (squares) of a square board of any size. At the start of the game, all squares of the board are covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the center square is occupied by White.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA piece's value is the number of pieces of its color orthogonally adjacent to it plus half the number of board edges adjacent to it.<br/><br/>A group is a piece along with all other like-colored pieces one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent pieces of its color.<br/><br/>The size of a group is the number of pieces in it.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, swap the positions of two orthogonally or diagonally adjacent pieces of different colors so that the value of your piece in the pair is increased.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more moves available. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. On even-sized boards, if the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsFree Emulsion: The board is initially empty. A piece's value is the same as in the standard game plus half the number of empty squares orthogonally adjacent to that piece. On your turn, instead of making a swap, you may place one piece of each color on orthogonally adjacent empty squares.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesA swap always increases the value of both pieces in the pair by the same amount. Therefore, a legal swap for one player is always a legal swap for the other player as well.<br/><br/>Emulsion was inspired by Michał Zapała's Slyde.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ElevatorUp is the brand NEW kid-created, kid-designed, kid-marketed, and kid-shipped (yes, they're all me) card game! Elevator Up will keep you smiling through Ups, Downs, and even getting Stuck!<br/><br/>ElevatorUp is fast-paced, easy-to-learn, and never gets old. Uno, GoFish, and other classic card games begin to become monotonous. Luckily, ElevatorUp provides a much needed innovation.<br/><br/>It is perfect for Travel, Camp, Sleepovers, Parties, Game-Nights, and any other occasion for a card game.<br/><br/>THEME:<br/>An elevator going Up, Down, and sometimes Stuck in a building!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY:<br/>Object - Be the first one out of cards.<br/><br/>Setup - Give each player 3 cards face down on the table (no one is allowed to look at these), 2 cards face up on the table (everyone can see these), and 3 cards for their hand (only that player can look at those).<br/><br/>Gameplay -  There are three sections of the game: Beginning: Hand Cards, Middle: Face Up Cards, End: Face Down Cards.<br/>When it is your turn, you must discard a card that is either an equal/higher floor than the previously played card or a special card. If there is no previously played card, then you can play any card. Continue taking turns and discarding cards until someone does not have a special card or an equal/higher floor, meaning they must pick up the entire discard pile and add it to their hand. Players must keep at least 3 cards in their hand at all times, replenishing from the remainder of the deck. The special cards, including New Building, Stuck, Penthouse, Door Closed, and Down to the Lobby, throw exciting twists and turns.<br/>Once the deck has been completely used up and players finish playing the cards in their hand, they move onto the face up cards, leaving them for all to see. The rules are the same for this section, but their hand can be seen by other players. Once they've gotten rid of their face up cards, it is time to play their face down cards. When it is their turn, the player will flip a card onto the discard pile. If it is an equal/higher floor or a special card, then shout &quot;YAY&quot; or any other celebratory exclamation. If it does not, then put on your game face and pick up the entire discard pile, adding it to your hand. The first player out of cards WINS!<br/><br/>description from publisher<br/><br/>",

They&rsquo;ll help you tilt the game in your favor&mdash;from blocking Traps to giving you special perks that last all game.<br/><br/>MONEY PITS: These Traps are all about the money. When an opponent lands on one, they pay you. When you land on one, the bank pays you.

You&rsquo;ve just got to be lucky enough to draw one.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of rolling and moving, drawing cards (see above), and playing those cards with devastating effect.<br/><br/>These cards reshape the jungle with each playthrough so that no two games are ever the same.<br/><br/>Beyond cards, one of the primary game mechanics is character abilities. These let you perform unique actions such as stealing a ton of extra cash from your foes to dodging a Trap at the last minute.<br/><br/>There are 8 characters (4 humans and 4 animals). Each team is made up of a randomly paired human and animal duo. Since every character has their own ability, you never know what combo (and strategy) you&rsquo;ll end up with.<br/><br/>Along the way you&rsquo;ll encounter spaces that protect you, beef up your wallet, or poison you, severely setting your progress back.<br/><br/>Nothing is truly as it seems in this jungle.

Having determined that the Spanish government did not hold the confidence of its people, and realizing, due to lack of both will and ability, it would never fulfill its responsibilities of allegiance to France, Napoleon determined plans must be made. Upon discovering agents of the Spanish throne discussed Spain&rsquo;s potential role against France with her enemies, the Emperor decided such plans must be acted upon.<br/> The seemingly never ending pursuit actions across the Iberian landscape of Spain and Portugal provided a stream of empty victories to the French, until finally, the British Expeditionary Force is expelled from the continent at La Coru&ntilde;a.<br/> To Assure My Dynasty, 1808 in Iberia presents Phase One: The Spanish Uprising in four scenarios, pitting Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperial Army against the Royal Army of Spain, and the British Expeditionary Force and its Portuguese supporters.

        "description": "The RAF R.E.8, introduced in early 1917, was the long&ndash;awaited replacement for the Be2 series of recon airplanes, offering greater speed and strength. Initial reactions were mixed, as the R.E.8 required more pilot attention than the Be2 and early accidents of spinning and stalls resulted. Once overcome, the airplane became the standard for British observation and light bombing, serving through the end of the war. It was nicknamed &ldquo;Harry Tate,&rdquo; after a cockney comedian, who pronounced his name &ldquo;AIR&ndash;EE.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A Warband represents your own band of warriors &ndash; courageous humans, blood-thirsty monsters, legendary heroes, and mythological entities from the depths of the darkest myths.<br/><br/>Mythic Americas: Warlords of Erehwon provides a new multi-level, scenario-driven approach to your games. This approach offers plenty of opportunities to reward tactical play, but at the same time keeps things manageable in terms of the size of forces and space required. The game still uses ten-sided and Order dice, making for a game with mechanical depth and considerable adaptability. The Order dice test system, at the mechanical core of Mythic Americas, and an extremely balanced rules set offers Warband leaders great tactical freedom, but the game still offers lots of opportunity for fate and chance to have a say in the outcome of your battles. But, every experienced general throughout the ages knows that fate and chance will test even the most ingenious battle plan!<br/><br/>This is The Way.<br/><br/>The rulebook contains all the rules you need to get playing, a wealth of scenarios and four full army lists for the Tribal Nations, The Aztecs, The Mayans, and The Incas. It also includes background with tactical tips and painting tips for each of the four warbands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Village War: The Calamity is a card-drafting, resource management, and spirit war game. The theme and narration is a combination of the history, folklore, myths and our fantasy of the Igbo tribe in Nigeria, Africa.<br/><br/>During game set-up, players each take their own village (including 10 different warriors, 11 resources which are selected randomly, 3 artifacts, and their wall). Warriors are different, and some of them possess unique powers to form combos during the war! And the artifacts are gifts from the gods with fierce powers. As players, you also have the chance to buy new artifacts during gameplay. Your aim is to win the battle and earn more resources as tributes paid from other players. The player with the most VPs &mdash; a sum of tributes collected and warrior power rank &mdash; wins.<br/><br/>Village War: The Calamity is the first of a five-game series that exposes the Igbo culture more than any other game in history. The game story (12 pages) narrates the inspirations behind the artwork and the story, and the game features masquerades, Priest(ess), and other creatures with Igbo origin in mind. The pulisher also had a live studio record for the game to create the right melody creating a 65-minutes &quot;Igbo War music&quot; instrumental for that extra experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a famed mercenary seeking to establish your medieval empire, the prophecy has been commoner's talk for a while now: &ldquo;Of dragon scales gather up 10, and so become the ruler of men!&rdquo; But your arrival in the desolate lands has presented two hardships. Firstly, dragons don&rsquo;t give up their scales willingly. And second, you&rsquo;re not the only one who&rsquo;s heard the prophecy.<br/><br/>Game play begins with card drafting as players create a unique hand to battle dragons and each other. Play continues in a series of rounds until 1 player wins by ending a round with 10 dragon scales or being the only player with at least 1 health token remaining.<br/><br/>Dragon scales are gained by contributing strength to defeat a dragon, looting from the dragon, or stealing from other players (if you kill another player you gain all of their dragon scales).<br/><br/>Each round has 3 phases.<br/>Phase 1: (every round)<br/>Players simultaneously play cards from their hand face-down. All cards are then revealed and resolved in a predetermined hierarchy (cards of the same hierarchy resolve clockwise from the dragon). <br/>Phase 2: (triggered only by specific phase 1 cards)<br/>A repeat of phase 1, however only players who have used specific cards during phase 1 can participate.<br/>Phase 3: (every round)<br/>Dragon combat and loot distribution. Players combine their strength in an attempt to defeat the dragon. The dragon player draws the top 3 cards from the dragon deck selecting one to play against all other players. The dragon card increases or decreases the dragon's base strength, often adding targeted abilities*. If the dragon is defeated, all contributing players take dragon scales. If undefeated, all players take 1 damage from the dragon. Looters acquire loot (dragon scales or items) from the dragon irrespective of the outcome.<br/><br/>All non-core cards are discarded before and he role of dragon then shifts one player to the left (their mercenary becomes untargetable for the following round). A new round will then begin, rounds continue in this manner until a winner is determined.<br/><br/><br/>    In a round with 2 or 3 players, the dragon becomes automated. In this case the top card of the dragon deck is chosen and targeted abilities affect all players.<br/><br/><br/>Unique game elements include a mix of card-drafting, simultaneous-play, semi-cooperative and competitive tactics, and playing as both the dragon and dragon attacker (in different rounds).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

One Type IX, U-107, made the most successful convoy mission of the war, with nearly 100,000 tons of shipping sunk out of Freetown in Africa. The latest variants of this design were capable of ranges of more than 23,000 miles, allowing them to rove far in search of convoys, while their heavy load of torpedoes allowed them to keep pace with a convoy, attacking night after night.<br/><br/>MTBs: The R1-class of R-Boat (from the German R&auml;umboot, meaning minesweeper) was intended to be used as a shallow water minesweeper but, as the war went on, it became a multi-role craft. Its duties expanded to include patrol, antisubmarine, convoy escort, minelaying, and rescue operations. Some classes of R-Boat, such as the R310, were fitted with torpedo tubes, though performance was very modest compared to craft specifically designed for the role.<br/><br/>The ultimate S-Boat to be operational in significant numbers was the S-100-class, which was produced from 1943 and was said to be the best fast patrol boat of its time. The S-100-class was nicknamed the Calotte, as it featured a rounded armoured bridge. It was powered by three Daimler-Benz engines giving it an overall capacity of around 7,500 hp and developing an outstanding top speed of 48 knots.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>3 Type IX U-Boats<br/>2 S-100 S-Boat Sections<br/>2 R-Boat Sections<br/>Ship Cards<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, white partisans are placed on the a4, g1, d10 and j7 squares, and black partisans are placed on a7, g10, d1 and j4. Additionally, each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color outside the board.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayWhite plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, move a partisan of your color to an empty square in a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, without jumping over enemy pieces.<br/><br/>Then, place a stone on an empty square that is a straight orthogonal or diagonal line away from the square onto which the partisan was moved, with no enemy pieces in between along that line. This is called shooting.<br/><br/>Note that partisans can move and shoot over friendly partisans and stones as well as over empty squares.<br/><br/>To compensate for the advantage of moving first, White is not allowed to shoot on their first turn, but they must still move a partisan.<br/><br/>If you have no moves available on your turn, you lose.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesPartisans is based on Amazons, a game designed by Walter Zamkauskas in 1992.<br/><br/>",

In the distant past, a cabal of city elders sought to save their lives by making a pact with a demon prince...and now the Red King has come to collect what he is owed, claiming Frostgrave as his own. Many have already fled before the Red King's demonic hordes, while others seek to weather the storm, turning their bases into makeshift fortresses. The wizards of Frostgrave must choose: Do they stand and fight, or do they abandon this great repository of mystical knowledge to the ravages of unearthly fire?<br/><br/>Frostgrave: The Red King is the first supplement designed for Frostgrave: Second Edition. In this sprawling, epic campaign, wizards will be pushed to their limits, fighting not only against one another and the perils of the Frozen City, but also against an invading army. As the Red King's power grows, the laws of magic and nature will start to bend. Can the wizards put aside their differences long enough to oppose this common foe, or will greed and mistrust doom them all?<br/><br/>",

The judge rank the sculptures on the table and the players will move accordingly. 1st place moves forward 3 spaces, 2nd place moves two spaces, 3rd place moves 3 spaces, and the rest don&rsquo;t move at all.<br/><br/>Along the way you will encounter rule squares, penalty squares and star squares, if you land on one of them, pick up a card with the corresponding symbol. Penalty squares make you sculpt with one hand or move back a space, stuff like that. Star squares typically give players the best card in the game, a Clay Crusher card. This means at the end of any future round the player can use their Clay Crusher card to smash another player's creation before the judge sees it.

        "description": "Pirates of the Dread Sea is a fast paced, fun tabletop skirmish game for two or more players. In Pirates of the Dread Sea you create a crew of pirates from various fantasy races (or just use the pre-designed crews) such as Orcs, Dwarves, the Undead or Humans and fight for treasure and survival. Although PODS can be enjoyed as a single game, and can easily be taught to new players for an evenings entertainment, it can also support long campaigns, during which players can personalise and upgrade their crews.<br/><br/>Games of PODS are based on a Scenario. Scenario&rsquo;s usually involve finding treasure, though sometimes they may involve capturing or rescuing hostages, or simply fighting. Each player controls a small Crew of miniatures (around half a dozen) and players take it in turns to act with one miniature at a time. During a miniatures &ldquo;phase&rdquo; they can perform two Actions (Captain&rsquo;s can perform three) such as moving, shooting and fighting hand to hand.<br/><br/>In addition to a huge variety of weapons, skills and traits which can be applied to characters dependent on their race and experience, Event Cards add another level of tactics to the game. An Event Card can throw your opponent entirely off track, or boost your own forces, whether that be by ensuing the enemy miss a shot, or by boosting your crews morale by singing a shanty to them!<br/><br/>Pirates of the Dread Sea is a PIRATE war game, not just a war game with a pirate theme tacked on. Everything about the game has been designed to fit the setting, and create fun, narrative, exciting adventures on your tabletop.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They outfit their troops in heavy armor at every level and arm them with the House&rsquo;s signature warhammer. While this heavy kit does slow down troop movements, the tenacity of their defenses can usually see them through. The Baratheon Wardens are the main infantry unit that the House uses, fielding many ranks of these rough and rugged fighters.<br/><br/>The Baratheon Wardens unit box for the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives House Baratheon commanders a tough, resilient set of troops for their forces. Clad in plate mail and carrying heavy shields, they have a good Defense Save stat, though all of that does slow them down. Their heavy warhammer attacks can crush the enemy&rsquo;s spirit as much as it can crush their bones. Defending against these pounding attacks can leave enemy troops gasping for air as the strength is sucked from them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It was first necessary to retake New Guinea and at least neutralize the Japanese fortified base at Rabaul. Taking the island of Los Negros and its airbase at Momote would cut off Rabaul&rsquo;s ability to received supplies from Japan or elsewhere, and allow the US-led forces to advance for an offensive to retake the Philippines. US Intelligence thought the island was only held by a small Japanese garrison made up mostly of ground crewmen and laborers. Instead, the island was held by a Japanese army garrison composed of many veteran troops whose numbers nearly exceeded those of the US force tasked with taking the island. What ensued was a protracted and violent fight. Perhaps you can do as well or better?<br/><br/>Each copy of Black Hell is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch map sheets<br/>&bull;    110 double-sided un-mounted counters<br/>&bull;    7 pages of charts and tables<br/>&bull;    9 pages of rules<br/><br/>Players will also need a standard deck of cards and one D6, one ten sided die (D10, treat a die roll of 0 as ten and not zero), to play the game.

        "description": "Enter into the world of Psychic Warfare.  To survive on this battlefield, you will need to see the future, read your opponent's mind while obscuring your own thoughts, move in for the kill when they least expect it, and, most importantly, survive by any means necessary.<br/><br/>ESPC is a fast-paced game where you try to be the last player standing.  A round should take about 5 minutes or less.  The last player left alive gets a victory point.  Cards in the game represent Psychic Powers. Each turn a player draws a card and declares what power they are going to use.  At this point, any player may challenge the use of this power.  If the player claiming to play the power doesn't have that card in hand, they are out for the round, but if the player has the card, the challenger is out.  At this point, the player uses their power card and discards face up.  This continues until only one player is left, and points are awarded.  Then the deck is reshuffled and the next round begins.  The game is played until one player reaches the target number of victory points to win.<br/><br/>Each time the game is played, only a subset of powers are used. The number of powers in a game is based on the number of players, and there are rules governing how powers are selected.  This leads to a unique experience each time the game is played. For a 4 player game there are 4,000+ different power combinations.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",
