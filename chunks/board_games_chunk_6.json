        "description": "The B&ouml;hnke couple needs your help!<br/><br/>A body washes up at the bathing spot in the suburb of &quot;Westerfelde&quot;. The police quickly take a suspect into custody and try to solve the murder case for a long time - in vain. In order to exonerate her arrested husband, the suspect's wife hires you to solve the case. Will you succeed in connecting the complicated events in Westerfelde and keeping a clear mind?<br/><br/>One thing is clear: this calls for true pros. To find the murderer, you will need to examine all the documents carefully, study the fingerprints, check the alibis and do some research. A real detective will follow any scent to uncover the mystery. Can you think creatively enough? No limits are imposed on your creativity during your investigations.<br/><br/>As a team, you will need to analyse letters, interpret the police interviews of various suspects, make telephone calls and even do some research on the Internet. Your approach to finding a solution is guaranteed to be multidimensional. Study the fingerprints, collect all the information on your large poster, discuss the alibis and motives. For your research during the investigation, you will need internet access and a phone with which you can receive text messages. It is also helpful (but not absolutely necessary) if you have a laptop or tablet at hand. Mobile phones are also allowed!<br/><br/>You should allow approx. 1.5-3 hours for the murder mystery game. However, you can also put it aside one evening and continue the next day.<br/>You will all work together in a team, rather than playing against one another. The game is suitable for people aged 14 and over. It is too complex for a group of younger children. In a family, however, younger children can also make a contribution and assist with the detective work.<br/><br/>Languages<br/>This game is available in:<br/>German: Gr&uuml;nes Gift<br/>British: Green Poison<br/>French: La mort en vert (coming soon)<br/>Italian: Veleno verde (coming soon)<br/>Spain: Una soluci&oacute;n venenosa (coming soon)<br/><br/>",

You must use Fuel Cells (the cards) to refuel your time machine or stop other players from refueling theirs first.<br/><br/>To escape the rupture, you must reach a Fuel Cell Charge of 21 or more on your Installed Fuel Cells at the end of your turn. Whoever does so first closes the rupture, leaving the other travelers lost outside time.<br/><br/>During your turn, you choose to either draw a card, install a Fuel Cell in your area of play, burn a Fuel Cell to the discard pile, or defuse an opponent's Fuel Cell. The Fuel Cell Charge on cards ranges from 1&ndash;10 and different abilities on Fuel cells make for changing strategies and multiple lines of play.<br/><br/>",

With gameplay inspired by GMT&rsquo;s COIN system, players will take on the asymmetric roles of the Delhi Sultanate, the Bahmani Kingdom, and the Vijayanagara Empire, navigating event cards and unique action menus as they contest to write themselves into medieval Indian history. Players will rally local amirs and rajas to their cause, construct epic temples, forts, and qasbahs, and battle for supremacy over the Deccan Plateau.<br/><br/>Highlights<br/>1. A sweeping, century-long narrative and numerous epic events.<br/>2. Playtime ~90 minutes.<br/>3. Three asymmetric Factions with different strengths and abilities.<br/>4. A fourth non-player Faction (Mongols) operated by the Bahmani and Vijayanagara players.<br/>5. A new battle-resolution system with strength-dependent risk mitigation.<br/><br/>Vijayanagara is intended for players new to asymmetric wargames and veteran COIN players alike. The factions have distinct capabilities and each is faced with different strategic decisions, offering a very high degree of replayability. The game is streamlined: all player actions and most rules are visible on the table on player aids and cards.<br/><br/>Gameplay and turn order is organized around a deck of unique event cards. With each new card, factions have the option to carry out the event or to select from faction-specific Commands and special Decrees; Commands such as the Conscription of new troops, Governing in Tributary Provinces, and Migration to begin life anew, and Decrees ranging from Demanding Tribute, Conspiring with Delhi&rsquo;s Governors to betray the Sultan, and forming new Alliances with minor regional powers.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

After trying to raise funds by any means at the &quot;All Rivers&quot; Poker tournament, the Padre recruits a band of gunslingers for the task and, once complete, travels back to the village over the precipitous Los Quantos bridge &ndash; all the while harassed by a detachment of the General's men. There they fortify Malpaso itself, and usher the frightened villagers into the abandoned silver mine for protection.<br/><br/>When the bandits finally attack, both sides are prepared. Mapache's men unleashing their Gatling gun to devastating effect, while the villagers have a few tricks of their own. Both sides will suffer many casualties in the calamitous battle, but will the Mexican Army arrive in time to put an end to the bloodshed?<br/><br/>Revolver 2: Last Stand at Malpaso is a two-player card game set in the Old West, in which one player takes the role of General Mapache and his band of thieving outlaws, and the other player controls the villagers and guardians hired to protect the town of Malpaso, led by the infamous Padre Esteban. Each player has a unique deck of cards with unique possibilities as well as different winning conditions, which requires different tactics and different methods of play.<br/><br/>More than just new locations, Revolver 2 features brand new gameplay elements in players can use a mine cart-mounted Gatling gun, blow up a bridge, assemble their own team of gunfighters, and dynamite mine tunnels. The game also includes a terrific Stud Poker mini-game which determines in which town the initial firefights occur.<br/><br/>Like the original Revolver, the game remains elegantly simple and can be learned in five minutes. That said, Revolver 2 is a standalone game and the cards from Revolver and its expansions (red packaging) are not interchangable with Revolver 2 and its expansions (green packaging).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Why First? is a racing game in which players vie to be second in order to win.<br/><br/>The game lasts five races, with each race lasting five turns. At the start of each race, players receive a hand of five cards, with each card bearing a value from -4 to +5. The players' pawns start each race on 0 of the racing track. Each turn, players choose a card from their hands and choose which pawn to move with this card, then reveal them simultaneously and move the selected pawns forward or backward based on the cards they played.<br/><br/>After five turns, the race ends and the player in second place on the racing track wins, scoring a number of points equal to his position on the race track. All other players score nothing. (If the winner is in the negative portion of the racing track, he loses points instead.) After five races, sum all of the points scored; the player with the second highest total who has won at least one race wins.<br/><br/>This revised version of Why First? has new rules, including simultaneous actions by players that cuts down the playing time from the original release.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dark Summer: Normandy 1944 is the latest in Ted S. Raicer's WWII operational series that began with The Dark Valley: The East Front Campaign 1941-45. The game uses a chit-pull activation system that determines both the order and type of each sides' actions during the game's ten action-packed turns, covering June 6 to August 21, 1944. The availability of Action Round chits (for the Germans, and separately for the British and US forces) is itself determined by the draw of Weather chits, one per turn, which reflect the importance of weather on the effectiveness of Allied air superiority and Allied shipping across the Channel. Weather also determines the number of German Reaction markers, which allow limited response to Allied actions. The &quot;Dark&quot; chit pull system makes The Dark Summer an excellent game for solo play, while keeping both players involved in face-to-face play.<br/><br/>The single map extends from just south of Cherbourg (itself covered by a Cherbourg Box) southwest to Avranches and southeast to Alencon, allowing players to recreate the entire campaign from D-Day to the closing of the Falaise gap in late August. Units are mostly regiment/brigades, with a few battalions, but German mechanized forces are presented as operational kampfgruppen.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by the Allies capturing Cherbourg, exiting units to Brittany and Paris, and preventing the exiting of German units, but the Allies win a sudden death victory if they capture all the cities on the map before Turn 10 and the Germans win a sudden death victory by closing down any three Allied Beaches, two of which must be contiguous. The unknown activation sequence means the Allies cannot take the safety of his landing beaches for granted in June!<br/><br/>The Dark Summer: Normandy 1944 is a game of moderate complexity, but nevertheless covers all the most important elements of the campaign. There are rules for the D-Day Landings, untried German strong-points and Ost battalions, Allied tac-air and carpet bombing, Allied artillery superiority, German nebelwerfer and flak guns, Allied naval support, the conquest of Cherbourg, exiting and re-entering the map, and variable entry and possible delay of both side's reinforcements. A game on an epic campaign that is playable in a single day's gaming and with a small footprint that will allow it to be left set-up for solo study, The Dark Summer: Normandy 1944 is a must-have for fans of WWII operational games, the &quot;Dark&quot; system, or students of the campaign for northwest Europe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Part of Ben Hull's award-winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles series.<br/><br/>The fourth installment in this series is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the career of one of the Great Captains of History, King Gustav II Adolf the Great of Sweden. In his brief career, he catapulted Sweden to the forefront of European power politics. This volume sets it focus on the rise and climax of Gustav Adolf's military system.<br/><br/>The series began with the English Civil War in This Accursed Civil War, then covered the Swedish army after Gustav Adolf in Sweden Fights On, then looked at the rise of the French in the Thirty Years War in Under the Lily Banners. In this volume the Swedish face the tough Polish cavalry, lance equipped winged Husars and Cossacks. The Swedish-style brigades also take on the unbeaten Tilly at the head of the allied Catholic League and Imperial armies. Finally, Wallenstein, with a resurgent Imperial army, mastered the art of drawing out the Swedes to attack on ground of his choosing.<br/><br/>In each battle included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms, armies are divided into several wings. Each has a commander and an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the player who can coordinate the actions of his wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry battalions or brigades, cavalry regiments and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, Cavalry Pistols for skirmishing or for close combat, and artillery grazing fire. Play is highly interactive and most battles can be played through in one sitting. The battles included in Gustav Adolf the Great: With God and Victorious Arms are:<br/><br/>Dirschau 1627 - The Prussian campaign that started in 1626, Gustav Adolf had finally brought the Poles to the field and defeated them in battle at Gniew a month before, skillfully using terrain to offset the powerful Polish Hussars. Again the King faced the Polish General Koniecpolski and sought to the same again.<br/><br/>Breitenfeld 1631 - The most famous battle of the Thirty Years War<br/><br/>Alte Veste 1632 - The late summer saw the Swedish besieged by Wallenstein at N&uuml;rnberg.<br/><br/>L&uuml;tzen 1632 - Southeast of Leipzig the Swedes caught up to the Imperial main body. Wallenstein's army had detached two corps and was serious danger. He fortified a position at L&uuml;tzen. King Gustav Adolf's final battle.<br/><br/>Honigfelde / Trzciano 1629 - &quot;I've never had a hotter bath!&quot; exclaimed Gustav II Adolf upon his return. Very nearly captured while trying to extricate his army from a Polish and Imperial trap, this great cavalry battle showed the Poles were to be treated with respect. Rheingraf Otto Ludwig's German cavalry attacked the advancing Poles and was drawn into a pincer. Gustav Adolf rushed forward to save the impetuous Rheingraf. Koniecpolski showed his cunning. The Imperial contingent joined the fray and sent the Swedes falling back. The Imperial commander, von Arnim, would take the field with Gustav Adolf at Breitenfeld two years later.<br/><br/>Components: <br/>3 Full-color countersheets<br/>Two 22&quot;x34&quot; back-printed maps <br/>Rulebook <br/>Scenario/Playbook<br/>2 11x17&quot; Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>",

Carthage concentrates on Punic events that take place in Carthage/Africa as well as Sicily, with the main scenario being the massive First Punic War. Building on the popular mechanics and systems of Rise of the Roman Republic (Vol I), Carthage includes the full, advances naval system, with galley battles, fleet building expanding ports, and everything featured in the unusual, truly naval war that was the First Punic War. In addition, the detailed political systems for both powers, the soul of the game and a set of mechanics that truly puts the players in the heart of ongoing events, are expanded and clarified. With the addition of rules for the Reduction and Repair of city defenses, militia, and the ability of garrisons to Sally, sieges are now more than just sideshows.<br/><br/>Carthage still uses The Ancient World's unique combat system, with its unusual Unpredictable Results, elephants, cavalry pursuit, and the dangers of fighting too many battles. Carthage's main scenario is, of course, the First Punic War, a twenty year affair that will take some time to play, but keep you entranced for years. The game also includes quick, one evening scenarios, including the playtester two-turn favorite Hiero; Hero or Gyro?, the twisty opening year of the First Punic War. We also have short scenarios for the first invasion of Carthage by Agathocles of Syracuse (311 BC) and the infamous Mercenary War that erupted in Carthage right after the First Punic War (241 BC).<br/><br/>Carthage contains one full-sized map - the slightly redone Italy map (we've expanded rivers to a three-tiered system and corrected some tangential map errata) - plus a half-map for Carthage and Africa. The 1000+ full-color counters include every Roman magistrate of the era plus lots of Libyans, Numidians, Egyptians, Iberians, Celts ... if they were there, they're in this game. Also, part of the game package is a expanded group of play-aid charts, prompted by playtester insistence, to help keep track of the many details that campaigning can require.<br/>Carthage is the Punic War's game that ancients and gaming aficionados have been waiting for since the beginning of the wargame hobby.

The only problem is that your opponents are doing the very same thing! Each gallery must be organized properly by exhibit number, but to succeed you must balance your passion for order with the need for public acclaim. Impress visitors by tastefully positioning works of art side-by-side showing similar themes. Make sure you don't get too greedy for applause, though &mdash; doing so might disorganize your collection and keep you from displaying any more paintings. The first player to complete each separate gallery will open the exhibition early and receive extra recognition.

        "description": "There's still much left to do in order to become the world's largest and most diverse amusement park! Your family (one of four) has a small, but steady income that should suffice to hire a few showmen to bring life to the oh-so-empty park site. As you earn more, you can afford a favor or two: the police officer is kinder to you, you can hire a migrant worker to do extra work, and you can even finagle the attention of a promoter or a journalist!<br/><br/>The families will need to co-operate from time to time; after all, those grand attractions don't build themselves. In the end, the grand attractions are what will impress the crowds and bring about euphoric headlines in the newspapers!<br/><br/>To set up Coney Island, each player takes two money tiles, a random building material and a player board, covering most of the spaces on that board with showmen tiles. At the start of each turn, a player receives income. At the beginning of the game a player's income is one VP, one money and one randomly drawn building material; as the game progresses, the player can remove showmen tiles to uncover VP, money and material spaces, thereby boosting his income. A player can never have more than five money tiles and five materials.<br/><br/>A player then takes one to three main actions and up to five special actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a building site tile. Pay the cost of the space you cover and receive the reward shown there (VPs, materials, an additional action)<br/>    Place a showmen tile. Pay the cost in building materials shown on your player board, then place this tile on an empty space on a building site. This boosts your income (by uncovering a space) and gives you and others potential places to build.<br/>    Place a grand attraction tile. These tiles cost 2-5 materials to build and cover 1-4 spaces, each of which must have a showman tile on it. Players receive points for their showmen used or attraction placed, then the showmen are returned to the appropriate player boards.<br/><br/><br/>By spending two money, a player can acquire one of five character tiles (either from the supply or another player); each character provides a special action that the player can use each turn, such as spending money or VPs for material or buying newspaper tiles (which are worth points and can be spent for an additional action).<br/><br/>Each main action may be executed at most once per turn unless extra actions are used from newspapers or from bonuses earned by placing certain building site tiles.<br/><br/>After one player reaches 60 VP, and each player has had the same number of turns, the game ends, with players scoring their newspaper tiles and losing points for each showman on their player boards. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The central banks have unlimited financial resources, so lots of money is going to be printed, but the central banks also face disaster &mdash; print too much money and the country they represent goes bust.<br/><br/>In Q.E., you play the role of a central bank. You bid on different size companies to accumulate various levels of victory points. The amount you bid is unlimited since you are the central bank and you own the printing press! After the initial &quot;open&quot; bid by the lead player, the other players bid in secret. After the sixteen companies have been &quot;bailed out&quot;, bonus victory points are awarded for company sets of nationalization, monopolization and diversification.<br/><br/>Player markers on the scoring track now reveal which player has the most victory points, but this is not the end. Players must now add up the amount of money they printed and the player who printed the most money loses all their victory points!<br/><br/>Q.E. stands for Quantitative Easing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great Plains in the latter half of the 19th century was a cultural battleground. The Native way of life was under siege by an avalanche of invaders seeking land and progress. Plains Indian Wars reduces this monumental and catastrophic series of conflicts to its basic elements: A settler surge via long snaking wagon trains, the building of the Transcontinental Railroad, east and west, and the cavalry sent to protect them all. At the same time, Plains Indian Wars seeks to offer the Native-American player the opportunity to unite earlier, hold their own and perhaps even prevent European-American success.<br/><br/>Plains Indian Wars can be played by 1-4 players. It is a card-driven, cube game that uses area movement and control. Game play averages 60-90 minutes. The Plains Indian Wars Map board centers on the Great American Plains between the Mississippi River in the east and the Rockies in the west, the Canadian border in the north and Mexican border in the south. The Northern Plains Tribes (NPT) and the Southern Plains Tribes(SPT)each defend 12 regions while the Northern (Crow)and Southern (Mexican) &quot;Enemies&quot; each defend 5 regions of their own.<br/><br/>Separating the NPT and SPT is the planned route for the Transcontinental Railroad. US Completion (linking the two lines) ends the game and earns the US player a bonus. The Indian player earns a bonus if this is prevented. Through the course of the game Wagon trains attempt to travel historical trails to the Rockies. If they make it they earn victory points for the US player if they don't the Indian player gets the VPs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card game in which players purchase companies using sets that have various monetary denominations (the resource cards).  Turning in a set with matching symbols is worth more than the face value of the cards, so set collecting becomes a key strategy.  Purchased companies (the corporation cards) are placed in front of the player according to a matching letter system.  The top company of each stack is vulnerable to proxy take-overs by other players, so they usually attempt to order their holdings such that the most valuable ones are covered by less valuable companies.  Scoring occurs whenever a player draws a profit card from the deck.  The game ends when the corporation deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>Originally published by 3M (3M Gamette Series), re-published by Avalon Hill in its &quot;gamette line&quot; (gamette no. 205) when they took over 3M's line.

Following the Resident Evil 2 (2019) and Resident Evil 3(2021) board games, Resident Evil: The Board Game (2023) brings the sinister Spencer Mansion to the tabletop in a terrifying open world campaign. Based on the 2002 remake of the original Resident Evil video game, Resident Evil: The Board Game is a cooperative survival horror board game for 1-4 players.<br/><br/>Built on the survival horror engine of the previous two board games, Resident Evil: The Board Game introduces a slew of new and updated mechanics to keep you on your toes. Solve ingenious new puzzles to unlock doors, build the mansion map as you explore, send non-player characters on valuable missions, and more. Setup is swift because each scenario begins with just a few tiles. As you explore and open doors, you&rsquo;ll build out the map, opening new pathways and discovering useful items&hellip; and deadly enemies.<br/><br/>Resident Evil: The Board Game is a campaign game playable over 27 hours, where every decision counts and has far-reaching consequences. Every resource must be managed, every bullet counted. Fighting isn&rsquo;t the only way to survive. You&rsquo;ll have to decide when to attack and when to flee. But you won&rsquo;t always get a choice! As your campaign goes on, the mansion will evolve and the danger level will rise. The tension and encounter decks will change, adding mysterious new cards and altering the effects of old cards to make them even more dangerous. But effects don&rsquo;t just happen over time. Tension cards can change enemy behaviours at any moment, making them more lethal from one turn to the next.<br/><br/>Short on time? Each Resident Evil: The Board Game scenario is also playable as a 60-90 minute one-shot, for bite-sized nightmare sessions.<br/><br/>In the darkness lie your fears. Can you fight them and survive?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the bleak future, after the collapse of our modern technological world, most of the structures we hold dearly today are no longer effective. The things that brought us comfort and ease have fallen into disrepair and disuse. Central governments have given way to localized strongmen. In some places the world is nothing but a vast wasteland and in other locals mankind thrives by calling back to its pre-modern lifestyle.<br/><br/>Through it all men still choose to compete and challenge each other in the various arenas. Auto racing is one of these sports that will not die. But the rules no longer apply. The racing circuits are no longer about speed and guile. Now they resemble high speed demolition derbies. The most famous organized racing competition of them all, the Apocalypse Road, is run by callous thugs and monsters who encourage drivers to arm their cars and literally destroy their opponents. It is the Roman Coliseum reincarnated.<br/><br/>Over time, new rules and organizational structures have taken hold. Ten teams now complete across the Thunderverse in a season-long show of firepower and twisted metal. Drivers work as part of a team struggling to complete laps under machine gun and even missile fire. The tracks, falling into decades of disrepair, are a jumbled mess of jumps, joker lanes and dirt. Much like the gladiators of old, in a time of intense anguish, the chance to be a hero, even for a day, calls drivers out to risk life and limb for wealth and food. The arena beckons, will you take the wheel?<br/><br/>Apocalypse Road is a race game using the Thunder Alley/Grand Prix engine. Players attempt to score points by crossing the finish line (somewhat like roller derby) and by eliminating opposing cars. The first team to 15 points wins the event and gets a double portion of foodstuffs as a reward.<br/><br/>In Apocalypse Road, a race is played to the accumulation of 15 skins for a team. A Skin may be scored in two ways.<br/><br/>Each time a car crosses the Finish Line is worth 1 Skin.<br/>    Each opposing car that is eliminated during your activation is worth 1 Skin.<br/>    There is no leading and there is no tracking of lapped cars.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pharaoh is dead and his funerary barge sails slowly down the Nile toward his tomb where his spirit will stand before the judgement of Osiris.<br/><br/>Pharaoh had no offspring so tradition holds that the governors of the land be tasked with building monuments to Pharaoh&rsquo;s glory so that Osiris will favor his spirit in the afterlife. Accordingly, Pharaoh&rsquo;s successor will be the governor who builds the greatest tribute to the late king.<br/><br/>Resources and laborers are limited, the gods are capricious, and time is short; the memorials must be finished before the barge reaches the temple of Osiris at Men-nefer.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSailing Toward Osiris is a euro-style game with worker placement, resources management, project completion, and no direct conflict. Down-time is kept to a minimum via a single action, round-and-round turn structure that emphasizes timing decisions and subtle strategies.<br/><br/>The game takes place over four &quot;seasons&quot; with the movement of Pharaoh's barge tracking the game's progress. Each season, after players draw workers from a communal bag, play begins with each player taking a series of one-action turns from a list of 10 possible actions:<br/><br/>1. Play a worker to harvest resources<br/>2. Play a worker to a city for cards<br/>3. Play a worker to a caravan as leader or follower<br/>4. Hire an extra worker<br/>5. Trade at the market<br/>6. Plan a monument<br/>7. Build a monument<br/>8. Play a city card<br/>9. Play a boon card<br/>10. Withdraw from further actions.<br/><br/>Players are working to build sphinxes, obelisks, and pylons to the glory of the late Pharaoh and to earn extra glory by building the monuments on certain river segments and in certain configurations. However, as more monuments are built, resource harvesting becomes less productive and viable locations for future monuments become scarce. By the last season, players will have to be creative to find enough resources or available land on which to build.<br/><br/>The player who has amassed the most glory points by the end of the game will be crowned the new Pharaoh.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSailing Toward Osiris was inspired by the real events surrounding the death of Rameses XI at the end of Egypt's 20th Dynasty and the ascension of Smendes, a powerful governor in Lower Egypt.<br/><br/>",

They range from division level contests on half sized maps to two map battles between armies. Experienced players will be able to play many of the scenarios in one sitting. The rules compare the development of the cavalry, and the changes in infantry and artillery organization and tactics in 1862 and 1864.<br/><br/>Three Battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaign of 1862<br/>In a campaign still studied in military academies, Confederate General Thomas J. (Stonewall) Jackson engaged and defeated the Union forces pursuing him. Greatly outnumbered and at times facing three Union armies, Jackson defeated them all within ten weeks, at one point completely freeing the Shenandoah Valley of Union forces. Three battles from Jackson&rsquo;s 1862 Valley Campaign are featured.<br/><br/>    Kernstown, March 23, 1862<br/>    Winchester, May 25, 1862<br/>    Cross Keys and Port Republic, June 8-9, 1862<br/><br/><br/>Five Battles of the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864<br/><br/>    New Market, May 15, 1864<br/>    2nd Kernstown, July 24, 1864<br/>    3rd Winchester, September 19, 1864<br/>    Fisher's Hill, September 22, 1864<br/>    Cedar Creek, October 19, 1864 <br/><br/><br/>The Great Battles of the American Civil War Series:<br/><br/>This series is one of the hobby&rsquo;s longest-lived design concepts, springing from the legendary regimental level Gettysburg game &ndash; Terrible Swift Sword (SPI) &ndash; designed by Richard Berg in 1976. Under GMT, the rules system has remained stable, but has shown remarkable flexibility to allow each game to smoothly incorporate additional rules to reflect the historical battles. The series relies on interactive chit-pull mechanics to simulate the oftentimes-chaotic nature of the 19th Century battlefield at the regimental level.<br/><br/>Changes have been made to the series rules for Death Valley in order to enhance their clarity and simulation value. Veteran players will find the revised rules to be very familiar, with the main differences being in the user-friendliness of the rulebook, as well as how the game &quot;feels&quot;, especially for players versed in Civil War tactics.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>        1960 counters<br/>        Three 22&quot; x 34&quot; double-sided maps<br/>        Two 17&quot; x 22&quot; double-sided maps<br/>        One GBACW series rules booklet<br/>        Two Battle booklets<br/>        Sixteen Activation and Turn Record charts<br/>        Two Player Aid Cards<br/>        One Terrain Effects Chart<br/>        One 2nd Disorder Chart<br/>        Two 10-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE: Each Turn = 1 Hour<br/>MAP SCALE: 145 Yards Per Hex with 25-Foot Elevations<br/>UNIT SCALE: 50 Men or 1 Cannon per Strength Point<br/><br/>description from GMT website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warhammer Epic 40,000 was the third edition of the Epic system. The first edition and second editions of the Epic system had each been released as two separate games. The first edition comprised Space Marine (1st ed) and Adeptus Titanicus. Second edition comprised Space Marine (2nd ed) and Titan Legions. For the 3rd edition of the Epic system GW decided to release it as a single game and that game was Warhammer Epic 40k. For this reason Epic 40K is also known as 3rd ed. Epic 40k absorbed both the Titan Legions and Space Marine rules into one system, reducing and streamlining the rules in both those games into one more concise and coherent system. Epic now has faster gameplay and less rulebook-reading during play.<br/><br/>It's a miniature tabletop battle game set in the Warhammer 40,000 (Third Edition) world using 6-10mm scale miniatures to simulate huge epic battles. The rules are fairly simple but very effective and allow for a lot of strategic ideas. While many old-school fans of the 1st and 2nd edition felt the 3rd edition of the game lost too much distinction between units with the simplification, to this day Jervis Johnson says this is the game he is most proud of and it has a very smooth playing style.<br/><br/>Expansions:<br/><br/>    Adeptus Titanicus II<br/><br/><br/>Reimplemented By<br/><br/>    Epic Armageddon<br/><br/><br/>",

It features the Mafia Lemming characters from the cartoon.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/>&quot;Real lemmings want to jump off the next cliff. Members of the different lemming mafia families aren't any different. Because in the game, there is not only one, but six members of the suicidal species, they make a contest out of it. They all run to the lake and the first one who jumps in the lake wins. And it wouldn't be a real race if you couldn't place bets on the result. Each player has his favorite lemmings and tries to use the dice results to influence the race.&quot;<br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Each player has 6 cards (1/lemming), and 2 mission cards (bonus VP at end of game). On your turn, roll two dice (sides show one of the lemming colors) then choose to move one of those lemmings (if one is out of the race, move the lemming in last place). Lemmings may move one track section at a time, to any unoccupied space in the next section. The spaces on the race track are one of several types (e.g., give a lemming concrete shoe; 2=dead, remove concrete, allow you to place bets, move a lemming, etc.).<br/><br/>Betting is interesting: each time, you have the option to bet. To do so, place a lemming card face down on top of your stack of bet cards; goal is to place winner on TOP of your stack (last bet placed).<br/><br/>The game ends when a lemming reaches the finish; place remaining lemmings in the order they are on the track. Mission cards score bonus VP if completed, or cost VP if failed. Then resolve bets: turn over your cards, then go through them getting 1 VP per card revealed until you get to winning lemming (max 6 VP).<br/><br/>",

Do you have what it takes to lead a daring space agency into a new age of human achievement?<br/><br/>Space Race takes place during the first seven decades of the space conquest, and players become directors of newly established Space Agencies. Their goal is to expand them and to achieve astonishing breakthroughs. During the game, players will develop their Space Agencies by acquiring various cards (engineers, technologies, space programs) from a shared pool of cards called Universe.<br/><br/>Space Race: The Board Game is a game based on finding synergies and constructing powerful combinations out of different abilities. There is no guaranteed winning strategy: players have to respond to an ever changing environment in order to identify the best course of development while competing with their opponents for the most interesting discoveries.<br/><br/>The game is played in seven rounds. In every round, players acquire new cards into their agencies and activate abilities on cards they already own. In order to do this, players spend one of the limited set of Control Cards during every round. The player who creates the most developed Space Agency, builds the most impressive Laboratory and reaches the most remarkable breakthroughs wins the Space Race.<br/><br/>Space Race uses a simultaneous action selection mechanism at the beginning of every round, when players choose one of their remaining Control Cards that will determine which abilities players can use during the round. Every Control Card activates one of four possible stripes on cards and players can only use those abilities that are on the active stripe. As there are only 3 Control Cards of each of the 4 types and no Control Card can be used more than once, players have to combine different types of cards and abilities to be successful during the 7 rounds of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You can instead play as a third faction that originates from the surprise return of Emmy's twin sister, Kammi, who wants to rule Harrow County. Players activate mason jars to move their haints (undead creatures) around the hex-based board as they try to accomplish their missions. Combat is resolved using a never-before-seen cube tower that's built into the actual box.<br/><br/>Finally, a third player can enter the game: Hester, the dead witch buried under the tree. She controls the roots of the tree and using the cube tower, Hester can infect haints on her roots, which causes a snake to be placed into its ear. That player can still control this haint, but now so can Hester. If Hester comes back to life, then she needs to eat the other legends to gain all her power back to win.<br/><br/>In short, Harrow County is a thematic, tactical game of territory control and enemy elimination to determine the fate of Harrow County.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Bohemian Revolt of 1618 triggered the Thirty Years War and in the early period of the war the Catholic/Imperial cause enjoyed an almost unbroken string of victories. This game, part of the Musket and Pike Battle Series, simulates six battles of the early Thirty Years War. In the period covered, the armies deployed in more compact formations so each battle fits on half of a standard map.<br/><br/>The battles covered in this game are:<br/><br/>White Mountain<br/>November, 1620<br/>The combined army of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic League under Johann Tserclaes, the Count of Tilly, strike a blow directly at the Bohemian capital of Prague. The Bohemians make a stand on the slopes of White Mountain outside the town. Their Transylvanian allies desert them at the most critical point of the battle, causing the total collapse of the Bohemian army and its cause.<br/><br/>This is a short scenario where the qualitatively superior Catholic forces must crush the strongly positioned Bohemians who are bolstered by a large Transylvanian contingent of questionable reliability.<br/><br/>Wimpfen<br/>May, 1622<br/>Tilly joins forces with the Spanish under Cordoba. Together they pursue the smaller army of the Markgraf of Baden-Durlach. They catch his army near the town of Wimpfen, where it is drawn up in a defensive position in a river bend. The Badian camp is fortified in a special traditional way with Spie&szlig;wagen (&quot;pikewagons&quot;), mobile barricades equipped with sharp poles and small mortars. Only when a powder wagon detonates in the midst of the Protestant position, scattering the defenders, the Catholics are able to storm the wagonburg and heavy fighting breaks out.<br/><br/>A balanced pitched battle. A larger Catholic army tries to defeat a Protestant army that is not only protected by a wagonburg but also possesses a strong cavalry force for counterattacks.<br/><br/>H&ouml;chst<br/>June, 1622<br/>The Bavarians under Tilly catch the forces of the zealous Protestant Duke Christian as they try to cross the river Main. To protect the crossing, Christian makes a stand at a stream. At first Tilly hesitates, but eventually the Bavarians attack and the Protestant army dissolves in a chaotic retreat.<br/><br/>A rearguard situation, where the Protestants must delay the Catholics while simultaneously trying to retreat the majority of their army to safety.<br/><br/>Fleurus<br/>August, 1622<br/>Defeated and demoralized, the combined forces of the condottiere Mansfeld and Duke Christian try to escape the German theater and enter the service of the United Provinces instead. Cordoba's Spanish army blocks them at Fleurus in what is today Belgium. The unpaid and mutinous Protestants attack at dawn in an attempt to break through. In a vicious five-hour fight, the Spanish hold, but enough Protestants break through to force the Spanish to lift an important siege in the Netherlands.<br/><br/>This is a smaller pitched battle where a large but very unreliable Protestant army attempts to overwhelm the smaller but more experienced Spanish army. This battle is suitable as an introduction to the game system.<br/><br/>Stadtlohn<br/>August, 1623<br/>Following the battle of Fleurus, Duke Christian again rebuilds an army with raw recruits to join with Mansfeld in the Netherlands and renew the fight for the Protestant cause. However, he soon finds himself outlawed by the Imperor, unsupported and forced to retreat when Tilly's veteran army bears down on him. The Protestan army, slowed by a massive baggage train attempts a last stand and finds itself caught by Tilly's vanguard when within sight of the Dutch border. True to form, Christian decides to risk his army to save his baggage train, but ends up losing both.<br/><br/>A race-against-the-clock rearguard situation where the focus is on the fate of the Protestant baggage train that is slowly moving towards the map edge.<br/><br/>Lutter am Barenberge<br/>August, 1626<br/>The Danish King Christian IV intervenes in the Thirty Years War and pushes Tilly back during the early summer. However, he finds himself outnumbered and on the defensive when Tilly is reinforced by Imperial troops. Christian decides to turn on his pursuers and gives battle in a strong defensive position at Lutter am Barenberge. The initial Catholic attacks are repulsed, but the subsequent uncontrolled Danish counterattack results in the eventual collapse of the Danish army.<br/><br/>This is also a rearguard battle, but with more evenly matched armies, though the Danes are severely hampered by an unusual command situation.<br/><br/>In addition to scenario specific special rules that highlight the unique events of each battle, the battles in the game all share a simple set of special rules. These rules show the peculiarities of the early years of the Thirty Years War, such as Croat/Transylvanian style light cavalry.<br/><br/>Even though not all of the battles included were equal contests in military terms, the player victory conditions are balanced. Along with the special rules, that means the battles are interesting for both sides.<br/><br/>",

As Seekers, you will fight your way through the well deck of challenge cards to reach Vainglory, the master of the well, and face her in an epic final battle.<br/><br/>To defeat Vainglory, you'll battle and puzzle your way through her well deck of 57 challenge cards before facing her final gauntlet. On your turn, attempt a challenge by playing a matching skill card and rolling the dice. Add enough progress tokens to a challenge and you'll be richly rewarded. But fail and you'll face the penalty by losing health, discarding cards, or being forced to return cards to the well deck.<br/><br/>Even when it's not your turn, the cards in your hand can be played to boost your teammate's action. But be cautious&ndash;emptying your hand means gaining exhaustion and suffering effects that can lose you the game.<br/><br/>Survive long enough to reach the bottom of the well and reveal Vainglory's final form.

Among piles of gold, emeralds, and precious jewelry, you stumble upon a chest containing a mysterious hourglass. As soon as you touch it, you are filled with mystical energy and realize its true power: You are now able to see glimpses of your own future.

Unfortunately, everyone in the palace is now after you...<br/><br/>A Thief's Fortune is a card game for 1-4 players in which each player represents a different possible future of the same character. By visiting different locations, interacting with local characters and making sure that certain events you have seen actually happen, you try to find the path that will lead you as far away as possible from danger.<br/><br/>In more detail, players each have three areas in front of them: past, present, and future. Over five rounds, players draft location, event, and character cards, adding them to their personal &quot;future&quot; area with resources on those cards. Players extract resources from those cards, and when they're empty, the cards move into the player's present, after which the player can activate the power on those cards to score the fortune points they need to win the game.<br/><br/>",

The fire dragons are sleeping. The giants of winter, lurking. The fall is precious and is vital to plan your actions wisely.<br/><br/>Dwar7s Fall is a game about collecting gems in order to trade it for food. In the meantime you also will need to build your dwarf kingdom and slay some monsters. In this game you have multiple paths to win by choosing carefully your actions.<br/><br/>Players take turns to perform their actions. Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile or place one dwarf in a tile or move one dwarf by one tile).<br/><br/>Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool.<br/><br/>When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not played this round make their last turn and, then, the game ends. The points are calculated and wins the match who has more points.<br/><br/>",

If you compile a collection that contains a number of beans equal to the number value on one of beans in the collection, you may redeem the collection for the same amount of points on that card.<br/><br/>For example: If a player has three violet beans, and one of them has a value of 3, that collection can be converted for three trophy points.

Suddenly you receive reports that a spy has gained information about your operation, and the enemy shifts their defensive forces. But do they know the full extent of your plans? Should you call off the invasion and plan for a new attack? Or risk disaster against a prepared enemy? This is the fog of war...<br/><br/>The Fog of War is a two-player grand strategic game covering the European theater of World War II from 1940 to 1944. One player plays the Axis forces, and the other the Allies.<br/><br/>The game does not have units that move around a map; instead the game focuses on the planning and intelligence aspects of the war. Each player has a deck of cards that represent the army, navy, and other assets of their nations. A map shows the 28 land and sea provinces over which the players are battling.<br/><br/>You defend a province by placing cards face down on the map. If you wish to attack a province, you must plan an &quot;operation&quot; to do so by creating one on your operation wheel. The wheel is a unique way of forcing players to commit to operations in advance, while giving opportunities for intelligence gathering and bluffing. An operation consists of a province card that shows the target of the operation, plus one or more cards to conduct the attack. All of these cards are placed face down, so your opponent does not know the target of the operation or the strength of the cards that are taking part. Each turn, the dial on the operation wheel is rotated by one position. This controls when an operation can be launched and any attack or defense bonuses that apply.<br/><br/>In addition to combat forces for attack or defense, you may also spend Intel tokens to look at your opponent&rsquo;s operations and defenses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The players decide whether they want to play the standard four-quarters football game or one of three scenarios. The scenarios put the offensive player in an on-field situation. When the offensive player scores or is forced to surrender the ball after failing to score, the players exchange roles and the new offensive player plays under identical conditions.<br/><br/>Play action begins with the defensive player secretly chooses a die. The color of the die determines the defensive stand: against the running play, a short pass or a long pass. The offensive player then announces which of the three plays will be enacted. Defense rolls the die. Offense rolls three dice. Each player checks the appropriate table for results. The higher the number rolled by the players, the more effective their choices were, generally.<br/><br/>Pizza Box Football is shaped like a pizza box... and it opens up into a head-to-head football strategy game designed to offer all the intensity of real football in every play. Players unfold the game board (the field) and lay it inside the unfolded pizza box. The cards guide the players as they play and show the players which dice to roll.<br/><br/>Players must apply football strategy in order to win (when to run, when to short pass, when to long pass and when to try to fool the other team). Also available are additional plays from the expansion (sold separately) that extend the offensive strategy to include draws, screen passes and play-action passes and add run blitzes, route jumps and QB blitzes for the defense.  These plays work with the existing PBF game.  (The full expansion features 32 teams with different strengths on offense and on defense.)<br/><br/>Pizza Box Football lets players feel like a coach, a player and a fan all at once. Its robust, statistically accurate play satisfies even the most demanding football fanatic while remaining accessible enough for the younger or casual fan. Four game options let opponents play for 5 minutes or an hour, they decide.<br/><br/>Contents: 1 game board, 5 play cards, 13 color pegs, 13 dice, 1 expansion game preview card, 1 instruction booklet, 1 stat sheet tablet. For 1 or 2 players (solitaire rules available at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.PizzaBoxFootball.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.PizzaBoxFootball.com</a>). Made in the USA, this game's clever design allows it to pack up into its pizza box, and yet it is sturdy enough for play anywhere.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Pizza Box Football Expansion<br/>    Pizza Box Football 2006 Expansion<br/>    Pizza Box Football 2007 Expansion<br/>    Pizza Box Football 2008 Expansion<br/><br/><br/>",

Points are earned by seeing different parts of the city, but the various ways to earn these points are only unlocked by crossing the city&rsquo;s seven bridges.<br/><br/>Six dice are rolled at the beginning of each turn, and each player drafts the roads from one of these onto their map.

Players will need to command armies of giants as they wage war throughout northwest Faer&ucirc;n. Order your giants to assault small folk villages and cities to score points and secure resources including food, artifacts, ore, and runes.<br/><br/>Each player issues commands to their giants in the form of command cards (recruit, move, attack, pillage, and so on). This allows players to recruit new giants, send them out to attack settlements and other giants, and also to pursue special agendas based upon their race. Each player represents a different giant race (hill giants, stone giants, frost giants, fire giants, cloud giants, or storm giants), each with a different agenda.  For example, the Storm Giants seek to restore their lost monarch, King Hekaton. The Cloud Giants seek an ancient dragon treasure trove, and the Hill Giants seek an abundance of food with which to feed their massive monarch, Chief Guh.<br/><br/>Contents include 12 Giants miniatures, injection molded in color, measuring from approximately 60mm to over 90mm in height, and three Giantslayers.<br/><br/>Preliminary FAQ: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-preliminary-faq\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1730050/assault-giants-prel...</a><br/><br/>Official Variants: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26201496\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/article/26201496</a><br/><br/>",

To set up the game, shuffle the 25 cards, then lay them out in a circle.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, one player rolls four special dice which indicate the color, shape and pattern of the amoeba being sought as well as the color of the lab it left and in which direction it was traveling. Competing at the same time, players need to find the lab, then move in the right direction to spot the amoeba (which may, of course, be striped and not spotted).<br/><br/>But wait! If you encounter a vent after leaving the lab, you need to skip to the next vent in the circle before continuing your search. (Amoebas prefer to travel in the dark when possible.) Plus, if an amoeba passes through one of three mutation devices in the circle, you need to alter the criteria for your search, looking for a tentacled amoeba instead of one with a tail, for example, or an orange/red amoeba instead of a blue/purple one. Zap!<br/><br/>The first player to lay her hand on the correct card collects a token, and the first player to collect five tokens wins!<br/><br/>",

A hexagonal grid is superimposed over the map to regulate game play. Each hexagon is 2 miles across, unit size is brigade and regiments. Each turn represents 12 hours of real time.<br/><br/>Game features include morale, prominent leaders, blitzkrieg tactics, German army boundaries, initial surprise, Allied air power and much more.<br/><br/>This is the Deluxe Edition, an entirely new version (fourth edition) of the game.<br/><br/>First off, the map is printed on heavy cardstock to avoid the problems with paper mapsheets. Improved &amp; updated the graphics for everything all around, and increased the size of the game counters to 5/8&quot;. Enhanced the Rulebook with new scenarios, additional variants, rule updates &amp; clarifications, included a Players Handbook, updated the designer's notes, and much more! There are full COLOR player aid cards, Random Events are introduced, they've updated the cartography (the map graphics), provided an updated Order of Battle, the hexes have been enlarged to contain the larger game counters, and variant counters are also introduced.<br/><br/>For those of you with distinguishing tastes in their choice of wargames, this has also been acclaimed by the noted designer and expert on the subject, Danny S.

        "description": "Stich-Meister is a trick-taking game in which the players alter the rules before each round of play. The game consists of two decks of cards: One deck of 60 cards with four suits of cards numbered 1 to 15, and one deck of 60 rule cards.<br/><br/>Each player has three rule cards, and at the start of a round, each player plays one of these cards. The rule cards played determine the rules for that round. There are three types of rule cards:<br/><br/><br/>    Trump cards, which determine the trump suit;<br/>    Scoring cards, which determine how many points a trick is worth;<br/>    Basic rule cards, which affect the way cards may be played.<br/><br/><br/>Now, a trick-taking game is played with the 60-card deck. One player leads a card and others need to follow suit, if possible (unless this has been changed by the rule cards). The winner of a trick leads the next trick. At the end of the round each trick is worth one point, modified by the scoring cards.<br/><br/>After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INCURSION is set in the world of Secrets of the Third Reich and is the ultimate combination of board game and miniatures game. Armored troopers of the US &ldquo;Lucky Seventh&rdquo; and stalwart commandos of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s MI-13 hurtle through underground bunkers and combat the monstrous forces of the German SWD in a furious race against time. The Doomsday Device is ticking and neither the Allies nor the Axis can fail. This two player game features a tight storyline campaign that culminates in an epic and desperate climax. The game mechanics are simple to grasp allowing players to instantly focus on their tactical options. Game play is incredibly fast-paced and tense and players choose their forces through a card-based Requisition Point system. The game is played on a board with a special card deck and highly detailed 30mm metal miniatures. You can also use the miniatures in games of Secrets of the Third Reich. Rules can be found for them here.<br/><br/>In 1946, after stunning German victories on both fronts largely attributed to Vergeltungswaffe 4, a compound that kills painfully and resurrects corpses as dangerous animate objects, Franco joined the Axis. Spanish forces backed by Brandenburger commandos and Fallschirmjager Drop Armor assaulted the British held rock of Gibraltar. Germany claimed the ancient fort with its network of caves and aggressively expanded it into a vast underground research, command, and control center, plumbing the depths of the Rock. In 1949, allied forces mount a massive offensive to retake it. The campaign is bloody and hard-fought but ultimately successful. German and Spanish personnel escape by U-boat from underwater chambers. US and British forces enter the German compound only to be beaten back by the horrors that lurk within the vast twisted labyrinth under Gibraltar. Many commanders feel that the only recourse is to seal the caves from the surface, so that is done. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the lo cation of all of the undersea tunnels. Zombie naval mines damage or destroy numerous smaller vessels and sink the aircraft carrier Lexington as they sally forth from these undersea caves. MI-13 stumbles onto communiqu&eacute;s detailing German SWD plans for a diabolical Doomsday Device under Gibraltar. Given the effectiveness of previous SWD attacks, the credibility of these reports cannot be ignored. The decision is made to clear the caves. MI-13 Commandos and elements of the US Lucky Seventh invade the stronghold in a desperate race to shut down the Doomsday Device before it can be deployed.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Rigid two piece box covered in art<br/>Glossy 28 page rulebook<br/>Card rules summary/playsheet<br/>4 sheets of two-sided heavy-duty die cut pieces (132 total) including counters, doors and stand-ups for all models<br/>Super Heavy duty two-sided six-fold game board<br/>86 cards (66 card Battle Deck and 10 Model Cards for each side)<br/>3 black dice<br/>36 black plastic stand-up holders for doors and &quot;models&quot;<br/>Vac-formed plastic holding tray<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Have you felt the thrill of the struggle between life and death, sitting at the same table with your worst enemy and an unreasonable amount of poison? Don&rsquo;t forget to bring some antidote when playing Raise Your Goblets!<br/><br/>In Raise Your Goblets, players take the roles of nobles at a banquet, each one with their own agenda of personal vendetta. Each player has wine, poison and antidote tokens they can pour into the goblets, trying to poison their enemies while staying alive themselves! Each noble also has a special ability that allows them to bend or even break a rule.<br/><br/>In more detail, each character has a plastic goblet, and each goblet is primed in secret at the start of the round with either wine, poison or antidote. On a turn, you take two actions, with actions being to peek inside your goblet, rotate all goblets left or right, swap your goblet with someone else's, or secretly add one of your wine, poison or antidote tokens to any goblet. Once someone has &quot;served&quot; all of their wine, they can call a toast on their turn instead of doing anything else. Each player, including the toaster, takes one more action, then everyone drinks. If you have more poison than antidote, you die.<br/><br/>What's your goal in doing all of this? Well, at the start of a round you are given a target to kill, and everyone knows who is targeting whom. If at the end of a round, your target is dead, you score 1 point; if you're alive, you score 1 point; if both of these things are true, you score a bonus point (3 total). Also, whoever has the most wine in their cup scores 1 point. If someone has died, they receive a new noble card, and at the end of three rounds, whoever has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a special calendar sheet and a hidden sheet, pencils and dice. Each round, the active player flips the card of the week and declares the day on which the event will occur. All players choose to join or not join the event all at once, and if they join, write them on their calendars. Of course, you cannot take part in the events of the day if you already filled that date on your calendar.<br/><br/>The biggest feature is the special bond that grows between the characters who participated in the same event. Players plan the events in order to develop friendships and score more points. &quot;Oh, only Hana and Vivian and I are free on Tuesday, so if I suggest going to swim in the sea on Tuesdays and Wednesday, maybe only I can deepen the bonds with the two girls ...!&quot; This is how boys and girls develop serious feelings and judgments are born one after another. Furthermore, &quot;I was the only one who went to the sea when I tried to open the lid!&quot; These goofy developments, the emotions that come from them are the most enjoyable!<br/><br/>Another feature is homework. Players must balance having fun with friends, and getting their summer homework done, too. If you do not reach a certain number of pages by the end of the holidays, you get deducted points. You will end up cramming all alone the last week, instead of deepening your new friendships. This reality is unbearable.<br/><br/>Agony, laugh loudly, please talk about sweet and sour summer memories by all means after play. It is certain that the calendar and the secret sheet will be important memorial items after the entry!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The houses were both branches of the royal family, therefore the Wars were originally known as &quot;The Cousins' War&quot;. Each player represents one of the houses as they fight battles and gain influence to control England.<br/><br/>The Cousins' War is played over a maximum of five rounds, with each round representing between five and ten years of the conflict. Each round involves gaining influence across England and preparing for a climactic battle.<br/><br/>In each round, the players decide where the current battlefield will be, playing action cards to deploy troops to the battlefield, while also increasing or decreasing their influence in the regions, after which they fight. Players resolve the battle by engaging in bluff and counter-bluff, using three dice, until only one side has troops remaining on the field. Winning the battle helps to consolidate your house's influence on the board.<br/><br/>You win The Cousins' War either by dominating all the regions of England or by controlling the most regions at the end of the fifth round.<br/><br/>2nd Edition is a new version of The Cousins' War with larger components. There are English (Surprised Stare Games, Flying Lemur Game Studio), German (Frosted Games) and Spanish (2Tomatoes) versions separately published. 2nd Edition contains an optional variant, Times of Change. This variant adds in the cards originally published as the Events expansion to the 1st edition. There is 1 extra card, Jura Belli, in the Times of Change variant over and above the Events expansion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Long out of print, this is a popular placement game by Wolfgang Kramer, published in the Franckh Kosmos long box series. Actually very simple, players take turns to put their colored pieces in different rooms. Whenever a row, column, diagonal or room is full, it is scored, with the majority holder getting the value of the length, and any minority holders losing points. All lines or rooms are marked off when scored and when you run out of pieces to place, you must move a piece, which means you can suddenly lose a potential score you were building.<br/><br/>",

Embody one of the outbreak survivors and cooperate with your partners so you can manage to leave the city before time runs out. You should be careful, though, because one of them looks a little bit ill and the girl was bitten a while ago&hellip; and she is anxiously staring at that bleeding wound in your arm. Maybe it&rsquo;s just better save her the suffering with a bullet, you can make it yourself after all&hellip; or maybe not&hellip;?<br/><br/>Includes a large survivor-styled board, 30 personalized standups counters to represent characters and zombies, two dice: one eight-sided and another one six-sided, 93 cards, plenty of items to represent weapons and objects in general, 7 customized characters sheets, comprehensive rulebook with a fair amount of quests aside the main game.<br/><br/>The approach is simple... we have to flee the city. There are three ways to escape: land, sea and air. The last one is only available if between players is the character of the pilot. The other two are available ... as long as the ship does not leave nor the military blow the bridge to contain the outbreak. Do not forget that the transport may have limited seats.<br/><br/>And on the way? Zombies, hidden areas which reveal themselves by the survivors approaching. But beware! these areas may contain more zombies or obstacles that force us to get round. Also, there are many common and special buildings that we can loot- Only if we are not eaten- looking for weapons, equipment and medkits. Meanwhile, zombies are surrounding us, they corner us, hit us&hellip; they also bite us so we can get infected!! of course the rest of the team doesn't need to know, right?<br/><br/>",

She rolls the dice one by one, stopping when she wishes, and the sum of the dice rolled can't exceed 7. If she rolls only one die, she moves forward by the number rolled; if she rolled two dice, she moves twice the sum of her dice (if the sum &le; 7); and if she rolled three dice, she moves three times the sum (again, if the sum &le; 7). If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.<br/><br/>If one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll &mdash; and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track. Stacks can have any number of pieces, and whoever is on top dictates to the active player how many dice she must roll. When a piece in the middle of a stack moves, it leaves all pieces below it in place.<br/><br/>When a piece or a stack lands on or passes the final space in the lap, the owner of the topmost piece takes one of the prize cards; each prize has a value on it, and once all the prizes have been claimed, whoever has the highest sum of prize cards wins.<br/><br/>The 2014 edition of the game, Mah&eacute;, allows for play with up to seven player turtles, who are circling the island while trying to lay their eggs on the beach and receive points for doing a good job.<br/><br/>The 2024 Korean edition of the game, 공룡 대작전, allows for play with up to seven player adventurers, who are circling the island while taking back stolen eggs on the T-Rex nest and receive points for taking a lot of eggs.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns choosing any tile from the trail, but can never turn back to choose a tile they have already passed. There are 15 different sets of tiles (three sets each of 8, 6, 4, 2, and 1), and when the last tile of any set has been claimed, the player holding the most in that set scores that number of points, while the player holding second most scores half that number. Complicating matters, there are also three tie-breaker tiles and three tiles that let you &quot;buy&quot; a tile from another player. It's an exercise in numbers that plays quickly, probably 30 minutes tops, and is suitable for youngsters yet susceptible to analysis. The game has a unique layout and a brightly-colored Egyptian pharaoh look.

        "description": "This Accursed Civil War is a tactical battle game featuring five battles from the First English Civil War: 1642-1646. It is the first in the GMT Musket &amp; Pike Battle System covering warfare in the 17th Century. The system emphasizes Command and Control and the unique style of combat in that era. Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Wings may change their order, but it is not an easy task to accomplish. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the Cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, Infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The battles included in this game are:<br/><br/>Edgehill, 23 October 1642<br/>    Is the King beholden to Parliament or is he truly sovereign? King Charles and his army, their way to London barred by the army of Parliament, have drawn up to give battle. Edgehill was the first major battle of the war. Robert Devereax, Earl of Essex, commands the army of Parliament sent to prevent the King's army from reaching London. The fighting is indecisive as the bloodied Royalist foot fall back, but Essex conceded the field despite receiving reinforcements. A major victory for either side could have ended the war here.<br/><br/>First Newbury, 20 September 1643<br/>    Outmaneuvered, Essex, with the Royalists under King Charles between his army and London, is forced to fight. Essex spies a hill southwest of Newbury and in the early morning occupies it. Hedges line the area and help minimize the King's advantage in Cavalry.<br/><br/>Marston Moor, 2 July 1644<br/>    The largest battle of the war. It decided the fate of Northern England. An allied army of Scots under the Earl of Leven, the Northern Association under Ferdinando Fairfax, and the Eastern Association under the Earl of Manchester laid siege to the King's Northern Army under the Marquis of Newcastle at York, the key to the North. King Charles dispatched his nephew, the talented Prince Rupert, to effect a relief. The defeat was complete; the Royalist army was utterly destroyed and the North lost to Parliament. A new hero arises here: Cromwell, a name synonymous with the English Civil War and the key player in the later two civil wars.<br/><br/>Second Newbury, 27 October 1644<br/>    The disaster that precipitated the forming of the New Model Army. Three Parliamentary armies come together and catch the King by surprise just north of Newbury. The most unconventional of all the battles; the superior Parliamentary force attacks from either end, but is short on time. Various options on gaining more time by shortening the flank march give this action high replay value.<br/><br/>Naseby, 14 June 1645<br/>    The debut of the New Model Army and the battle that broke the back of the King's army. The New Model Army was created by combining the elements of the major armies in the field. While this worked well for the cavalry, there were serious problems in the infantry ranks. The King's army was outnumbered, but it retained its corps of veteran infantry. The final result was a decisive defeat for the King and the end of his military fortunes. Though fighting would last another year, the King would never field a potent army again.<br/><br/>2nd Printing Note: This reprint version will include an updated series rulebook and playbook and an Edgehill variant scenario, as well as numerous updates to the counters.

With these resources, you develop your colonies and attempt to build science stations and outposts.<br/><br/>The game is played over ten rounds, each of which consists of three phases: discover, excavate, develop.<br/><br/>In the discover phase, a resource card is flipped and resources are placed in excavation zones.<br/><br/>In the excavation phase, players use their excavation cards to compete for those resources.<br/><br/>In the development phase, development tiles (which are won in the excavation phase and come in a variety of shapes) are placed on the player's individual colony board. The resources, which also include ships, colonists, and crystals are placed in designated spots on the tiles.<br/><br/>In the competitive game, players score points by creating the best mining colony, i.e., having various resources, people, and ships that are determined to be more valuable. Victory point values change from game to game, so different resources have different values from game to game.<br/><br/>In the solo mode, the player competes against a dummy player while they attempt to complete their colony.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One day, though, they were tricked: The angelic guardians were turned into stone and demons flood the world ever since.<br/><br/>Eons later, a captain named Kareem found a petrified angel on a remote rock off the shores of an island. Kareem managed to awake the angel Leanas, who told him about the island of EOS and gifted him with immortality.

Together they would fight back the demons, forcing them to return to the abyss they came from and freeing the world of their dark powers once again.<br/><br/>EOS: Island of Angels is an engine-building board game for 2-5 players, which also includes some worker placement mechanisms. Players hire a unique, asymmetrical crew and set sail to the island of EOS, to free the angels of old and leave their mark on this mythical world's chronicle. Be wary though: While exploring the ocean, vicious demons will attack the ships and crews. Fighting them and their powerful demon lords will bring players glory and help restore the angels' power. Through awakening angels, players can gain powerful blessings that pose as an advantage to their strategy, while demons sabotage the ship, resulting in disadvantages.<br/><br/>Finding the perfect balance between progressing on their journey and fighting demons while improving their ship and crew is key for players to gain the most victory points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each family has several eligible roosters eager to jump into the world of politics, getting rich and creating a legacy by any means necessary.<br/><br/>Roosters gain renown for their families by occupying various political offices. Low-ranking officers don't yield much fame, but they hold both the purse strings and the power of the sword. A few roosters in the lower offices of Aedile and Praetor, together with the votes of a few well-paid (and temporary) allies, can clear a path to the luxury and recognition that come with the titles of Censor, Consul, and even Caesar.<br/><br/>Being Caesar isn't easy, though: fail to bribe and bargain to ensure the welfare of the whole coop and today's Caesar is tomorrow's Coq au Vin. Dead roosters don't earn any more points, but they do offer opportunities for their surviving relatives to exaggerate their accomplishments. All that matters, in the end, is history's judgment, and history can be rewritten.<br/><br/>Mechanically, players gain and maintain areas of influence through negotiation and voting. The game features a Suffragium marker that players pass after voting to either promote a Rooster to a higher office, or throw him to the fox.

You've decided to bring these two powder kegs together just to see what happens &ndash; and you wouldn't say &quot;no&quot; to a little money on the side, so round up your herd, march them through France, and set them loose behind the Cordon Rouge. If you're lucky, you'll come home rich before Greenpeace gets hold of you.<br/><br/>Either way, there's something magical about blowing up cows.<br/><br/>Unexploded Cow is a money game in which players are trying to collect enough points to win the pot. On every turn, you will buy cows and pay for special effects by putting money in the pot, then try to discover bombs with your own cows in an effort to take money out of the pot. All along, you will be earning points from the French as you liberate town after town from the terrors of unexploded bombs, and the player who scores the most points gets whatever's left in the pot.<br/><br/>Unexploded Cow is best played as a series of short games, each of which takes about thirty minutes. The game is quite simple and very chaotic: You'll have a blast.<br/><br/>",

To win, you need to earn more &quot;star bucks&quot; than anyone else, and you earn those by completing contracts, upgrading vehicles, finding alien technologies and having resources on hand at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Upgrading your UMVee also provides it with special abilities that can come in handy throughout the game.<br/><br/>Undermining is a highly interactive game, with player actions sometimes benefiting and sometimes impacting the future actions of others. Competition for resources is important, of course, but using open tunnel spaces to get where you need to go&mdash;and blocking those spaces from opponents&mdash;is also key. Players can still move through other UMVees, but doing so costs battery power, and managing your batteries&mdash;which allow extra actions&mdash;is another important aspect of playing well.<br/><br/>Undermining comes with a double-sided game board, with player interaction being significantly different from one side to the other. With a random layout of resources, UMVee upgrades, contract variability, and one-off special bonuses from the finding of alien technology, no two games of Undermining are ever the same.<br/><br/>",

These falling stars crashed to the surface, and in the ages to come, became enshrined in legends as the Lost Legacy. Discover where the Lost Legacy can be found and win the game!<br/><br/>Lost Legacy: Third Chronicle contains two sets of game cards: Sacred Grail and Staff of Dragons. Each set can be played independently or mixed together with other sets to create a unique custom set.<br/><br/>As for how to play, Lost Legacy is a game of risk, deduction, and luck for 2&ndash;4 players. You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play. The player who guesses correctly wins; if no one finds the Lost Legacy, then everybody loses.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>By combining different Lost Legacy sets (while keeping only a single Lost Legacy card in play), up to six players can compete at the same time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theme<br/>The theme of this game is similar to the original Three Dragon Ante. You are sitting in a bar in a fantasy world, playing cards for gold. The setting is a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons style bar and the game may be played as a sub-plot of a D&amp;D game if desired.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal is to have the most gold at the point where the first player runs out of gold. In a two player game, you just have to bankrupt your opponent, but in a larger game, you may have to prop up another player until you become the richest.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>A game is played over a series of hands until the end-condition is reached (above). A hand typically consists of playing one of your cards into the centre as an 'Ante' card, then three rounds of card-playing, attempting to play the best set (or 'Flight') of cards. The highest value Ante card determines the amount of gold that every player must contribute to the pot this round. The player who played the highest value Ante card starts the first round. Subsequent rounds are started by the player who played the highest value card in the previous round. Each card has both a numerical value and a power (or ability). However, the power is only triggered if the card has a lower or equal value to the card just played.<br/><br/>The game is a balance between playing high cards to win the pot of gold in the Ante and playing lower cards to trigger their abilities and improve your hand for a later round.<br/><br/>This game can be played by itself, or in combination with the original Three-Dragon Ante card set.<br/><br/>From WoTC site:<br/>This fun card game updates the popular Three-Dragon Ante card game, adding new cards and new ways to foil your opponents! Designed for 2&ndash;6 players, Three-Dragon Ante: Emperor&rsquo;s Gambit showcases dragons and iconic character archetypes from the D&amp;D world. Easy to learn and play, this game is great for everyone, from dedicated D&amp;D gamers to poker fans to casual card players. D&amp;D characters can also play Three-Dragon Ante: Emperor&rsquo;s Gambit within the context of any D&amp;D campaign.<br/><br/>In addition to the added cards and rules, this game also contains complete rules for the original Three-Dragon Ante card game.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Three-Dragon Ante.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Blitzkrieg Legend simulates Case Yellow, the German offensive in May of 1940 that shocked the world. In less than a month's time it made quick work of Belgium and Holland, shattered the armies of France, and pushed the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) into the sea at Dunkirk. This twelfth game in the Operational Combat Series (OCS) game from Multi-Man Publishing and departs from its established norms in using a ground scale of 3 miles per hex and a time scale of two-day turns, and as such is similar to Sicily. The chosen scale lets this lightning campaign unfold a bit more slowly, and gives the densely-packed armies more room to maneuver.<br/><br/>Case Yellow achieved the largest pocket ever to be created in the war, with the largest number of captured soldiers as well. This result is sometimes looked upon by gamers and historians alike as a foregone conclusion, but Manstein's daring strike through the Ardennes was a gamble that might easily have gone awry. Hindsight suggests the fighting could have gone much differently.<br/><br/>A range of historical problems confront the player directing the Allies in this game. His French, Belgian, Dutch, and BEF combat units have not yet mastered the faster pace of action in WWII, and therefore are slow and don't fight at full Action Rating when in Move Mode. The Allies are also forced to adopt the historical Dyle Plan (when not playing the what-if version of the campaign), which leaves the French with inadequate reserves behind the Ardennes and too many of their best forces committed to shielding Antwerp and Brussels. Because history tells us the headlong rush into Belgium was primary cause of the quick Allied defeat, an &quot;If I Was in Charge...&quot; version of the campaign is presented to allow both sides to explore some different initial deployments.<br/><br/>A simple set of campaign objectives are presented, with Victory Point awards centered on the following:<br/><br/>&bull; The French must vigilantly protect Paris, which is the ultimate German objective. Two more cities along the map's south edge, Verdun and Metz, are also worth points (so the French cannot just abandon the Maginot Line).<br/><br/>&bull; The possible surrender of Holland is triggered by German armor moving adjacent to any of the three Dutch major cities. Surrender chances are modified if the French and BEF are supporting Holland (which is why French 7th Army initially moved north of Antwerp).<br/><br/>&bull; The possible surrender of Belgium and BEF Evacuation are triggered when the Germans drive a wedge between the Belgian coast and Paris. Surrender chances are modified, however, if the French and BEF are supporting Belgium (another nod toward the historical rationale of the Dyle Plan).<br/><br/>&bull; The Germans also win points for battering the BEF, so the Allies are encouraged to keep this force intact.<br/><br/>The game's special rules are judiciously chosen to evoke the full flavor of the campaign. For instance, the Maginot Line is given its historical due, shown as a strong right shield that can unfortunately be outflanked through the Ardennes. Rules for special operations are something new to OCS, and these can capture enemy bridges and forts (but just on 10 May unless playing an optional rule). As mentioned above, the BEF can get isolated or mauled as part of the victory conditions, and if this happens a ragtag assemblage rides to the rescue: RN Destroyers, special Evacuation Ports, elite Irish and Welsh battalions, and even some Spitfires finally appear to provide some top-cover. Mix in the occasional Pause &mdash; an event that tugs sharply on the panzers' leash &mdash; and you've the kind of chrome that make The Blitzkrieg Legend a tremendous tool for historical study and an exciting source of gaming  pleasure.<br/><br/>The Blitzkrieg Legend is also a game with tremendous replay value. Presented are 7 scenarios and 3 campaigns. The longest is just 13 turns; the largest fits on a standard 4' x 6' table.  Series veterans know the depth of the model can lead to some long and complex turns, but here at last we have an entire campaign that can easily be played to the finish!<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/><br/>1. South.  The first 4 turns on the southern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Sedan as well as the crossings of the Meuse further downstream by 6th and 8th Panzer.<br/>   2. Center. The first 4 turns on the northern half of Map B. Covers the fighting at Gembloux Gap as well as the crossings of the Meuse by 5th and 7th Panzer.<br/>   3. North. The first 4 turns on Map C. Covers the air landings and surrender of Holland.<br/>   4. Mini-Campaign. Links the first three scenarios into a short campaign using two maps.<br/>   5. Sedan. Lasts just 2 turns and uses just a small portion of Map B. Covers the French counterattack and German breakout.<br/>   6. Arras. Lasts just 1 player turn. A teaching scenario covering the Allied counterattack.<br/>   7. Dynamo. Lasts 8 turns. Plays like a campaign game, using just Map A to cover the important events during the last half of the campaign.<br/><br/>Campaigns<br/><br/>1. &quot;No Holland&quot; Version. Doesn't include the fighting in Holland, which is &quot;automatic&quot; and not under player control. Uses two maps, the full 13 turns.<br/>   2. &quot;With Holland&quot; Version. Uses all three maps, the full 13 turns.<br/>   3. &quot;If I Was in Charge...&quot;  Several variations on either of the two campaigns are offered.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/><br/>     OCS Series Rulebook<br/>     TBL Game Specific Rulebook<br/>     Two Charts and Tables Booklets<br/>     Full Color Game Map (two 22x34, one 28x15)<br/>     1,960 Counters (7 counter sheets)<br/>     One 8.5x11 Play Aid<br/>     10 Scenarios (3 of them are Campaign Scenarios)<br/>     Box and Dice<br/><br/><br/>",

Also published by Oriflam as La Guerre des H&eacute;ros in 1993 (in French) and as ドラゴンパス Dragon Pass in Japanese by Hobby Japan.<br/><br/>The role-playing World of Glorantha was created as a semi-public-domain project by Greg Stafford around 1966 as a mental exercise. Eventually, Greg published a wargame based on his world called White Bear and Red Moon. In fact, Chaosium was founded to allow Stafford to publish this boardgame! This game later became the excellent Dragon Pass game. White Bear and Red Moon was enough of a hit to spawn a second war game, Nomad Gods, and, more importantly, inspired some D&amp;D fans to write a gaming system that would allow role-playing in Glorantha. Thus was RuneQuest born.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    White Bear & Red Moon<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Ming Voyages&quot; are the seven journeys made by the Chinese treasure fleet of oceanic junks between 1405 and 1433. The Yongle Emperor constructed the fleet during a period of outward-looking expansion of Chinese influence overseas, and its commander was Admiral Zheng He. The maritime power of the Ming Empire was used for political purposes, not just for trade. The immense fleet was technologically far in advance of European counterparts until at least the 18th century. While it is purported by some that the fleet circumnavigated the world and discovered all its continents save Europe, the voyages certainly reached Calicut in India and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf, while making landfalls in the Arabian Peninsula and East Africa &mdash; but on the landward side of the Empire, border troubles were always brewing.<br/><br/>In The Ming Voyages, one player will be the Ming Emperor who is trying to complete all seven treasure voyages, in addition to protecting the Chinese borderlands from invading barbarians. The other player controls the three disparate barbarian factions who are trying to settle on the borderlands with China. Battles can occur in these borderlands, with players use their three dice to roll for triples, doubles, and singles that are better than their opponent's rolls. Reserved cards can be used for re-rolls.<br/><br/>The game uses multi-function cards (as in The Cousins' War) to provide actions for players to reinforce their armies and attack the enemy and for the Emperor to complete voyages. Play of a card may provide an out-of-turn action for the opponent, so players must be careful of timing. Only the Emperor draws new cards. Players swap hands at the end of each turn, so the Emperor always knows what the Barbarian Overlord holds, and each player tries to exploit the out-of-turn actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the multiplayer card-driven, city-building strategy game Forged in Steel, players take on the role of a prominent family in a burgeoning Colorado county in 1900 as turbulent social and technological changes are about to reshape the way all Americans live. Each family seeks to control one of four sectors (mining, industry, city, or commercial) while also striving to be Mayor to control the appointment of other players to offices.<br/><br/>The game takes place over three eras (turns/decades), each with multiple phases in which players are dealt eight cards &mdash; all with historic black-and-white photos from Colorado &mdash; and must discard one and bank two for their final turn. Cards are used to either play Municipal Muscle points to build, buy, or seize structures, or used for the &quot;event&quot; listed on every card. Cards can also be used to set yearly &quot;Headlines&quot; or &quot;Themes&quot; which evoke a movement in American society or technology and change VP awards or other variables in the game. Structures are scored by multiplying the amount the sector tracks have advanced by the number of buildings owned. Different tracks progress differently.<br/><br/>Finally, players can build parks, civic buildings, hospitals, and police stations. These buildings in turn affect further play and cause neighborhoods to have more political votes at turn's end, increase VPs for proximity, or protect against certain negative cards.<br/><br/>Forged in Steel is an organic building game in that all builds change the landscape and players may build only adjacent to where others have built &quot;the grid/network&quot;. At turn's end, the game decides how many immigrants come seeking jobs based on how many factories and commercial buildings were built that turn. Too many? Unrest grows and there could be a riot, undermining all of your recent city-building efforts. The National Guard will step in to help you, of course, but they are usually outnumbered, and there's often fighting in the streets, so be wary of not contributing to the &quot;Unrest Track&quot;.<br/><br/>Can your family negotiate the turbulent changes of the early 1900s and become the local political and economic powerhouse? From the New Deal, Women's Suffrage, City Beautiful and Spanish Flu, to sidewalks and paved streets, all aspects of a 1900s western American city are incorporated, and players will learn about the rise of those developments that changed cities, labor, industry, and society forever.<br/><br/>",

Skillfully arrange the landscapes and use their effects to turn your work into a great success!<br/><br/>Players build the Almadi realm in front of them by arranging the different Landscape types to the right of their starting tile.

By placing this tile, the player can activate the effects of adjacent tiles.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players score points based on the landscape layout in their realm, the number of rubies collected, the activation of certain effects and the royal objectives they have completed.

Players roll and allocate dice to Unit cards, with each card accepting specific die results or dice combinations. On a later turn, those dice are removed to activate the Unit and attack an enemy formation, removing wooden pieces assigned to the formation in question. But the enemy may be able to screen the attack (cancelling it), counterattacking (inflicting extra losses on the attacker), or absorb it via a strategic reserve. In fact, in most cases, the enemy MUST do so if they're able to. The result is a tense cat-and-mouse game in which both players make feints and counterfeints, looking for an advantage and acting decisively once it presents itself.<br/><br/>In this base game, there are eight different scenarios and 84 different formations. The battles included are:<br/><br/>     Bosworth, 1485<br/>     Ivry, 1590<br/>     White Mountain, 1620<br/>     Marston Moor, 1644<br/>     Battle of the Dunes, 1658<br/>     Malplaquet, 1705<br/>     Plains of Abraham, 1759<br/>     Brooklyn Heights, 1776<br/><br/><br/>",

The King has named the feudal lords who will bring glory and prosperity to the conquered lands.  To that end, the nobles will have to hire workers and master craftsmen to make their feuds grow as well as helping in the construction of a glorious cathedral, a symbol of the King&rsquo;s proximity to God.<br/><br/>Feudalia is a deck-building and resource management game for 1-4 players, who will take the roles of the feudal lords of the new lands.  Each player will rule three feuds, and all the vassals living in them, who will work those lands to improve their territories, all of it while trumping your opponent&rsquo;s progress with military incursions into their territories.  But the King wants his share too, and the tax collector will appear frequently, taking part of the resources stored by the players.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first player to earn 10 points.  Players earn points by building, either developing their own feuds or helping in the different phases of the construction of the cathedral.  During a turn, each player plays their vassals from their hand to gather money and resources, to further invest in new workers or new buildings.  Resources can be saved, but be careful! the tax collector will show at your door when you least expect him, and he&rsquo;ll take half your resources from each feud.<br/><br/>Manage your vassals wisely, hire the best master craftsmen, spend your resources in the cathedral before the tax collector arrives, and become the most prosperous feudal lord in Feudalia!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Last Kingdom Board Game is game of war and politics for 2-5 players by renowned designer John D Clair that's based on the Netflix series The Last Kingdom.<br/><br/>In this world, the kingdoms of Britain are at war. Many have already fallen to the invading Danes, leaving the great kingdom of Wessex standing alone and defiant under the command of King Alfred. You are one of the great commanders and politicians in this war-torn land known today as England. Both Saxon and Dane armies openly battle for dominance, and it is up to you to title the scales of power. To claim these lands, you will need to tread a dangerous path between both sides of the conflict. Will you betray your allies for power? What part will you play in the birth of a new nation, and will you ultimately rule it all?<br/><br/>The Last Kingdom Board Game plays over the course of two rounds during which players will perform actions to command armies to shape the course of the war. Your allegiance to the Saxons or the Danes can be firm or fickle, and your score will reflect not just your prowess in battle, but your political skill in maneuvering the competing forces of Britain.<br/><br/>Each of the ten leaders offers unique benefits to your strategy and provides special cards to start your hand. At the start of each round, players complete their hand by drafting cards from a deck specific to that round, then the war begins in one of the five regions. Players take turns playing cards to command Saxon or Dane armies, gaining affinity with the different factions, or positioning their heroes and leaders to shift the tides of war. Players also have access to a rotating market of actions that are available to everyone.<br/><br/>Alternatively, players may choose to not act on their turn and instead pass to see what moves their opponents make.<br/><br/>Once all players have passed consecutively, the war in the current region will be decided by the strengths of the Saxon and Dane armies battling there. Players gain victory points if they are aligned with the winning faction and based on their level of affinity. The focus of the war then moves to the next region, and the battle continues.<br/><br/>After the fate of each of the five regions has been decided, the round ends. After two rounds of play, the player who has accrued the most points wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the 4th Edition with vastly improved contents over previously released versions. There are many differences over the others, with numerous enhancements due to the efforts of these fine folks and countless others.<br/><br/>The best way to see those is to visit the L2 Design Group's website or one of the others that feature this wonderful game. Some of the things that they've done for this is: enlarged the size of the game-board hexes; enlarged the game counters (to 5/8&quot;); enhanced the visual aspects of the graphics; included New Scenarios; allowed for an 'Allied Expeditionary Force' (Variant Counters); provided a New Weather Chart; improved on everything in general; and even included a CD-Rom for game play with others over the 'Net!<br/><br/>There should be no shortage of opponents for those dedicated to supreme Wargame play with this, and it's definitely worth the effort. You will benefit from acquiring a copy of it for the value alone. Those folks at L2 D.G. are planning on releasing even MORE of John Edwards' great game designs and I'll be looking forward to their expertise in producing them as well. Then, maybe, the rest of you folks can reap the pleasure of J.E.'s innovative systems &amp; the improvements he makes to his competitors' games in his earlier releases as much as I have.<br/><br/>The inspiration for Russia Besieged.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Latice is a strategy game where you match tiles by color and shape. The game comes with a game board, stones, and acrylic tiles. Most of the tiles contain one of six images (e.g., turtle, leaf, lizard, dolphin) in one of six colors. There are also a few special wind tiles. The game is for 2-4 players, who will evenly split the tiles. You win by being the first player to play all of your tiles.<br/><br/>The first player selects one tile from their rack and places it in the center square on the board. The next player, and then each in turn, can add one tile to the board, but that tile must be set adjacent to one or more existing tiles, and it must match each adjacent tile based on either color or shape. If you match more than one tile, or you place your tile on one of the sun squares on the board, you get stones that can be traded in for extra moves, allowing you to get rid of your tiles faster. You can also use the special wind tiles to move a tile already on the board over by one square.<br/><br/>As you play Latice, you&rsquo;ll learn to plan your turns and extra moves ahead of time. You&rsquo;ll strategically use wind tiles to alter the layout of the board, and play both offensively and defensively based on your knowledge of the remaining tiles. Latice has no language, culture, age or gender barriers and can be played by just about anyone. It offers strategic gameplay for adults while still being simple enough for younger players.<br/><br/>The DELUXE editions come with nice acrylic tiles instead of simple cardboard pieces.<br/><br/>",

They will quest through an interwoven series of adventure books, and the results of their choices will echo through history: changing the relationships between sovereign nations, usurping kings, creating new waygates, or even locking and unlocking parts of the map.<br/><br/>Change in Trudvang Legends manifests physically as parts of the board actually change, making the actions of previous hero generations affect future sagas. However, the changes are only as permanent as long as history remembers them, which makes the game endlessly replayable, and even playing the same adventure book repeatedly will have a completely different feeling because the world itself has changed.

Marion Crawford, Ave Roma Immortalis, II, IS<br/><br/>Seven centuries of history are contained in this box.<br/><br/>Imperium Romanum II is the game of the Roman Empire -the greatest and most glorious empire the world has ever known. The rules book describes the intricacies of Roman political, economic, and military conflict. The game-map portrays the whole Roman world, from Britannia to Parthia, in exacting detail, and the 800 game counters depict individual legions, fleets, and auxiliary units. The thirty-five scenarios examine every major Roman war, civil and external, through 700 years that shaped the Western World. <br/>Many games claim historical accuracy; players will be astonished at the wealth of historical detail in this one. Many games claim to be playable; players will be very pleased at how elegantly Imperium Romanum II joins scholarly historical concern to an eminently playable game system. In short, Imperium Romanum II is the definitive game of the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>Imperium Romanum II is based on West End Games classic Imperium Romanum. More accurate, informative and attractive maps, an increase in the number of unit colors and types, rules substantially revised with an eye to readability, clarity, and historical accuracy, and the addition of new scenarios (and the elimination of some older ones) are just some of the improvements players will find in this thorough revision.<br/><br/>What You Will Do In Imperium Romanum II <br/>Storm the walls of Rome; plunder provinces; reconquer the Empire; strive for the Imperial purple; war against the Parthians; fight great battles at sea; fight barbarian invasions; mass barbarian hordes to plunder the West; conquer Gaul; cross the Rubicon. <br/>Fight against aristocratic oppression, or for aristocratic stability. Strive to become Rome's absolute ruler, or to defend the republic. <br/>Take the role of Caesar, Pompey, Octavian, Marc Antony, Vespasian, Diocletian, Constantine, Theodosius, Theodoric, Justinian, or Attila the Hun. <br/>&bull; Lead legions, cavalry, horse archers, auxiliaries, and r fleets; distribute donatives to your troops; watch your troops defect because of low morale. <br/>Conspire with other players, and betray them to their foes. <br/>Experience the glory and grandeur that was Rome.<br/><br/>Suitable for solitaire play. <br/>Some of the 35 scenarios provided can be played to completion in 4 hours or less; others could take as long as 100 hours. <br/>Some scenarios permit as many as 6 players; others as few as 2.<br/><br/>Imperium Romanum II includes: <br/>&bull; Two full-color maps, total area 22&quot; x 51&quot;, portraying the entirety of the Roman world at 50 miles per hex. <br/>&bull; 800 full-color counters depicting individual legions, auxiliary units, and leaders. <br/>&bull; One 28-page rule book. <br/>&bull; Two 8-page chart booklets. <br/>&bull; One 48-page scenario book including thirty-five scenarios. <br/>&bull; Dice and counter-tray with lock-on lid.<br/><br/>Design: Albert A.

        "description": "The classic wargame Risk has been updated and revised for 2008. The graphics and components are brand new. Major and minor objectives have been added, along with cities and capitals, plus rewards for completing objectives.<br/><br/>The new version has a drastically changed victory condition: complete three objectives while controlling your capital. This shortens the game playing time to around 90 minutes.<br/><br/>There are three rule sets: Basic Training, Command Room and World Conquest. Basic Training is an introduction to the new Risk rules and includes a pre-existing setup for 3, 4 or 5 players. Command Room adds a randomized setup and rewards for achieving objectives. Both Basic Training and Command Room end when a player controls three objectives. World Conquest is an updated version of the classic Risk game of Global Domination: play continues<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Doodle City is a quick family game of city building. By drawing a network of roads on their play sheet, players are building a city and trying to score points for their hotels, shops and taxis &mdash; all while avoiding pollution.<br/><br/>Working out an ideal road network can be quite the puzzle, so before the game begins roads through parks are randomized, making sure that no two games will be alike. Each round, one white die per player, one additional white die, and a blue die are rolled onto the table. The blue die indicates which column the players must use, while each white die indicates a row. In turn each player picks a white die and draws in the given space. In most spaces you draw roads, but in parks you instead build houses. You can draw only once in each space, and if on your turn you cannot draw, you gain pollution.<br/><br/>A building is scored the moment you draw in its space. For example, when you draw a road through a hotel space, you score points equal to the length of the road passing through that hotel. Shops score according to how many houses are currently connected to the shop. There are also bonuses awarded to the first player who connects a shop to a certain number of houses.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player completes the highest possible hotel or shop score, or when a player loses his last tree due to pollution. Final scores are for connected taxis and for having least/most pollution.<br/><br/>",

The power-hungry Pirate Lords have waited for this chance for a long time and seek to seize his throne. After following the old pirate code mentioning a rum cask, the reckless Julienne &quot;Jolly&quot; Gar&ccedil;on and the eccentric Jack &quot;Roger&quot; Hummingbird were the only ones who could still stand up. The so-called &quot;Double-Boarding&quot; contest shall now determine the winner between the two of them &ndash; and thus the new Pirate King. Prepare to be boarded, you landlubbers!<br/><br/>Jolly &amp; Roger is a card game for two players featuring the well-known &quot;I split, you choose&quot; mechanism. On their turn, a player draws five pirate cards and splits them into two sets. The other player then chooses one of the sets, and the player who split the cards takes the leftover set.<br/><br/>With their pirate cards, players try to board the four merchant ships by adding their matching-colored crew members on their side of the ship. The player who has the most powerful crew on a ship puts one of his captains on the ship (possibly removing the opponent's captain) and may then use further pirate cards of that color to steal gold from the ship. After eight rounds, the game ends. Each player's captain on a ship at the end of the game captures this ship as a bonus. The player with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>Jolly &amp; Roger includes three types of special cards &ndash; the Kraken, the Skeleton Pirate, and Tortuga &ndash; for use in the expert variant to spice up the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Battle of Versailles&quot; was a fashion show held in 1973 in Versailles, France that pitted five American designers against five French designers. The American designers, including Anne Klein, Halston, Oscar de la Renta, Stephen Burrows, and Bill Blass, were considered to be more innovative and less traditional than the French designers: Yves Saint Laurent, Hubert de Givenchy, Emanuel Ungaro, Pierre Cardin, and Christian Dior. The American designers ended up winning the competition and solidifying their place in the fashion world. The event was widely covered in the media, and is considered a turning point in the history of fashion.<br/><br/>In the game The Battle of Versailles, players take the role of either the France or U.S. team, facing one another by playing action cards to show off their best dresses, to attract the most popular celebrities, or to annoy the opponent by spreading bad gossip. They also compete to contribute more than their opponent to the reconstruction of the palace of Versailles.<br/><br/>The French player has five actions per round, representing the classic but overly-long show (2h 30min) that it put on, while the American player has only three actions per round as their show was fresh, innovative, and short (only 37min). Correspondingly, the game has different victory conditions:<br/><br/><br/>     The French team tries to keep its prestige in the fashion industry, while the American team tries to steal the French prestige.<br/>     Both teams fight to control the most influential celebrities in the fashion world.<br/>     The Americans try to show off the best innovative features on their dresses.<br/>     The French try to contribute as much as possible to the reconstruction of Versailles in order to raise their national pride in this beautiful palace.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

But they should make sure they preserve their engine and tires for the last part of the race...<br/><br/>Moving on to the advanced level, the top drivers, besides their driving skills, will have to demonstrate their strategic abilities by choosing the best tires, by deciding between pit stops tactics or long race ones and by identifying the optimum set-up to push the car ahead of all others.<br/><br/>To improve the level of simulation and play, a die is provided to rule superior performance requests, unforeseen events &amp; risky situations: this adds a touch of the unexpected to the Bolide race.<br/><br/>The game comes with multilingual rules (Italian, English, German)<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Bolide Tracks #1: Roma (Italy) and O Copo (Brazil)<br/>    Bolide Tracks #2: Bugeleisenring (Germany) and Tsunami (Japan)<br/><br/><br/>Developed from:<br/><br/>    Racetrack<br/><br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Tacara<br/><br/><br/>",

ASLSK#4 is a self-contained ASL module that gives players the opportunity to start playing Advanced Squad Leader almost immediately.<br/><br/>ASLSK#4 expands on the themes of previous Starter Kits by providing new counters and updated rules featuring a new concept to Starter Kit &ndash; PTO. At the heart of this module are the rules for using the Japanese Imperial forces who fought amongst the jungle and island atolls of the Pacific in terrain completely different from the European Theater of Operations and with tactics different than their European counterparts. In addition to the step-reducing Japanese infantry and new rules for familiar looking terrain, simplified rules for Banzai, concealment, and hand-to-hand close combat are introduced. Neither components nor experience with earlier Starter Kits is necessary to play.<br/><br/>The eight scenarios and three mapboards cover actions between the U.S. forces (Marines and Army) that opposed the Imperial Japanese Army on the islands of the Pacific and in the exotic China-Burma-India theater. From Guadalcanal to Myitkiyina to the big island of Luzon in the Philippines, these forces fought to the death from 1942 to 1945.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fire in the East covers the war in the Soviet Union from the start of the Barbarossa invasion in June 1941 through the end of the Soviet winter counteroffensive in March 1942. It requires two players, with one player controlling the German and German-allied (Rumanian, Finnish, etc.) forces and the other controlling the various Soviet forces: regular troops, militia divisions,and Guards formations. The size of the game makes it well suited to team play: each side can easily be played by a team of two or three players.<br/><br/>Fire in the East's 6 multi-color maps stretch from Warsaw to Stalingrad, from Murmansk to Sevastopol. Terrain is analyzed in detail, with over 20 different types, including two types of rivers, forests, and mountains and four types of cities.<br/>There are over 2500 counters each marked with its historical designation - the most accurate and detailed order of battle ever published for the Eastern Front. The counters represent divisions, and independent brigades, regiments, and battalions. Units are highly differentiated by type, from armor, infantry, and artillery to Soviet Guards, NKVD, and katyushas, German flammpanzers and railroad artillery, and Finnish ski troops. Air units vary from outmoded I-15 biplane fighters to the Me-109F, from Ju 87 Stukas and Il-2 Sturmoviks to Pe-8 long-range bombers. The capital ships of the Soviet Baltic and Black Sea fleets are also represented.<br/><br/>The rules include extensive armor and antitank effects, plus special capabilities for many other unit types, from assault engineers to paratroopers. Every combat arm has its own abilities and limitations, and the players must use them all to achieve victory. The air system is very detailed - almost a game in itself. Logistics rules cover the different gauges of German and Soviet rails and allow supply lines to be extended temporarily by trucks. Isolated units gradually lose their combat abiliites and then collapse, but those besieged in cities and fortresses survive longer. Other important rules cover weather effects, the unique nature of the Arctic front, the need for artillery support, the German surprise attack, doctrinal limits of Soviet mechanized units, and more.<br/><br/>Fire in the East is extremely challenging to both sides. German panzer spearheads can break through the front almost at will, but soon will find themselves outrunning their supply lines, infantry, and air support. Careful play and the optimum use of all arms are needed to travel the long road to Moscow. The Soviets are faced with the need to preserve their army for the final defense of major cities while delaying the German advance to make that defense possible by determined resistance and carefully chosen local counterattacks.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    six 21&quot; x 27&quot; maps (1B, 2A, 3B, 4A, 5B, 6A)<br/>    over 2880 die-cut counters (Europa 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42)<br/>    a complete set of rules<br/>    a complete set of charts<br/>    two dice<br/><br/><br/>(source: back of the box and user's description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spring, 1805<br/>Napoleon&rsquo;s Grande Armee&rsquo; is encamped along the shores of the English Channel. Following the teachings of Alexander, the French Emperor seeks to defeat a naval power from the land. He has but to place his 200,000 troops on British soil and France&rsquo;s hereditary enemy will finally fall. To do this, his combined fleet must control the Channel long enough for hundreds of shallow draft boats to ferry his troops to England. Standing in the Emperor&rsquo;s way is the Royal Navy.<br/><br/>The year 1805, which is punctuated by the British naval victory at Trafalgar, represents one of England&rsquo;s darkest times during the Napoleonic Wars. Her great &ldquo;wooden walls&rdquo; offer the island nation its only defense against a far superior foe.<br/><br/>1805: Sea of Glory examines the naval war on an operational level during that pivotal year. Although Trafalgar shines through history as the beacon of victory, it is the successful blockade of enemy ports that kept French boats from stepping onto British soil. But 1805: Sea of Glory is more than just a game about blockade duty. It is a game of breakout and pursuit, deception and false leads, husbanding meager resources, striking a blow where your enemy least suspects, and bringing about the decisive battle that defines victory or defeat.<br/><br/>1805: Sea of Glory focuses on the operational actions of the three great navies. The Allied player (France &amp; Spain) must constantly try to break out of numerous European ports and form a combined fleet. The British player must continuously worry about his ships on station, as wind and weather allow the enemy an opening to slip anchor and set sail. For when Napoleon&rsquo;s fleets take flight, the British are hard pressed to cover all the potential targets and bring the enemy to bear. The British player will find that he never has enough frigates to watch all avenues of escape, and that a clever French player can keep him guessing and ultimately win this game of cat and mouse.<br/><br/>The game uses blocks to represent the fog of war. The ability to spot and intercept your enemy is paramount. But is that block scurrying across the Mediterranean towards Egypt the French fleet? Or has the Toulon squadron turned west towards the Caribbean? From the French perspective, is the block off the coast of Brest a fleet? Or have the British returned home to repair and refit, leaving only a few frigates to watch the port? Is now the moment to sortie? Or does a large enemy force lay just over the horizon?<br/><br/>While blocks represent fleets, squadrons, and scouting frigates, traditional counters represent the individual ships of the line. Every ship that could have seen duty, from lowly 64 gunners to the massive Santissima Trinidad, is present. Individual ships are kept on off map organizational charts, so that the exact composition of a fleet or squadron block is not known to your opponent until interception takes place.<br/><br/>The great naval commanders of the age are present in the game as well. Rosily-Mesros, Villeneuve, Ganteaume, Missiessy, and Gravina for the Allied fleets. Cornwallis, Nelson, Calder, Collingwood, and Strachan for the British. Each admiral is rated for his ability to escape or pursue, as well as, his tactical acumen in combat. Special abilities are also included: from Cornwallis&rsquo; skill as an administrator, to Villeneuve&rsquo;s fatalistic bent, to Gravina&rsquo;s charisma, to Nelson&rsquo;s visionary brilliance brought to life as the &ldquo;Nelson Touch&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map covers the North Atlantic from the Channel Coast to Africa, and the Mediterranean from the Straits of Gibraltar to Egyptian shores. An insert map covers the West Indies. Each hex represents 50 nautical miles. An Atlantic transit track handles fleets and squadrons sailing from Europe to the Caribbean and back. The major ports of the three belligerents are shown; each rated for harbor facilities and their effect on a fleet&rsquo;s ability to sortie.<br/><br/>Weather also plays a huge part in the game. Storms and squalls will blow blockading forces off station, allowing the Allied player the opportunity to escape. While at sea, fleets and squadrons are at the mercy of the wind. True to any age of sail game, fleets may become becalmed at the worst possible moment. Prevailing winds are also noted on the map, resulting in interesting strategic options. A player that learns to anticipate and utilize the game&rsquo;s weather system will have the advantage. Beware being caught at sea in the Windward or Leeward Islands during hurricane season.<br/><br/>Each individual ship is rated for its firepower and morale. The Allied player will cringe as his Spanish ships strike their colors early in a battle, while the steadfast Jack Tars of the Royal Navy will never seem to falter. But despite their superiority at sea, the British are not invincible, and a shrewd French player will find ways to thwart his enemy. Fire high and disable the British so that you can slip away, or stand hull to hull and exchange broadsides?<br/><br/>A unique tactical combat system rewards fleets that seize the weather gauge. Each player has a selection of tactics chits which represent flag signals sent to his ships during battle. Choose the right combination of maneuver and sail settings to break the enemy line. Take the leeward position and attempt to escape before the windward fleet can close. Or from the leeward, turn and fight, creating a gauntlet of fire an overly aggressive enemy must endure. A Trafalgar sized battle can be fought out in less than 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Although the game ends immediately in a French victory if the Allied fleet ever controls the English Channel, there is also a set of variable victory conditions. The British Admiralty must watch out for French invasions of Egypt, Malta, Naples, Ireland, or West Indies islands. The British player will quickly learn that he never has enough ships to cover every potential threat.<br/><br/>A series of random events rounds out the simulation. Napoleon&rsquo;s meddling, British manpower shortages, West Indies fever, Spanish drafts, favorable winds, and Royalist spies are among some of the events that will hinder or help players achieve victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nothing Gained But Glory will be the fifth volume from the award winning Musket &amp; Pike Battles Series. It features several pivotal battles in Baltic region of the late 17th century - a period where rulers struggled to centralize power in their realms and to introduce permanent standing armies instead of expensive mercenary forces. It shows the highly trained and well led army of Sweden struggling to defend its massive gains from the Thirty Years War and the Northern Wars of 1655-1661 against the forces of Denmark and Brandenburg, reinforced by contingents from Austria, the United Provinces, M&uuml;nster, Hesse-Kassel and Poland.<br/><br/>The personalities in the game include the great Swedish warrior king Carl XI, Brandenburg&acute;s Frederick William (the Great Elector), and King Christian V of Denmark-Norway. Never before have so many monarchs been in one M&amp;P box!<br/><br/>Nearly all the scenarios in this module are smaller than the typical Musket &amp; Pike scenarios, and thus take less time and space to play. For the same reasons it is a great introductory game to the series.<br/><br/>The Historical Background<br/><br/>The Scanian War was prompted by the Franco-Dutch War of 1672-1678. Sweden had allied with France against several European countries, and was eventually forced to fulfill her treaty obligations to France by invading Brandenburg. This invasion was an attempt to force Brandenburg to withdraw from the fighting against France, but the invasion was conducted without the usual energy and force of previous Swedish offensives. When the Brandenburg Army returned home much faster than anticipated the Swedes started to withdraw, but were caught by the Brandenburgers and defeated at the battle of Fehrbellin on June 28th 1675. The previously &quot;unbeatable&quot; Swedish Army had lost a battle, and this key event soon persuaded others to join the war.<br/><br/>Most notable of these was Denmark, which saw its chance to regain the Scanian lands lost in the Northern Wars. (Scania is the southern tip of Sweden, just across the Oeresund, the Sound, from Denmark.) After mopping up the Swedish possessions of Wismar and Bremen, the Danish Army landed in Scania on June 29, 1676. Danish King Christian V led 15,000 troops against a defending Swedish Army of 5,000 men that were spread out over the province. Initially the operation was a great success. Large parts of the local peasantry sided with Denmark and the outnumbered Swedish troops were in bad shape. Town after town fell into the hands of the Danes and the Swedes had to retreat north to Sweden proper. After a month only the fortified town of Malm&ouml; remained under Swedish control. At sea the situation wasn&acute;t any better for the Swedes, as their navy lost several battles against the combined Danish- Dutch Navy, and left the command of the sea in the hands of the allies.<br/><br/>Two factors helped to save Sweden from ruin: the splendid courage of their young king who resolutely and successfully kept the Danish invaders at bay, and the diplomatic activity of Louis XIV, the French king.<br/><br/>The first ray of light for the Swedish cause came with the battle of Halmstad in August 1675 when the king succeeded in outmaneuvering and destroying a small Danish force sent north to take Halmstad and link up with the forces operating out from Norway. As the Swedish Army slowly grew larger it became possible to meet the Danish main army head on, and the Swedes were victorious at the battles of Lund in December 1676 and Landskrona in June 1677. These battles caused the fighting to stalemate on the Scanian front, as the Danish could supply and reinforce their coastal fortresses by sea, but didn&acute;t dare venture inland to meet the Swedish Army in a field battle again.<br/><br/>The focus of the war therefore shifted to the German front once again, where the Brandenburg Army was slowly conquering the Swedish fortresses and fortified cities one by one. The Danish Army sent an expeditionary force to the island of R&uuml;gen and captured it, but lost it again in January 1678 after a winter of horrid attrition, when the Swedes returned to the island once more and defeated them in the battle of Warksow. Later in 1678 the Allies would take R&uuml;gen once more, and eventually all the Swedish possessions in Germany were lost.<br/><br/>Events in Western Europe would once again have far reaching effects on the Baltic as the end of the Franco-Dutch war in 1678 gave France the power to force an end to the Scanian War and dictate the peace treaties of Fontainebleau. These treaties restored almost all the Swedish possessions lost during the war, and so the end result was truly &ldquo;Nothing Gained but Glory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The 7 battles included in Nothing Gained but Glory are:<br/><br/>Nyborg, November 14, 1659 - (While not part of the Scanian War, this bonus battle from the Northern War of 1655-1660 features many of the same participants.) The Swedes had occupied the Danish island of F&uuml;nen, but following the landings of two Allied forces and their subsequent combination the Swedes had to fight to win time for an evacuation from the island. With no more room to retreat and the port town of Nyborg&acute;s fortifications in a sorry state, the 7,000 strong Swedish Army positioned itself in good defensive terrain between a lake and a forest. While command difficulties in the 11,000 strong Allied Army almost cost them the battle, the Allies eventually prevailed, forcing the Swedish Army to flee to Nyborg, where it surrendered the next day.<br/><br/>Fehrbellin, June 28, 1675 - Returning from fighting against France to face the Swedish invasion, the highly mobile Brandenburg Army of 5,600 cavalry and 13 guns faced a retreating Swedish Army of 7,000 infantry, 4,000 cavalry and 7 guns outside the town of Fehrbellin. A poor deployment of the Swedish Army combined with aggressive handling of the Brandenburg cavalry forced the Swedes from the field. Although the losses in the battle were about equal, the Swedish Army was severely reduced by the subsequent pursuit, raiding peasant guerilla, desertion, and starvation. While only of minor importance militarily, the victory had an enormous psychological impact: the Swedes, long considered &quot;unbeatable&quot;, had been bested. With the myth of Swedish invincibility broken, Denmark decided the time was right to settle its scores with Sweden and entered the war. Frederick William henceforth was known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot; and the army that he and Derfflinger had led to victory became the core of the future famous Prussian Army.<br/><br/>Halmstad, August 17, 1676 - After the initial great successes for the Danish forces following the landings in Scania in late June 1676, a small Danish force of 3,500 men under Jacob Duncan was detached from the main army and ordered to advance north to take the town of Halmstad and if possible link up with the Norwegian forces under General Gyldenl&oslash;ve. Sensing the possibility of destroying the unsupported Danish detachment, the Swedish king reacted and by heavy force marching succeeded in cutting off Duncan from his line of communications, forcing him to fight his way back. Duncan moved against the Swedes, but then went on the defensive. The Swedes took the initiative, collapsed both of the Danish flanks, and then overwhelmed the center, forcing the army to surrender. This battle ended the Danish plans of linking up with the Norwegians, and provided a much-needed boost to Swedish morale.<br/><br/>Lund, December 4, 1676 - This was the bloodiest battle in the history of Scandinavia, with almost 9,000 killed (out of 12,000 Danes and 8,000 Swedes) after an intense day-long battle fought in the chilling cold of the Scandinavian winter. After a cross-river standoff that lasted for a month, the Swedes attacked when the river froze. The Swedes initially had the advantage, and their right wing (along with the king) routed the Danish left and pursued it off the field. The rest of the Swedish Army was then outnumbered, and just as they were about to succumb, the king and part of his wing showed up in the Danish rear, saving the battle for the Swedes.<br/><br/>Malm&ouml;, June 25-26, 1677 - Malm&ouml;, the regional capital of Scania, was the only major town that didn&acute;t fall during the 1676 Danish offensive, and had been a thorn in the Danish side ever since. In June 1677 the Danes decided to take the town by besieging it.<br/>When news arrived that the Swedish Navy had set sail to break the blockade of the town and that the Swedish Army was moving to relieve the town, the Danes decided to force the issue and storm the town, even though the siege hadn&acute;t progressed very far. On the Swedish side, the town commander Fabian Fersen prepared his 2,300 strong garrison well, and they fought with desperate courage as they knew it was victory or death. While the Danes were able to scale the wall and break into the city, a determined Swedish counterattack destroyed them before they could open the gates for more Danish troops.<br/>(This is a medium sized battle on a half map with various special rules to reflect the many special circumstances of storming a fortified town at night.)<br/><br/>Landskrona, July 14, 1677 - After the defeat of the Danish Army at Malm&ouml;, the Swedish king decided the time was right to attack them before they could be reinforced by their German and Austrian allies. He thus moved his 10,000 regulars and 4,000 peasant militia towards the Danish Army located at Landskrona. However, the Danes had received their reinforcements that replenished their numbers to 14,000, and the Danish king felt confident about fighting a field battle. This was a hard-fought battle which saw both armies experimenting with combined arms wings and the personal involvement of the monarchs of both armies.<br/><br/>Warksow, January 18, 1678 - As the war had reached a stalemate on the Scanian front the Danish forces invaded the island of R&uuml;gen in the fall of 1677. They quickly conquered most of the island except for a small Swedish fortified bridgehead. As supplies ran low and attrition ravaged the army, large parts of the Danish expedition were withdrawn from the island, leaving just under 5,000 men. This allowed the Swedes to transfer 3,500 men from their field army in Germany to the remaining bridgehead in early January 1678 and try to take back the island. The armies met at Warksow, where a Swedish cannonade killed the commander of the Danish Army, paralyzing it. Most of the Danish expeditionary force was captured during the battle or in the aftermath as the Swedes quickly cleared R&uuml;gen.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 series rulebook<br/>1 playbook<br/>3 countersheets<br/>2 2.5 map sheets, 2 of which are backprinted<br/>1 10-sided die<br/>3 Player Aid Cards<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late 19th century, the Russian government commissioned a project to build a railroad that would connect Moscow in the west with Vladivostok in the east. You and your fellow players are buying shares of the railroads that will expand across Russia, attempting to enrich yourself along the way and not lose control of railroads to the Tsar!<br/><br/>Trans-Siberian Railroad &mdash; originally one of three titles in Winsome Games' 2015 Essen Set &mdash; shares some similarities with older Winsome titles in which the rail network is already printed on the board and individual railroad companies purchase the links that are printed. Four companies (Red, Blue, Green, and Yellow) are active at the start of the game, with one share of each company auctioned to the players in that order to provide starting capital for those companies. The winner of each auction chooses an unoccupied link from Moscow to another city; each link has a value listed in it, and the railroad's initial income is set to this value.<br/><br/>Once the game begins, on a turn you can:<br/><br/>&bull; Buy stock, specifically one share in one company or one share each in two different companies; the money paid is placed in the railroad's treasury, and when you buy two shares, you must pay an additional $4 to one of the two companies.<br/><br/>&bull; Build links, specifically one link, two links, or one external link (i.e. to a location on Russia's border) &mdash; but only if the railroad is public (i.e., at least two shares have been purchased) and you hold at least as many shares in that railroad as each other player. (If a railroad has had only one share of stock purchased, it is private.) You can build direct links that extend that railroad's existing network or you can jump another railroad's links to extend the network in a more convoluted way. When you build two links, the second link must start from where the first link built that turn ended. The cost to build an internal link is $4, and if you jump another railroad's links, you must pay $2 to that railroad's treasury; the cost to build an external link is $8, plus $4 to each railroad per link you jumped.<br/><br/>When you build a link, the value of that link &mdash; 2-6 &mdash; is added to that railroad's income. Each time a railroad's income marker lands on or passes over a black mark on the income track, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level. Additionally, when you build two links or an external link, that railroad's stock value is bumped up one level.<br/><br/>&bull; Pass.<br/><br/>When you buy two shares, build two links, build one external link, or pass, you move the timing token one space on the timing track. When this token reaches the end of the track, each railroad pays dividends to those who hold stock in it, with the railroad's income being divided by the number of shares owned, then rounded up. If Red has $11 income and you own two shares and another player owns one, then you receive $8 and the other player $4.<br/><br/>After paying out dividends (and re-setting the timing token to 0), if any railroad has a stock value of at least $48, then the game enters phase 2, which starts with an auction for a share of the black and white railroads, with the winner of each auction claiming any one non-external link for that railroad that connects to another railroad's network.<br/><br/>In phase 2, once you pay out dividends, you check to see whether any railroad's stock value is equal to or less than the nationalization value, which starts at $24 and which increases after each dividend payout in phase 1, each failure to auction a railroad's share at the start of either phase, and each dividend payout in phase 2 during which no railroads were nationalized. If a railroad's stock value is less than the nationalization value, that railroad is nationalized, with each owner of its stock getting one final dividend payment, after which all shares of that railroad are removed from the game. Once all nationalizations are complete, the nationalization value is increased three levels for each nationalization that took place.<br/><br/>If at this point any railroad has a stock value of $75 or the dividend marker has reached the end of the track, the game ends; otherwise players continue playing. When the game ends, players sum the value of the stocks they hold in public railroads with any money they have on hand. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's early on July 1st, 1863, and Union Brigadier General John Buford&rsquo;s 1st Reserve Cavalry Division is deployed to the west of the town of Gettysburg battling unidentified Confederate infantry advancing on the town.  All morning long, the men in gray have pressured the Union cavalry. Help finally arrives in the form of I Corps commander Major Gen. John Reynolds. He rides up to the Lutheran Seminary, where Buford is directing the battle from its cupola. Reynolds calls to Buford, &quot;What goes, John?&quot; The cavalryman simply points to the long lines of advancing Confederates and says, &quot;The Devil's to pay!&quot; Reynolds then asks, &quot;Can you hold?&quot;, to which Buford responds, &quot;I reckon I can.&quot; Reynolds ends the exchange with, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s ride out and see all about it.&quot; And with that rather brief, mundane conversation began one of the most important and iconic military engagements in history &ndash; the Battle of Gettysburg.<br/><br/>A Most Fearful Sacrifice is an epic two-player wargame with over 15 square feet of playing area and 526 playing pieces depicting the fighting that occurred during all three days of this decisive clash. The game utilizes a new ACW operating system called the Black Swan system, which is closely related to the popular Blind Swords game system first introduced in the game The Devil&rsquo;s To Pay! by Tiny Battle Publishing. This version of the system is specifically designed to handle larger-scale battles yet keep rules overhead low. Players can simulate huge encounters in a reasonable amount of playing time. This is accomplished in one way through the use of card draws rather than chit pulls. Also, players will trigger activations by Corps instead of by lower-level formations but they still have tactical decision-making choices by needing to determine which Divisions get activation priority. Though at a grander scale, this system maintains a tactical feel about it and still emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of war &hellip; the Fortunes of War, the Friction of War and the Fog of War. Players will be challenged to deal with a constantly developing battle situation, never quite sure of what the Gods of War will throw at them, and thus they must always be prepared to deal with historically realistic &ldquo;black swan&rdquo; events.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Age of Thieves is a fantasy board game of strategy and adventure set in Hadria, a port metropolis located on the northern fringes of a mighty Empire. Each player becomes a master thief about to commit the most daring burglary of his career. During the game players may use unique abilities of their thieves as well as various action cards, which represent maneuvers, alchemical potions or complicated devices inspired by visionary ideas of Renaissance inventors. The players choose cards to play and then use available Action Points to plan the order of their activities. This makes the game very dynamic, with each resolved action dramatically influencing the turn. The players&rsquo; order changes dynamically depending on the number of Action Points placed on each chosen card.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to break into the vault inside the Emperor's palace and steal the Emperors' Jewel, the symbol of power very precious to the ruling dynasty. However, this is hardly the end, because thieves must escape from the city with their loot. This is no easy task - the streets are patrolled by vigilant city guards and veteran captains well versed in all criminal tricks. Additionally, time is running fast for the thieves - event cards introduced each turn control the flow of the game, escalating its pace and difficulty of challenges for the players to overcome.<br/><br/>The thief who will manage to escape through one of four city gates taking with him the Emperors&rsquo; Jewel or other valuable loot will be the winner of the game. Anyone who will stay inside Hadria after resolving the last event card will be caught and mercilessly thrown inside the city dungeon, their names erased from the annals of the omnipotent Guild.<br/><br/>",

That's the spirit driving your actions in Dollars to Donuts, mostly because the customers in your donut shop will not want to purchase half-donuts that will undoubtedly be stale on their open ends.<br/><br/>To set up the game, place four 1x1 starting tiles on the 6x6 game board that represents your donut shop and take five &quot;dollar&quot; tiles from the bag; on their back side, dollar tiles have either a half donut (plain, chocolate, sprinkle) or a set of donut holes (again in the three flavors). The starting tiles depict half donuts in these three flavors<br/><br/>On a turn, you can purchase a 1x4 donut tile that depicts half donuts along its edges from the six available tiles for a cost of $0-5. You then add this tile to your shop &mdash; with some of the tile hanging off the edge of the board if you wish &mdash; ideally lining up the half donuts on that tile with those already on your board. If you make a matching donut, i.e., putting two sprinkle halves together, then you take a sprinkle scoring token; if you make a non-matching donut, i.e. a plain half combined with a chocolate half, then you draw a dollar tile from the supply bag. Note, however, that jelly donuts give no dollar tile if paired with a non-jelly donut because who in the world would reward something like that?<br/><br/>To end your turn, you can place a dollar tile on your shop board to complete a donut (and score) or fill a space with donut holes (which might also score). Additionally, you can serve a customer in line by offering them scoring tokens that match their desired donuts, which will earn you more points than the tokens on their own.<br/><br/>When one player has filled every space in their shop or the donut tiles run out, the game ends, with you scoring for satisfied customers, neighborhoods served, donuts still on hand, and donut hole pairs in the shop, while losing points for empty spaces in your shop. The player with the highest score clearly has the most popular shop in town!<br/><br/>",

As well-to-do citizens in Mercado, gamers wander around the stalls, always on the lookout for special items to enhance their reputation.

Each player has a personal bag containing different coins. On a turn, you draw three coins from it blind and place them at the market tables of your choice. If a player has paid all the necessary coins of a product, they receive the board and thereby increase their reputation. Some tablets bring extra privileges or seals, others bring counterfeit money that might wander into a bag. Who can buy the most valuable goods?<br/><br/>",

They praise their king Balor, who reigns from his fortifications in the north with an iron fist. Old paths and ruins spread over the island's face, which will be called Ireland many generations from now. But new tribes arrive at the island striving for permanent presence. Who will control &Eacute;rin's fate over the next centuries to come?<br/><br/>Each player in The Arrival represents a tribe leader who tries to gain predominance over the mythical island of &Eacute;rin while pushing back the demon-like Fomori. But the players are facing a dilemma, for spreading too quickly means becoming more and more corrupt and strengthening the Fomori in their power...<br/><br/>Over 4-6 rounds, the players determine their resources by means of a unique game mechanism, which will be used later on profitably. During a first phase (Earning Phase), players draw four cards, each showing three sections of different resources. Two of these sections are gradually blocked by the player, thus leaving one section. The resources shown on this section are the ones the player gets. During this phase, they have to decide which section is the best one; while the upper section of the cards offers many resources, it also results in unwanted Corruption Points. The middle and the lower sections offer fewer resources, but also less Corruption.<br/><br/>After that, the Action Phase takes place and the players must use their resources wisely while having the choice from different kinds of actions in order to get Fame Points.<br/><br/>The game ends when a certain number of rounds have been played or somebody reaches the corruption limit.<br/><br/>The winner is either the one with the highest amount of Fame Points or the one with the fewest Corruption Points. This depends on the scene of the board at the end: Do the tribes (players) control more locations on &Eacute;rin than the Fomori do &mdash; or is it the other way around?<br/><br/>",

While you begin armed only with basic combat maneuvers, you will add new, more powerful cards to your deck as you go, with the goal of defeating as many Stage Bosses as you can.<br/><br/>Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Villains, Heroes, Equipment, Super Powers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &quot;Line-Up&quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player will always have five cards to choose from each turn, so every turn there are new options and new surprises.<br/><br/>When a player has amassed enough Power, he may attempt to defeat the current Stage Boss. When a Stage Boss is attacked, it retaliates against the attacker! With Street Fighter, the action is often one-on-one. Players can defend themselves with Defense cards like Chun-Li's Bracelets and Electric Thunder. Each player also has access to a special Ultra card that is one of his character's signature maneuvers. In the end, the player who has accumulated the most Victory Points from the cards in his deck wins.<br/><br/>",

To become the Necromancer King, you have to master dark magic, raise an army of undead minions, explore festering dungeons, and research ancient artifacts and spells.<br/><br/>Rise of the Necromancers is an evil strategy game for 2-5 players, in which each player controls a Necromancer struggling for absolute dominance. Rise of the Necromancers is based on a classic fantasy narrative with character development as well as territorial strategy. The objective of the game is to develop your Necromancer and take control of the lands. Each player starts out as an aspiring Necromancer who can study spells, craft artifacts and eventually graduate from one of four academies. In time, your Necromancer can attract their own apprentice and assemble an undead army of minions to rule the lands.<br/><br/>Your Necromancer can venture into dungeons where they will encounter wonders and dangerous creatures &mdash; and perhaps meet new companions. In the end, your Necromancer might be able to return to their academy and become Headmaster &mdash; or even seize the foulest of thrones as the Necromancer King.<br/><br/>Each player moves their miniature Necromancer around the game board to gather resources, spells and artifacts, enter dungeons, battle cities and fight rival Necromancers. Throughout the game, Necromancers can increase their combat and movement abilities as they amass their armies. A Necromancer's minions can also be left behind to protect conquered cities and dungeons.<br/><br/>In addition to the game's territorial component, the players compete in collecting spells, artifacts and minions affiliated with the four academies. Enough elements of the same color can make you Headmaster of an academy. The game has a varying starting set-up, so no two games are ever the same.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Basilica, a game for 2 players, presents the duel of two medieval master masons who are ordered to build a medieval cathedral together. Players are planning cathedral layout and overseeing work at the construction site in tandem, in the same time trying to gain advantage over the opposite player.<br/><br/>The temple is built by laying square tiles adjacent to the board or already built tiles. Tiles form the plan of the cathedral. These tiles, distinguished by four colors, represent different elements of the cathedral. The pool of tiles available to players is random. Later, the players place pawns on the tiles &ndash; these pawns are the teams of builders: foremen, masons and carpenters, who will make the design a reality.<br/><br/>The players strive to achieve two goals: to lay their cathedral tiles so as to create the largest possible areas representing a single color, and to have more pawns in these areas than their opponent.<br/><br/>Every tile bears also one special action that could be played instead of adding a tile to the cathedral. Using these actions player may move pawns from tile to tile, promote them (increasing their value) or manipulate the tiles. Execution of specific order excludes the tile from being used as part of cathedral, so choice between expanding the edifice and making some action is strategic. Planning and optimal use of available resources is important, as both participants share the same selection of tiles. Thus, tiles and actions shown on them not used by the player in her or his turn become immediately available to his opponent.<br/><br/>Some tiles trigger movement of a special King pawn, which moves along the scoring track. Every few moves, the King pawn comes to a space indicating a royal visit to the cathedral. During each royal visit, the progress of work is assessed and Victory Points are assigned to the players. The number of VPs each player is awarded depends on the size and number of the areas controlled by their pawns at the moment of scoring. The more areas the player controls, and the bigger these are, the greater the reward for the player. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has claimed more Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kings of War is the miniatures wargame from Mantic Games. Designed to go along with the accompanying 28mm Fantasy Ranges the game features players maneuvering large blocks of miniature soldiers around the battlefield in search of victory.<br/><br/>Kings of War is a new concept for mass battle miniature wargaming &mdash; a game that is both easy to learn and fast to play! With few and simple rules, there is little to get in the way of the fun and slaughter. Kings of War is a challenging game of strategy, where you can pit your wits against your opponent without devoting half of your brain power to remember a plethora of convoluted rules.<br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s not all, the innovative turn structure allows you to play Kings of War using a time-keeping tool (like a stopwatch or a chess clock) to time your moves. As the seconds tick away, the pressure and excitement this adds makes 'Kings of War' unlike any other large-scale wargame you&rsquo;ve ever played before.<br/><br/>Units are given simple ratings such as 'Melee Attack', 'Defense' and 'Nerve' and then augmented with special abilities that characterize the different fantasy races that inhabit the world. In 2015, the &quot;beta&quot; rules were updated and a full ruleset was released. Abbreviated rules are downloadable from Mantic's website, and extracts (about 70%) from the full army lists for all factions are also available for download, called &quot;starter lists&quot;. Currently army lists exist for Elves, Dwarves, Kingdoms of Men (medieval humans), Basileans (clerical army with saints and angels), Forces of Nature (Treemen, Dryads and other assorted forest creatures), Forces of the Abyss (devils and demons), Abyssal (evil) Dwarves, Goblins, Orcs, Ogres, Twilight Kin (evil elves) and the Undead hordes. <br/>Additional factions lists are now available in the &quot;Uncharted Empires&quot; supplement: The Brotherhood (high medieval and mystical humans with elementals), Salamander (humanoid lizards), The Herd (satyrs... ok: beast-men), The League of Rhordia (fantasy renaissance humans and halflings), The Trident Realms of Neritica (tritons/ fishmen), The Empire of Dust (aegyptian undead... yes, kings from tombs), Night-Stalker Armies (spirits, ghosts and the like), Ratkin Armies (ska... er, scavenger ratmen) and the Varangur (chao...tic warriors).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to A World at War, an immersive exploration of the grand strategies of the Second World War. With roots tracing back to the classic Third Reich, and its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War pushes this gaming system even further, expanding on the detail and choices of what was already a fine family of wargames.<br/><br/><br/>A World at War--the game that brings you everything in one meaty box, a far-ranging battlefield where marines and paratroopers slog it out with infantry and armor; where carriers and submarines spar with cruisers and battlewagons; where army planes and carrier planes crisscross the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide what to build, and you decide where to deploy it. Will this corps storm across Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes patrol The Steppes, or hunt the shores of the Med? Choose carefully--for in A World at War, the deployment of troops is crucial. But don't go thinking armaments comprise the only battlefield. The struggle extends deep into other arenas, like into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy, and into your skunk works, through research, and behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not just in drop tanks and detonators, but also in spy rings and wool parkas. Most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you'll tend to obsess over mistakes, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk. But now isn't the time for recriminations--now is the time for action! Will you gamble and surge-research the atomic bomb? Or will you take the exigency--less glitzy and less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? Whatever you decide, decide carefully, for this is bare-knuckled warfare not only across land, sea, and air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on lab benches and in diplomatic pouches. With so many elements in play, can winning strategies ever be more than a cobble or winning choices ever more than an anguish? It's a question only you can answer. But whatever your approach, if you hang on long enough to unleash your final hoard of weapons in one last grand assault, you just may earn that rare chance to annihilate armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players play cards to collect trade goods and at the same time influence the price of these trade goods. The player who earns the most money becomes the trading partner of the rich merchant Jakob Fugger and wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Cards 1-9 are placed clockwise; these are the Market, and indicate the prices of 5 commodities. A marker (card) for each commodity is placed in the 5 position. The Jakob the Rich card is set close by. Players each get a hand of cards.<br/><br/>Players rotate taking turns. On your turn, you draw a card if you have &lt;4 cards. Then, play a card face up. The first 2 turns, you may play 1 card each round face down _in addition_ to the face up card. At the end of each round, draw a card from the draw deck and add to Jakob's area. Any time a commodity card is played face up (on your turn, or for Jakob), count all the cards of that type face up on the board. The turn ends if there are 5 of that type: score, and start again unless someone got to 100  points. If so, reveal and score all hidden commodities and score them (below). If starting the next round, first deal 2 more cards to everyone; players who played 1 merchant get 2 more cards (total 4); those who played 2 merchants get 3 more (total 7). Play continues with the player who would have played next.<br/><br/>End of Turn Scoring: First, count how many cards there are for each of the 5 commodities. The top 3 will move clockwise in the Market, one step for each card played. If any commodity would move past 1, it stops at 1. All other commodities move counterclockwise (down) ONE space (but not past the '1' value). Each player adds up the value of the cards they've played. If any commodity has &lt;3 total cards played, those commodities marked with a rose count as double value.<br/><br/>End of Game Scoring: all hidden cards are revealed and score double their current Market value (ignore roses)<br/><br/>",

Each player builds his own unique harbor and tries to reach the highest combination of money and prestige by the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each round, players are trying to get the most influence on the action fields they want to use. Since you place your influence cards face down, you have to watch closely what the other players might want to do. (You can even place more than one card on one spot.) The options are varied: Get a new ship with new goods into your harbor, close a new contract, change the values of the four different goods, improve your influence card-hand, expand your harbor, buy a new building, or simply rise in the nautical ranks to get more money. But you have to be careful: Every ship and every contract will stay in your harbor only for a short while. (The transporters and trains are waiting!) If you fail to coordinate the incoming and outgoing goods, you might have to pay penalty for not fulfilling a contract!<br/><br/>Bremerhaven ends after a defined number of rounds, and the rules include both a short version and solo rules. Visually the game will be in the vein of Le Havre.<br/><br/>",

HMB reproduces that phenomena using a simple set of easy-to-implement qualities. The result is story-line drama that we think you'll find to be quite entertaining and captivating--but which doesn't bog down play, or require copious book-keeping!<br/><br/>HISTORY MAKER BASEBALL expands the scope of the game to include events &quot;outside the innings&quot; which rightly affect what happens during the game. The pitching coach wants to talk &quot;privately&quot; to you about yesterday's starter. Here's the trainer with an injury report. Comments this morning from an outraged local sports talk host will have to be dealt with. The front office can be fickle--maybe they'll give you a &quot;vote of confidence,&quot; or perhaps bungle a player negotiation, and you'll have to clean up the mess. All these are real factors in real baseball, and it's built-in to be a real part of HMB as well.<br/><br/>This baseball board game offers a universe of managerial choices that includes classic baseball strategy and at the same time supersedes it, expanding into the realm of baseball psychology. Dugout chatter, coaching tips, walking to the mound to chat with the pitcher, arguing with the umpire--all have a place in real baseball, all have a place in HISTORY MAKER BASEBALL Big League Baseball simulation board game.<br/><br/>Results are found by rolling 3D6 and checking the results in the included game action booklet.  Each player is rated on a set of qualities for batting, running and fielding, while pitchers are also rated on their pitching ability.  Qualities include being a &quot;patient&quot; batter or a &quot;prospect&quot; pitcher.  The game booklet checks to see if a player has or lacks a certain quality to see what the result of the at-bat will be.<br/><br/>If a result is color coded (red, blue or purple), the next at-bat will be resolved on one of the three mini-charts.  Either EXPERIENCE(red chart), the RIGHT NOW (blue), or CHEMISTRY (purple).  In this game, a team's winning streak could give the players a little extra edge to make a tough diving catch in the outfield.  Whereas a losing streak may have the team in a STORMY mood causing players to chase bad pitches or miss the hustle plays.<br/><br/>",

Each student is represented by a letter of the alphabet. All players are dealt a few cards and therefore have some knowledge of which students are definitely not missing. To solve the mystery, you will ask for and give clues using five-letter words of your choice. The person asked gives a number as an answer, communicating how many of the letters in the words they have in hand, but not which. By learning which players have which letters (students), you will begin to suspect which students are off playing Hooky and which players have what information.<br/><br/>",

Lose, and it's back to the boasting minor league for you. Let's get to the contest!<br/><br/>Each round, players start with seven cards in hand from a deck that contains cards in three suits &mdash; red, blue, and yellow &mdash; as well as a number of &quot;pass&quot; cards. Randomly stack the three tokens  &mdash; also red, blue, and yellow &mdash; to set up the color rank tower.<br/><br/>The first player leads a card, and everyone must follow suit, if possible; if they can't, they play a card of their choice. If all cards are the same suit, the highest card wins the trick, and whoever played it leads to the next trick. If cards of multiple colors were played, then whichever color is on top of the color rank tower is trump, and the highest card of this suit wins the trick; if no cards of this color were played, then the highest card of the middle color wins. Move the token that matches the color of the winning card to the bottom of the color rank tower. (A &quot;pass&quot; card is always the lowest card played and cannot win a trick.)<br/><br/>After seven tricks have been played, score 1 point if you won the &quot;proper&quot; number of tricks: three tricks with three players, two tricks with four, and one trick with five. If you won no tricks, score 2 points! Move your token on the popularity track accordingly.

        "description": "For the most part, Han uses the same gameplay as China, also from designer Michael Schacht, but the maps on the double-sided game board introduce new rules and variants.<br/><br/>In general, players use cards to place pieces (houses or emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. To place in a region, a player must play a card of that region's color or two cards of the same color as a joker; a player can place at most two pieces in a region on a turn, but only one piece if the region was unoccupied at the start of the turn. One side of the game board &mdash; titled &quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot;, or &quot;Border Disputes&quot;, and made for 3-5 players &mdash; includes house sites that straddle two regions; to claim one of these locations, a player must discard two appropriately-colored cards. The number of emissaries in a region is limited to the number of houses of the same color in that same region.<br/><br/>When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for that region. Whoever has the most houses in that region scores one point for each house in the region, whoever has the secondmost houses scores one point for each house of the player who has the most, and so on.<br/><br/>At game end, players also score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions, scoring as many points as the number of emissaries in both regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board. On the &quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot; game board, players also score majority points for the houses in the port cities located in multiple regions, these port cities effectively forming their own region. Whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>&quot;Grenzstreitigkeiten&quot; has one variant. Each player starts with one fortification in addition to his other pieces. Once per game, a player can play two matching cards, then place his fortification on a house site, then top it with a house. Whenever this house scores &mdash; whether for the region majority, for being a port city, or for being part of a sequence &mdash; the house's owner scores double the points he normally would.<br/><br/>The other side of the game board &mdash; &quot;Wege der Diplomatie&quot;, or &quot;Ways of Diplomacy&quot;, which is made for 2-4 players &mdash; also has a variant, with each player receiving a marketplace. Once per game, a player can play two matching cards, then place the marketplace on a house site, then top it with an emissary (not a house). This allows a player to compete for emissary points in a region that is otherwise full.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Every winter, the lake freezes over. It won&rsquo;t last long, so we have to play as soon as possible, trying to dominate the frozen parts of the lake before everything unfreezes and we lose everything. In order to win, choose key spaces wisely before your rival does, and control them. Show that the cold never bothered you.<br/><br/>In Winter, two players compete to be the player with the most chips of their color on the lake at the end of the game. The game is divided into two phases. In the first, the freezing phase, players will create the frozen lake in a contiguous form using their snowflake cards. They&rsquo;ll also attempt to secure zones in which they&rsquo;ve managed to group four snowflakes of their color using chips. In the second phase, the unfreezing, they&rsquo;ll undo the creation by moving and retrieving their cards and chips of their color. At the end of the game, the player with the most chips on the table is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Winter is an abstract game for 2 players ages 8 and up. Games last 10 minutes in which good decisions are everything. This is a reissue of the 2016 edition with all new mechanics.<br/><br/>Winter was the winner of the 2021 Cardboard Edison Award. It&rsquo;s the first of a series of the 4 Seasons series that will continue later with Autumn, Summer, and Spring.<br/><br/>",

You need seven different colored jewels or eight of any kind of jewels to complete the amulet and win the game. Powerful spell cards are auctioned off each turn using a fixed set of energy stones.

The winning bidder places their winning bid (in energy stones) on the acquired spell card; this card will remain in play for a length of time related to the number of energy stones placed on it. Each turn energy stones are removed from the spell cards, and these energy stones are then available again for future bidding (so these energy stones are recycled throughout the game). The spell cards give each player some resource production (four different kinds of metals) and usually a special ability that can be used in the game. With the metal resources, the jewels are auctioned off on the main board and are acquired by the players in their quest to complete their amulet.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by<br/><br/><br/>    Wizard's Brew<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aquileia, the second most important city of the Roman Empire, had been originally founded as an outpost against the Barbarian invaders. From its military origin comes the peculiar quadrilateral structure divided by the main streets. Later, the city developed to become an important political and cultural center and a prosperous trading city, especially for precious goods, thanks to its convenient and efficient river port. Important monuments such as the Gladiator Arena, the horse-racing Stadium, and the famous theater were built, as well as craftsmen's workshops, patrician villas which completed the architectural network of the city.<br/><br/>In Aquileia, players want to become the most powerful figure in the city by trading and building. Each player, representing a wealthy Aquileian patrician, owns a certain number of henchmen (pawns) which he uses for these main activities: sports playing, culture, trading, and building. Each activity can bring expenses, earnings and sometimes victory points (VPs).<br/><br/>Each round begins with a placement phase in which players take turns placing their henchmen on action spaces and their tiebreaker disc on the tiebreaker track. Placing the tiebreaker is mandatory; placing henchmen is not (but you probably want to place them). Once everyone has passed or placed all of their tokens, players resolve the action spaces in numerical order:<br/><br/><br/>    The Mercatus allows players to buy weapons, arms and slave cards, collect money through a die roll, claim four blue dice for use with the Arena and Stadium, and trade one currency for another. (This is the only way to make change, and some actions require specific currencies; if you must pay bronze and have only silver and gold, then you cannot take that action!)<br/>    At the Arena, players compare fighting strength, with that number determined by the starting strength on the action space claimed, the roll of three dice and the playing of slave and weapon cards. The winner gets three bronze coins and either double his strength in VPs or a slave card. The second and third best players receive lesser rewards.<br/>    The Stadium is similar to the Arena, with the horse cards coming into play and the winner receiving gold or silver coins and his choice of two laurel cards; laurel cards deliver 3-10 VPs or are a multiplier for endgame scoring.<br/>    The Theatrum brings a bid for a dual-colored laurel card, with players needing to ante and raise in particular currencies. <br/>    In the Forum, players build villas and private banks, sometimes scoring points for doing so when they pay the specific costs with the proper coins.<br/>    Finally, the Portus gives players a chance to activate their buildings, thereby earning them VPs or money.<br/><br/><br/>After six rounds, the game ends and players score VPs for their hidden point cards and the product of their villas' values times laurel cards of a matching color. (For example, a total of 8 points of blue villas and three blue villa cards equals 24 points.) The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each aircraft has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, the B-17s carry a lot of bombs and are hard to shoot down, but they are terrible versus naval targets and only moderately accurate against all but the largest of land targets.<br/><br/>The game also goes more in-depth on the tactical options you have while over target. Each turn, each aircraft can become &quot;Offensive&quot; which gives it an attack bonus, but also makes it easier to be attacked when it gets shot at. Likewise, aircraft can be &quot;Defensive&quot; which penalizes their own attacks and makes them harder to hit. &quot;Slow&quot; pilots can &quot;Rush&quot; their attack at a penalty and attack during the Fast pilot step, and &quot;Fast&quot; pilots can Wait and get a bonus if they attack during the Slow pilot step.<br/><br/>Like the other games in the &quot;Leader&quot; series, Corsair Leader is a solitaire game.<br/><br/>The game is published in both PDF and Vassal versions.<br/><br/>Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen<br/><br/>",

Randomly placed VP tiles dictate the value of each port and the location of Treasure Maps, while a unique tile rotation system helps keep game play fresh. Weapons, Crew, and Provisions may also be found in the various ports, each of which confers its own Advantages during the game and translates to VP's in the end.

        "description": "As a giant monster, stomping cities is what you do. But now, other giant monsters are moving in on your turf - and you have to put a stop to that. Through a bizarre twist of fate, a branch of the military has decided to focus all its firepower on the other monsters. While your rivals are busy trampling tanks and swatting fighter jets, you'll be out there growing in power and infamy - getting ready for the Monster Challenge. In the end, when the dust settles and the radiation fades, the last creature standing will be crowned King of the Giant Monsters!<br/><br/>Each player is one of six Giant Monsters, stomping across a map of the USA in search of cities to destroy. The monsters run the gamut from the classic (enormous lizards and gargantuan apes) to the slightly more unconventional (giant walking eyeball), and each has its own set of attributes and powers.<br/><br/>Ingeniously, everyone also controls an arm of the military, which can be used to attack and weaken the other monsters on the board. It's a losing battle for the militia -- monsters can wipe out military bases and reduce the total number of forces available to each player -- but you can get a few good licks in early in the game.The battle escalates until the 20th city is reduced to rubble. At that time, all the monsters duke it out in a free-for-all, mano-a-clawo Monster Challenge; when the dust settles, the last monster standing is declared the winner.<br/><br/>This game is a reworking of Monsters Ravage America.<br/><br/>Key differences between this version and the original game include: getting rid of money in favor of a set number of units each turn, streamlined combat (two rounds in the new edition as opposed to three), removal of &quot;bad&quot; cards from the Research and Mutation decks (along with a few new cards from some of the unofficial expansions), removal of terrain effects on the board, miscellaneous balance tweaks between the military branches and the monsters.<br/><br/>",

The more identical symbols are grouped, the more points can be scored. The game is as simple as Sudoku and can also be played alone.<br/>How it is played:<br/>2 dice are rolled and each player has to draw these symbols into their sheet following very simple rules:<br/>- the two symbols have to be drawn in orthogonally adjacent fields. (Single fields previously surrounded with symbols will never be filled.)<br/>- as long as there are adjacent spaces, the symbols must be entered.<br/>The game ends when the sheets are filled or there are no legal adjacent spaces left. Each row and column are scored separately: 2, 3, 4 or 5 adjacent symbols of the same type score 2, 3, 4, 5 points PLUS 4/5 bonus points for 4/5 symbols.<br/><br/>The Grail Games edition of Criss Cross also includes &quot;Advanced&quot; rules which add a layer of complexity to the base game.<br/><br/>",

Countless swarms of Red infantry, tanks, and guns then swept the lines. In four days, the pincers met near Kalach-um-Don &ndash; entombing the 6th Army in Stalingrad. During the next three months, the Germans will reel from successive Soviet hammer blows, try in vain to relieve the 6th Army, and fail to supply it from the air. The 6th Army surrenders, and only the counter-attack by von Manstein&rsquo;s panzers stop the red tide. The turning point of World War II in Europe has passed.<br/><br/>Enemy at the Gates, the second Operational Combat Series release by The Gamers, offers players different challenges from those in the very popular game Guderian&rsquo;s Blitzkrieg. The Soviet army has rearmed and reorganized their Tank Corps &ndash; their challenge to the Panzer Divisions. The unique force structures of each side force players to fight differently in order to maximize their strengths. And, of course, players must face the toughest operation and strategic choices they have ever faced. When to stand, when to run&hellip;and when to strike.<br/><br/>Enemy at the Gates covers the entire period from 19 November 1942 to mid-March 1943. There are numerous one and two map scenarios. The game covers Operation Uranus, Operation Little Saturn, the German Relief and airlift efforts, and Operation Star and Gallup (to include von Manstein&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;backhand blow&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Extensively researched, playtested, and developed, Enemy at the Gates will satisfy the Eastern Front interest of any gamer who wants to know more than the pulp-history version of these pivotal events!<br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>    Dynamic and fluid situation<br/>    All of the pivotal battles in AG South<br/>    The creation of the Stalingrad pocket<br/>    The relief effort and airlift<br/>    Mansteins famous Backhand Blow!<br/>    Follow-on to the popular Guderian's Blitzkrieg: The Drive on Moscow game and system- refined based on player feedback<br/>    Player skill is highly rewarded<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Turn: Half-week<br/>    Hex: 5 miles / 8 Km<br/>    Units: Battalion to Army<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    Four 22 x 34&quot; maps (Maps A, B, C &amp; D)<br/>    One 8 x 11&quot; Stalingrad 'Blow-Up' map<br/>    Eight dual-side printed countersheets (5 combat, 3 markers - 2,800 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 36-page OCS rules booklet<br/>    One 36-page Enemy at the Gate game specific rules booklet<br/>    Two 6-page OCS version 2.0 Charts &amp; Tables Folders<br/>    Four Player Aid cards<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Complexity: High<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Playing Time: 4-100 hours<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/><br/>(from the Game Box)<br/><br/><br/>All 4 maps were changed and reprinted in 2001.<br/>Updated and replaced by Case Blue.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the invading forces is to manage to get inside the city before the end of the game or force the citizens to abandon the cause by dropping their morale to zero. The defenders, on the other hand, try to withstand the siege and protect the city long enough for the invaders to abandon their attempt either by deciding to leave on their own or by having their morale dropped to zero. The actions of the players are driven by the cards in their hands, which highlight actual events and personalities of that time, while the combat is dice-driven to allow for quick and exciting game-play.<br/><br/>",

Now the greatest animal coaches from around the world (the participating players) have gathered for the ultimate test of their training prowess to see who will become The Champion of the Wild.<br/><br/>Three events are first selected - one from each of five different categories (speed, power, endurance, technical and team). These events can be any measurable activity, examples including the 100m sprint, high jump, ballroom dancing and hide-and-seek. Players are then dealt a hand of animal cards to choose from and must select one single animal to represent them across all three events, competing against the animals selected by the other players. These events are then played out by way of animated discussion and players then vote according to their opinion on the likely rankings (excluding their own animal when voting). Votes score points for the appropriate players and the player with the most points after three events wins.<br/><br/>The Champion of the Wild combines the fun and laughter of a conversation-driven social game with the challenge of strategic thinking required for animal selection and event tactics.<br/><br/>Who will be your champion?<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with one worker cards on the table and five action cards in hand; an action card shows a combination of one of the five resources and one of the three workers. On a turn, the player first reveals one of the face-down resource cards, then chooses one of the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Passes on playing cards and draws two action cards. (A player can hold at most eight cards.)<br/>    Plays two action cards that bear the same symbol, takes the appropriate action (claim a character or extract resources), then draws one action card. (Any two action cards can be used as a joker, but you need at least one symbol of the appropriate type to take an action.)<br/><br/><br/>What do the characters do? Each investor has a different resource symbol, and when you extract that resource in the future, you need to play only one card instead of two. The salesman either boosts the value of a particular resource or the value of a character type at the end of the game. The worker allows you extract more resources.<br/><br/>When you extract resources, you take one card from the resource row (starting at the left) for each worker you have in front of you, then replace those cards with face-down cards from the resource deck. When the last resource card is revealed, each player takes on final turn, then they tally their scores, scoring $1,000 for each character and the printed value for each resource card (unless a salesman modifies those values). The player with the highest total wins!<br/><br/>The five salesman cards in Siberia: The Card Game can be used as an expansion for Siberia, and rules for this expansion are included.<br/><br/>Expands (while also being a standalone game)<br/><br/><br/>    Siberia<br/><br/><br/>",

But whenever you see a bird, word will get out. Anticipate the crowd to see more birds than anyone else!<br/><br/>Birds of a Feather is a fast, friendly, easy to learn card game for 1-7 players. The game is easy enough for children to learn and enjoy, but surprisingly strategic, making it a great filler for more hard core gamers.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt a large hand of cards. The game takes place over several rounds. In each round, each player chooses a card to play simultaneously. This determines not only which bird that player sees that round, but which habitat that player visits. Players check off the birds they see on a score sheet, seeing their own bird plus any other birds in the same habitat. Additionally, all birds are available to be seen for an additional round, giving players the opportunity to see rare birds they missed the first time.<br/><br/>Once all players have played through their hands, scores are tallied based on which birds each player saw. Seeing all birds in a habitat gives a substantial bonus. In the end, whoever saw the widest variety of birds is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Silent Death is a space combat game, normally played with miniatures. Most ships are fighter and heavy-fighters in size, but there are expansions to include gunboats and small capital ships. Each ship has a control sheet to make all bookkeeping (mostly damage and ammo when necessary) easier. The game is normally played in 10 turns, each player alternate moving all ships before making attacks.<br/><br/>From designer's notes:<br/>Silent Death is an attempt to produce a fun and fast-moving game that is simple to learn. The mix of design trade-offs (detail for playability) in the Standard Game feels about right, but since you can't satisfy all of the people all of the time, we piled in a bunch of optional rules so players can find their own optimum mix; either simpler or more complex.<br/><br/>Re-implemented in:<br/><br/>    Silent Death: The Next Millennium Deluxe Edition<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designed to be an educational and challenging game in which players compete primarily with Nature and with each other, luck tends to be an element in the game, but can be overcome by careful play. Because the situation is forever changing, there is no single best strategy; however,players must weigh risks against gains with every decision they make and good judgment will pay off.<br/><br/>The game is played on a mapboard showing Africa from Khartoum to Capetown and Lagos to Mombasa. The periphery of this map, showing the territory known ca. 1820, is filled-in; the center is blank. A hexagonal grid is superimposed on the map to regulate movement and to delimit territory explored. In the course of play, each player moves a token (representing his explorer) from explored hexagons to blank hexagons one at a time.; terrain, native tribes and other discoveries within the hexagons are then semi-randomly determined, with allowance made for previous discoveries in adjacent hexagons. The player interacts with the discoveries (e.g. negotiates with new natives for guides) and records them on the mapboard using wax crayons. The mapboard surface is erasable. If the explorer dies before returning to Europe to publish his discoveries, all hexagons which only he has explored will be erased and &quot;subsequent explorers will find that his discoveries were only rumors&quot;; i.e., when other players explore the erased hexagons later they will have to generate new discoveries there.<br/><br/>When explorers do return to civilization, however, they may publish their discoveries, after which they are safe from erasure. Players may also emulate real explorers by withholding some of their discoveries since they will enjoy some advantages when moving through terrain or dealing with natives known only to them. Points are scored for discoveries as they are published and once scored will not be lost if the explorer dies or is retired by his player. A player may retire his explorer at any time and then start a new explorer in Europe.<br/><br/>Before each trip to Africa, explorers will have to raise money to support their expedition. New explorers with no discoveries to their credit must do this by drawing chance cards for several turns until they feel their finances are adequate. Experienced explorers can accelerate this process by publishing discoveries, which allow them to draw additional chance cards.<br/><br/>Originally published by Discovery Games and re-published by Avalon Hill as a more card-based rather than dice-based system. A form of the original rules are preserved in the AH rules book under the rubric &quot;Game II&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules to the AH version have a serious glitch in sections 12.61 - 12.63 where the die roll modifiers for guides and proceeding cautiously are reversed.<br/><br/>The GENERAL Index  Article List:<br/><br/>    The GENERAL Vol.18,No.6<br/>        Source of the Nile &ndash; &ldquo;Native Policy in Source of the Nile&rdquo; (Strategy) Michael Anchors<br/>        The Question Box - Source of the Nile<br/>    <br/>    The General Vol.21,No.3<br/>        &quot;Source of Strength&quot; (Variant)Source of the Nile With A Vengeance, Tim Williams<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>     amarriner.com (PBEM)<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Source of the Nile: Tributary (Discovery Games version)<br/><br/><br/>",

You combine two of these half puzzle pieces to craft your own dominoes. This mechanism is meant to provide more variability and randomization in each play.<br/><br/>Instead of building your landscape around a central castle, you start from the river and expand away from it.

It takes less than a minute to learn and 20&ndash;30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Whenever you close your eyes, you fall into the dream realm: a world of vivid hallucinations and dark monsters. You must use your wits to draw power from the dream realm and break its hold on you, before the monsters can track you down and consume you!<br/><br/>Each turn, you randomly draw a number of dice from a shared bag. This represents the dreams you will encounter this turn. Return two to the bag to represent your chosen path through the dream realm and roll the remainder. After you have suffered the effects of your roll, you must choose whether to rest (and clear your card of one or two dreams) or press on and try your luck on another turn &ndash; going deeper and rolling more dice every time you do so.<br/><br/>You win by collecting 15 power symbols on your rolled dice &ndash; freeing yourself from the dream world's grasp. But if you collect too many of the wrong symbols, you may find yourself twisted and turned by the monsters, until you too become a dreaded Nightmare. Or something's dinner.<br/><br/>Should you become a Nightmare, your game completely changes. You can still win, but only by consuming the dreams of the remaining Dreamers, or sending minions after them to prevent them from becoming more powerful than you. If nobody has escaped by the end of the game, the most powerful Nightmare is the victor.<br/><br/>Without dreams, you cannot win. But without control, you risk becoming that which you fear most.<br/><br/>Or maybe that was your plan all along.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fernando Pessoa (13 June 1888 - 30 November 1935) was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher, and philosopher and has been described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets of all times. Pessoa was a prolific writer &mdash; and not only under his own name because he created approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them all pseudonyms because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them heteronyms.<br/><br/>In Pessoa, you are one of Pessoa&rsquo;s most famous heteronyms &mdash; Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, &Aacute;lvaro de Campos, and Bernardo Soares &mdash; and move between the metaphysical space of Pessoa's head and the physical spaces of Lisbon to gain inspiration from the iconic caf&eacute;s, visit bookshops to expand your library and knowledge, and seek inspiration to write poems, thereby scoring victory points. Whoever has the most victory points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>In more detail, Pessoa is a worker-placement game with special rules in which players can place their heteronyms since each player is a different heteronym, but all players are also the same physical person, that is Fernando Pessoa.<br/><br/>The game comes with two modules that can be switched on and off as the players wish. If you play with only the base game, Pessoa fares well as an advanced family game with straightforward rules, but interesting decisions and a more tactical nature. With the modules, Pessoa becomes a more crunchy game, in which extra layers of strategy combine to offer you a rich experience that tries to shine light on the complex figure that Fernando Pessoa was.<br/><br/>The game's rulebook includes historical notes to explain how theme and mechanisms are interconnected, providing you an accurate historical background about this extraordinary poet and his metaphysical creations that had their own personality and writing style: his heteronyms. We hope that at the end of your first game, we have spiked your interest to learn more about Fernando Pessoa and his poetry.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Garum was a fermented fish sauce used as a condiment in the old ages; its manufacture and export was an element of prosperity and perhaps an impetus for the Roman penetration of Lusitanian and Hispanian coastal regions.<br/><br/>Garum from today&rsquo;s Portugal and Spain was highly prized in Rome and has now inpired a versatile strategy boardgame for the whole family, ages 8 and up, that plays 2 to 4 players. Garum is a tile-laying game, which plays in about 30 minutes, it is language independent and features endless replayability, due to its board system, that ensures no two games are alike.<br/><br/>In Garum, each player represents a master in the preparation of a specific type of fish sauce and receives a set of 16 Cetarian Tiles; each one has 4 spaces filled by 4 colors in different proportions, though the color that the player is defending is the predominant one.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to play Cetarian Tiles strategically, in order to get a huge number of his own colour symbols in selected rows or columns - the greater the influence, the higher the reward! While placing the tiles, players may apply to score, collect some bonuses and also block their opponent&rsquo;s intents. Whoever scores most points is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The original city-building game Big City returns to print in a 20th Anniversary Jumbo Edition with buildings 33% larger than the original game and revised property trading rules.<br/><br/>In Big City, players acquire cards in eight different neighborhoods, then use them to lay out buildings either one, two, or three spaces large. The points they receive for a given building is a base score, plus bonuses for the buildings surrounding it. Someone must play city hall (scoring no points for themselves) in order for anyone to start placing any structure beyond the simple residences and business. As for what differs from the original game in this new edition:<br/><br/>&bull; Redevelopment Phase - This new mandatory phase happens at the end of each round of player turns (i.e. after all players have acted). In point order (first to last) each player must surrender one property from their hand, and optionally they can surrender a second property. Then in reverse point order, each player takes back a number of cards equal to the number they surrendered. Cards are normally played face-down so that only the neighborhood is visible. However, a player can &quot;jump to the front of the line&quot; by choosing to play their card face-up. However, this can be done only when the card is currently usable, so you cannot use this method if you're trying to trade neighborhood properties which are not yet in play. (You can still trade them, just face-down only.)<br/><br/>This redevelopment phase helps to solve the stand-off issue in which players are tempted to hoard properties when the person owning the neighboring property was also doing the same thing. Now the city enforces a &quot;use it or lose it&quot; policy.<br/><br/>&bull; Escalating City Hall Points - City Hall starts the game worth 0 points, but each round it escalates by 1 point up to a maximum of 5.<br/><br/>&bull; Early Game End - If everyone passes or uses the exchange action, the game ends immediately. That means there is no guarantee your city will become a Big City. Be very sure not to leave the leader in control of the last downtown property before City Hall is built!<br/><br/>&bull; Base Game 2-4 players only - The original edition allowed up to 5 players, but this was widely-considered to be too many players because such a large proportion of neighborhoods started the game on the board and the action became crowded in a hurry. As per Benno's request, the base game is now just 2-4.<br/><br/>&bull; New Waterfront Tile - Basically it's a neighborhood where nothing can be built. It acts as both a barrier to adjoining neighborhood placement, but also it provides a bonus to residential placed nearby.<br/><br/>",

By tactically moving groups of camels through the different desert grounds and by using its specialties you can rule the desert. -- from the rulebook<br/><br/>Targui has a board made of large square tiles representing the different types of desert ground. These provide varying economic and strategic value, from 0-5, and with a salt mine in the center, random distribution (with a little tinkering) makes a varied map each game. Players have a village tile which they place on the outer edge, and start with some camels and money. Your turn simply consists of moving and buying camels, expanding your control of the land.<br/><br/>Targui has very simple mechanisms, and is in effect a simple rolling war game with obvious tactics. But the random turn order creates a wonderful world of rapidly shifting alliances, with players making and breaking promises within moments. The winner is not the one with most money or camels, but with the most economic value under their control.<br/><br/>The game plays nicely with 3 or 4 players. However, Targui is a long game. Eight rounds takes about three hours, so using the whole deck of 20 fortune cards makes for an over-long game. If you enjoy Risk or light wargaming, then you'll get a lot from Targui.<br/><br/>",

Success, on the other hand, will eventually force the player to change sides and recover the losing side's fortunes. The duration of the war and the player's performance determine victory.

Any missing units of work (are required by the Attraction) cause Tourists to leave before gathering resources.<br/>     Players gain the primary resource of Gold by having more tourists at each attraction, and Flair by having less tourists. <br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPhase II - Action: Attract, Hire &amp; UpgradeIn order, players take one action per turn or pass. Players will be interacting with common draft areas, as well as using abilities from their own workers and attractions. Possible actions include:<br/><br/>     Attract Tourists from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Tourists are placed at attractions, potentially increasing the Gold gained on the subsequent turn.<br/>     Attract a Hero from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Heroes start with low health, which is gained at the end of each round. Fully Rested Heroes are scored for Victory Points.<br/>     Upgrade an Attraction (Spending Gold) - Providing higher tourist capacity, better Gold payout, better abilities and more Victory Points. Upgraded attractions typically require more workers to keep them fully staffed.<br/>     Train or Hire new Workers (Spending Gold) - Upgrade your workers to provide more work, or better abilities. Training locks a worker draft pile, preventing other players from upgrading to that particular worker during the round.

        "description": "Doggerland was a landmass that connected Great Britain to mainland Europe that disappeared under the North Sea after the last ice age. Humans lived on these fertile lands where multiple resources and animals were found.<br/><br/>In Doggerland, you play a clan at around 15,000 BCE. Your goal is to expand your clan in order to leave a trace of its existence for centuries to come. Players increase their population, make crafts, paint murals in caves, raise megaliths for the gods, and (most of all) survive the rigors of the seasons. To do this, they explore the surrounding territory and adapt to the resources at their disposal. The territory differs in each game, thanks to modular tiles.<br/><br/>Each round, players program their actions, then carry them out. These actions vary, based on available resources, abundance or scarcity around their villages, and also based on the actions of other players. As time passes, resources run out, and clans must migrate to find what they need for their development and survival.<br/><br/>In each clan, there is a leader who brings bonuses, and a shaman who allows powerful and unique actions thanks to knowledge and magic. After 6-8 seasons, the clan with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In DIG, each player is a dog that will run throughout the Yard, dig up bones and attempt to return them to the matching colored Dog Bowl with the greatest efficiency. All players will score once, at the end of the game, based on the cumulative value of the Bones that they returned to the matching Dog Bowls.<br/><br/>There are 4 Bones in each of the 5 colors in the game. A Bone's value is determined at the end of the game, based on the distance of its corresponding Dog Bowl to the Dog House. The Dog Bowl that is closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 5 for each bone of that color. The Dog Bowl that is second closest to the Dog House will yield a value of 4 for each bone of that color, and so on. The Bowls and Bones will be swapped from the end of the Yard into the place of a recently dug up bone, continuously moving the 5 Bowls to the end of the Yard nearest the Dog House.<br/><br/>Each Yard Card has a Scent with 2 colors. The Bone on the opposite side of the Yard Card matches 1 of the colors of the Scent. This will help players determine which color Bone might be dug if that Yard Card is selected for digging.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting aspects of DIG is the unique &quot;Leap Frog&quot; Yard replacement mechanism. When a Bone is dug up, the Card that is furthest from the the Dog House is removed and fills the empty spot created by the Dog. This action creates some interesting ways to influence which Bones and Bowls each Dog has close access to, but also makes timing critical for influencing Bone value for scoring.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they may perform three of the following actions in any combination:<br/><br/>MOVE: A player may move their Dog a maximum of 4 cards along the Yard Cards, and 1 less for each Bone they hold prior to movement. For example, if a player holds 2 Bone cards, they may move their Dog up to 2 Cards, moving below or above the Yard cards. A player may move their Dog in any direction. There is a movement legend on the bottom half of the Dog House for easy reference.<br/><br/>DIG: A player may dig up a bone and place the Bone card in their hand. Bones that are in the hand are kept secret until they are dropped off and placed in front of the player. The empty space created from the Yard Card removal is filled with the last Card at the edge of Yard. A player may have no more than 3 Bones in their hand at any time.<br/><br/>DROP: Drop a Bone into a Dog Bowl and place the Bone card from your hand to the playing area in front of yourself, face up with the Bone visible to all players. A Dog must be AT the Bowl of the corresponding color in order to drop off any Bones of that color.<br/><br/>Game End and Scoring:<br/>   When Bowls are the only remaining Cards in the Yard (next to the Dog House), the game ends immediately and players total their scores. Any Bones still in a player's hand are removed from the game and do not count for scoring.<br/><br/>Number 12 in the Pack O Game series.<br/><br/>",

The name &ldquo;Majolica&rdquo; comes from the Spanish name for the island of Maio (Cape Verde), which became renowned for (and later synonymous with) its export of high quality colorful glazed pottery tiles.<br/><br/>In the game of Majolica, players take turns to collect majolica tiles from the outlying sides of a 4 x 4 grid and place them in one of their four workshops. When the ratio of the tile colors matches the requirement of the workshop, you may deliver the tiles to your design card and &quot;carry-over&quot; the remaining tiles to the next workshop.<br/><br/>Choose the tiles wisely, arrange your design cards in the right place, and &quot;recycle&quot; your remaining tiles efficiently are the keys to score the most points and win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players attempt to be the first to build a railway route from Cape to Cairo through various terrain types in Africa. Players begin with 100 pounds, which is used to bid on terrain cards and purchase missing tracks necessary to cross terrain. Each turn, a number of terrain cards equal to the number of players in the game are auctioned off and placed before the appropriate player's train, representing the next space to be crossed. Terrain cards show a number of tracks ranging from 0 to 3 and require from 6 to 10 tracks to cross depending on the type of terrain. In turn order, players flip additional terrain cards, and decide whether to build (cross terrain) or pass. When a terrain is crossed, the card is flipped face down and the player who completed the crossing receives back a number of pounds as indicated on the card. The track-building phase continues until one player has no terrain cards lying in front of their train, at which time a new set of terrain cards are auctioned. The first player to complete the crossing over eight terrain segments is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It features several characters, represented on actual stickpin buttons, that each have a unique allowance of polyhedral dice.  These dice endow each  character with fairly unique combat abilities.  Players roll the dice against each other and take their opponents' dice as casualties.  The object of the game is take out the most die 'sides' during the combat.  It's quite simple, quite inventive, and deeper than it would seem at first.<br/><br/>",

In the game, you take control of a small group of American soldiers. Under your command, the Americans must fend off the relentless attacks from German paratroopers and fusiliers. Your goal is to recreate the incredible historic accomplishment of the American soldiers by defending the town of Lanzerath, Belgium and delaying the advance of an entire SS Panzer Division.<br/><br/>Lanzerath Ridge is the next design in the Valiant Defense series, following the critically acclaimed Pavlov's House, Castle Itter, and Soldiers in Postmen's Uniforms.  The Valiant Defense series allows you to play amazing stories of  courage, with small forces holding the line against unimaginable odds.  Games in the series focus on the individual defenders and are deeply  rooted in history, while providing a quick play experience with a light complexity rule set.<br/><br/>Lanzerath Ridge is divided into four attack periods, each of which is represented by a deck of enemy cards. Each attack period is divided into a number of turns, and each turn consists of two phases:<br/><br/>The game ends immediately if the defenders&rsquo; morale drops to 0 or if a German attacker takes over an American defensive position. Otherwise, the game ends after the last attack. Your level of success is based on the Americans&rsquo; morale, intelligence gained during the defense, and any objectives you accomplish.<br/><br/>",

Three factions vie for control of this corrupt new world and everything within it. You are a mercenary known as a &quot;freelancer&quot;, here to profit off the conflict, to make a name for yourself &ndash; but ambition alone isn't enough. A network of seedy contacts will assist you in undertaking the dangerous missions necessary to bolster your rep. Whether it's hiring henchmen to carry out your dirty work or plotting with secret schemes, you'll let nothing stand between you and your squalid goals.<br/><br/>In Infamy, players find that nearly anything can be bought for the right price. Players attempt to win the game by being the first to reach 15 Infamy points or by reaching the highest reputation level in any one of three factions: the Harada Cartel, the Trust Megacorp, or the PKD Militia. The core of this auction and influence game is the &quot;Pay to Play&quot; mechanism in which players must sacrifice bidding power in order to place any bids at all. Spend too much time bidding against an opponent, and your currency will dwindle &ndash; but if you refuse to bid, you'll be forced to watch your opponent acquire all those things that only the criminal underworld can deliver.<br/><br/>Here at the end of the world, where everyone and everything has its price, there is but a single ambition that endures: Infamy.<br/><br/>",

The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: strategic or otherwise.  The basic game has players simultaneously playing cards (ala Raj), whereas the strategic version plays like a trick-taking game with players selecting a card sequentially.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Yin Yang/Fifty-Fifty<br/><br/><br/>",

Follow the clues with your team of investigators to answer these questions and other questions.

During your turn, each player must perform one of the following actions:<br/><br/>A) Reveal information:<br/>Choose a card from your hand and place it on the table, so all players can read or see the entire information.<br/>We recomend you read out loud all shared info when you place it on the table. If you play a clue that happens to be irrelevant<br/>to the case, you lose points at the end of the game, but be careful! Some clues are vital to resolve the case.<br/><br/>You can share and expose your theories at any moment and talk about the cards you have in your hand but you cannot show them to the other players and you may only read out loud the words written in bold or the text framed inside an image:<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when all clue cards have been revealed or discarded, you must check carefully all the available information and prepare a theory of what happened, working all together. Then, open the questionnaire and answer all questions. During this phase of the game, you can speak freely about your discarded cards, or the information you remember of them. Each right answer will add two points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Portuguese King has called the finest stonemasons of the country to pave one of the most important squares with cal&ccedil;ada tiles (worldwide famous black and white tiles that pave several squares in Portugal). But the task is enormous and players will have to count with the aid of helper cards who will help them score points and/or collect money.<br/><br/>In Rossio, players start the game by drawing five cards and keeping three of them on their hands.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, players will first recruit a card from their hands, placing it on the rightmost space under their player board, sliding to the left all cards previously recruited, discarding the card that slides off their boards (under each player board there are only 3 card slots). If the newly recruited card is played face-up, players must pay its cost in coins. If the card is played face-down, no money needs to be spent.<br/><br/>Then, ALL cards under a player board will activate: face-up cards will give the player Points for each time the pattern depicted on the card is found on the square. Face-down cards will provide the player 1 coin each.<br/><br/>Then, players must build the leftmost cal&ccedil;ada tile of their player boards. Players can never voluntarily change the order of the tiles on their board. At any moment players can, however, spend 1 coin to swap 2 pieces on their board that are orthogonally adjacent. The tile must be built in the square orthogonally adjacent to at least 2 elements: 1 tile and 1 wall, or 2 tiles. And must be built on the leftmost available space of the line it is being built. If the players manage to build orthogonally adjacent to a similar tile, they can as bonus build the next leftmost tile, and so on, until they decide to stop or until they can't build more. Players collect then 1 coin for each coin depicted on the spaces that were left free on their player boards after tiles were built.<br/><br/>Finally, players end their turn by drawing 1 card into their hand from the 4 cards available on the market. However, the amount of cards players can choose from depends on the number of tiles that they have built. So, if players build only 1 tile, they must take the 1st card. If they build 3 tiles, for example, they can choose between the 1st, 2nd or 3rd cards. Players end their turns by refilling the empty spaces of their player boards with tiles from the facedown stacks.<br/><br/>As the square is being cooperatively built, certain patterns appear more often than others and the scoring of face-up cards becomes exponential. Also, when players complete a column, they collect a bonus, that can be either 1 coin or drawing more cards. Money is very tight in this game, so gaining an extra coin can be crucial to recruiting a card from your hand face-up.<br/><br/>The game ends when the square is finished and the player with most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Rossio is all about timing: Recruit a card face-up late in the game, and then it will score fewer times than expected. Recruit it too early, and it will score you a few points since there are few tiles built on the square. To many cards recruited face down will give that extra amount of money, but, they won't score any points. Build several tiles and you're probably helping your opponents. Build fewer tiles and you probably won't have money next turn to recruit a face-up card.<br/><br/>Rossio is a game with very simple rules, but with high interaction between players and interesting decisions every single turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Mechanically, the game employs a familiar card drafting system of picking a card and passing the rest.  The cards are then used according to their type.  Vase cards are placed in a player's shop window.  Flower cards are tucked under the vases, provided they meet the vase's requirements. Basket cards may be hung at the top of a player's window, but only if they can buy the baskets first.  Salary cards provide free income.  Sale cards allow players to sell flowers to put additional funds in their register.  At the game's end, players score points for the best display of flowers in their windows.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to create courtyards &ndash; and subdivide existing courtyards &ndash; while keeping your opponent from doing the same. Players have the same cards in their decks, so the challenge is all about what to use when. The game ends when all the castle pieces are used up, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Two different pairs of Keep colors are available in the two versions of Castellan, so with two copies of the game &ndash; and the right combination of bits &ndash; up to four players can play.<br/><br/>",

This allows for a total of 81 unique power combinations. One of these combinations plays as the original Capital Lux, while the other 80 present the players new tactical challenges.<br/><br/>The core of the game revolves around the following dilemma: Do you play character cards in your home base for points, or contribute them to the capital to benefit from their powers? At the end of a round, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your home base for any color than the current total value in the capital. Exceeding the limit makes you lose those cards. At the end of the third round, all cards remaining in your home base are worth points.<br/><br/>The game therefore turns into an act of balancing on a razor's edge: Secure as many points for yourself without exceeding the capital's limit &mdash; always taking into account the current capital powers.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>160 cards<br/>40 tiles and tokens<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>Last Chance for Victory is the next entry in The Gamers&rsquo; Line of Battle series (LoB) which simulates the Battle of Gettysburg. It is the second game in the series, following the well received None But Heroes about the Battle of Antietam.<br/><br/>The story of Gettysburg is well known or, I should say, the popular rendition of the battle is well known and has certainly been simulated multiple times.<br/><br/>As is usually the case with stripped down, accepted versions of complex events, this narrative misses much flavor and a deeper understanding of what went on. It&rsquo;s the &lsquo;auto-tour&rsquo; version of a much more involved event.<br/><br/>Many things are simply not brought out, or put into proper context, in the affirmed version of the battle:<br/><br/>1)     Lee arrived on the field and tried to get his footing when Ewell (on his own initiative) ordered Rodes and Early to attack. Lee wasted no time in ordering Hill to attack with Heth and Pender to support Ewell&rsquo;s Corps. In the commonly held view, Lee arrived and simply dithered while events unfolded outside his control.<br/><br/>2)    There were several opportunities that afternoon and evening to advance and take Cemetery and/or Culp&rsquo;s Hills. These were missed&hellip; but not, as commonly assumed, because one or more leaders were staring at their navels confused or indecisive. What happened and why?<br/><br/>3)    Ewell made a clear headed decision his men were in no condition to take the hill that evening. He was the commander on the spot. Since then historians and armchair generals everywhere have questioned that decision, the game allows you to see who was right. Ewell was of the opinion that he could only do it if 3rd Corps supported him. That support was ordered by Lee (using 3rd Corps&rsquo; artillery) but was not implemented by the army&rsquo;s chief of artillery. Would that have allowed the attack to work? What was the relative condition of the Union defenders and the potential attacking troops anyway?<br/><br/>4)    There never was any sort of &lsquo;dawn attack&rsquo; order, but there were orders to attack much earlier on the second day than actually occurred. The game allows you to find out what went wrong (so you can draw your own conclusions as to who to blame).<br/><br/>5)    By evening of the 2nd day, the fate of Cemetery Ridge rested in the hands of a handful of formed Union regiments (including the human sacrifice of the 1st Minnisota). Confederate victory was very, very close&mdash;teetering in the balance much more than normally assumed. There was a reason Lee said that if Dorsey Pender remained in command for another 30 minutes, the Confederates would have won the battle. See just how tough the Union job was and how close to the edge they got. What would have been the result of that 2nd day&rsquo;s attack had it launched just a few hours earlier or even at the same time, but with the coordinated use of Anderson&rsquo;s and Pender&rsquo;s divisions?<br/><br/>6)    Everyone assumes Pickett&rsquo;s Charge was a forlorn, desperate, throw of the dice, but what was the condition of many of the Union units manning that ridge? Was this attack a complete reworking of the Confederate battle plan out of blind frustration or was it a continuation of the plan from both earlier days? What was the earlier, theoretically coordinated, plan the attack was ad libbed from?<br/><br/>7)    As a whole, the popular version of the battle pretty much assumes a Union victory unless multiple stars aligned for the Confederates. If this is so, did the Army of the Potomac have to merely put out a &lsquo;fair-to-middl&rsquo;in&rsquo; effort or did they have to fight tooth and nail to gain victory? If the latter, just how close of a run was it? Doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;assuming they will win&rdquo; take away well earned credit they had for finally overcoming a determined and usually successful foe?<br/><br/>Last Chance for Victory attempts to allow players to find their own answers to these questions and points as well as many others. The added depth and nuance makes for a very different and, in my opinion, more accurate rendition of the battle than you&rsquo;ve ever seen before.<br/><br/>Aside from showing the history in a way that will be both entertaining but make you thirst for more and better reading on the topic, multiple variations are provided to explore the battle. Sure, there are the usual &ldquo;extra troops&rdquo; variants, but more importantly, options that allow players to tweak the various historical behavior &lsquo;knobs&rsquo; I assigned. If you think my &lsquo;setting&rsquo; for Howard (to pull a name out of a hat) are all wet, you can change him to be better (or worse) so you can see how your version &lsquo;plays.&rsquo; Likewise, a number of rules simulate activities that were pretty much out of the player&rsquo;s hands (such as Buford&rsquo;s need to screen the town yet keep his losses very low), these can be &lsquo;turned off&rsquo; as desired to see what effect they really have on the battle. There is a matrix of the various &lsquo;control&rsquo; rules and the possible &lsquo;settings&rsquo; for each one that players can use before starting if they disagree with my decisions. The results of your choices might surprise you and spur your understanding of the battle to new levels.<br/><br/>As with None But Heroes, Last Chance for Victory is designed to bring all of this and much more to your table in the most historically accurate and informational jam-packed game possible. Like any LoB game, it was designed with twin goals: the most insight possible and a game with maximum playability.<br/><br/>Enhancing the already well received and streamlined Line of Battle rules, Last Chance for Victory comes with the v2.0 series rules. These rules incorporate the refinements and suggestions of hundreds of real players which make this smooth system even faster to play. Make no mistake, this is the only regimental level Gettysburg game that can be played to completion at a respectable clip&mdash;yet it is a large game. A pair of reasonably fast players could play the campaign game to completion at a convention like ConsimExpo. I&rsquo;ve completed campaign games with three players in a week of rather relaxed play time.<br/><br/>Scenarios abound of various sizes. The campaign uses a 4-map &lsquo;box&rsquo; layout, but the game comes with two additional maps, one covering just the 1st Day&rsquo;s fighting and the other the 2nd and 3rd Day&rsquo;s. The big game scenarios can be played on one or both of those maps and, with those two linked together, it is possible to play the entire battle on 2 maps.<br/><br/>It replaces This Hallowed Ground from the RSS-series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brazen Chariots  is a Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP) game that chronicles fighting in the North African desert towards the end of 1941. Once Axis forces under Rommel had laid siege to Tobruk, they then set about trying to take it. Meanwhile, Commonwealth forces pushed back to the Egyptian border launched several attempts to break into and relieve the fortress. Two of these efforts, BREVITY and BATTLEAXE, lacked the depth needed to accomplish this goal and were utter failures. The third, CRUSADER, was a massive undertaking that successfully opened communications to Tobruk and proved to the British 8th Army that Rommel could be beaten. It also set the stage for Rommel's Gazala offensive in 1942.<br/><br/>Brazen Chariots is the third game in the Battalion Combat Series, which took players by storm with its blockbuster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge and follow-up fast playing game Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine. In Brazen Chariots, the wide-open desert, the limited number of Formations, and numerous shorter scenarios provide players with both a rapid and fun introduction to this highly acclaimed new series.

Each family fights dirty, doing all they can to seize ownership of alcohol crates, even if that means sending rivals to sleep with the fishes. You are the &quot;Capodecina&quot; for one of these families. Command your henchmen to gain the upper hand in New York City by collecting crates, eliminating rivals, exposing moles, and tipping off the DA on your opponent. Do you have what it takes for your family to become Capo dei Capi?<br/><br/>Each round in MOB: Big Apple, players take turns rolling two dice, then decide how to execute the results. Each roll allows players to allocate henchmen to the two game boards and perform various dastardly tasks, such as loading cars with henchmen to drive to locations, loading crates of contraband, revealing their rival's moles, and eluding the District Attorney.<br/><br/>In more detail, six key locations of New York City are contested each round, with half being represented by a black die and half by a white die. You roll one of each die on a turn, and the die values denote which locations may be interacted with, and how many henchmen may travel to that specific location, with the white die serving as the location and the black die the number of henchmen or vice versa. During every turn, a player must send at least one henchmen to perform a specific task on the action board, which can help command cars, expose moles, move crates, and influence the District Attorney to move in on their rival&rsquo;s family.<br/><br/>Once both players have allocated all of their henchmen, the round ends, then a battle takes place at each location, with the survivors remaining to guard the contraband. After the third and final round, whichever Capodecina owns the most crates of contraband gains control of the Big Apple!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Celebrities is a public domain game in which each player writes the names of celebrities (about 8) on pieces of paper or cards, one per piece of paper or card.  The names are placed in a container, and players are assigned partners randomly (there must be an even number of players).<br/><br/>The first player pulls names out of the container one at a time and tries to get their partner to say the name on the paper by giving whatever clues they like, without saying the actual name on the paper.  If their partner get a name right, they keep the paper; everything else goes back in the container.  Each player has only 30 seconds.  The names are passed to the next person, who repeats the process, and so on, with the names going around the table, and everyone getting chances to give clues and to guess, until all of the names are guessed.  Teams score one point for each name guessed.  All of the names are put back in the container, and a second round begins.<br/><br/>In the second round, the clue giver can give only one word clues for each name (with whatever other sounds or charades they like), and the guesser can guess only once.  The round is played similar to the first round in everything else, and the names go back to the container at the end again, for a third round.<br/><br/>In the third round, no words at all are allowed for the clue giver; only charades and sounds (humming tunes) is allowed.<br/><br/>The team with the highest total score from the three rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The game was packaged commercially as Celebrity and Time's Up! in 1999, and Monikers in 2015.<br/>Also known non-commercially as Salad Bowl or Fish Bowl.<br/><br/>",

There are also Events which can inflict plagues and famines, foment civil wars, incur barbarian invasions from all directions of the compass and unleash volcanoes, floods and earthquakes of apocalyptical proportions.<br/> With a very short rule book that lets players get into the game quickly, Ancient Civilizations of the Inner Sea is an exciting, fast-playing, easy-to-learn, easy-to-play but challenging to master and always different abstract game in which player's guide the legendary civilizations that surged and receded around the shores of the Mediterranean: which the Romans aptly called the Mare Internum, or Inner Sea.<br/><br/>Ancient Civilizations of the Inner Sea is not just one game but many games. From one to six players will each take the role of one, two or even three of these civilizations as they compete across up to four epochs, each Epoch taking up to four turns, on land and sea, each seeking to make their indelible mark on history.  The scenarios are of much shorter duration of only a few turns each (depending on which is selected).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Dreamwell is represented by a 4 x 4 grid of tiles. Each tile shows a environment and a creature, in addition to pathways to neighboring tiles. At the beginning of the game, players will be dealt two cards, each of which shows a picture of the friend whom he or she is trying to locate along with the two creatures and environment that will be required to find that particular friend.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will be able to take three actions from the following list: move one of your pawns, rotate a tile, draw a card, replace the display, or locate one of your missing friends by playing a card. Only by carefully navigating the maze-like Dreamwell can you locate your friends and win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Classic Art, first released as Members Only, players attempt to predict how many works of art will be present in five exhibitions. The riskier your predictions in a season, the more you score &mdash; but only if you're correct, of course!<br/><br/>The game consists of 65 cards, with 13 cards in each of five categories; eleven of the cards are &quot;positive&quot; and two are &quot;negative&quot;. At the start of each season, players get a hand of cards (7-11 depending on the player count) and two cards are placed face up from the deck in their respective exhibitions.<br/><br/>In the first round of the season, players may predict how many works of art will be in an exhibition at the end of the current season by placing 1-2 tokens (along with their high risk token) on a prediction space. Each exhibition allows you to bet on whether the art will be rare (bet spaces 1-4) or plentiful (bet spaces 5-8). In each subsequent round, a player must place two cards from their hand in the appropriate exhibitions, then they may place a prediction. They may place only one &quot;double token&quot; prediction in a season, and predicting is optional. When all players have only three cards in hand, they each discard one face down, then place the other two cards in exhibitions. Whenever a negative card and positive card appear in an exhibition, remove them.<br/><br/>At the end of a season, players score for correct predictions. If art in an exhibition is &quot;rare&quot;, i.e., four or fewer works, then all plentiful bets fail, and vice versa. What's more, a rare bet succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or fewer than the bet, e.g., if you bet 3, then you succeed only if three or fewer works of art are present. A plentiful bid succeeds only if the number of works is equal to or more than the bet. The riskier the bet, the higher the payout per token in that successful bet, with players recording points separately for each exhibition.<br/><br/>At the end of a season, tokens on failed bets (other than the high risk ones) are removed from play, while tokens on successful bids are returned to players. If a player has zero or one tokens at the end of a season, all of their tokens are returned to them.<br/><br/>A player can score at most 10 points in an exhibition. Continue playing seasons until at the end of a season, each exhibition has at least one player who has scored 5 points in it. The game ends at the point, and players tally their scores &mdash; but tokens in the 0-4 range in an exhibition are worthless. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>In Members Only players bet on odd things like how many royal scandals will happen in a month, and in Glenn's Gallery, another version of this design, players bet on the number of customers who will show up to look at types of art, but otherwise gameplay is nearly identical to Classic Art. The only difference is that each player has a dedicated &quot;double bid&quot; token instead of being allowed to bid two tokens once per season.<br/><br/>Classic Art includes a two-player variant that can be used in prior releases. After dealing eleven cards to each player, set up a ten-card &quot;house&quot; deck. On each player's turn, they play the top card of the house in addition to two cards from their hand. In the last round, play the final two cards from the house along with the chosen two cards from both players.<br/><br/>",

You can make animals hatch to use their card abilities after you have moved them to the safe cavern. Saved animals will score rescue points in different ways at the end of the game. However, you also need other animal cards to move your saviors around the board (and thus move your animals to safety). Be careful how you use your cards!<br/><br/>2. Different types of cards deepen the strategic choices. Skillfully use the ability of your asymmetrical hero cards and optimize the possibilities of the silver and golden animal cards. When the pile of silver cards is used up, the comet phase begins and initiates the end of the game.<br/><br/>3. Even the movements on the game board want to be well planned.

        "description": "Untamed: Feral Factions is a fast-paced shuffle-building card battle game. Players each take control of three animal factions that battle together to bring down the opponent's three Strongholds. Each faction has its own unique appearance, Stronghold, and play style. By combining three different factions each game, players will be able to discover new synergies, combos and strategies.<br/><br/>The game features a streamlined, accessible ruleset and a double resource system that adds tactical depth. Players can easily build their decks at the start of the game by choosing three animal factions: shuffle them together and you are ready to play.<br/><br/>Each turn a player will face interesting choices with regards to how to use their cards: all cards double as resources which are required to play Animals and Items. Previously used and defeated cards enter a player's Support Area where they can be used to fuel powerful card abilities.<br/><br/>Untamed: Feral Factions requires no additional purchases beyond the base set for an optimal playing experience, with almost a hundred possible deck combinations out of the box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;White Star Rising introduces Lock &lsquo;n Load Publishing&rsquo;s Nations at War (NAW) game system. Based on the popular World at War, NAW depicts platoon level combat in World War II. Here you&rsquo;ll find everything you're looking for in a platoon-level game -- armor, artillery, infantry that serves as more than cannon fodder, command and control, air support, amphibious landings, and desperate close assaults that leave the victor in possession of the ground and the defeated in headlong retreat, all in eight pages of rules. That&rsquo;s two less than the World at War system.<br/><br/>&quot;Units represent platoons of vehicles, such as M-10 Wolverines, M4A3E8 Easy Eight Shermans, and German Panthers, Tigers, and Mark IVs. Of course White Star Rising isn&rsquo;t all about tanks. There&rsquo;s plenty of infantry; paratroopers, line doggies, Fallschirmjaeger, and Volksgrenadiers. In the same vein as the World at War system, the infantry are capable of moving fast and hitting hard. White Star Rising also includes support weapons, such as heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that infantry platoons can use to lethal effect.<br/><br/>&quot;The system throws typical turn-based gaming out the window. The platoons are grouped into formations (usually battalions and kampfgruppen) and led by a headquarters. Each unit of the formation must be within range of the HQ to activate with its formation. Although individual units might activate, and recon units can double their range from the HQ, you&rsquo;ll want to keep those formations together. The formations are activated by chit draw, and better-trained, better-led units can activate more than once in a turn, moving, shooting, and fighting in each activation. On the flip side, there is no guarantee that a formation will activate even once. The cup into which the formation chits are placed is seeded with end turn chits. When the second end turn chit is drawn the turn ends. Doesn&rsquo;t matter if a single formations has activated; the turn is over. It keeps you on your toes.<br/><br/>&quot;When attacking, each platoon rolls a number of dice equal to its firepower. Every die that equals or exceeds the &ldquo;to hit&rdquo; number (right superscript) hits the target. The target then rolls a number of dice equal to its armor factor plus terrain advantages. Each die that equals or exceeds its armor factor negates a hit. The first hit disrupts a unit, second reduces it, the third eliminates it.<br/><br/>&quot;Units may also close assault, entering the opponent&rsquo;s hex to either deal a death blow or force him (or her) out of valuable terrain. Same procedure, but both units use their close assault value. The side that takes the most hits must retreat from the hex. Infantry is VERY good at this, especially against armor without its own infantry support.<br/><br/>&quot;Game includes rules for thin-skinned vehicles, support weapons (actual counters that represent heavy machine guns, flamethrowers, and satchel charges that add to an infantry platoon&rsquo;s capabilities), air support, bunkers, wire, artillery, mines, overruns opportunity fire, line-of-sight rules that have been streamlined since their inception in World at War, transporting infantry--and all in eight pages of rules.&quot;<br/><br/>Other Games in Series:<br/><br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising<br/>    Nations at War: Desert Heat<br/>    Nations at War: Stalin's Triumph<br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising – Airborne<br/>    Nations at War: White Star Rising – Operation Cobra<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    World at War: Eisenbach Gap<br/><br/><br/>",

It is a game you can take anywhere and play time and time again to discover all the different nooks and crannies of the seven maps included.<br/><br/>It is a completely unique concept that promises to equally surprise and create headaches in equal measure. In this original game from Devir, you will unfold a map on the table, where you will start at the compass rose with the pointer you will find in the box, moving it along the labyrinth paths marked in white without ever lifting it from the map. You will have to open and close different parts of the map in search of the Impossible Triangle that will allow you to escape the maze. You can go under bridges, climb up ladders and run around in circles in the maze and in your own head until the exit finally leads you to&hellip; the next map!<br/><br/>In Mazescape: Lab&yacute;rinthos you will go through three well defined territories: the docks, the graveyard, and the mountain. The first of the maps will help you to understand the most essential concepts of the game. Then. from there, they will become progressively more complicated until reaching the final challenge. They also have a bunch of secondary objectives that you can explore to get the very most out of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Adapting to their environment they use land sails with wheels on these flats. But the Apocalypse is not done with the Saltlands, from the west a storm of raiders, a terrifying Horde on gas guzzling machines approaches in search of their lost God. Only those among the first to escape have a chance!<br/><br/>In Saltlands, the first group of players to find and reach an exit point wins, leaving the rest to the Horde. There are no fixed teams, players can decide to co-operate or backstab each other as they see fit. Each player starts the game with a single captain but may increase his crew as the game progresses. Each crew member represents an extra life and an action each turn. Players move with their land sails according to the wind direction: being able to criss-cross slowly upwind or speed in the fastest direction, sailing on a broad reach. Each player can choose which group of raiders to move at the end of their turn until all raiders have moved. This allows players to help each other or force confrontation with the raiders. Players can fight the raiders and take their vehicles as an alternate mode of transport.<br/><br/>",

A good combination of tile placement and card management can result in very impactful turns, where several cards are completed and the city expands. Interaction between players is important, because all players are building on the same board and can take advantage of what other players have built on their previous turns.<br/><br/>You will try to build the most harmonious city possible, because that will be vital for your score: in the end of the game you will score normally the regions where you have your two highest scores but you will triple the score of your lowest scoring region. So be aware!

Along with these leaders, players utilize a pool of generic units composed of infantry, cavalry, and catapults.  All game pieces are plastic figures.<br/><br/>Players attempt to conquer their neighbors and build up cities and fortifications to increase production of wealth.  Players also may build road networks that allow for faster movement, by all armies.  Along the way players have to contend with rising inflation which makes military units more and more expensive.

        "description": "Sweden Fights On is a tactical battle game featuring four battles from the later half of the Thirty Years War. It is the second volume in the Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series covering warfare in the 17th Century. This volume traces the fall, revival, and pinnacle of Swedish military fortunes after the death of King Gustav II Adolf at L&uuml;tzen in 1632.<br/><br/>The Musket &amp; Pike Battle Series transitions from the English Civil War period (This Accursed Civil War, Vol. I) to the Thirty Years War period with added features such as limbered guns, double-sized batteries, and organic regimental artillery. The system emphasizes command and control.<br/><br/>Armies are divided into three or four wings. Each wing has an order that limits the types of actions that units of that wing may perform. Victory goes to the commander who can coordinate the actions of these wings in the heat of battle. Units are infantry brigades, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries. Rules include Cavalry Charges, use of the cavalry's pistols to skirmish or use in close combat, artillery grazing fire, infantry techniques of fire including advancing, retreating, and salvo firing. Play is highly interactive, and a battle can be played through in one sitting.<br/><br/>The four battles in Sweden Fights On are:<br/><br/><br/>    N&ouml;rdlingen 1634 <br/><br/><br/>Though the Swedes struggled with command after the death of King Gustav II Adolf, they continued to exploit the momentum he had generated.

Archduke Leopold commanding a larger Imperial army rushes to engage the Swedes. Within sight of the same ground of Gustav Adolf's greatest victory from eleven years past, the armies met.

Melodies whisper in slow rhythms as children wake from their slumber. Leaping from their beds, they rush to their parents and startle them awake. The mix of fear and excitement fills the room. The lure of exotic sweets wafts in on the warm summer wind. The lives of this dull, small town are revitalized with the anticipation of this dreadful circus.<br/><br/>Dreadful Circus is a set-collection card game in which players try to create the most successful circus! The game comes with an unique twist: Over the course of the game, players buy cards that have special final scoring rules. As the game progresses and more cards are gained, each player develops their very own final scoring rules. No game is the same, and no player at the table scores the same way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A spin off from Martin Wallace's design God's Playground features updated artwork and a new rule set for four players.<br/><br/>The title is borrowed from book by Norman Davies.<br/><br/>The game itself is set in Poland.  It covers the period from about 1400 to 1790, which is covered by volume 1 of the two books.<br/><br/>From BGN:<br/><br/>In GP, players represent families of Polish nobles who are trying to increase their wealth and influence while fending off enemy nations that constantly threaten Poland.<br/><br/>The four families are:<br/>Radziwiłł family (white) <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82_family\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radziwi%C5%82%C5%82_family</a>  <br/>Sapieha family (red) <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapieha_family\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sapieha_family</a> <br/>Potocki family (blue) <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potocki_family\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potocki_family</a> <br/>Leszczyński family (yellow) <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszczy%C5%84ski_family\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszczy%C5%84ski_family</a><br/><br/>In each of the four turns of GP, players place markers in five different Polish regions, and in a box representing the Polish national army.  Each marker has a number ranging from zero to five which represents the number of nobles that the player is placing in that area.  Most actions in the game require a player to remove a noble cube from an area in order to perform an action in that area.  Players also have income-generating estates in the different areas of Poland, and these holdings may determine which areas a player is most eager to defend.<br/><br/>Each turn, players may raise private armies and use them to strike at the five nations that threaten the different areas of Poland.  If a player is successful enough at attacking an enemy nation, then that nation may not have the resources to attack Poland that turn.  Later, a roll of four die will determine which enemy nations receive reinforcements, and then enemy nations will take their turn attacking Poland.  A successful enemy invasion of Polish territory may result in players losing one or more estates in that region.<br/><br/><br/>Boże Igrzysko - Dzieje Rzeczpospolitej Szlacheckiej.<br/><br/>&quot;Nierządem Polska stoi&quot; -  nieźle ktoś powiedział;<br/>Lecz drugi odpowiedział, że nierządem zginie.<br/>Pan B&oacute;g nas ma jak błazn&oacute;w. I to prawdy blisko,<br/>Że między ludźmi Polak jest Boże igrzysko.<br/><br/>Gra obejmuje dzieje I Rzeczpospolitej od czasu panowania dynastii Jagiellon&oacute;w i wojen z Zakonem Krzyżackim, aż po rozbiory Polski w XVIII wieku.<br/><br/>Boże Igrzysko zostało zaprojektowane dla trzech graczy, lecz posiada r&oacute;wnież wariant dla czterech os&oacute;b. Każdy z graczy wciela się w rolę przyw&oacute;dcy jednej z gł&oacute;wnych familii magnackich tamtych czas&oacute;w. Biały kolor odpowiada rodowi Radziwiłł&oacute;w (herbu Trąby), czerwony odpowiada Sapiehom (herbu Lis), niebieski Potockim (herbu Piława), a ż&oacute;łty rodowi Leszczyńskich (herbu Wieniawa). Podczas rozgrywki gracze będą musieli szukać kompromisu pomiędzy interesem własnego rodu, a interesem całej Rzeczpospolitej.<br/><br/>Rozgrywka trwa cztery tury, każda z nich jest podzielona na kilka etap&oacute;w i faz. W każdej turze Rzeczpospolita będzie zmagała się z ościennymi państwami, kt&oacute;re będą pr&oacute;bowały dokonać na nią inwazji. P&oacute;łnocnym granicom Polski zagrażać będzie Zakon Krzyżacki, p&oacute;źniej Szwedzi, a na końcu zachłanni Prusacy. Z p&oacute;łnocnego wschodu grozić będzie coraz większa potęga Rosji. Z południowego wschodu będą nadchodzić nieujarzmieni Tatarzy. By z nimi walczyć, gracze będą mogli posiłkować się wojskami kozackimi, te jednak skore są do buntu. Na południu rozpościera się muzułmańska potęga Imperium Otomańskiego. Za wojnę z niewiernymi, graczy czeka największa chwała, będą mogli oni nawet iść na odsiecz Wiednia. Ostatnie ościenne mocarstwo &ndash; Imperium Habsburg&oacute;w &ndash; na początku gry zachowuje pozorną neutralność, jednak pr&oacute;buje zdominować Rzeczypospolitą politycznie. W ostatniej turze Habsburgowie ściągają jednak białe rękawiczki i przyłączają się do Rosji i Prus w celu rozebrania Polski.<br/><br/>Gracz, jako głowa magnackiej rodziny, będzie dysponował rzeszami szlacheckiej klienteli, gotowych do działania na jego rozkazy. Na początku każdej tury gracze decydują gdzie wyślą posłusznych im szlachcic&oacute;w. Za ich pomocą gracze będą werbować wojska, wysyłać zbrojne wyprawy, zdobywać władzę na sejmikach ziemskich i przewagę polityczną na dworze Kr&oacute;la. Szlachcice to najcenniejszy zas&oacute;b gracza i musi on rozważnie z nich korzystać.<br/><br/>Gracz będzie czerpał pieniądze z latyfundi&oacute;w, kt&oacute;rych ilość będzie m&oacute;gł zwiększać podczas gry. Zamożność latyfundi&oacute;w będzie zależała tego, czy w prowincji, w kt&oacute;rym się one znajdują, kwitnie pok&oacute;j, czy raczej była ona ofiarą zagranicznego najazdu. Ziemie ograbione i wyludnione przez Tatar&oacute;w nie dadzą dochodu por&oacute;wnywalnego z majątkami leżącymi w niezrujnowanej wojną prowincji. Gracze będą mogli rozwijać swoje latyfundia gospodarczo, poprzez zatrudnianie zarządc&oacute;w a nawet budowę miast.<br/><br/>Na prestiż rodu wpłynie sława zdobyta w bitwach, nawet jeśli toczone wojny nie zawsze będą wygrane. Prestiż danego rodu będzie wzrastał także dzięki fundowaniu miast, kolegi&oacute;w, powiększaniu ilości latyfundi&oacute;w, wydatkom na dobra luksusowe.<br/><br/>Grę zwycięży ten gracz, kt&oacute;rego r&oacute;d zdobędzie najwięcej punkt&oacute;w prestiżu za wymienione wyżej osiągnięcia.<br/><br/>Komponenty gry:<br/>- kartonowa plansza do gry,<br/>- instrukcja,<br/>- 4 karty pomocy,<br/>- 48 żeton&oacute;w wpływ&oacute;w &ndash; 4 komplety po 12 żeton&oacute;w w kolorze białym, czerwonym, niebieskim i ż&oacute;łtym,<br/>- 32 żetony wojsk prywatnych &ndash; 4 komplety po 8 żeton&oacute;w (4 piechoty, 3 kawalerii, 1 artylerii) w kolorze białym, czerwonym, niebieskim i ż&oacute;łtym,<br/>- 9 żeton&oacute;w wojsk kr&oacute;lewskich (4 piechoty, 4 kawalerii, 1 artylerii) w kolorze złotym,<br/>- 2 żetony wojsk kozackich (2 kawalerii) w kolorze jasnobrązowym,<br/>- 80 kostek graczy &ndash; 4 komplety po 20 kostek w kolorze białym, czerwonym, niebieskim i ż&oacute;łtym, <br/>- 12 kostek kr&oacute;la w kolorze złotym,<br/>- 64 dyski graczy &ndash; 4 komplety po 16 dysk&oacute;w w kolorze białym, czerwonym, niebieskim i ż&oacute;łtym,<br/>- 2 duże dyski miast w kolorze szarym,<br/>- 8 dysk&oacute;w zarządc&oacute;w w kolorze szarym,<br/>- 1 duży dysk traktatu w kolorze złotym,<br/>- 5 dużych dysk&oacute;w zamożności posiadłości ziemskich w kolorze czarnym,<br/>- 2 piony w kolorze czarnym,<br/>- 125 kostek wrog&oacute;w &ndash; 25 czarnych, 25 zielonych, 25 brązowych, 30 pomarańczowych, 20 fioletowych,<br/>- 10 habsburskich znacznik&oacute;w wpływ&oacute;w w kolorze fioletowym,<br/>- 31 żeton&oacute;w złotych o nominale 5,<br/>- 29 żeton&oacute;w złotych o nominale 1,<br/>- 4 kostki do gry,<br/>- kartonowa buława hetmańska.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 58 BC, Gaius Julius Caesar was appointed by the Roman Senate as proconsul for Gaul, for which he was given four legions. The ambitious Caesar, a military ingenue, had little idea of how lucky he was going to be -- as he was in usually everything he did -- because, within a short space of a few years, after coming to the rescue of the Gauls against incursions from Germanic tribes to the east, Caesar himself decided to bring the rest of the barbarian tribes under the domain of Republican Rome...and, at the same time, increase his visibility among the Roman people.<br/>From a military point of view it was an immense achievement, one that fueled Roman imperialist feelings like no other war. For the Gauls it meant subjugation. For the gamer, it means six battles of Pure Excitement.<br/><br/>Bibracte 58BC     <br/>Caesar is called on by the Aeudui to repel the Helvetii. Caesar corners the Helvetii near the Aeudui oppidum, Bibracte, and forces them to attack him. The Helvetii fall back, regroup and, as Caesar's legions march toward them, attack again. At this moment, contingents of the Boii and Tulingi tribes hit Caesar's right flank.<br/><br/>The Rhine 58BC     <br/>Having defeated the Helvetii, Caesar is now asked by the Gauls to do the same against the aggressive Germans. The German tribes are led by a very capable and wily chief, Ariovistus -- he outmaneuvers Caesar to cut his supply line, to which Caesar reacts by outbluffing the Germans so that their lines are now cut.<br/><br/>The Sabis 57BC     <br/>Having decided to pacify Gaul, Caesar realizes he will have to start in the north, with the Belgae, the most dangerous tribe. He marches against them, reaching the banks of the Sabis (today, the Sambre) River. Without warning the Nervii and their allies, the Viromandui and Atrebates, emerge from the woods in full barbarian fury.<br/><br/>Bay of Biscay 56BC     <br/>The sea-oriented Amorican tribes of NW Gaul proved most difficult. They could not be defeated on land, so had to be attacked at sea. For that purpose, Caesar had his men build an entire fleet of biremes from scratch in less than two months. The Roman fleet, under Admiral Decimus Junius Brutus faced a difficult foe.<br/><br/>Britannia 55BC     <br/>Late Summer, and Caesar decides to cross the Channel. A fleet of 80 warships and transports reach the shores of Britannia near modern Dover. But their cavalry has been dispersed by a storm, and the Romans have a difficult time beaching their galleys. The Romans are beset by large numbers of Britons.<br/><br/>Lutetia 52BC     <br/>There are rumblings of a Gallic uprising, and Caesar sends his right-hand-man Titus Labienus, with four legions, against the local tribes around what is now Paris (Lutetia). After some up and down river maneuvering by both armies, the Gauls attack Labienus in a classic set-piece battle that serves as a learning scenario.<br/><br/>Game Features:<br/><br/>        Eight of Rome's most vaunted legions, including Caesar's favorite, the Xth, and its maximum-rated 1st cohort...each with its own artillery, auxiliares and hired cavalry.<br/>        Ten tribes of sword-armed, axe-throwing barbarian infantry, fueled by special rules for Barbarian Impetuosity and Ferocity.<br/>        For the first time in the GBoH system, war galleys, sail ships and transports...all in a preview of the Naval Warfare system for the series.<br/>        A much simplified command system (as opposed to the hierarchical system in Julius Caesar: The Civil Wars), reflecting the smaller Roman armies as well as the leadership theories of the tribes.<br/>        All three major land battles of the war, a full-scale invasion scenario as well as a smaller battle perfect for getting a feel for the game.<br/>        Special rules for Hit and Run tactics, as well as revised artillery use mechanics.<br/>        The *feared German cavalry...a combination of light horse and light infantry so effective that even the disciplined Romans sought to avoid confrontation.<br/>        A system that is perfect for solitaire play.<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     75 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     100-150 men per size point<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four<br/><br/>(source: GMT website)<br/><br/><br/>Expansion Modules:<br/><br/>     Caratacus: two battles from the Claudian invasion of Britannia<br/>     Gergovia: Caesar's defeat in 52 BCE<br/>     Battles of the Warrior Queen: Covers the major engagements during the rebellion of the Iceni tribe and Boudicca&rsquo;s allies against the legions of Emperor Nero.

        "description": "Quixo bears a superficial resemblance to Tic-Tac-Toe &ndash; with one player being crosses and the other circles, and with both trying to create a line of their symbol &ndash; but that's where the resemblance ends. The pieces in the game are cubes that have a circle on one side, a cross on another, and blank faces on the other four; to set up the game, players place the 25 cubes with blanks face-up on the 5x5 grid in the game board.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hoplite, the 15th volume in the Great Battles of History series of games, allows players to recreate classic battles from the pre-Alexandrian Persian-Hellenistic Age, the heyday of the Hoplite (heavy infantry fighting in packed formation). This period is often considered to feature the birth of Western Warfare, as opposed to the Persian/Eastern style, which relied on archery , light cavalry, and mobility.<br/><br/>Exactly how hoplite warfare was fought &ndash; what really happened when &ldquo;the bell rang&rdquo; &ndash; is highly disputed by ancient military historians, even today. Hoplite allows you to test out your theories (well, our theories, using your dice) with eleven of the great battles of this era, from the Battle of Leuctra, featuring the huge 60-man deep phalanx of Beotarch Epaminondas to the classic confrontations with the Persian missile-armed troops against the classic Greek hoplite phalanxes.<br/><br/>Hoplite uses detailed mechanics meant to convey all the possibilities of this style of warfare, from The Hellenic Law of Inertia, to Drift to the Right, to the special capabilities of the Persian Light Cavalry (Harassment and Dispersal) to three different levels of Hoplite advance to Combat (the Run Don&rsquo;t Walk rules) and a whole lot more.  We even still have some good old chariots!<br/>  <br/>And you get to fight what was the biggest land battle in European history up until Napoleonic times, the immense Battle of Plataea (truly the deciding engagement of the Greco-Persian Wars):  two maps and about 250 combat  counters covering The Greek Contingents from 26 City-States under Pausanias, Spartan Regent and General, vs. The Persians, Medes, Asians (Bactrians, Scythians, Indians and a whole lot of others) and seven Medized Greek city-states, under Mardonius, Persian Commander and son-in-law of The Great King, Darius I.<br/> The package includes Simple GBoH versions for each of the battles along with special rules that highlight the hoplite style of warfare.<br/><br/>Hoplite is the ultimate board game simulation on the birth of Western Warfare.

        "description": "Longstreet Attacks: The Second Day at Gettysburg is a two-player Tactical level  board-wargame simulating the fighting on July 2nd, 1863 during the second day of the Battle of Gettysburg and focuses on the southern portion of the battlefield. These engagements involved General Longstreet&rsquo;s attack against Sickles&rsquo; positions, with troops from Hood&rsquo;s and McLaws&rsquo; Divisions, assisted as well by Anderson&rsquo;s Division of A.P. Hill&rsquo;s Corps.<br/><br/>The game is specifically designed to be a playable regimental-scale game that players can complete in a long evening. It allows the players the immersive experience of tactical combat without the heavy rules overhead normally found in such games, while also delivering a comprehensive experience of limited intelligence and unexpected events. The game features the Blind Swords chit-pull system which emphasizes the three &ldquo;FOW&rsquo;s&rdquo; of military conflict: fog-of-war, friction-of-war and fortunes-of-war. With each chit pull, players will be challenged to make tough decisions based on their assessment of the situation at that moment. Unlike traditional chit-pull systems, the Blind Swords system ensures that no combat units can be counted on, or conversely, counted out. This yields an environment of tense action and constant surprises &ndash; an environment that will challenge each player.<br/><br/>UNITS<br/><br/>All regiments and batteries of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Army of the Potomac that took part in these actions are represented in the Order of Battle. Each unit has a Strength Point number, with each point equaling 50 men or 1 artillery piece, and a Cohesion Rating, representing the unit&rsquo;s morale, training and experience.<br/><br/>SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS<br/><br/>Combat and Cohesion System: The combat system is &ldquo;firepower&rdquo; based and utilizes the unit&rsquo;s size and Cohesion Rating to determine its effectiveness. The combat system is driven by a unique four-D6 dice mechanic. All four differently-colored dice are rolled simultaneously. The black and white dice generate an initial result ranging from 11 to 66. The other two dice (red and blue) simultaneously give the players the tangible effect of the initial result and represent physical casualties suffered by the unit (the red die) and the morale effect of the enemy&rsquo;s fire (the blue die).<br/><br/>Orders System: A player must first choose one of four possible Orders that an activated Brigade will operate under &ndash; Attack, Defend, Maneuver or Rally. Each Order has specific parameters that provide benefits and restrictions. This Order choice can be critical to a unit&rsquo;s performance during its activation.<br/><br/>Chit-Pull System: The Blind Swords chit-pull system is a unique mechanic and generates challenging actions and difficult decisions for the players. It features four different types of chits, all of which reside in the same cup, each with special effects:<br/><br/>Division Activation Chits. These activate any one Brigade (not yet activated) from the Division listed on the chit. However, further Brigade activations from this Division are dependent on the Division General&rsquo;s Command Rating and a die roll. A successful die roll places the chit back into the cup and thereby the other Brigades of the Division have a chance to activate in the future.  A failed die roll discards the chit for the turn and the remaining Brigades will not be able to activate normally (however, see below). <br/>CIC Chits.  These are a special kind of Activation Chit. The Union player has a Sickles chit and the Confederate player has a Longstreet chit. These chits allow the player to select any one Brigade in the game for activation - even if it has already activated or will be activated later in the turn. Thus, this is the opportunity to activate a Brigade twice in the turn or activate a Brigade from a Division that has lost its Division Activation Chit. <br/>Event Chits.  There are nine Event chits assigned to each player. At the start of each turn, players may select any one of these chits to place in the cup (obviously an Event they really want). Three Event chits are randomly thrown out of the turn and will not be used &ndash; the remaining five Event chits are also then placed into the cup with the previously pre-selected chit. In this manner, players are never assured of drawing any particular Event chit, except for the one they chose. Each Event chit has a Unique Event side (all the chits have a different Event listed) and a Command Event side. The Unique Event is a tactical event that can be used on the battlefield and each Event has specific effects and options for the player to consider. Examples are Rebel Yell!, Union Logistics, Quick March and Heroic Stand. The Command Event side is used for more strategic options. The Union player may call for reinforcements from the rest of the Army of the Potomac (only the III Corps Divisions are available at start) and the Confederate player can attempt to better coordinate his attack (by increasing his Division General&rsquo;s Command Ratings). <br/>Wild Chits.  These are the two &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; chits. One chit is Fog of War, which can possibly cause units from either side to conduct unexpected attacks or withdrawals, or can cause General officer casualties. The other chit is Fortunes of War which will immediately discard the next chit pulled with no effect &ndash; including that special pre-selected Event chit if it happens to come up!<br/> MAP<br/><br/>The map is 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; hexagonal map of the entire south end of the Gettysburg battlefield. Each hex equal 150 yards and contains all the significant terrain details &ndash; elevations, slopes, woods, swamps, buildings, orchards, etc.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS<br/><br/>The game will include at least five scenarios:<br/><br/>The Round Tops. A small scenario to introduce people to the games rules.<br/><br/>The Whirlpool. A ten turn scenario about the most contested part of the battlefield. The Wheatfield, Devils Den, Houck's Ridge and the Peach Orchard. 4:20 to 7:20pm<br/><br/>Assault on the Emmitsburg Road. A 9 turn scenario of the battle for the Peach Orchard and Cemetery Ridge. 5:40 to 8:20 PM<br/><br/>Hammerin' Sickles. The full second days action on this part of the field. 14 turns. 4:00 to 8:20 pm.<br/><br/>Sickles Stays Put. A what if scenario exploring a set up closer to what Meade intended for Sickles before his forward advance.<br/><br/>Map by Rick Barber<br/>Counters by Charlie Kibler<br/>Box by Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>",

The game is played using mostly standard trick-taking rules: Each turn, someone plays a card to the center of the table, then in turn each player lays down (if possible) a card matching the suit or rank of the card led, throwing out any other card otherwise. The highest card in the color led wins the trick, and that player leads the next trick. Points come only from the black cards, with the black spies (yes, &quot;spies&quot;, with six black #7 cards) being worth ten points each and all other black cards worth 1-5 points. When someone reaches 200 or more points at the end of a round, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

New game mechanics support a simulation which must encompass planes with very different flight capabilities and firepower, while still keeping the flow of the combat simple as it is in the WW1 series. The innovations to maneuver cards and to the fire deck system provide all the needed historical accuracy with no headaches to the players!<br/><br/>&ldquo;Fire from the Sky&rdquo; is the second set in the new series of Wings of War games, which will allow you to re-create dogfights, bombing missions, escorts, and endless other aerial combat situations set in World War Two. New fighters are introduced into the system, among which the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk featured in several allied color schemes including the famed Flying Tigers. Airacobra, Yak 1, Reggiane Re.2001 Falco II, Hien and several other fighters from every WWII front are also included. The newest add to the system are Anti-Aircraft guns in ground nests and three different dive bombers: Stuka for the Axis, Val for Japan and Dauntless for United States and France.<br/>Up to 6 planes can fly with the contents of this set, for scenarios with 1 to 6 players.<br/><br/>Part of the Wings of War series<br/><br/>Expanded By:<br/><br/>     Wings of War: Flying Legend Squadron Pack<br/>     Wings of War: Eagles of the Reich Squadron Pack<br/><br/><br/>",

Have you enjoyed a good historical novel dated on the old Republic of Rome, and you would like to travel to that time?<br/><br/>ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is a war game similar to miniatures games in which both sides fight an ancient battle. The game is mainly based on the II Punic war, although battles from III to I B.C centuries can be also simulated. The game concept combines both, orders and events cards, that makes each game different and each combat becomes unpredictable and thrilling. ONUS! can be played anywhere but to get the best gaming experience we do recommend a game area as large as possible, i.e. 3.2 x 2.9 feet (100 x 90 cm).<br/><br/>Units are represented by cards which have been scaled around a Centuria (also known as Century) or to a Maniple (also known as Manipulus), representing formations from 80 to 100 men for Infantry units, 20 cavalrymen for Cavalry units or 6 Elephants. Units have their own set of traits to represent permanent attributes of the unit, like Melee Combat, Range Attack, Defensive capacity, Morale and Life, and Movement capacity. This set of traits gets bonuses and penalties depending on the ongoing situation and combat engagements.  Units also have their unique set of skills to represent specific abilities they can perform: from defensive formations to extremely effective techniques to attack enemies. Some of these skills need to be activated, meaning only one of them can be used in an engagement, while others are inherent to the units.<br/><br/>Leadership is represented in the game by the figure of the General. A General&rsquo;s token represent his HQ and its own escort. In addition to the leadership benefit, a General grants bonuses to nearby units, boosting the morale of the troops and providing additional benefits when they are engaged with the enemy in those bloody encounters. Both, Hannibal and Scipio, two well-known Generals are included in the game with their unique set of bonuses! Also, Heroes, Veterans and Elite units take part in Onus!<br/><br/>ONUS! Rome Vs Carthage is played in turns, composed by six different phases each:<br/><br/>1.    Activation of Units: in this phase, the active player can play any number of Order cards from his hand, stating what units are going to be used during the turn.<br/>2.    Movement and Charges: in this phase, the active player may move all those units activated in the previous phase. Those units finishing their movement in contact with enemy units, may Charge against them.<br/>3.    Range Attack: those active units able to carry out Ranged Attacks and which haven&rsquo;t moved or executed a Reduced Movement may shoot enemies within its maximum range. Also, special units like Skirmirsher have this skill, thus they may want to use this ability.<br/>4.      Skirmishers: units having these specific skill can harass enemy units, provided they haven't spent all their movement points.<br/>5.    Combat: All engagements are resolved in this phase, being the active player the one choosing the order of combats.<br/>6.    Flee Movement: units fleeing continue their movement if Morale checks fail.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description courtesy of BoardgameNews.com<br/><br/>Waterloo &ndash; a two-player game for early 2009 with the French and British fighting once again. The action system is a clever creation: You know the range of possible actions that you can take on a turn, but the opponent knows exactly how many actions you have, and that knowledge strips the certainty from your preparation. Can you get your infantry back in a defensive position before the opponent thunders through with his cavalry? If you don&rsquo;t think you can, you might develop timidly, which gives the opponent a better shot of taking valuable terrain.<br/><br/>Damage in the game is represented by blue/red/black cubes, and you can distribute the cubes throughout your lines during the game to represent the movement of troops back and forth from the front lines. Shifting all the damage to the back seems like a no-brainer, but if cavalry does break through your front line, your troops are toast. Morale is checked only in face-to-face combat, and it&rsquo;s handled by a die roll compared with the level of damage within an area.<br/><br/>Control of areas like La Haye Sainte is critical. Just as Wellington tried to funnel French attacks through gaps in ridges in order to cut off their support, you can do the same, fighting for highland to prevent being pinched. The French win if they take Mont St. Jean, the British if they take Rosonne; if neither occurs before the end of 8pm (ie the last turn), then the British and Allies win.<br/><br/>",

With the enemy's minions closing in and innocents in peril, our heroes will need to work together to stop the villain's plans and save the world &mdash; but will they be able to save it in time?<br/><br/>In Marvel D.A.G.G.E.R., players work together to challenge the forces of evil. Play as iconic heroes like Spider-Man, Daredevil, and Black Widow, and race across the globe to complete missions, battle enemies, and square off for the final showdown against the nemesis. Choose the best aspect for your hero, pull off awesome combos, and wait for the perfect moment to unleash your ultimate ability. Team up with your allies and take on dangerous threats as you become the greatest heroes in the world!<br/><br/>In more detail, &quot;D.A.G.G.E.R.&quot; stands for &quot;Defense Alliance for Global and Galactic Emergency Response&quot;, and the &quot;Alliance&quot; and &quot;Emergency Response&quot; elements drive how the game is played, with heroes needing to strengthen themselves via combos in time to take on the nemesis.<br/><br/>There are two types of combo tokens: empowered tokens and primed tokens. When a hero becomes &quot;empowered&quot;, they can later discard their empowered token to add one success to any attribute test they perform. When an enemy is &quot;primed&quot;, a hero attacking that enemy can remove a primed token from them to add one success to the attack result, which means more damage dealt.<br/><br/>What's more, each hero has at least one &quot;combo ability&quot; that requires either an empowered token on themselves or a primed token on an enemy to trigger. Triggering these combo abilities comes with an extra benefit: advancing the team-up track, a resource shared by all heroes that's used to pay for &quot;team-up abilities&quot;, the strongest abilities in each hero's arsenal.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You will have to trust and cooperate with your fellow players in order to reach a more peaceful conclusion.<br/><br/>The game consists of a number of scenarios which form an exciting story driven campaign. There are multiple secrets and surprises in the box to be unveiled in certain points of the story. This way each game is radically different from the last and no two games feel the same. However, none of the game&rsquo;s components are destroyed or altered so you can replay any scenario as many times as you like.<br/><br/>Dawn of Peacemakers is set in Daimyria, the same world as both the original Dale of Merchants and Dale of Merchants 2. Although it takes place almost one thousand years before those games, you&rsquo;ll be able to spot many familiar animalfolks. Are you ready to dive into the exciting world of Daimyria?<br/><br/>Players use cards to influence different sides of the ongoing war. Armies and player-controlled adventurers are represented with highly detailed plastic miniatures on a beautifully illustrated game board. All scenarios have their unique map which is built using modular terrain tiles.<br/><br/>",

Volume I covers the period from the start of the War in 1939 to the early months of 1943. You serve as BdU, Befehlshaber der U-Boote; the Supreme Commander of Uboats, Kriegsmarine. Your mission is to deploy your forces with maximum effect to destroy British and Allied shipping, while limiting your own submarine losses.<br/><br/>Featured scenarios cover actions ranging from famous short single sub patrols, through short campaigns, ending with the full campaign covering 1939 to 1943. The game map breaks the Atlantic, Mediterranean, South Atlantic, and Western Indian Oceans into historical Operations Areas through which subs patrol in search of shipping.<br/><br/>Special rules feature historical events such as the invasion of Norway and Torch; b-dienst, ULTRA, and the intelligence war; torpedo improvements, German wolfpack tactics, Super-Skippers, large vs. small U-boat philosophy, appeals to Berlin for resources, and many others. Every German sub deployed between 1939 and 1943 (as well as some what-if classes) is represented with its very own counter, each meticulously and accurately drawn and shown from their side in full-color. Players familiar with Silent War will find Steel Wolves takes the system to new depths, while those trying it for the first time will be able to quickly get into action!<br/><br/>",

In this game you start at 221B and travel through the streets and alleys of London picking up clues and attempting to solve the most intriguing cases Holmes and Watson have ever faced.<br/><br/>Each player assumes the role of Holmes and matches wits with the other players to determine who possesses the most skillful powers of deduction.  Each case is represented by a card that features a crime told in story form, a selection of probable suspects and a list of locations involved in that crime. Clues are hidden throughout London, one in each of fourteen locations. Players must collect clues from each location, noting them down on their checklists as they attempt to find the answers to the questions listed on the case card.<br/><br/>Naturally, the crime scene will often contain vital clues, and a prudent detective always checks with the neighbors. Still, you can learn something vital almost anywhere in town.  The first player to figure out the correct answers to a particular mystery or crime, return to 221B and announce the solution, is the winner.<br/><br/>The original 221B Baker Street Board game was created and copyrighted by American writer Jay Moriarty (dba Antler Productions) in 1975.  The Brazilian version of this game is known as Scotland Yard, not to be confused with the 1983 Spiel des Jahres winner also called Scotland Yard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Red Storm&quot; is the second sequel to the Charles S. Roberts Award-winning game Downtown. Red Storm is a standalone game that utilizes the Downtown game system to depict a hypothetical air war in May/June 1987 over the central portion of the NATO/Warsaw Pact front in central Germany.  Like Downtown and Elusive Victory before it, Red Storm is an &ldquo;operational&rdquo; level air warfare game where players manage large strike packages and numerous combat air patrols in an effort to strike enemy targets, protect their own ground troops, and secure control of the air over the land battle raging below.  Both sides have highly advanced all-weather aircraft, long-range missiles, precision bombs, sophisticated electronic warfare assets, and dense air defense networks of surface-to-air missiles and radar-guided AAA.  The game features aircraft from the United States, United Kingdom, West Germany, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Soviet Union, and East Germany.<br/><br/>As the NATO player, you fight outnumbered in the air, but with a qualitative edge in technology and better-trained pilots.  NATO faces the daunting task of contesting the air in the face of the initial onslaught from the WP air forces while also getting bombs onto targets on the ground both on the frontline and rear echelon forces of the Soviet and East German armies.  As the Warsaw Pact player,  you must push your numerous but less flexible forces to the absolute limit in an effort to overwhelm NATO forces in the air and destroy them on the ground, all while supporting advancing ground forces.  Both players also have to manage their air defense networks consisting of overlapping layers of SAM and AAA.<br/><br/>Units<br/>Like earlier games in the series, units in Red Storm are flights of 1 to 4 aircraft, each tasked with different roles such as bombing, combat air patrol, close escort, or jamming support.  Red Storm features more than 50 types of aircraft, including both older &ldquo;3rd Generation&rdquo; workhorses like the F-4E Phantom II and MiG-23 Flogger as well as advanced &ldquo;4th Generation&rdquo; fighters including the US F-15 Eagle, the UK/West German Tornado, and the Soviet MiG-29 Fulcrum. Aircraft from the air forces of Belgium, West Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and East Germany are provided.  Ground units depict various types of troop concentrations, SAMs, and AAA assets.  The SAM network on both sides is both more numerous and more dangerous than ever, with low-altitude SAMs like the UK Rapier, US Chaparral, and Soviet SA-13 Gopher joining a daunting array of medium/high altitude SAMs like the US Patriot and Soviet SA-12.<br/><br/>Maps and Terrain<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map sheets depict the rough terrain in the central portion of the NATO front line, reaching from the Rhine river in the west to the Thuringia region of southwest East Germany.  The map uses the same scale of approximately 2.5 nautical miles per hex used in earlier games in the series.  This densely populated region of Europe features numerous rivers, cities, and airfields dot the map.  Unlike earlier games in the series, Red Storm features a frontline that moves steadily west as the Warsaw Pact armies advance.<br/><br/>Game System<br/>Like the earlier games in the series, Red Storm requires both players to do planning for both their air and ground forces prior to a scenario.  Raid forces must be generated, targets and routes planned, and aircraft loadouts determined.  SAM, AAA, and radar units must be placed to take advantage of the rough terrain and frequently poor weather of central Germany.<br/><br/>During a scenario, players go through a sequence of phases each turn where they conduct electronic warfare, use various means to detect and track enemy flights, and move and fight with their flights while potentially being attacked from the ground.  The heart of game is the movement phase where players use a chit-draw system that allows players to alternate moving one to five flights at a time.<br/><br/>Scenarios<br/>The war depicted in Red Storm is a short one, with just six weeks between the start of the air war and a fateful initiation of nuclear warfare by both sides.  More than 20 scenarios feature a mix of day and night operational missions for both sides, including missions to directly support frontline ground troops as well as many missions that &ldquo;go deep&rdquo; behind enemy lines to strike enemy airfields, logistics, and air defense networks.  These range in size from smaller, partial-map ones that can be played in an afternoon to very large, full-map scenarios that might take a couple of days to complete.  There are also scenarios depicting reconnaissance missions, airborne drops, helicopter assaults, special forces insertions, cruise missile strikes, and delivery of nuclear weapons.<br/><br/>Components<br/>Two 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; maps<br/>1,260 die cut counters<br/>One Rules Booklet<br/>One Scenario Booklet<br/>One Appendices Booklet<br/>Five Full-Color Player Aid Cards<br/>Three Full-Color Aircraft Data Cards<br/>Two 10-sided dice<br/>NATO and Warsaw Pact log sheets<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Martin Wallace's 2-player wargame for Treefrog's second line of games (2009-2010 series, 4th game of the series) dealing with the American Civil War - the players commanding either Confederate or Union forces. With Gettysburg Wallace wanted to produce a balanced rather than a historically accurate game. The game e.g. ignores casualty levels, and Units do not correspond exactly to brigades or divisions - even if the forces' proportion is close to historical accuracy.<br/><br/>The player pieces in Gettysburg are similar to those in Treefrog's previous wargame, Waterloo. Each day consists of four periods, and the game is played over three days, and key locations must be held by the end of one period.  Each player has eight numbered 'order blocks', ranking from two to five.  Players then place such blocks in the game areas, the order block allowing a number of orders to be issued that area.  The orders can activate units in the same or adjacent areas.  Orders are represented by discs, once the number of order discs in an area matches the value of the order block then no more orders can be issued.  The players will then have to remove the block and place a new one. If a player does not have enough order discs for the following period, he will be forced to pass for each disc he is short.  Assault combat is similar to Waterloo, the main exceptions are that the attacker and defender use different morale check tables. The defender is more likely to retreat than be eliminated, but there is also the chance of a counter-attack to throw back the assaulting forces. The Confederate player wins by taking two starred areas, or Little Round Top.<br/><br/>Only 1500 were produced all signed and numbered.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your family have come to Nevada City to set up a homestead and help the town grow. Will you be able to outperform the other homesteaders?<br/><br/>Each player in Nevada City starts the game with a nuclear family &mdash; mother, father, daughter, and son &mdash; and a homestead mat where you can establish farms, fence in livestock, and develop silver mines. You start the game with one mine, one farm, and one ranch, along with some money and an assortment of commodities. The town consists of a few buildings, and other buildings will become available for construction as the years advance, with the game lasting four years.<br/><br/>A year lasts a number of turns until all players have used all of their characters and hired workers. On a turn, a player chooses one of their characters and takes actions until all of that character's actions are spent; a character can't take the same action during a turn. A character can buy new property from city hall; mine, farm, or ranch their own property; claim a building; construct a building; use an existing building; reserve a contract that has conditions for improving the city; or work to fulfill that contract. Each character and worker has a different set of skills that can boost the actions they take, such as finding additional silver in a mine or bringing lumber to a construction site.<br/><br/>You earn victory points (VPs) for constructing buildings, in addition to fees from those buildings when other players use them. You earn VPs for completing contracts as well, with those contracts having different values depending on which buildings are in place at the time. Each player receives a private goal card at the start of the game, and all players score points for these goal cards based on how well they do relative to other players, so pay attention to their choices.<br/><br/>Each year, various events pop up, leaving players to suffer drought or reap the benefits of fertile land, among other things. At the end of a year, workers leave unless you marry them into a family, which will require spirits and other resources.<br/><br/>Nevada City also includes advanced rules that add additional buildings and events to the game, a gambling subgame of sorts, a more volatile production market to make life in the West less predictable, and extra sons and daughters. On top of all that, the unhired workers at the end of a year get rowdy and start shooting up the town, so you need to use your gunslinging abilities to bring them to heel and try to avoid getting wounded since you might lose out on a character's abilities in the subsequent year.<br/><br/>",

While South Pacific is a complete stand alone game, all of the tactics that work in EotS work in SPac. What is unique about SPac is the smaller map region (see C3i 30 back cover image) focuses and significantly simplifies the strategic options available to the two sides.<br/><br/>Each side has a 24 card deck that are like the EotS cards except they have been renumbered. The counter mix is also identical, except we have aligned the set up and reinforcement markings to the four-turn scenario. In designing this new C3i Scenario Variant, I wanted to put you in the shoes of MacArthur and Ghormley/Halsey prosecuting the US counterattack, while still being impacted by interservice rivalry, China, and competition for resources in Europe. All of the relevant tracks have been redesigned by Mark Simonitch to fit on the tailored C3i Mapsheet surface that shines a spotlight on the turning point in the Pacific War.<br/><br/>Since this is a subset of the broader war each player is playing with a four rather than a seven card hand, and you will never reshuffle the deck allowing for high replayability. The practical result of this smaller hand of cards is South Pacific typically clocks in at less than two hours, so easily a one-session game.<br/><br/>If you learn to how to play South Pacific you will also know how to play its parent game Empire of the Sun.<br/><br/>(from the designer)<br/><br/>",

Two to four players take on the roles of scientists working quickly to repair these worlds&rsquo; connections to their past, present, and future by making new time strands &mdash; however, every repaired connection ripples through time and fuels the Quake to fracture more worlds. When the storm&rsquo;s power fades, the most successful scientist will be hailed as a hero throughout the multiverse.<br/><br/>Paradox takes familiar board game elements such as card drafting, set collection, and resource management, then adds a Bejewelled-like grid of colorful disks for each player to manipulate, along with a universe of worlds that must be protected by game&rsquo;s end. As a result, Paradox presents players with a unique experience that is simple to learn yet challenging to master as players navigate three interlocking systems to protect these worlds from the chaotic forces of the Quake.<br/><br/>Paradox is designed by Brian Suhre and is illustrated by 15 artists, each with their unique view of one of the worlds. Paradox plays in about 20-30min per player.<br/><br/>UPC 748252122094<br/><br/>",

To best accomplish this, you&rsquo;ll need to share insights, discuss ideas with peers, and publish theories. And to stay invigorated, you&rsquo;ll likely need some coffee&mdash;lots of coffee.<br/><br/>Unconscious Mind is a euro-style game featuring worker placement, engine building, multiple rondels, and cascading effects. On your turn, you may place one or two Ideas (workers) on a central Meeting Table to access a variety of actions, such as adding tiles to your player board, drafting and playing cards, and moving around the city of Vienna. Where you place your Ideas also determines how far to advance your rondel&rsquo;s inkpot, activating a row or column of tile effects on your player board.<br/><br/>To treat your clients and interpret their dreams, you must work with a supply of Insight resources, which you&rsquo;ll manage on a multi-level dial. As you work through surface-level Manifest dreams into deep-seated Latent dreams, these Insights will help your clients reach catharsis. This is represented by lifting transparent layers from the client cards&mdash;unlocking their ongoing special abilities and end-game scoring opportunities.<br/><br/>Once the group has solidified its reputation, the end of the game is signaled, and the member with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To start a round, shuffle the deck of cards, which has five suits, and deal players their hand. Next, reveal a number designation card from a separate deck. Let's say it's 3.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to traditional trick-taking games. The lead player for a trick plays one card, and the other players must follow suit if possible, while throwing any other card if they can't. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless one or more trump cards were played, in which case the highest trump wins the trick &mdash; but at the start of the round, trump is undetermined! The first time a 3 is played, the color of that card becomes trump for the rest of the round. What's more...<br/><br/><br/>     The color of the second 3 played determines which color is worth 1 point per card at the end of the round.<br/>     The color of the third 3 determines the &quot;hund&quot; color; at round's end, the player(s) who don't have the most or fewest cards of this color each earn 3 points.<br/>     The color of the fourth 3 determines which color is worth -1 point per card.<br/>     The color of the fifth 3, which is evident as soon as the fourth 3 is played, allows the player who collects the most of these cards to determine the start player of the subsequent round after cards for that round have been dealt.<br/><br/><br/>The game includes color markers to track this information.

        "description": "New captains are sent to fight pirates.<br/>Bold captains are sent to fight Klingons.<br/>Only the clever Captains are sent to fight the crafty cloaked Romulans!<br/><br/>From the designer of Star Fleet Battles and Federation & Empire, Federation Commander: Romulan Border is a fast-moving game of starship combat in the Star Fleet Universe.  This is not an 'introduction' to some other title.  This is a product in an entirely new direction for the Star Fleet Universe, featuring production values expected by 21st-century gamers - mounted game maps, laminated full-color ship cards, full color counters, and laminated full-color play aids.<br/><br/>This is the second base set in the Federation Commander Series (Federation Commander: Klingon Border being the other). <br/>This is a complete game and does not require any other products for use. All other Federation Commander Products will work with Romulan Border.<br/> Components: 60-page Rev-4 rulebook, 216 half-inch and 20 one-inch full color die cut playing pieces, four full-color double-sided laminated player reference cards, sixteen full color double-sided laminated ship cards, six 8.5x11 hard-mounted double-sided map panels, two dice, paper clips for energy track, wipe-off marker.  Improvements over Klingon Border: Higher-quality maps (now used in both products), real wipe-off marker, latest revision rulebook, expanded Sequence of Play.<br/><br/>It is far more than just &quot;SFB Lite.&quot; It uses the best concepts from the best-selling space combat game of all time with Euro-Game production values and ease of play.<br/><br/>Key points include: <br/><br/>     A typical duel takes one hour<br/>     The largest fleet battles take four hours, not four days. <br/>     Energy is spent &quot;on the fly&quot; via a marker on a sliding scale. <br/>     Ship diagrams are laminated (multiple use, no photocopies!). <br/>     Color coded charts and ship cards make it easier remembering what goes where.<br/>     Expansions include more ships, more scenarios, more maps - not complex new rules. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crimson Skies is a character-based board game of dogfighting and dive bombing in an aviation-dominated world; a simple, fast-playing game of pulp-fiction-style air combat.  It is a game about the men and women who pilot flying nightmares, the metal-sheathed birds of prey that spit death from the sky.<br/><br/>In Crimson Skies, you are at the top of the aviation food chain - a fighter pilot, one of the fearless men and women who take to the skies each day for honor or profit.  Each player generates a minimum of two characters, a pilot and his or her wingman.  If your characters survive from mission to mission, they gain experience that can translate into better skills, and thus even better chances for future survival and success.  While this is a combat board game, not a roleplaying game, telling tales about your characters will invest the game with action, drama and humor, making the game-playing experience even more enjoyable.<br/><br/>",

The heart of the game is its innovative card combat system. The full-color cards allow the use of pikes, swords, war bands, elephants, heavy cavalry, foot skirmishers, light horse, siege towers, artillery, and galleys. Special cards allow you to develop better military leaders, diplomats, traders, and engineers. However, winning the game is not just about having the largest empire. The player with the largest army will also lose the most victory points, so he had better use his forces well. If warfare is not to your taste then you can trade your way to victory, by having the largest trading empire.<br/><br/>",

With this ambassador you will build a Faction, then set an Agenda for your Faction to pursue. By fulfilling your Faction's Agenda and accumulating Power, you will lead your race to a position of dominance and win the game. You may recruit allies (character cards) from among the other races, or try to rely only on your own people.<br/><br/>Will you use diplomacy, intrigue or military conquest as your stepping stones to power? Will you rise to dominance on your own merits, or will you seek the aid of an elder race, like the Shadows? If you do, beware, for there may be a price! Choose your actions wisely Your decisions decide the fate of the Galaxy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "More than 2500 years ago, the emperor of the Qin dynasty decided to protect his prolific provinces of northern China from the frequent barbaric invasions, building and joining several fortified fortresses. So he nominated his most faithful imperial officers to oversee the construction, promising riches and honours to the first who would have completed what now represents one of the most remarkable works produced by men: Chang Cheng&trade;, the Great Chinese Wall.<br/><br/>Take on the role of one of the 4 officers of the emperor and try to increase your reputation in his eyes. Build parts of the Great Wall to defend the Chinese provinces and compete with the other players to gain the reputation that comes from protecting the most important ones. But beware of the threat of the Mongols who hang near the border. . .<br/><br/>In this game of clever placement, players take turns adding pieces to the Great Wall. On one side of the wall lay the Chinese provinces, each with its own point value. On the other side are the provinces of the Mongol invaders, each with a randomly-assigned negative point value. Since provinces on either side do not directly correspond to each other, the goal is to place your pieces so that you can attain a majority on the Chinese side (for positive points) while avoiding having a majority on the Mongolian side (for negative points). Players also have a set of cards (tiles actually) that give them a few special privileges to help themselves or interfere with other players.<br/><br/>The game also comes with optional cards that may be used to provide other methods of scoring points.<br/><br/>",

Strategy cards differ by color, duration and effects, and can be used to boost one team&rsquo;s game or to inhibit the opponent's strategy.<br/><br/>Coaches can play UND1C1 with one of the featured set teams or draft players to compose their best XI. Strategy card decks can also be customised, as the whole UND1C1 collection counts more than 100 unique cards.<br/><br/>UND1C1 simulates real match dynamics in a simple and intuitive fashion, not leaving aside tactics and strategy. The game mechanics are a mix of German and American elements in which the casual factor is balanced by positioning strategies and resources management.<br/><br/>The game features premium materials (including neoprene pitch and clay chips), original artwork by Marco Paradiso, collectable components and a number of expansions (some of which are currently in beta testing).<br/><br/>",

This is the first Dice Masters set that is sold as a contained set without the possibility to expand it with boosters.<br/><br/>In the game, each player brings a set of dice to the table; these form the player's team, from which only they can purchase dice. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase them.<br/><br/>During a turn, a player draws and rolls a number of their dice, purchases additional dice, and fields character dice to attack the other player. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.<br/><br/>TMNT Dice Masters is one of several planned Dice Masters games, all of which can be intermixed (or played alone).<br/><br/>",

As ravaging and looting will damage each side&rsquo;s reputation, each faction will strive to convince cites to join its side. Great battles will seek to kill or capture enemy lords&mdash;perhaps even a king. Two kinds of operational moves will be in play: the military and the political.<br/><br/>In the end, when the dust settles and all arrows have flown, one rose will sit on the throne. White or Red, York or Lancaster, gather your troops and banners and join the fight.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A few magically talented individuals, their devoted followers in tow, have been drawn from their villages across the twisted wilderness to the Ruined City.<br/><br/>At the very heart of the city, the cursed Tower of Magic rises into the broiling clouds. From this vantage the Archmage and her Order of Mages ruled these lands for an Age, drawing together the warring magics of the mythic races into one all-powerful and cohesive force. That was, of course, before The Ending.<br/><br/>The Ruined City is now home to but a fragment of the mythic races that once served the Archmage and her Order. And until now, no human has dared step foot in these forsaken streets. The newcomers, of human stock, are the descendants of the ancient Mages, now outcasts living in camps in the farthest reaches of the lands. Unusual shows of power in their home villages have already gathered them small but enthusiastic bands of followers. And now they have travelled to meet with representatives of the mythic races, to seek their wisdom and magical secrets.<br/><br/>The mythic races are the keepers of six very different spheres of magic, with very different abilities. It was only the power of the Archmage that long ago found ways to combine the spheres and gain higher and higher levels of magic. Now, much of the magic of the mythic races is lost, and the newcomers, having come so far, are told they must now travel the lands to reclaim lost relics sacred to the races. It seems the journey to absolute magical power has only just begun...<br/><br/>Archmage is a euro-thematic hybrid, where players take on the role of fledgling Mages, traveling the lands to recover ancient relics, gather followers, and train apprentices in six spheres of magic and beyond. As the power of their Order grows, they will pit apprentices against each other, and attain unheard of spells and magical powers, building their own Mage tower to watch over the lands and weave their magics.<br/><br/>When the time of reckoning comes, a new Archmage will rule.<br/><br/>Each turn is formed of two phases:<br/><br/><br/>     The Journey: A Mage travels across the map (formed of hex tiles): discovering new locations; deploying followers to gather relics from Ruins, Libraries, Sacred Glades, and other locations sacred to each of the mythic races; and encountering and dealing with the followers of their opponents. <br/>     Journey's End: A Mage will finish each Journey in a specific location where they can perform a specific action. <br/>         Ending a Journey on a Town will let the Mage call on their Followers to deliver the relics and resources they have gathered.<br/>         Ending in a Settlement (where the spurned descendants of the Mages fled after the Ending) will let a Mage recruit more Followers to their Order.<br/>         Ending with a Mythic Race will let the Mage train Followers as Apprentices specialising in the magic of that Mythic Race (at a cost of the Relics with which the magic must be weaved).<br/>         Ending in the Wilderness will let the Mage's followers take more physical control over the area. <br/>         Ending in the Mage's Tower (once it has been built), will let the Mage train and test their Apprentices. On the floor of the tower (player board) is a mandala in which the Apprentices stand. Moving apprentices on the mandala will change the sorts of spells the Order has access to. Testing apprentices sees one apprentice advance to a higher level and allows an Order to discover new spells and magics beyond what any of the Mythic Races could individually know, and to add to those magics to their spell library. <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Spells provide Mages with a range of options for strategic and tactical play. Archmage has a modular spell system, with 18 spells included in the base game, and expansions planned to add more sets. Spells are used by expending a cost in Relics, the magical currency of the game that is unique to each mythic race.<br/><br/>The game is played over a number of turns, depending on the player count. After the last turn, the Mage with the most powerful Order of Mages, is declared the new Archmage and power is restored to the lands... until the next time!<br/><br/>",

Don't let that fool you though - whilst this game takes minutes to learn, it takes ages to master. The rules are simple: using your stack of tiles, you try to make a line of five before any of your opponents can. Each tile must line up with the flat side of another (no placing corners on corners) and your line of five can go orthogonally or diagonally. If you manage to use all of your tiles and there's still no winner, you can reposition them one at a time. Whether you're from Albania or Zambia, speaking in Urdu or Zulu or playing against a rabbi or a Jedi, OK Play can go anywhere and be played by anyone, with anyone (even if you can't understand a word the other person is saying).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You then use those railroads to make deliveries that drive up the price of your stocks. At the end of the game, the player who has run the most profitable railroad while also owning the most valuable stocks becomes the greatest of all of the railroad rivals!<br/><br/>In more detail, Railroad Rivals is a tile-drafting and -laying game in which you build a railroad empire that stretches across America&hellip;and across your table. Each turn you draft one new city tile and one new railroad stock tile. You then lay one of your city tiles next to a city tile that is already on the table to create a link between the two cities. The matching edges must both have the same railroad on them. Each newly laid city gets one or more randomly drawn colored cubes placed on it that represent the goods that can be delivered from that city. After all players have laid their city tile, you deliver one goods cube using one of that city's railroad links. This gives you points and raises the value of that railroad stock.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, your score is the total of all of the points that you received from deliveries, from other players using your railroad links, and from the value of all of your railroad stock tiles.<br/><br/>",

In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards.

Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun.

Each turn, you will build structures in different provinces assigned to you through a rotating board. Balance war, politics, trade, and religion while scheming against your rival players.<br/><br/>In Age of Rome, each player is assigned a hero with their respective player board, then are given secret quests and starting resources of Denarii, Followers, Scheme tokens, Legions, and Votes. Then they spend nine rounds competing on a rotating board to earn Glory points.<br/><br/>Each round consists of four phases:<br/>1) Scheme phase: An Event card is revealed and turn order is determined; players activate Schemes in turn order.<br/>2) Building phase: Players build structures in turn order.<br/>3) Action phase: Players take actions by placing Followers in turn order.<br/>4) Income phase: Players receive Income and the Provinces board is adjusted.<br/><br/>Players can earn Glory points in various ways. They may build structures, place Followers to vote and win a majority, send Legions to conquer regions, trade or collect items, or even build a Pantheon.

The final score is determined and the player with the most Glory points is declared the new Emperor of Rome.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the year of Vespasian and Titus - the sixth such ordinary consulship that Titus shared with his Imperial father. The civil war of a decade ago is but a memory, and the Flavians have restored peace and order to all corners of the empire, save one. The people of Britannia remain fiercely resistant to the will of their Roman masters, and the emperor has charged YOU with the seemingly impossible task of bringing them to heel.<br/><br/>Agricola, Master of Britain is a solitaire game of governance and conquest. To master the delicate political situation, you will need the right blend of military force, administration, bribery, and diplomacy. Every action you take matters, changing how the native populace feels about you and your rule. But you'll never know exactly who's with you or against you, because the game tracks this &quot;under the hood&quot;, or, more precisely, &quot;in the cup&quot;.<br/><br/>Three chit-pull cups (Friendly, Unfriendly, and Hostile) represent the allegiances of the units contained within those cups. After each action you take, one or more of these units are blindly moved from one cup to another. You'll have a general idea of &quot;I'm really cheesing them off&quot; or &quot;I should have a lot of friendlies available for recruitment&quot;, but until you pull a chit, you won't know who your friends really are, or where the next rebellion will spring up. This isn't totally random: certain tribes naturally skew more in one direction or the other, and taking actions to stabilize a region after it's been pacified will diminish the chances of revolt there.<br/><br/>Building the right armies, and taking the right actions at the right time is key to your success. But the Flavians - and particularly the hated Domitian - expect greater and greater results with each campaign season. You'll need to meet and exceed them if you want to duplicate Agricola's achievement.<br/><br/>",

Bewildered but resolute, she set out to revisit all the planets in reverse order in the hope of retrieving all her lost memories.<br/><br/>Deja Vu: Fragments of Memory is about memory, but it is NOT a memory game; instead the game focuses on tableau-building and set-collecting, and to win the game, you must perform well both tactically and strategically. In the tactical part, players collect wooden tokens on the map with various combinations of color and shape, and both the color and shape are essential to success! The process of collecting is a pleasantly perplexing mind puzzle.<br/><br/>In the strategic part, players use the wooden tokens they gained to add cards to their tableau, building up their &quot;card engine&quot;, which serves to generate victory points, reinforce their resource-collecting ability, and improve the engine itself. Should you increase your selection of cards first? Or create more space to save up resources? Maybe you should plant more cosmic flowers? Balanced and efficient long-term planning is the key to victory.<br/><br/>The central cosmic map, aside from being a place to hold resources, is also a battlefield to contest precious memory fragments which, when paired with the right cards, can earn enormous amount of ictory points for you!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>During the summer of 1941, the forces of German Army Group North appeared to be advancing irresistibly toward Leningrad, the second largest city in the Soviet Union, and the birthplace of the Communist revolution. But Leningrad was a long way from the German border, and the closer the Germans got to it, the more difficulties they encountered with terrain, their own lengthening supply lines, and stiffening Soviet resistance.<br/><br/>In mid-July, approximately 100 miles south of Leningrad at Soltsy, a surprisingly strong Soviet force of about six divisions struck the German armored spearhead and pushed it back. The 8th Panzer Division did not suffer the catastrophic losses claimed by the Soviet, but attack did cause the Germans in this sector to halt for three crucial weeks before resuming their drive on Leningrad.<br/><br/>In August the Soviets launched another counteroffensive, this time with ten divisions, against the German flank south of Staraya Russia. Just as the German offensive against Leningrad renewed, the Germans diverted critical motorized reserves to deal with the threat, winning a strategically barren victory far from their true objective. When the Germans did reach Leningrad, they lacked the strength to break into the city itself.<br/><br/>The battles of Soltsy and Staraya Russia may well have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>&middot; 22 x 34 inch map sheet (19mm hexes - double sided)<br/>&middot; 3 sheets of 5/8&quot; counters<br/>&middot; Rules book, Play Book, set-up cards, and player aid cards<br/><br/>TIME SCALE  12 hours per turn  <br/>MAP SCALE  1.2 miles per hex   <br/>UNIT SCALE  Battalions and Companies<br/><br/>DESIGNERS Vance von Borries<br/>DEVELOPER Tony Curtis<br/>MAP &amp; COUNTER ART Mark Simonitch<br/><br/><br/><br/>(BGG description:)Roads to Leningrad is a package consisting of two separate operational level games on WW II --the Battle of Soltsy and the Battle of Staraya Russa.<br/><br/>Scenarios: <br/>1. The Battle of Soltsy: Manstein&rsquo;s LVI (Panzer) Corps was assigned the road through Soltsy and was told to advance rapidly east to Novgorod and then north to cut Leningrad off from the rest of Russia. Manstein was on such a quick and tight schedule, he had no time to cover his flanks - a fact local Soviet commanders quickly exploited.<br/><br/>2. Counter-Blow at Soltsy: Led by the powerful and highly decorated 70th Rifle Division, the Soviets quickly surrounded German armor at Soltsy, stopped German motorized infantry in the swamps to the north, and raided German supply columns to the German rear. Von Manstein, unflappable in a crisis, organized a counterattack to allow the 8th Panzer to escape. The German 8th Panzer Division permanently lost about 30 tanks (with many others damaged) and retreated 25 miles. It was a Soviet victory that might have saved Leningrad.<br/><br/>3. Battle of Staraya Russa: In early August, the Soviet High Command prepared a surprise counter-offensive south of Lake Ilmen to relieve pressure on the increasingly hard-pressed armies defending Leningrad. Within two days, Soviet mechanized units had penetrated 35 miles and threatened to surround German X Corps. The Germans will clearly need reinforcements; can they hold on until Manstein's motorized troops arrive?<br/><br/>4. Manstein Attacks: To solve the deepening crisis at Staraya Russa, the German command called on Manstein's LVI Corps. On the 19th he struck, crushing the Soviet flank division in one day. In three days, he surrounded Soviet 34th Army, forced most of it to surrender, and then pushed on east. German play in this scenario depends on the mobility and timing of Manstein's troops. The Soviet player knows he is about to be trapped but maybe one more push would break the German infantry to the north.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TSCHAK!' is a card game in which everybody gets to play with exactly the same hands. But who will be the most successful in avoiding the troglodytes and bigger monsters, while going for the fattest treasures, or even better, the legendary rings of power?<br/><br/>The card deck in TSCHAK! is composed of twelve wizards (blue), twelve warriors (green), twelve dwarfs (red) and four artifacts (purple). Before the first round, a player receives three wizards, warriors and dwarfs and one artifact. (When playing with fewer than four players, deal out hands to virtual players; these are not used during the current round.) Set up the keep by placing one monster and one treasure tile face up on each of the three levels.<br/><br/>Players now assault the keep, trying to avoid the monsters and claim treasure. On the first level, players choose one card from their hand, reveal it, choose another, reveal it, choose a third, and reveal it. A player must create a team of adventurers with three different colors, and the strengths of these teams (the sum of the cards' values) are then compared. (The chameleon wizard with a ? equals the strongest wizard on the table. The artifact doubles the weakest character on your team.) The weakest team gets the monster card, which costs points, and the strongest team gets the treasure card, usually positive points. Ties are broken in favor of the strongest wizard, then in favor of the wizard with the wand, then the strongest warrior, and so on.<br/><br/>On the second level, players reveal one card, then a pair of cards, then compare strengths. On the third level, players reveal three cards at the same time. Players then compare the last card in hand, gaining 0-3 gold depending on the strength of that final card.<br/><br/>Once all ten cards have been played, each player passes his whole hand to his left neighbour, a new dungeon is created, and you now play with the same cards as the player sitting to your right. After four rounds, the game ends and players tally their points. Some treasures and monsters are worth a set number of positive or negative points; others are worth the square of the number of them you've collected (whether positive or negative); additional treasures have special abilities, like eliminating one monster card from the tiles you've collected. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Good hand management, double-guessing, a tad of luck, and the victory is yours!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1000 Blank White Cards is a public domain card game, which allows the players to make the cards during the course of the game. There are no initial rules, and while there may be conventions among certain groups of players, it is in the spirit of the game to spite and denounce these conventions, as well as to adhere to them religiously.<br/><br/>Card Content<br/><br/>Cards may feature a title, a picture, a score, a rule, or any other content, and need not be limited to one side or even to a single card. Early iterations of the game included cards with attached objects, and cards of a variety of sizes and shapes within the same deck and gameplay session. Many cards in later decks have a point value, but this is by no means a requirement.<br/><br/>Cards generally include hand-drawn pictures. The game encourages quick sketches by non-artists, which can add to the overall ironic orientation of the game. Card illustrations can represent anything the designer wants to feature, from serious to absurd. (However, usually cards tend toward the latter.)<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Game play conventionally follows a &quot;draw one, play one&quot; rule, with standard rotation; however, this, as with any game parameters, can be arbitrarily altered in play.<br/><br/>In one variant, blank cards are simply made available to all players at all times, and can be created without limitation and played in turn. In other variants, players seed an otherwise blank deck with their own invented cards, which are shuffled in with blank cards to form a deck of about 60-90 cards. In this latter variant, a player may only craft a new card if he or she draws one of the blank cards during the course of play.<br/><br/>In most cases, unless countermanded or constrained by rules created during gameplay, players may play a card on themselves, on another player, or on all players. Card rules and actions may counter other cards which have already been played.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck is exhausted. Points may be tabulated and a winner declared. In some variants, players may then lay out all of the cards face-up for the &quot;epilogue&quot;, which allows players to choose the best cards to seed the deck for the next game. In other variants, all cards must be retained and reintroduced, regardless of perceived quality.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Dvorak<br/>    Nomic<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quietville needs a new mayor. Before the people vote, though, each candidate must govern a small part of this great city to prove his ability. Unfortunately, that's not an easy task. Quietville sits beside a frequently erupting volcano, happens to be the city of choice for alien invasions, and is a favorite playground of a mutant radioactive dinosaur &ndash; and these are only a few of the disasters Quietville must face! Whoever can build and protect the most prosperous city area, by avoiding or limiting the damage of these terrible disasters, will be elected new mayor of Quietville!<br/><br/>Quietville, a new edition of Bull in a China Shop/Der Elefant im Porzellanladen, includes Michael Schacht's &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; cards that give players the opportunity to perform different actions during the game.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Elephants and china don't go together especially well, and playing the card game Der Elefant im Porzellanladen will only strengthen that prejudice. The players collect china cards, and the collection grows through additional purchases. But players must take elephant cards in order to make more purchases, and elephants can lead to embarrassing consequences for their china collection, and therefore their score. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible by collecting china cards.<br/><br/>A short description of the game: Five elephant cards and five china cards (in three flavors: red, blue and green) are laid out. On a turn you either (1) pay money and buy china, (2) take an elephant (which might destroy your china) and earn money, or (3) pass, which you can do only once a game. The game has four scoring rounds, during which you choose one out of four scoring options; each option can be chosen only once. After four rounds, the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Samurai is the fifth entry in the award-winning Great Battles of History series and is easily the most exotic and visually stunning. Samurai covers all the major battles of the Sengoku Jidai (the Age of Warring Daimyos). Japan was truly a country at war. Because of the nature of 16th century Japanese warfare, it is also the easiest game in the series to play. The revamped command system simulates the clan-oriented levels of leadership, plus simplified shock and fire mechanics. Also included are individual samurai used to challenge opponents and collect the important severed heads. Ignore the challenge and lose face, or even be forced to commit seppuku on the spot.<br/><br/>Battles include the most unusual Okehazama, complete with burning castles, thunderstorms, and a historically victorious army out-numbered six to one; Anegawa; Kawanakajima; Mikata-ga-Hara; Nagashino, with the famous Takeda cavalry corps charging Oda's volley-firing musketeers; and the most famous battle to take place in Japan, Sekigahara. All the great leaders are there: Obu Nobunaga, Takeda Shingen, Uesugi Kenshin, and of course, Tokugawa Ieyasu.<br/><br/><br/>    The Anegawa 1570 - Nobunaga takes the offensive against his treacherous brother-in-law, Nagamasa. His objective is Nagamasa's castle of Odani.     <br/>    Sekigahara 1600 - The most decisive battle in the history of Japan. The rivals were I. Mitsunari and T. Ieyasu ... one would be Shogun.     <br/>    Kawanakajima 1561 - Uesugi Kenshin was determined to destroy Shingen once and for all. His objective was Shingen's Kaizu Castle.<br/>    Okehazama 1560 - One of Oda Nobunaga's finest victories, won by a small force against one much larger, at odds of about six to one!     <br/>    Nagashino 1575 - The culmination of Oda Nobunaga's brilliant military career and a milestone in Japanese history.     <br/>    Mikata-ga-hara 1572 - Takeda Shingen is pitted against the young Tokugawa Ieyasu in a furious battle.<br/><br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     20 minutes per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     100 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     100 men per strength point; individual leaders and samurai<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     One to four<br/><br/>DESIGNERS: Mark Herman and Richard Berg<br/>ART DIRECTOR/PACKAGE DESIGN: Rodger B.

On that fateful day, the ground trembled, the sky darkened, and rivers turned into dust.<br/>Today, the Outer Lands no longer grant their fruits. Our fields are no longer covered in green. Our children grow weaker by the day. <br/>Nihil is all over us.<br/>We cannot wait any longer. <br/>We must stand against the Void. <br/>It is time to prove that you deserve to be called a Hero. <br/>Lead your Faction in the battle against the Void. <br/>Become a Legend with its defeat... <br/>or fade away, forgotten by all, in an unsuccessful attempt.<br/>It is I, Leafly, <br/>Elder Druid of the Ash&rsquo;Nei Faction and Protector of Nimali, who calls to you.<br/>[Leafly's speech to the XXVII Factions' Ring] <br/><br/>Legends of Void is a 1-4 player strategy game, based on hand-management, engine-building, and area-control mechanics.<br/> OVERVIEW <br/>You'll play a Hero leading a Faction in the battle against the Void. The Void has summoned Seraphs, god-like creatures who threaten the Outer Lands, draining its life and replacing it with Nihil.<br/>You have a common goal: banish all the Seraphs from the Outer Lands. But you compete with each other to gain the favor of Lumen, the Flying City of the Eternals, rulers of all known lands.<br/><br/>HAND-MANAGEMENT<br/>During the game, you will buy and cast Lumen scrolls, which have a variety of effects: conjuring animal familiars, gathering magical berries, evoking a fireball, stealing Gold from other players.<br/>Scrolls can increase your production, grant unique actions, and empower your Hero. The game has 216 unique scrolls, and in addition to these, there are 45 Gift scrolls, which are awarded to Heroes during setup to empower and distinguish them even more.<br/>Acquiring a Lumen scroll for your hand costs 3 Gold. Casting a scroll takes Gold, and sometimes additional resources and requirements.<br/><br/>ENGINE-BUILDING<br/>There are nine types of resources:<br/>&bull;    Gold, Mithril, Mana, and Hero resources. These can be directly produced. <br/>&bull;    Dark Matter and Genasi, which descend from Mana.<br/>&bull;    Creature, Spirit, and Artifact, which can only be present on specific scrolls.<br/>Your basic income of Gold, as well as your base score, is based on your Lumen Rating. It starts at 13 and increases only when you damage a Seraph. You can damage a Seraph in many ways: fighting it directly with your Hero, sealing a Portal, scorching a Nihil, blooming a Vytae, or through actions granted by your Hero, Faction, and certain scrolls. Usually, to damage a Seraph, your Hero or one of your Areas must be near it.<br/><br/>AREA-CONTROL<br/>The Outer Lands are a map made up of six Regions, randomly chosen from eight double-sided tiles. They form a disc with the Void at its center. The Seraphs threaten every Region. Here and there, Portals and Nihil infect the Lands. In a Stronghold on the edge of the map, you are preparing for the battle.<br/><br/>GAME FLOW<br/>Legends of Void is split into years and seasons. In each year:<br/>&bull;    Spring: you buy new Lumen Scrolls to expand your options.<br/>&bull;    Summer: you take Actions, spending resources to counteract the Void and its Seraphs.<br/>&bull;    Autumn: you generate more resources to pay for Scrolls and Actions next year.<br/>&bull;    Winter: the Void stirs, and the Seraphs spread corruption across the Outer Lands.<br/><br/>ENDGAME<br/>Legends of Void ends immediately when one of these happens: <br/>&bull;    You banish all Seraphs, making the Outer Lands safe, and Lumen awards the winning Hero with the title of Legend. <br/>&bull;    You reveal the last Event from the Void-Deck and run out of time. The Void probably erupts, swallowing everything. A Hero still wins, but the Outer Lands are doomed.<br/>Endgame scoring depends on how the game ends. The Hero with the most Lumen Points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer-<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with four amazons (which move as chess queens, but do not capture) placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board.  On a player turn, he moves one amazon and then fires an arrow from the arrival position. Firing an arrow consists in placing a new arrow piece on the board; also the arrow moves like a queen from the position it is fired. The landed arrow doesn't move anymore and creates a permanent block on the board. Arrows can not be passed through by either amazons or other arrows.  The first player who can not make a legal move (move and then shoot) loses the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Die Dolmeng&ouml;tter is an area majorities game, where players move their druids on the board, building stone circles and marking them with their dolmens. Once a circle is complete, the dolmens are scored. Each dolmen has a value of 1&ndash;4, unknown to other players, and the value of each dolmen is multiplied, depending on how high it is in the stack &mdash; the higher the better.<br/><br/>Placing of dolmens requires players to interact. When a druid leaves a space, he leaves a stone behind. Once a player has a majority of stones around a dolmen space (at least two stones, with another player having one stone), she gets to place a dolmen. If another player adds a stone so the amount of stones is tied (2-2, for example), he gets to place a dolmen beneath the stack. When somebody again gets the majority (3-2, for example), he or she places a dolmen on top of the stack. Making sure your 4-point dolmen gets on the top of the stack in a large, valuable area is something of a challenge.<br/><br/>The game ends when somebody runs out of dolmens or stones. Unfinished areas are scored in the end (finished areas are scored as soon as they're done) and the player with the highest points wins the game.<br/><br/>The description from the publisher's website describes what the theme is about:<br/><br/>Die Dolmeng&ouml;tter is a luck-free majorities game. Move through dark and mystical Ireland, create the valuable stone circles and mark them with your dolmen, without your fellow players knowing their worth. Only at the end is it clear who has created the most valuable dolmen.<br/><br/>Approximately 240 stone circles of Celtic origin have been found so far in Ireland. These stone circles, which originate in ancient times and were built by druids, often served as ritual places or enclosed burial areas. In their center were frequently dolmen, which rank among the oldest megaliths and whose meaning is still not perfectly clear.<br/><br/>The artistic representation of gods on the dolmen - Dolmeng&ouml;tter - led to the assumption that the dolmen served the druids as meditation areas, in which their reincarnation-based cult was practiced.<br/><br/>",

Each round before players take their turn, a plague card will be revealed which shows how the plague will spread in that round.

        "description": "Under a vile curse, the forest is slowly dying. A few druids, last guardians of this green and endangered kingdom, answer the call of the helpless animals. Save the forest and become its protector!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>In Nemeton, you have ten&nbsp;moons&nbsp;(ten turns) to explore&nbsp;the forest, create new potions, and summon the spirit of animals to earn as many reputation points as possible.<br/><br/>A player's turn has four phases &mdash; night, dawn, day, and dusk &mdash; then the next player takes their turn.<br/><br/>At night, the druid summons the power of the moon to grow sacred plant essences in the forest. The player adds a &ldquo;Forest&rdquo; tile to the existing forest on the &ldquo;Moon&rdquo; side. Once the tile is placed, the player checks if he can link it in a straight line with another &ldquo;Forest&rdquo; tile of the same type (river, clearing, rock or earth),&nbsp;in any direction. The player then places the resources of a certain type on the activated tiles.<br/><br/>At dawn, the player turns over the &quot;Forest&quot; tile he just placed on the &quot;Day&quot; side. He can now discover a path leading to a sacred place: an Oak, a spring, or a Nemeton. If it&rsquo;s the case, the player picks the corresponding &quot;Sacred place&quot;&nbsp;tile in the reserve and adds it to the forest by connecting it to the tile he just added.<br/><br/>By day, the player will move the druid to take the proper course of action depending on the &quot;Forest&quot; tiles on which he is walking: gathering all the resources on a simple tile, creating potions with those resources near a Nemeton, or earning the trust of animals.<br/> <br/>Exploring the forest isn&rsquo;t easy. When moving forward, a druid can use a power to take winding paths and change directions or enjoy a boost in movements that go in a straight line. However, the player will have to choose between resting and getting back the power to move forward or getting a triskel to earn more points.<br/><br/>If he wishes, the druid can use a sacred plant, the archangel plant, to turn into a crow and to fly to any &quot;Oak&quot; tile on the board. He can summon the spirit of an animal to obtain its special powers and then use them during a special move (swap a resource, find a shortcut, etc.)<br/><br/>At dusk, if the druid helped to heal the forest by successfully doing virtuous deeds, he puts his token on the accomplished goal, giving him one more resource as well as bonus points at the end of the game if he is the first of the players to do so.<br/><br/>Once his turn is over, it&lsquo;s the turn of the next player until all players have laid down their 10 &quot;Forest&quot; tiles.<br/><br/>Then the players must count their reputation points:<br/>Each potion gives the points indicated on the card.<br/>The goals show the number of points given.<br/>The animals give points depending on the different streaks.<br/>Each triskel gives two points.<br/><br/>The player with the most reputation points wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Baptism By Fire: The Battle of Kasserine, February 1943 chronicles the first real ground operations by the US Army in the ETO in WW2. Every wargamer knows this battle was a severe Allied setback. What is not obvious, however, is that Allied troops on the ground gave a good account of themselves against the remnants of Rommel's vaunted Afrika Korps, despite the ineffective and confused leadership that existed at Corps level.<br/><br/>In the end, while GIs and Tommies fought their guts out to make up for the mistakes of their leadership, the advantages achieved by initial Axis successes were allowed to blow away in the wind by an equally detached and confused Axis High Command. In its case, how to best exploit the results of their initial attack depended on an argument raging within the Italian Commando Supremo and the persuasive abilities of Albert Kesselring and Erwin Rommel. After much discussion and the loss of several crucial days, the Axis decided on the less ambitious plan, which was itself no longer even possible.<br/><br/>Baptism By Fire is the second game in the Series: Battalion Combat Series (MMP), which took players by storm with its block buster initial release Last Blitzkrieg: Wacht am Rhein, The Battle of the Bulge. The game is designed as a more accessible entry to the system for those who want something smaller and faster than the earlier monster game. Here the wide open desert, limited number of Formations, and short scenario length provide players with a rapid and fun introduction to the series, the chance to develop their play skills to become a more effective BCS player overall, and to take a good look at this poorly understood battle.<br/><br/>Once again, the masterful order of battle research by Carl Fung showcases the forces involved with more fine detail than ever before. As a result, the common misconceptions of hapless GIs and Afrika Korps supermen is put to rest.<br/><br/>To give players a better feel for the pulse of the battle, the Germans run rampant for a few turns but then must idle back for several more while their commanders figure out what the overall objective will be. The player selects this objective randomly in the middle of the game, and it determines his Victory Conditions. This precludes the Axis player from overusing his limited combat power beforehand (since he might be going down the wrong road, literally) and keeps the Allies off balance as they must protect against both possibilities.<br/><br/>With a campaign game of only 10 turns, multiple plays are readily possible and various strategies for both sides can be explored.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>    Kasserine Campaign, 2 maps, 10 Turns<br/>    Operation Spring Wind, 1 map, 4 Turns<br/>    Mid-Campaign Start, 2 maps, 5 Turns<br/>    Between a Rock and a Hard Place, 1 map, 5 Turns<br/>    End Campaign Start, 2 maps, 3 Turns<br/>    High Water Mark, 1 map, 3 Turns<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    BCS rulebook (version 1.1, in full color)<br/>    Two BCS Charts and Tables<br/>    BCS Crib Notes Booklet<br/>    BBF Game Specific rulebook<br/>    Two 22&rdquo; x34&rdquo; Full Color Game Maps<br/>    560 Counters (one sheet of units and one BCS marker sheet)<br/>    6 scenarios total, 3 one-map scenarios<br/>    Box and Dice<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Turn: 1 day<br/>    Hex: 1 mile<br/>    Units: Battalion (w/a few Companies)<br/><br/><br/>(description from MMP website and user)<br/><br/>",

Ever larger and faster steamships revolutionized maritime traffic. Daring shipping companies opened steamship lines to the major ports worldwide. Modern steel juggernauts replaced traditional sailing vessels and competed intensely for dominance on the shipping routes.<br/><br/>Build yourself a thriving merchant fleet, and guide it to economic prosperity. Acquire the most modern steamships on the market and take over the precious ports from your rivals. Build an extensive network of trading posts and coal bunkers to expand the capability of your fleet. Make use of diverse options to carry out lucrative transports and win the prestigious Blue Riband of the North Atlantic.<br/><br/>Crossing Oceans picks up the theme and some elements of the 2017 board game Transatlantic, composing an entirely new game on a large historical map.<br/><br/>During their turn, a player can put a ship on the board or take a contract, use contracts in three different ways (optional), and choose an action on the rondel. (The main difference in this design is that it's a rondel game, not a card-driven game.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Rackham Website:<br/><br/>HYBRID <br/><br/>The Steel Age<br/>Whereas it is with the head of the young empire of the Scorpion, Dirz is suddenly had by a vision of apocalypse. It launches out then to body lost in a secret project to the worrying name: the Hybrid Code. Alas, Shamir, the Alchemical capital is attacked by mysterious warriors; Dirz disappears before to have been able to enjoy the fruits of its dark intentions. The laboratories of the Hybrid Code, private of resources, die out in their turn and sink in the lapse of memory.<br/><br/>The Age of Darkness. <br/>The incommensurable energy released by the ritual of the Paddle, in the heart of Second Shamir, flows through the continent of Aarklash and reactivates the disastrous sanctuaries of the Hybrid Code...<br/><br/>Nowadays, in Akkylannie. <br/>The population of the village of Glasinhar must face a terrible threat to which it is not prepared: monsters emerge from the entrails of the ground and are devoted to a massacre.<br/>Only a handle of warriors interposes between the impious creatures and the remainder of the continent: valorous Templiers of the Cabin of Hod.<br/> Hybrid Game Box<br/><br/>Before disappearing, Dirz the Heresiarch, founder of the Empire of the Scorpion, nourished a shadowy project: Code Hybrid. Many decades later, Dirz's forgotten laboratories mysteriously reactivated themselves... Today, monsters spring from the innards of the earth! Only has handful of warriors stand<br/> between these impious creatures and the rest of the world: the Griffins of the Lodge of Hod. <br/>Come and join has blood-filled battle in the gloomy underground laboratories!<br/><br/>The Hybrid&copy; game box includes 13 figurines, 1 Hybrid&copy; rule book, 110 cards, 9 playing boards and 2 dice. <br/>(in French on the site; badly translated here)<br/><br/>Take part in a bloody battle in the corridors of lugubrious laboratories! <br/>Presented in preview at the time of the last show of the Monde de Jeu, HYBRID is the new game of the Rackham range. <br/>Although the action proceeds in the universe of Aarklash, the principles of play are very different from those of Confrontation and Rag' Narok : the game of Hybrid proceeds on richly detailed, square modular game tiles.<br/><br/>You can achieve the ten perilous missions suggested in the basic booklet or to invent your own laboratories! <br/>The mechanisms are also innovative: Hybrid is played with dice with d10&rsquo;s. The capacities of each combatant are described in four characteristics to which many special Aptitudes are added, as the ability to emit an aura of battle or to become stronger after each death inflicted upon the enemy. The tables of Capacities, as for them, describe the prowesses that your warrior can carry out at the critical times in the battle!<br/><br/>The basic box contains two factions: the Griffons of Akkylannie, represented by Templars of Hod , and the impious creatures of the Alchemists of Dirz . These figurines is delivered with the reference cards which also make it possible to play them Confrontation and Rag' Narok. All are compatible: the majority of the references for Confrontation and Rag' Narok will be able, in the long term, to be used within the framework of the Hybrid game. <br/>Templars of Hod include Worthy Ambrosius , wise equipped with mysterious capacities, like three R&eacute;purgateurs and their Seneshal , of frightening warriors trained with the special operations. <br/>Against the combatants of the Light, the children of the H&eacute;r&eacute;siarque are short handed: not less than four Plagues of Flesh the corridors in the search of victims. Three Hybrids represent the prototype of the warrior of excellence imagined formerly by Dirz itself. The Alchemical perfection carries a name and a horrible face: Aberration . Nothing seems to be able to stop this living nightmare which has the power of a machine of war and the speed of an unforeseeable storm...<br/><br/>Note finally that the amateurs of conversion were not forgotten: the arms of R&eacute;purgateurs and Hybrid are interchangeable and make it possible to create several models starting from the same base. <br/>Will you be able to take up the challenge of H&eacute;r&eacute;siarque?<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Hybrid Expansion 1 - Nemesis<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Blood &amp; Roses focuses on the battles of the Wars of the Roses in England, between 1455 and 1487. This was warfare in which most men were truly &quot;of iron&quot;, heavily and totally armored to such a point that their mobility was suspect. It was also the introduction of gunpowder &ndash; mostly field artillery &ndash; in noticeable numbers. And while many English men-at-arms were mounted, they did so almost entirely for transport. Most fighting was on foot &hellip; and it was quite vicious.<br/><br/>Historical Note: The game&rsquo;s title refers to the heavy casualty rates and the names given to many of the fields after the battles: Bloody Meadow, Bloody Field, et al. <br/><br/>Blood &amp; Roses is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no &quot;turns&quot; - play is Continual, with ample opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll. Playing time is about 1-2 hours, per battle.<br/><br/>Battles:<br/><br/>    1st St. Albans (22 May 1455) marks the first major engagement in the Wars of the Roses. Richard, Duke of York and his ally, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, defeated the Lancastrians under Edmund, Duke of Somerset, who was killed during the battle. York also captured Henry VI and forced Henry to appoint him Constable of England.<br/>    Blore Heath (23 September, 1459) where greatly outnumbered Yorkist infantry used the longbow and a defensive position to drive off the Lancastrian Men-at-Arms.<br/>    2nd St. Albans (17 February, 1461) where the Lancastrians drove the Yorkists out of the town and then destroyed Warwick&rsquo;s strangely deployed army, even when sturdily defended by hedges, caltrops and spiked netting.<br/>    Towton (29 March, 1461) is easily biggest battle in the box and the biggest in the entire series. It uses over 200 combat units and, much like the actual battle, will probably take a long time to play. It is mostly crash and bash, with little room for maneuver, all fought in a blinding snowstorm!!<br/>    Barnet (14 April, 1471) a classic battle of planned deployments, but overlapping wings, cries of treason in the lines, fog of war (actual fog), and the excellent use of reserves. <br/>    Tewksbury (4 May, 1471) a battle that shows one of the key terrain features of the battles in this era, extensive hedges and thick underbrush in otherwise clear fields.<br/>    Bosworth(22 August, 1485) the best-known battle of the wars and the tragic (I think) death of King Richard III in a battle he should have won. Using the latest information as to where the battle took place, let&rsquo;s see if you can cancel out the Tudor dynasty.<br/><br/><br/>Each game includes:<br/><br/>    Two double-sided 22&quot; x 32&quot;game-maps<br/>    2.5 sheets of counters<br/>    Rules Booklet<br/>    Battle Book<br/>    Charts and Play Aids<br/>    2 ten-sided dice<br/><br/><br/><br/>Designer:  RICHARD H.

His Mobius Ring invention promised to change the world, but has instead given us our greatest disaster. Meant to provide the world with unlimited clean energy, the Mobius Ring malfunctioned, bathing Dr. Strobal in radiation, and creating a singularity that threatens to consume the world. We need him back, and the only way to revive him from his coma is to enter his subconscious and free him from the demons found within.<br/><br/>Comanauts is the second installment in Jerry Hawthorne's Adventure Book system following Stuffed Fables. This game of exploration and danger builds on the mechanisms first introduced in that earlier title, providing a new experience for more mature players. Race against time to revive Dr. Strobal by exploring his tormented mind. As players work together to uncover the secrets of the doctor's subconscious, they will follow his inner child across eleven different Comazones. There they attempt to locate and overcome the Inner Demon that holds Dr. Strobal hostage. Assume the role of 22 unique avatars as you explore the dangers and secrets of each world locked inside the doctor's dream. Can you free Dr. Strobal from his own mind before it's too late?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Coin Age is a microgame for two players that's played with a single card and pocket change. Players take turns placing coins on a map to control spaces, outmaneuver their opponent, and score victory points.<br/><br/>Coin Age uses an innovative &quot;coin slap&quot; mechanism to determine available actions. On a player's turn, they take one of each of their remaining types of coins in hand (one quarter, one nickel, one penny, and one dime), shakes them up, then slaps them on the table. Based on the number of coins that match their &quot;side&quot;, players can then either place coins on the map, move previously placed coins to an adjacent space, or remove them altogether. When placing coins, players may also place their coins on top of the opponent's coins if their size/rank is smaller, so while a quarter will give you the most victory points at the end of the game, it has the highest probability of being covered by your opponent.<br/><br/>Coin Age is a quick-playing area control game with lots of player interaction and a bit of push-your-luck gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/> The Great Battles of History series ventures back into the mists of time: the Bronze Age, or the Age of the Chariot. From approximately 1700 BC to 1200 BC (which was the abrupt end of the Bronze Age) the chariot reigned supreme on the battlefield. It was the first modern weapons system, and chariots controlled most of warfare until actual cavalry appeared in the middle of the Iron Age.<br/>  <br/>But how did chariots work as a tactical weapons system? There is no complete historical agreement on what exactly they did or how they were used, but Chariots of Fire will show you our view of their many applications - and many types of chariotry there were - providing GBoH players with the complete and definitive chariot rules. These rules cover combat and mobility from the first battle wagons of the Sumerians to the two-man, fast-moving light chariots of the Egyptians, often complete with their associated and specialized Runner Infantry, to the heavy 3-man Hittite wheels.<br/> To simulate these ancient tactical details Chariots of Fire presents you with nine battles:<br/>Sumer (ca 2320 BC) - featuring the legendary Sargon the Great<br/>Sekhmen (1875 BC)<br/>Megiddo (ca 1479 BC)<br/>Senzar (1470)<br/>The Astarpa (1312 BC)<br/>Kadesh (1300 BC)<br/>Nihriya (1230 BC)<br/>Babylon (1225 BC)<br/>and Troy (1200 BC) - including an extra: Homer's heros!<br/><br/>And of armies Chariots of Fire has plenty, and a truly colorful bunch they are: Sumerians, Akkadians, all sorts of Egyptians, Canaanites, Hittites, Mitanni, Arzawans, Assyrians, Babylonians, and the Mycenaean Age Greeks.<br/><br/>Game Features<br/>TIME SCALE     20 minutes per turn  <br/>MAP SCALE     100 yards per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE      350 men per mounted unit <br/>PLAYING TIME     1-3 hours<br/><br/><br/>(from BGG description:)<br/><br/>Historical Note: The period following The Bronze Age, from what is known as The Catastrophe of ca. 1200 BC to the rise of the Greek city-states, is almost totally devoid of any sort of information, and that includes archaeological  remains. It is the true Dark Age of history. When the area emerged from that era, warfare had undergone major changes and chariots had been relegated to the sidelines.<br/><br/>Three errata counters for Chariots of Fire were included in C3i #24.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Looterz, players are racing to collect the most loot possible by recruiting a team of Looterz. Your loot is never safe though as many Looterz have the ability to steal Loot from other players.<br/><br/>A player's turn involves four phases: Recruitment, Looter Activation, Recruitment, then Sacrifice. Each recruitment phase allows the player to draw a card from the deck or put a Looter from their hand into play. Players are then allowed to choose to activate their Looterz in any order. Finally, if players have more than three Looterz in play, they must discard down to three.<br/><br/>Looting is resolved by rolling dice. The number of hearts on a Looter indicates the number of dice a player may roll during the Loot resolution.<br/><br/>",

Whoever has the most ankhs in each color now claims any cubes of this color from the tray. (In a tie, no one claims these cubes.) Players then tally their points, and whoever has the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

Suddenly, out of the bushes, hordes of zombie animals are rushing towards you. Do they want to steal your marshmallows? Not at all! It's your brains they want to cube and roast over the campfire. Your goal in Oh My Brain is to rid yourself of these assailants &mdash; that is, the cards in your hand &mdash; as quickly as possible to avoid gradually losing your mind because losing your brain entirely means being transformed into a zombie...and losing the game!<br/><br/>The card deck consists of cards numbered 0-19, and to start a round of play each player takes three cards from the deck and places one in their &quot;cemetery&quot; (a card holder) and the other two in their hand. They then do this twice more to have a hand of six cards and a cemetery of three cards. Each player starts with a number of brain tokens.<br/><br/>On a turn, you must play to the central pile (campfire), playing a number higher than the current highest number. You can play multiple copies of the same number, and if you do, you place all copies of that number after the first one into the cemetery of one or more opponents. You can always play a 0, which restarts the pile. If you play an 8, the next player must play lower than an 8, then the pile ascends again. If you play an 11, you take another turn. If you play certain high or low cards, you must roll the special die, which may have you play again, steal a brain from another player, swap campfires with an opponent, or take some other action.<br/><br/>If you cannot play, you lose a brain token, clear the pile, draw two cards, place one of those cards in your cemetery, then start the pile again by playing from your hand. If you have fewer than three cards in hand at the end of a turn, refill your hand to three from the cards in your campfire. If you have played all of your cards, success! You have fended off the zombie animals, and all opponents lose a brain token for each card in their hand and cemetery. If any player has no brains remaining, the player with the most brain tokens wins; otherwise, shuffle the cards and play another round, starting with the player who has the fewest brains.<br/><br/>",

Since all cards show their color on the back, the players have more information than usual.

This strategy might backfire, however, if cards of the wrong color make it into a trick and you're aiming for a low score in that color.<br/><br/>During each trick, you must follow suit, even with the special trump cards.

Each one of you has been accused of various crimes that you didn't commit, and you'll have to uncover the truth throught a campaign divided into 3 acts. While being linked narratively, each scenario can be played individually, and there's no obligation to play them in the campaign's order.<br/><br/>Each scenario come as a 6x6 grid, in which you can find different types of colored boxes. Each box's color corresponds to a type of proof, and at the beginning of the game, each player will draw a card for each type of proof on the grid. This combination of cards is your neighbour's solution, so each player will be responsible for the solution of another player. Turn after turn, each player asks select questions that will help not only them, but everyone else playing as well. The goal is to find out your solution before you run out of questions, as you only have a limited number of questions to ask before the scenario ends!<br/><br/>At the end of the scenario, the players announce what they think their solution is. If everyone is right, you've won. If not, it looks like your group has lost...<br/><br/>Almost Innocent is higly modular: each scenario has 3 difficulty levels, to accomodate every type of players, from newcomers to experienced veterans of deduction games.<br/><br/>As you progress throught the scenarios, you'll unlock different modules. After all, each one of you is a character in their own right, it's only fair that you may have you very own powers...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, if you want a more boardgame-like experience, you can download all the other artwork, and mount it on cardboard, illustration board (my new favorite mounting material) or foam core.<br/><br/>The starting layout can be set up randomly, or for an additional challenge, one of the author's predefined Scenarios can be used.<br/><br/>Using tribes to expand your civilization, create cities, buy advances, build wonders and go on expeditions, while preparing for the devastation that random events will bring.

In those hostile conditions, nomadic clans struggle to survive with the regular and puzzling outbreak of steam columns everywhere on the continent. These columns are a testament to intense subterranean heat sources. They free earth from the grasp of ice and allow mankind to grow food once again. These oases of heat are vital for survival...and, unfortunately, only transient. To make things worse, a strange sickness spreads around them: The Bane. It affects both mind and body, and to this day, no cure has been found. Handling it is necessary to the survival of the clans.<br/><br/>Steamwatchers is a 2 to 5 player game in which you play as the leader of a nomadic clan. You will struggle over the geothermal resources of Europa in scenarios that last from 3 to 6 rounds. At the end of the last round of the chosen scenario, the winning clan is the one with the most geothermal resources (steam columns and farms), but a clan can claim victory before the end of the scenario by acquiring 10 geothermal resources.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The usurper Pelias gave Aeson his word that when Jason will come of age, he will give crown and throne to the young prince, but that was a promise he did not intend to keep. When Jason, a young man now, confronted Pelias and asked him to honor his word, the usurper tasked Jason with a seemingly impossible quest to prove that he is worthy of the throne of Iolkos. He had to recover the Golden Fleece from the distant city of Kolchis. Jason accepted and sent word to famous heroes to aid him in his quest. Hercules, Orpheus, the brothers Kastor and Polydefkis, Laertes the father of Ulysses, were some of the 50 heroes who answered Jason&rsquo;s call and joined him in his noble quest on board the legendary ship &ldquo;Argo&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Argonauts is a cooperative game that requires careful strategic planning and just a bit of luck, as even the best laid plans, can fall victim to the wrath of the Gods. The game&rsquo;s objectives are to acquire the Golden Fleece and return safely to Iolkos without losing Argo or too many members of her crew. Each player controls heroes that participated in the Argonaut campaign, each with his / her own set of skills and special abilities. Following the journey from the myth, the Argonauts must face mythical monsters like Scylla and Harybdis, Harpies, Sirens, the construct Talos and the dragon guarding the Fleece, not to mention the perilous journey full of lethal encounters with merciless pirates or having to weather destructive thunderstorms all the while making sure their cargo hold is well stocked with the necessary supplies for the journey to and from Kolchis and their ship sea-worthy.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players must decide which of their characters will participate in the encounter they face, dealing with threats with either might or cunning and keeping in mind that these characters will be unavailable to face the next encounter due to exhaustion. But the Argonauts are not alone in their quest. The Gods occasionally take interest in their actions, either helping or hindering the progress of our heroes, laying careful plans to waste&hellip;<br/><br/>",

All those pirates you loved - Black Bart Roberts, Long Ben Avery, Ned Lowe, L'Ollonais, and, of course, Edward Teach (Blackbeard) - 23 in all, are still there, as are the King's Commissioners sent out to stop them. However, the entire play system has been overhauled, and the result is a game that highlights and specializes in player interaction, with almost no down time for any players.<br/><br/>Players represent individual pirates, using them to gain Victory Points by amassing booty and, even more importantly, earning Notoriety for their dastardly deeds. Seizing merchants with cargo ranging from useless paper to the monumental treasure of the Mughal emperors, attacking and sacking ports, fighting storms and scurvy, seeking safe haven in infamous pirate ports such as Tortuga and Madagascar, and, hopefully, using Letters of Marque to retire successfully.<br/><br/>And while the player is doing this, all of the other players, at the same time, are playing their cards and seizing opportunities to stop the pirates. There is a constant interplay among players, and you never know what is going to happen when you set out to do something.<br/><br/>We've simplified movement (no more hexes) and ship battles, we've expanded the use of Royal Navy warships, we've even added individual hostages!

One player controls the Western Allies and the other the Soviet Union in their joint effort to destroy the Axis. Though the two players share the goal of defeating the Reich, each seeks a victory that favors their dominance in post-war Europe. To this end, each player controls two factions:<br/><br/><br/>     The Western player commands the Western Allies faction and the OKH faction, that is the German and minor Axis armies battling the Soviet Union in the east (Oberkommando des Heeres).<br/>     The Soviet player commands the Soviet faction and the OKW faction, that is the German and Italian armies facing the Western allies in the west (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht).<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay is driven by Downfall&rsquo;s innovative initiative track. The faction with the initiative chooses an order, pays its initiative cost by advancing their marker along the track, and performs the order. Then, the faction with the initiative (based on the updated positions of the markers) chooses the next order. There is no set sequence of play; initiative expenditures determine who goes next. The progress of faction markers along the track also trigger strategic events, changes in weather, and advancement of game turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In each of the nine rounds, players simultaneously and secretly program orders to send teams of adventurers out to do the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Recruit more adventurers.<br/>    Attempt increasingly difficult contracts to gain money, fame and other rewards.<br/>    Hire builders to upgrade their guild to increase their capacity to do all of that more.<br/><br/><br/>All players then sequentially resolve their planned orders, starting with each players' 1st order, then 2nd order and so on, and in the order they appear on the board (builders, then adventurers A-F then contracts 1-6).<br/><br/>Players plan and program orders carefully around other players' likely moves, various strategies, risks, and rewards. They manage their guilds' growth and optimize combinations between their adventurer abilities and contract rewards to achieve their goals. As the game advances, guilds become more powerful and must rise to meet an increasing number of game state changing threats. Recruiting increasingly powerful adventurers and upgrading your guild capacity are both key to victory. There are various ways to exert control over the board, your dice rolls, and your chances to get what you want.<br/><br/>Most orders are resolved by paying coin or rolling dice based on your adventurers' skills. Sometimes players resolve these orders alone, and sometimes cooperating with, or in conflict with, other guild's adventuring teams attempting the same thing at the same time. When players' orders overlap, coins and negotiated prisoners' dilemma cooperate/conflict skill checks resolve the contest. Negotiation over shared goals, contract bonuses and reward splits is encouraged and rewarding, but not absolutely required to win.<br/><br/>Everything you do earns you fame (victory points) and other rewards. At the end of nine rounds, any remaining coins are converted to fame at a rate of 5 coins = 1 fame. Then any special prestige upgrade fame is added. The most famous guild is then declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players will acquire morsels of information after visiting the &ldquo;Mag Rack&rdquo;. That information will lead them to the bins where they select albums to add and expand their collection. Albums can be played at the listening booth to increase the value of a player&rsquo;s collection and their ability to collect even more albums. Unfortunately, the inventory is limited and other customers may be targeting the same vinyl gems. After the final round is concluded, players will tally their collection&rsquo;s value and determine who is the Elite Collector of Vinyl!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The ink was hardly dry on the documents following the partition of British India in 1947 before war broke out between India and Pakistan. Since the partition, four major wars and numerous smaller conflicts have been waged over much of the same ground. In 1947, 1965, 1971, and 1999 India and Pakistan fought in the mountains of Kashmir and on the plains of the Punjab region to the south.  Today, both sides are armed with thousands of armored vehicles, hundreds of advanced aircraft, and dozens of nuclear weapons.  With tensions high and both sides heavily armed, another conflict may be just a matter of time.<br/><br/>Next War: India-Pakistan, the next volume in GMT's series of Next War games and a follow-on to  Next War: Korea, allows players to fight a near future war between India and Pakistan.<br/><br/>Due to the nature of a potential conflict, only a portion of the Indo-Pakistani border is featured so that the fighting centers around what it always has: the fate of the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir. Special rules govern such things as the expanded role bridges play in the region play as well as the fact that both sides in the conflict are nuclear-armed nations. The People's Republic of China and the United States can make an appearance, but they might withdraw in the event of a nuclear exchange. The question is: will this war settle once and for all who will control northwest India?<br/><br/>Note: the Next War series is not an introductory wargame. Rather, we have intended herein to create a system (and a series) that will allow detailed study of modern warfare in various venues as well as engaging gameplay. That said, the Standard Game rules encompass a fairly straightforward rule set that will, we think, be considered &quot;easy to learn&quot; by experienced wargamers. So, players who choose to play Standard Game scenarios can have a relatively quick game when that's what suits them. The real flavor of a war in the theatre, however, comes through in the Advanced Game, where you get much more control over airpower and can more clearly see each side's strengths and weaknesses. For players who want a &quot;mini-monster game&quot; experience, playing the Advanced Game Campaign Scenarios with some or all of the optional rules will definitely &quot;deliver.&quot;<br/><br/>Ownership of Next War: Korea will NOT be required to play.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tUnits<br/> Ground units in Next War: India-Pakistan represent the brigades, support units, and divisions of the armies of the India, Pakistan, China, and the United States. All ground units are rated for their attack and defense strengths, movement capabilities, and unit efficiency.<br/><br/>Air units represent fighter, bomber, and attack squadrons of the major combatants and are rated for All-Weather Capabilities as well as their range, average pilot skill, and their abilities in Air-to-Air Combat, Close Air Support, and Strike missions.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tMaps and TerrainThe game's map represents the area in and around the Punjab district of Pakistan and the Indian state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir at a scale of roughly 7.5 miles per hex. The map stretches from edge of The Great Indian Desert to just inside the Himalayas and encompasses portions of both sides of the border.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame SystemA game turn is generally composed of:<br/><br/><br/>     Weather Determination. Bad weather can severely hamper air operations and can significantly slow ground operations. <br/>     Initiative Determination and Air/Naval Phase, wherein Air Superiority levels and air availability are determined. <br/>     Special Operations Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to utilize their special operators in various recon and raid missions behind enemy lines. <br/>     Strike Phases in the Advanced Game allowing players to launch air strikes, cruise missiles, artillery and tactical nuclear weapon strikes. <br/>     One or more Movement and Combat Phases that allow both sides to move, react, and fight, with an advantage to the Initiative player on non-Contested turns <br/>     Arrival of Reinforcements and Replacements <br/>     Victory Determination <br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCombatCombat resolution examines not only unit strengths but also unit efficiency (representing training, doctrine, and morale), as well as the terrain where the combat takes place. The CRT tends to be very bloody in nature, reflecting what we believe will be a degree of attritional warfare early due to the lethality of modern weapons. As in many games, casualties represent not only actual combat losses but also losses of unit cohesion brought about by the rapid pace with which modern armies are able to engage and exploit on the battlefield.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNukesIn this installment, players will have the option, depending on game situation and a die roll to secure release authorization for and use tactical nuclear weapons in the playing area. Use of such weapons, however, could cause your international allies to leave the theater, so be careful!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tScenariosThere are several Standard Game scenarios. Some are small and focus on limited objectives while others are variations of a campaign game encompassing the entire map.<br/><br/>In a break from the standard set in Next War: Korea(and its follow-on Next War: Taiwan), the scenarios in Next War: India-Pakistan posit specific at-start situations and objectives (or victory conditions).  In some scenarios Pakistan is the aggressor while in others the Indian side is on the attack, in all cases there are varying levels of Chinese and United States intervention.<br/><br/>The International Posture Matrix &agrave; la Flashpoint: Golan – The Fifth Arab-Israeli War is still present to allow players to experiment with a variety of intervention options for the US and PRC.<br/><br/>In  Next War: India-Pakistan, Jammu &amp; Kashmir is once again aflame. Can you, as the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's commander, conquer Kashmir and hold it against the enemy? Can you, as the Republic of India's commander, attack and defeat the enemy without the conflict going nuclear? And what will happen in the international community while all this is going on? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out...<br/><br/>TIME SCALE 3.5 days per turn <br/>MAP SCALE 7.5 miles per hex <br/>UNIT SCALE Brigade / Division / Squadron <br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: Two (Optimal)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A traditional two-player Japanese card game played with the beautiful Hanafuda (literally 'Flower card') deck.<br/><br/>Setup: the cards are all shuffled, and one card is randomly revealed: the player whom the birthday month is closer to the revealed card month is the first player and thus the dealer. The cards are shuffled again and handed out, two by two, to both players, as for the face-up talon in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Turn: Then each player proceeds as so: firstly, he discards a card face up on the table from his hand. If that card matches another card on the table (matching months), the player then wins both cards which he puts in his face-up collection, in front of him. The collection is always displayed in 4 columns, as so: Flowers, Ribbons, Animals and Specials. If it doesn't match anything, the discarded card stays on the table. Secondly, whether it matched or not, the player then draws the first card from the face down deck, and proceeds the same way: if it doesn't match any card, the drawn card stays on the table, but if it does match a card, the player wins both cards which he adds to his collection. Then the other player takes his turn.<br/><br/>Turn's End: At the end of a player's turn, if he has any Yaku, he can stop the current month (inning) by stating his Yakus, then the points are scored and the next month begins. However, if he wishes to continue in order to increase his score for this month, he says &quot;Koi-Koi&quot; and the other player takes his turn. If later on during the game, the player who said Koi-Koi wins another Yaku OR increases his previous Yakus, he can then again stop the game or say Koi-Koi, as many times as he wants. But if a player gets a Yaku in a game where his opponent already said Koi-Koi, then he gets the right either to say Koi-Koi too, or to stop the game and receive his points, thus leading his opponent to get no points at all this month.<br/><br/>End: Since each player has 8 cards in his hand, a month (inning) can at worse last 16 turns. In case of a game where one (or both) player(s) said Koi-Koi and no more Yakus have been added or increased before the month ends, then only the last player who said Koi-Koi scores his points as usual. The winner of a month becomes the dealer for the next month, or stays the same if there was not any winner.<br/><br/>Each Yaku can add itself to the others. Here are the Yakus:<br/><br/>Basic Yakus<br/><br/>10 Flowers / Kasu : 1 point (Each additional Flower adds 1 point)<br/>5 Ribbons / Tanzaku : 1 point (Each additional Ribbon adds 1 point)<br/>3 Purple Ribbons (blue) / Aotan : 5 points<br/>3 Ribbons with Poems (red) / Akatan : 5 points<br/>5 Animals / Tane : 1 Point (Each additional Animal adds 1 point)<br/>Doe + Boar + Butterflies / Ino Shika Ch&ocirc; : 5 Points<br/>3 Specials without the Rain Man / Sank&ocirc; : 5 Points<br/>4 Specials with the Rain Man / Ameshik&ocirc; : 6 points<br/>4 Special without the Rain Man / Shik&ocirc; : 8 Points<br/>5 Specials : Gok&ocirc; : 10 points<br/><br/>Special Yakus<br/><br/>The Moon + The Sake Cup / Tsukizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)<br/>The Cherry Curtain + The Sake Cup / Hanamizake : 5 points (Bonus Yaku, only in addition to at least another normal Yaku)<br/>The Iris Flower is a &quot;Joker&quot; card: it can either be counted as an Animal, or as Flower to form a Kasu (but not both).<br/>The 4 Cards of the current Month / TsukiFuda : 5 points<br/>No Yakus / OyaKen : 1 point<br/><br/>The game ends when one player reaches 50 points. In some variants, at the end of a month, the points scored by a player are subtracted from his opponent's score. In some variants, the player with the most points at the end of the year (December) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Designed by Bill Crenshaw as the successor to the Age of Renaissance, and developed by Ken Gutermuth, Manifest Destiny combines the strategic components of earlier, longer civilization-based games with the elegance of streamlined European gaming. While reminiscent of its predecessors in some respects, it is significantly simpler and quicker to play. Designed to appeal to a wide range of gamers, Manifest Destiny combines several unique elements that require strategic balancing to succeed.<br/><br/>Each player controls a mercantile empire as it expands into territories containing new markets across the continent. Players use cash to purchase Progressions and tokens. Progressions give players additional capabilities during the game. Tokens are used for territorial expansion and to purchase Pioneers, cities and additional cards.<br/><br/>Each game is unique, with no standard path to victory. The game has several elements that keep all players competitive; cards and Progressions are designed to assist lagging players. How you balance the competing opportunities will determine whether you achieve your destiny.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Menace Among Us is a semi-cooperative game of intrigue and survival in deep space. Adrift and powerless, your crippled vessel is bleeding oxygen. As you effect repairs, every breath you take brings you one step closer to death. You must work together to restore power before the air runs out &mdash; but hidden among you, as loyal friends and crew members, are imposters who have infiltrated security and continue to sabotage the ship. Their only goal is to avoid detection and kill the crew, by force or by asphyxiation. Can you identify them in time and eliminate the threat? Or will succumb to the menace among us?<br/><br/>The Menace Among Us is a 40 to 60-minute, asymmetrical card game for 4-8 players. Each player chooses an Agenda at random, either a loyal Crew member, a deadly Menace or the Coward, who&rsquo;ll take any side just to survive. Your Agenda card sets a Team Goal and an Individual Goal, as well as outlines any special abilities and the card composition of your individual 13-card deck. Then, knowing your Agenda and Goals, you choose a Character who you believe will best help you achieve them or mask your true identity. Characters add 7 new cards to your deck, shuffle-building a unique combination of cards, as well as provide you two specialized Above Deck Actions.<br/><br/>In this hidden traitor game, how you play your cards and abilities is far more important than the meta game aspects of accusations and denials. Cards are played face down and shuffled together as &ldquo;Below Deck Actions.&rdquo; Here, Menace players secretly sabotage the ship&rsquo;s systems and attack crew members, who are trying to save the ship with their cards. If too few crew members risk going below deck to effect repairs, the ship&rsquo;s Emergency Maintenance Assistant (EmMA) adds cards to the pile to help. However, the system has also been compromised and occasionally places damaging cards into the mix, providing plausible deniability to the Menace players. In contrast, Above Deck Actions are conducted in full view of the crew. Most of these abilities have costs, either in Energy or Oxygen, both resources the crew is trying to increase. So, while The Doctor has the ability to heal a crew member and remove a debilitating effect, a Menace player, who may be secretly in control of The Doctor, cares far more that it costs 2 Oxygen to perform the healing.<br/><br/>At some point, someone&rsquo;s behavior will raise suspicion. But, did they do so because they are trying to fulfill an Individual Goal &ndash; or are they a Menace? You can call a vote to expose their true nature. But if they are a loyal Crew member, you&rsquo;ve just blown precious Oxygen in the effort to detain them. For that matter, was it a Menace player calling the vote in hopes of wasting the air on purpose?<br/><br/>If the Crew can find and eliminate the Menace players &ndash; and raise the Energy to a safe threshold before the air runs out, they win. If the Menace can prevent this or kill the crew outright, their mission succeeds. Special commendations are awarded for surviving and for achieving your Individual Goal.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your goal in Ada's Library &mdash; first published as Phoenix &mdash; is to arrange all of the books in your personal display in an order that matches the books in the &quot;master display&quot;.<br/><br/>The game includes larger &quot;master&quot; book cards in a six colors, as well as smaller books in these six colors. To set up, each player draws ten books from the bag, then places them in a row in front of themselves in the order drawn. Shuffle the six master cards, then lay them out in a row, e.g., red, light blue, gray, brown, yellow, dark blue. Shuffle the deck of action cards, with each player getting a hand of five cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, either discard a card from your hand (ignoring its effect) or play a card from your hand. Cards will:<br/><br/><br/>    Swap the position of two books in your display, with the number of spaces between these books being specified.<br/>    Move a book in your display a specified number of spaces either left or right, but never past the end of your display.<br/>    Move a book to either end of your display.<br/>    Swap the books on the ends of your display.<br/>    Swap a book of your choice with the book in the opponent's display directly opposite.<br/>    Move a book in the master display 1 or 2 spaces to the left or right.<br/><br/><br/>Draw a replacement card to end your turn. As soon as the ten books in your display match the order of the books in the master display &mdash; regardless of whether all the colors are present &mdash; you win.<br/><br/>Ada's Library differs from Phoenix in two ways. First, it includes only four books of each color whereas Phoenix had five pawns of each color. Second, in Phoenix, a complete game lasted three rounds, and players scored points at the end of each round based on whether they went out, had a pawn of each color, and had 3-5 pawns of a color in a row on their display. Whoever had the most points after three rounds won.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Northern Italy - and especially Milan - at the end of the 15th century was the brutal focal point for power and control between France and the Imperialist empires of Venice and Spain. And the battles fought for this prize are a record of the changing face of how war was fought.<br/><br/>At the start of the 'war', the main forces were mounted men-at-arms and a tightly packed and closed formation of pike, especially as represented by the Swiss. But as battle churned into battle, that slowly changed. Firepower, in the form of the arquebus (an early musket) became increasingly prevalent and dominant, forcing the closed pike formations to open up, as the Spanish did (with sword and buckler), and the reliance on heavily mounted cavalry to decrease.<br/><br/>&quot;Arquebus&quot; shows all of this in true die-rolling glory, featuring 8 major battles: Fornovo, Cerignola, Agnadello, Ravenna, Marignano, Bicocca, Pavia, and Ceresole. These are all really great game-players, with all but two of them half-mappers playable in 3 hours or less. The other two are the 'tiny' page-sized (8&quot; x 11&quot;) Cerignola and the big one-mapper, the major, final battle of Pavia. Pavia was a crushing defeat wherein France lost over 50% of its army and almost all of its nobility of command, including her king, Francis I, who was captured. But for gamers, Pavia is wonderful gameplay, with units all over the greatly detailed map, much maneuver and many tough decisions to make.<br/><br/>Arquebus uses the popular &quot;Men of Iron&quot; mechanics with much concentration on detail of weaponry, from the differences between closed formation and open, to the decline of the Swiss (pas d'argent? pas de Suisse), and the rise of the German Landsknecht, the major force in warfare of the era and, ironically, the best-dressed men in Europe. Yes, Landsknecht uniforms literally set the fashion trend at the time for the entire western world.<br/><br/>",

'<br/><br/>So began each of the Sagas of Noggin the Nog, in which the crown of Noggin, Prince of the Nogs is sought by his wicked uncle Nogbad the Bad who devises evil plots to threaten the safety of the kingdom, in order to force Noggin to give up his crown. In this game, players are the noble Lords of the north, looking to assist Noggin however they can in his adventures with resources and wise council.<br/><br/>Players use their influence to take actions on the board which as a back drop is Peter Firmin's classic hand drawn map of the Northlands. The time taken on each action is plotted on a roundel which acts as the game clock, changes the turn order and progresses the seasons. However Nogbad is never far away from the source of the Kingdom's troubles and Noggin must use his cleverness, intuition and resourcefulness to thwart Nogbad and confirm his position as King of the Nogs. The game ends when Noggin secures the crown or if Nogbad manages to get there first.<br/><br/>In Tales of the Northlands: The Sagas of Noggin the Nog, players must work together to successfully complete the adventures revealed by the saga cards. By offering much needed resources and making key decisions that effect the progress of the adventures, players will, if successful add to Noggin's popularity. Should their decision be unwise or they take too long the popular vote might sway toward Nogbad.<br/><br/>The game includes all of the characters from the TV series, Noggin, his Queen Nooka, Knut their son, Thor Nogson the grumpy Captain of the Royal Guard, Graculus the Great Green Bird, Olaf the Lofty, the Court inventor, and Romf, the little man from the Hot Water Valley.<br/><br/>These adventures are all based upon the books and stories developed by Oliver Postgate and Peter Firmin. The game is fully licensed has access to all artwork previously released in books and film and includes over fifty new pieces of new artwork commissioned from Peter Firmin specifically for the game. The game has three levels, solo, a family game with simplified rule set and a gamer's version with deeper strategy options.<br/><br/>",

Each player then marks off spaces in the shape of this polyomino on one of their pyramid cards. The first space covered on a card must be the entrance square. If you cover gems, torches, or skulls, mark off these spaces on your personal player board; if you cover a potion, erase two covered skulls. If you cover a red X, mark one additional space, either on this pyramid board or your other one; all marked spaces must connect orthogonally.<br/><br/>If you cover the tomb on a pyramid board, set that board aside and take a new board from the four on display or from the deck. When you've completed your second, fourth, or sixth pyramid of the same color &mdash; and the deck includes three colors &mdash; score the highest color bonus available.<br/><br/>After seven exploration cards have been revealed, the round is over. Shuffle all eight cards, then start a new round. After four rounds, players count their scores, earning 10 points per tomb reached, 5 points per pair of colored gems found, 5 points for each round in which they covered at least one torch, and their color bonuses, after which they lose points based on the number of skulls covered.

The object of the game is to capture as many pieces as possible, with bonus points awarded for special combinations.  Each player attempts to accumulate the highest score and then bring the game to a close before another player has a chance to steal the lead away.<br/><br/>Volcano requires 5 Treehouse sets and a set of Volcano Caps.<br/><br/>Multi-player Volcano supports any number of players, though between 2 and 6 is best.

At the end of the war, if there are two Americans and one Russian left alive, we win.&rdquo; ~Gen. Thomas Power, U.S. Strategic Air Command 1957-1964<br/><br/>19XX: The unthinkable happens. The world is scoured clean in nuclear fire. The oceans are poisoned for generations to come. One last patch of habitable land remains: Antarctica. The remnants of humanity huddle together in a fragile patchwork of research stations and refugee ships. But even here, the Cold War survives. And our civilization may not.<br/><br/>In Meltwater, two players take command of the shattered remains of the superpowers, struggling for control of the ice. Simple diceless mechanics let players displace, corner, and isolate their opponent&rsquo;s survivors. Here, hunger is a crueler weapon than gunfire, and the barren tundra can only support so many souls. And every turn, radioactive contamination pushes in from the coastline, shrinking the available space and forcing the belligerents closer and closer together.<br/><br/>In the end, there is only either submission or annihilation, and whatever world is left.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Opposing these lads are elements of the 12th SS Panzer Division &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; (Hitler Youth) and Panzer Lehr&mdash;elite panzergrenadier units.  The goal of the British division is to seize the town of Fontenay, then press onward to secure the high ground near Rauray in time for the impending Operation Epsom, to be launched the next morning.<br/><br/>The game by designer Mark Mokszycki uses the same system as Red Winter, his game on the Battle of Tolvaj&auml;rvi  from the Russo-Finnish Winter War of 1939.  Scale is grand tactical: 90 minutes per game turn, 425 yards per hex, and mostly company sized infantry units with platoon sized armor units. Gone are the Winter War specific rules such as ski movement and night raids, and in their place we have a more detailed armor/anti-tank subsystem.  There are lots of tanks on both sides in this one!<br/><br/>Rules for Operation Dauntless include the 12th SS Fanatical Defense Table, British sabot ammo, tank destroyers, self-propelled infantry guns and artillery, combat engineers, troop transport, British air strikes, German nuisance raids (night bombings), infantry anti-tank weapons, German ammo shortage, and abstracted effects of the immense British opening barrage by 650 guns.<br/> Terrain is a mixture of corn and wheat fields, orchards, woods, heavy and light bocage, and small stone farm houses and villages.  The Germans begin the game dug in, and they may place a limited number of fortifications during setup.<br/><br/>The game includes a multi-day campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. The Germans are on the defensive overall, but they are armed to the teeth with many powerful panzer formations&mdash;including Panzer IVs, Panthers, and Tigers&mdash;and will find themselves able to counterattack frequently and effectively. Some of the shorter scenarios feature the Germans on the offensive to recapture lost ground.<br/><br/>The game was designed for two players, but works very well solitaire.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 90 minutes<br/>Map: 425 yards per hex<br/>Unit: Platoon to Company<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>Three counter sheets of 528 5/8&quot; counters (roughly 2 sheets of unit counters and 1 sheet of markers)<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; map<br/>One 36 page Rule Book<br/>One 28 page Play Book (includes full-color illustrated examples of play, Comparisons to Red Winter, Tips &amp; Strategies, and counter manifest)<br/>One 56 page Scenario Book (includes 11 tutorials, ~15 scenarios, and optional rules)<br/>One 48 page Reference Book (includes designer's notes and complete Order of Battle)<br/>Two Identical Player Aid Cards (foldout, 4 sided)<br/>One Player Air Card 2 (Optional rules)(1 sided)<br/>One British Reinforcement Card (8.5 x 11&quot;, 1 sided)<br/>One German Reinforcement Card (11 x 17&quot;, 1 sided)<br/>One Flowchart card (double-sided with LOS and Armor Reaction Cycle aids)<br/>One Campaign Game Setup &amp; Vehicle Identification Card (2 sided)<br/>One Turn Track Card (Turn Track A: June 16-18 on front, Turn Track B: June 25-27 on back)<br/>One Information &amp; Turn Phase Track Card (1 sided)<br/>One Tutorial Getting Started #1: Infantry Card (2 sided)<br/>One Tutorial Getting Started #2: Armor Card (2 sided)<br/>Three 6-sided dice<br/>Three 10-sided dice<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium (similar to Red Winter or a tad more complex)<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>",

Luckily, you seem to have natural immunity and now you must escape to help create a vaccine before the virus spreads to Earth.<br/><br/>In an attempt to quarantine the virus, the computer locked down all systems, undocked all the spaceships and is currently venting the oxygen to prevent you from ever leaving. Fortunately, it has missed one. Unfortunately, it's still on the assembly line and only partially complete.

On the screen above your head, you can see the required layout in blueprint form and on the assembly line you can see the completed Room Modules hanging around the edges ready for placement in the bays corresponding to the instructions overhead.<br/><br/>You have discovered a rather limited set of commands to complete the ship but for some reason the controls keep glitching.

This brand-new boxed game from Games Workshop lets four players slug it out for brutal supremacy in brutal pit fights. The box includes four plastic multi-part Citadel miniatures: the Exalted Deathbringer of Khorne, the Skullgrinder, the Slaughterpriest and the Aspiring Deathbringer with Goreaxe and Skullhammer &ndash; four iconic champions of Khorne.<br/><br/>The game itself is a simple, cunning and laugh-out-loud mix of subtle strategy and straightforward brutal combat, and four players can play through a game in about an hour. 24 action cards let your chosen fighter pick from a variety of painful attacks and gambits (our favourite being the humble Shove, should your victim happen to be standing next to one of the fire pits present on the game&rsquo;s board) while 16 injury cards present, in gruesome detail, the inevitable results of standing in a spiked pit with three other crazed madmen. And the fun doesn&rsquo;t stop with the feuding &ndash; players who have been knocked out can still influence the game thanks to special Fate of the Slain rules. Full rules for these fighters are presented on four fighter sheets, and rules for four more (with miniatures available separately from Games Workshop) are included inside the game&rsquo;s rulebook.<br/><br/>Each fighter has a unique Kill Zone which dictates what they can hit, and how powerfully. The Slaughterpriest in the box, for example, has enormous reach forwards with his axe (because it&rsquo;s flipping massive) but is weaker when to the sides. (You can imagine an overhead chop, rather than a sweep around him.) Each fighter also keeps track of his wrath using the Wrath Track. Wrath can be spent to make actions, and is usually accrued when fighters are wounded &ndash; injury cards, which are received when combatants are damaged, affect wrath in this way.<br/><br/>Wrath also has an effect on who goes first, because the angrier fighters are, the more chance there is they will act first! Each turn, fighters put in a number of initiative cards equal to their wrath (each player has a unique design of initiative card), then the top initiative card is turned over, dictating who will act. After that player has made an action, the next initiative card is turned over, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "People Power: Insurgency in the Philippines, 1983-1986 is volume XI of the highly-praised and popular COIN series originally designed by Volko Ruhnke. This is one of only two games in the COIN series that feature three separate factions, instead of the customary four.<br/><br/>The first faction is the Government, symbolized by the personal rule of Ferdinand Marcos, his wife Imelda, and his political cronies and military forces. Second are the Insurgents represented by the New People&rsquo;s Army (or NPA). The NPA sought a national uprising from both the urban and rural populace. Finally, the third faction are the non-violent Reformers, embodied by Aquino&rsquo;s widow, Corazon. She, along with her allies and supporters in that moment of tragedy, revived a platform of social justice and unrelenting momentum that would irrevocably change the Philippine political landscape immeasurably.<br/><br/>For players new to the COIN Series, or for those looking to teach the the series to their friends, People Power will serve as an excellent introductory game. It was designed for simplicity and quick play, utilizing many of the basic COIN Series mechanics. The 22&quot; x 17&quot; map aids in introducing the game to a new player, as it presents only two types of terrain - Cities and Countrysides (where the latter amalgamates the rural settings of the island nation as well as much lightly-habitable terrain of jungles and mountains). Don't let the fast play and basic systems fool you, though. There are still plenty of strategic puzzles and inter-player backstabbing to be had! Also, People Power includes a new feature for the COIN Series - a Key Personality mini-hand procedure that represents the effectiveness of various generals and power brokers adding a new dimension to player actions and decisions.<br/><br/>",

As a stand-alone game it has 5 scenarios and 2 maps (a camp and a castle). There are rules that cover a range of siege warfare tactics such as siege weapons, fire, breaching walls and scaling ladders. It is well suited for play-by-email format and can be adapted for decent solitaire play as well.<br/><br/>The unit scale is one man to one counter. Each man (or woman! They are here too!) is generally represented by multiple counters or both sides of a single counter to portray healthy and wounded combatants as well as mounted and unmounted (including the horses) where applicable. Each counter has a nicely colored picture of each man with attack defense and movement values in addition to the name of the person depicted.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Outremer<br/><br/><br/>The Cry Havoc series page contains information about the game system and history of the game including fan expansions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In June of 1812 Napoleon invaded Russia, meanwhile on the other side of the world the young republic of the United States declared war on Great Britain. It was one of America's most unpopular wars and &ldquo;Mr. Madison's War - The Incredible War of 1812&rdquo; is a strategy game based on the US campaigns to take Canada in the years 1812 - 1814.<br/><br/>The map board measures 35&rdquo;x24&rdquo; and covers the the northern part of the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and the Canadian provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, the area where most of the battles were fought. The game features over 203 counters that feature the named regiments and battalions that fought the war including militia and Indian units. Also included are named individual Schooner, Brigs and Frigates that fought the naval war on the great lakes. The principal leaders of the war are included such as Major General Isaac Brock, Sir George Prevost, Major General Hull and many others.<br/><br/>The game utilizes the new 'card driven system' which enable players to perform their actions on the game board and score automatic points for the playing of a card as an historical event. The colorful cards include historical information, the year the event took place and a detailed description of the function of the card. There are 110 individual cards in the game.<br/><br/>The illustrated Rule Book is approximately 20 pages long, and there are 5 player aid sheets that contain the Combat Results Table along with cards to set up the various reinforcements.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to gain Victory Points by invading your enemy's territory while maintaining your own. In complexity the game would be rated as average and would appeal to any student of the Napoleonic Wars in general. It is at present the most comprehensive treatment of the War of 1812 yet offered to the public.<br/><br/>The publisher, GMT Games, also produced a mounted map for this game which was sold separately.<br/><br/>",

When is the best moment to expand? When will harvesting be profitable? How much force will be necessary to defend the city walls? Only the player who can correctly judge the timing of such decisions will be successful in the end.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player receives a small, unprotected principality. Over three epochs the various principalities can be developed. A steady production of money and food is needed to expand the principality and to maintain an army of mercenaries. During the game there are several cultural and military valuations that give the players victory points.<br/><br/>The unusual part of this game are the action cards, which are available to all players. From the changing pool of possible actions, players have to secure the most suitable cards and use them at the appropriate time &ndash; reaching for the new means while parting with the old. This simple mechanism turns Principato  into a varied tactical game full of tough decisions.<br/><br/>",

Behind them lie the remnants of the Soviet Western Front -- almost a million men in four armies. The Soviets are stunned by the German Blitzkrieg. Their responses are slow, confused, and governed by pre-war contingency plans made obsolete by the speed of the German advance. In little more than a week, the German panzer spearheads meet east of Minsk. Though isolated units continue to fight, the entire Soviet Western Front has ceased to exist!<br/><br/>The Germans' next target is Smolensk, but the Soviets resist more effectively. Entire armies are dispatched from other parts of the Soviet Union as the true scope of the Minsk pocket disaster and the magnitude of the German threat become known. Soviet counterattacks, especially around Lepel, are thrown back with horrific losses. Once again the Panzer Groups charge eastward, creating yet another huge Soviet pocket west of Smolensk. The Soviets resist savagely. Smolensk falls on July 13th, but the pocket does not close. Many Soviet units escape to fight another day.<br/><br/>Hitler now makes a fateful decision and overrides his generals. Over half of Army Group Center's armored and air formations are diverted south to take Kiev or north to isolate Leningrad.

The system encompasses (as of 6/2001) Barbarossa: Army Group North (2000), Barbarossa: Army Group Center (1998), and Barbarossa: Army Group South (1996). Typhoon! (1995) is the progenitor of these games, and its system is quite similar, but it is unfortunately subtly incompatible with the later games.<br/><br/>While not simple, these games are also not overly complex and present an excellent simulation of the early war. Most of the details of the campaigns are covered in a playable manner. Perhaps the most obviously interesting detail is the sequence of play, which is asymmetrical to account for the difficulties the Soviets labored under. Make no mistake, the Soviets are going to take a lot of abuse, but this is no walkover for the Germans and both sides are interesting to play.<br/><br/>(BGG user description)<br/><br/><br/>Errata counters contained in Barbarossa: Crimea.<br/><br/>",

Play as Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf the Grey, Thorin Oakenshield, or others. Your Hero card will guide your strategy throughout the game, or you can break away with a plan of your own.<br/><br/>Each player starts with his own basic ten-card deck and draws a hand of five cards each turn. Power is the currency you will use to buy new, stronger cards to add to your deck. The goal of a deck-building game is to craft your personal deck into a well-oiled machine, and five types of cards can be acquired: Enemies, Allies, Artifacts, Maneuvers, and Locations. A large, central stack of cards supplies a five-card &quot;Path&quot; from which players make their purchases. Each player always has five face-up cards from which to choose each turn, so new options and surprises await each turn.<br/><br/>When you have amassed enough Power, you can take on an Archenemy! Each Archenemy has Loot cards you can acquire. Defeat a Troll and you might find Sting, Orcrist, or Glamdring! Take on The Goblin King and you might find the maneuvers you need to escape from the Misty Mountains. Azog is the final Archenemy, and he has unfinished business...<br/><br/>In the end, the player who has accumulated the most Victory Points from the cards in his deck wins.<br/><br/>Cryptozoic's The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit deck-builder series:<br/><br/><br/>     The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring Deck-Building Game<br/>     The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers Deck-Building Game<br/>     The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King Deck-Building Game<br/>     The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey Deck-Building Game<br/>     The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug Deck-Building Game Expansion Pack<br/><br/><br/>",

His former allies Prussia and Austria turn traitor and attack him. Tsarist Russia sends a massive army across the Vistula into Europe proper.<br/><br/>Draining every reserve the French Empire has left, Napoleon gathers his loyal Rhinelanders, Italians, Saxons and Poles. Seizing the initiative in the Spring, he defeats the Allied Coalition at Lutzen, and then at Bautzen, and then again at Dresden. But these are not the complete victories his desperate situation demands. Small defeats of his Generals (Oudinot on August 23rd at Grossbeeren, Mcdonald on August 26th at Katzbach, Vandamme on August 29-30th at Kulm and Ney on September 6th at Dennewitz) brought the strength to decline...<br/><br/>Now, with his strength sapped, Napoleon recoils to Leipzig. Like wolves, his enemies surround the place and converge. . . . Napoleon at Leipzig 3rd Edition retains its classic starting situation with only one wing of the French Army on the map. Later, Napoleon leads the main body of La Grande Arm&eacute;e, 175,000 strong, into a position which Marshal Marmont later described as lying &quot;at the bottom of a funnel.&quot; As 300,000 Allied troops converge on Leipzig during the succeeding days, the French task is to crush one or more of the enemy armies, or successfully retire the cream of their army across the sole remaining bridge spanning the Elster.<br/><br/>Scenarios and the Campaign Game can begin on the 14th, 16th, or 18th of October, 1813. The Standard, Campaign and Grand Tactical rules have been completely revised to reflect the latest findings in Napoleonic scholarship.<br/><br/>A totally new map, based on fresh sources, accurately portrays the terrain around Leipzig, emphasizing the superb cavalry terrain to the south. A Study Folder with the classic narrative by noted author F. Lorraine Petrie, along with the Order of Battle and set-up for the three stages of the six-day battle, is also included.<br/><br/>The game has 4 editions.  <br/>The first one was produced by Kevin Zucker's own &quot;Operational Studies Group&quot; company.  <br/>Later 3 more editions had been published, all by Clash of Arms (comments to the different editions had been made by Ed Wimble): <br/>- [2ed] 1988 - new counters. Map &amp; box uses old negatives but with a different color scheme and paper.

New box and artwork. New rules: Kevin Zucker redesigned them. Counters: The half sheet reworked.<br/><br/>Thereafter GMT proclaimed a combined GMT-OSG 5ed for a P-500. <br/>In 2012 Kevin Zucker announced that the 5th Edition will now be a sole OSG product and should see publication in 2012/ 2013. <br/>Note: the 5th Edition can be found here: Napoleon at Leipzig (Fifth Edition)<br/><br/>GAME SYSTEM: <br/>Series: The Library of Napoleonic Battles (OSG) - formerly known as the &quot;Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB-)Series&quot; <br/>- scale = 480m/hex, <br/>- time = 1hour/GT,<br/>- strength = 500-800 men/SP.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1-3 hours<br/>Hex: 525 yards / 480 meters<br/>Units: Battery to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory (Operational Studies Group version):<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; 6-color mapsheets<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (400 1/2&quot; counters - 90 of which are blanks)<br/>One 8-page Napoleon at Leipzig rules booklet<br/>One 32-page Napoleon at Leipzig study folder booklet<br/>One side-printed errata  card<br/>One 6-sided die<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-6 Hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paco Ŝako (Esperanto words for &quot;peace chess&quot;: pronounce &quot;PAH-tso SHAH-ko&quot; = /'pat͡so 'ʃako/ IPA) is a form of chess created to be an expression of peace, friendship and collaboration. The aim is to find, through strategic gameplay, a way to &quot;embrace&quot; the other player's king.<br/><br/>The game represents a constructive conversation or development in which the two sides merge their knowledge, ideas, and strength. During the game, both players try to bring forward good or ever better ideas than the other player by moving their chess pieces around. For both players, the aim is to stand strong for your knowledge, ideas and strength, but you will be open to receive input from the other player when it is their turn. Making the last move and bringing one of your pieces into a union with the other player's King will make you win the game.<br/><br/>Paco Ŝako is played on the same board and with the same chess pieces as traditional/classic chess, though the Paco Ŝako chess pieces have a different functionality. Black and white pieces can be merged into a union and can stay together on one square. Because there are no pieces taken, all pieces stay on the board during the game. Once unions are created, both players can still move them; you can take over a union and release your piece out of a union by replacing it with another piece and eventually there is the chain reaction, which really brings out the Paco Ŝako gameplay. Taking over unions and releasing pieces mean you may move several pieces in one turn.<br/><br/>The game is very much focused on patterns and creativity, not on piece advantage. The nice thing about this is that both players stay in the game until the last move is made. There can be created an advantage in position and games can be fast because of the dynamics and physical patterns in which several pieces can be moved in one go. When the game develops into an endgame with a lot of unions, there will be a high energy on the board with lots of possibilities, chains and creative options, and often both players will get closer to making the final move. Sometimes it is about having momentum and holding it.<br/><br/>",

It is designed to be a very quick filler game (10-15 minutes) that still demands a certain level of skill and tactical decision-making. Yet, because dice rolls can be unexpected, players must be prepared to adapt and change their plans at the drop of a die.<br/><br/>",

At each location the player can perform a particular task, such as: draw the face-up card there (cards show a rocket base, fuselage or tip in one of three different colors), add a part to a rocket, take fuel tokens, change direction of rotation, etc. Some rocket tips grant special privileges, and the first fuel that's taken is more valuable than the last.

        "description": "Rolling Stock is a card game about stock and company trading. Players are investors buying private companies in auctions, which they may later use for an IPO (to turn them into corporations) or sell to already existing corporations (to turn them into subsidiaries of that corporation). The majority share holder of a corporation controls its actions: issuing new shares, paying dividends, and buying more subsidiaries from other corporations, players, or an ominous foreign investor.<br/><br/>The companies are transportation themed, starting with the early Prussian railroad. As more companies are bought, the scope of the game expands to Germany, later Europe, and ultimately even space. With expanding scope, older companies become less and less profitable until they have to be written off eventually, severely hitting the book value of their owner.<br/><br/>As a pure card game, Rolling Stock has no game board to simulate actual transportation. Instead, networking effects are modeled by synergies between geographically adjacent companies that are subsidiaries of the same corporation. This simplistic model merely sets the stage for the trading of stocks and companies, which is the heart and soul of the game.<br/><br/>Rolling Stock is vaguely inspired by the 18xx series of games but it is clearly not a part of it. Obviously, track building is missing entirely, but even the stock market with all its superficial similarities turns out to be fundamentally different.<br/><br/>Compared to the 18xx series, Rolling Stock has extremely simple rules. Strategically, however, it is comparably deep and complex.<br/><br/>",

You'll need those latter items to defeat the Ghoul Friday, the Whispering Tyrant, and especially Lamashtu, the Mother of Monsters. But first you'll have to fight your way through all those goblins...and kill them and take their stuff!<br/><br/>Munchkin Pathfinder Deluxe contains the same cards, die and rules as Munchkin Pathfinder, but also includes a game board, pawns and plastic stands.

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Sex &amp; Crime&quot; contains historical events related to more or less famous and sometimes hilarious crimes and some more adult themes, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 45 BC. Julius Caesar brings all the leaders of the provinces of Hispania Ulterior together for a meeting in Corduba, where he thanks them for the support received during the recent civil war. The fight between Caesar and Pompey had ended with a clear victor, but not all Roman citizens were completely behind Caesar.<br/><br/>One year later, the cruel governor and Caesar&rsquo;s right hand man is nearly assassinated as he makes his way to the Basilica. This act turned out to be the precursor to what would happen just two years later. Cneo and Sexto, sons of Caesar&rsquo;s enemies, taking advantage of the influence that Pompey&rsquo;s name still carried and capitalizing off the rich resources of the Roman province, took control of all of Hispania, including the colonies of Italica and Corduba. These two traitors had somehow pieced together an army of no less than 13 legions, made up of veterans loyal to Pompey and the remnants of his defeated armies in Africa, along with citizens of Hispania.<br/><br/>Caesar promptly travelled to the capital of Hispania with the intention of crushing the rebellion while it was still in its infancy. After losing a battle to Cneo for control of the bridge, Caesar was forced to winter in Ategua and, as it was necessary to feed his forces, he subsequently pillaged the surrounding area. Many were those who joined the rebellion led by Pompey&rsquo;s sons, but in the end there weren&rsquo;t enough of them. Forced to take refuge in the city after the battle of Munda, Caesar besieges Cneo and Sexto. He later takes control of the city after a daring assault on the walls. Sexto manages to escape Caesar&rsquo;s wrath, but his brother Cneo dies along with another 22,000 citizens of Corduba. As punishment for supporting the rebellion and giving refuge to its instigators, the city is left a smoldering ruin. But from the ashes a new city will arise&hellip;<br/><br/>The year is now 27 BC, nearly two decades later, and Augustus, the first emperor, sends representatives of the most influential Roman families to Corduba in order to raise it to its former glory. To achieve this, it will be necessary to rebuild the city and cater to its inhabitants. All of this, of course, under the watchful eye of Rome.<br/>Players, who represent the heirs of different patrician families sent from Rome, will compete for the honor of becoming the next Governor, but must first win the vote of the people, and of Rome.<br/><br/>The game is played out over three eras, each one representing a decade. During a round, players will take actions in turns until all decide to pass. Players use actions to produce or harvest resources, construct buildings and monuments, train legions, and tend to the religious needs of the people. To do this, players will have access to a certain number of specialists and workers that will increase as the city&rsquo;s population rises.<br/><br/>It is important to note that Corduba is not a tile-laying game, but rather one of building actions that includes familiar worker placement and resource management mechanics.<br/><br/>Actions available at the beginning of the game are scarce and mostly limited to harvesting basic resources in order to construct buildings and train troops. However, as players construct new buildings, the amount of actions available increases, since each building constructed provides a new action. Players will certainly appreciate the sheer number of possible strategies and combinations that arise during the course of a game.<br/><br/>Another of Corduba&rsquo;s strengths is how a particular game evolves. A total of nine rounds are played, grouped into three decades. At the end of each round, the buildings release their workers and therefore become available for the next round. What this means is that all these buildings, which have been constructed one by one over previous rounds, are now free to all players regardless of who built them. Also, since there is an ever-increasing amount of actions available, strategic possibilities multiply. In addition to this, every action is just as important as the next, which leaves you with the constant feeling that another player has anticipated your move and occupied a building you wanted to activate or built what you wanted to build. Even though the rules do not change from one round to the next, players will quickly realize that the game does, since their strategies and perceptions during the first few rounds will be very different from later ones.<br/>There are no Victory Points in Corduba. In order to win, you will have to garner the favor of the city&rsquo;s inhabitants and of Rome itself. Constructing buildings in the different districts will improve your reputation there. Providing the largest armies for the Roman Cohorts or giving the largest offering to the gods will also help you win favor in the Senate, as well as, of course, helping the city meet the demands of Rome. At the end of each decade, players will have the opportunity to add to the Senate.<br/><br/>But not all that glitters is gold, and, on occasion, the citizens will rebel. Players will have to deal with these uprisings, but this does not mean they will have to cooperate. However, if this aspect is neglected, the entire city could fall, resulting in a very undesirable outcome &ndash; all players lose!<br/>Corduba is a bona fide example of a game with near-infinite strategic possibilities. Each game will play out differently depending on the buildings and monuments constructed, the combinations from families and inheritances that players choose, the demands of Rome, the fluctuation of the resource market, the Res gestae (milestones) available, etc. Even if you try to play in a similar way as you did the last, you will not have the same experience. Truly, no one game of Corduba will be the same &ndash; you will uncover different strategies and combinations each time you play.<br/>Corduba is a game of medium to high difficulty with simple rules that anyone can understand, but will profoundly challenge players of even the highest skill levels.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the first round, you will play cards to build roads that divide the city into neighborhoods, then populate them with loyal peasants and nobles who share your view of this new city. In the second round, you will build the walls themselves and choose which nobles will move into the towers to stand guard over the city as Watchmen. Beware, unfinished roads will combine neighborhoods, and gaps in the walls will cause Nobles to flee the city. Scoring is based on area majority: more neighborhoods loyal to you means more votes towards securing your seat on the city council.

Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.<br/><br/>On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.<br/><br/>Silver Dagger contains 14 new roles and abilities not seen in the previous titles, some of which allow you to strategically switch the direction of gameplay, the #4 zombie in particular! As might be expected, zombies are tough to get rid of; in game terms, you can't place them on top of the discard pile, and they need to be face up in order to pass them to the previous player. The game also includes helpful roles such as the debt collector, which subtracts a point for each card held by your opponents, and the halfling, who has the power to divide your entire score for the round in half.<br/><br/>As in other Silver games, call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves circling your village. Your opponents will then have only one more chance to save themselves &mdash; or to sabotage you!<br/><br/>The Silver series is made to mix and match! Pick out roles to fill the 0-13 slots from Silver Amulet, Silver Bullet, Silver Coin, or this title to create your very own custom deck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Evil Masterminds like Loki and Red Skull lead a horde of powerful Super Villains, planning dark Schemes to destroy the Marvel Cinematic Universe! Only you can stop them, leading awesome Marvel Super Heroes like Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor!<br/><br/>In this game for 1-5 players, each player starts with their own deck of basic Hero cards. At the start of your turn, you play the top card of the Villain Deck, showing how Villains invade the city, capture Bystanders, and create special events. Then you play Hero cards from your hand to generate Attack, Recruit Points, and special abilities. You attack with your Heroes to defeat Villains. You use Recruit Points to recruit better Heroes to add to your deck.<br/><br/>Whenever your deck runs out of cards, you shuffle your discard pile to make a new deck, including all the new Heroes you recruited. This way your deck gets stronger and stronger over time. Build up enough Power and you can defeat the evil Mastermind! But be careful: if the players don&rsquo;t defeat the Mastermind quickly enough, then the Mastermind will complete their dark Scheme and win the game for evil!<br/><br/>In Legendary: Marvel Studios Phase 1, the Avengers are back in a new setting with images straight from the Phase 1 movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America: The First Avenger, Avengers). Black Widow, Iron Man, Captain America and more face off against the Villains of the first six movies. Three Masterminds including the all new Iron Monger and his Iron Foes try to complete their evil schemes.

        "description": "Conquest and Consequence brings the Triumph &amp; Tragedy system to the Pacific/East Asia theater during the same 1936-1945 time period. Like T&amp;T, it is designed for three players, maintaining the three-sided dynamic that adds so much variety and intrigue to the system. Those three sides are:<br/><br/><br/>    Militarist Japan, the first Asian power to modernize, which seeks to replace the European colonial empires in East Asia with a true &quot;all-Asian&quot; empire, with itself as the natural leader.<br/>    The Communist Soviet faction, which is comprised of the Siberian USSR and the Red Chinese revolutionaries.<br/>    The Capitalist USA faction, which consists of the United States, the British Empire, and the struggling regime of Nationalist China.<br/><br/><br/>The game begins in 1936 with the Militarists in control of Japan and expansion on the agenda. Its [war] industry is well-developed, but it is weak in population and particularly resources. Its battle-hardened army has easily overrun resource-rich Manchuria, and a weak China awaits. Japan (like Germany in T&amp;T) has the early initiative due to its well-prepared military. Will it:<br/><br/><br/>    Move south into China?<br/>    Take the &quot;Northern Road&quot; into resource-rich east Siberia (as favored by the army)?<br/>    Pursue the &quot;Southern Road&quot; to the oil-rich Dutch East Indies advocated by its navy?<br/>    Or bide its time, seeking a better position via diplomatic arrangements with neutrals including independent Chinese warlord states?<br/><br/><br/>Japanese aggression in China will likely irritate the sleeping giant that is the USA, but it is far away across the wide Pacific, and Japan has special naval abilities that allow it to compete at sea.<br/><br/>The Red Chinese have just completed their Long March and re-established their base in inland Shaansi, far from areas of Japanese (or Capitalist) interest. The Red Chinese are very weak militarily but have a secret weapon: Partisans. These are non-military &quot;political&quot; organizations (represented on-map with cardboard counters) that are difficult to eradicate, multiply if ignored, and can be converted into military units when desired (this being ill-advised without sufficient concentration). The Soviet Union, also acutely aware of Japanese expansionism, is desperately fortifying eastern Siberia, which is otherwise thinly defended. Nationalist China is aware of the Japanese threat but must also deal with the internal Communist threat. The United States is disarmed, disinterested, and distracted by the Great Depression. The British Empire is woefully under-defended and overconfident. The USA alliance must build up its economy while somehow improving the military capabilities of the British Empire, Nationalist China, and itself.<br/> The game combines the Pacific naval war and the land war in Asia (including the Chinese Civil War), both equally weighing upon victory. The naval war is dramatic, featuring short, decisive battles and expanded roles for airpower and island bases. In the tradition of Triumph &amp; Tragedy, the three-sided aspect features negotiation, diplomacy, and subterfuge within a multitude of strategic possibilities. Like T&amp;T, the game allows players freedom to diverge from the inclinations and policies of the historical actors and plays in 4-6 hours of constant tension and involvement.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alexandros is an abstract strategy by Leo Colovini, thematically inspired by the military expansion of Alexander the Great. It includes the &quot;triggered scoring for all&quot; mechanism, which can be considered a trademark of the designer, implemented in many of his games. It forces players to evaluate their actions in relation to what other players can earn.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have more points than other players when the trail/border markers are depleted or someone scores 100 points first.<br/><br/>Gameplay is driven by cards, used for all actions. Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.<br/><br/>After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.<br/><br/>Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.<br/><br/>Awarded title of &quot;Best Family Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 2005.<br/><br/>",

Napol&eacute;on has no choice; if he wishes to keep his throne, he must smash this new coalition...and many more!<br/><br/>Napoleon against Europe follows the epic of Napol&eacute;on in his attempt to cement his dynasty and retain the conquests of the Revolution via the medium of playing cards that follow the great events and personalities if this exciting period.<br/><br/>The player takes in hand the destinies of the Emperor and his enemy, indefatigable Albion and its successive coalitions. The French player has no choice other than imposing his will on the entire Europe so as to isolate Britain by a tight blockade forcing the continental powers to recognise French hegemony: the decision must be made between the wild Iberian Peninsula and the steppes of Russia.<br/><br/>Each side has its own deck of cards divided into two periods: Epic and the Punishments.<br/><br/>Each player controls naval fleets and land troops presented at the level of army corps, other units are those of great renown from this period such as the Imperial Guard Cavalry, the King&rsquo;s German Legion etc... The quality of the generals of each side plays an essential role in operations.<br/><br/>In six rounds of play a year, the players must not only have a long term view of their objectives but must also demonstrate operational skill in the course of the campaigns: the importance of lines of communication will be fundamental to bringing their armies to the decisive battle! The game system takes account of forced marches, attrition, evasion, counter-marches and interceptions&hellip;<br/><br/>In an immense theatre of operations, each side will attempt to seize the initiative and each year equip forces allowing it to continue the struggle and to redeploy them with foresight before engaging in the operations phase: unhappy the player who fails to take into account the communication distances.<br/><br/>Against the operational excellence of the French, the Coalition must respond with a strategic long-term vision that will permit him to exhaust his foe.<br/><br/>Now, it is up to you to decided if l'Aiglon will be Napol&eacute;on II or the Duc de Reichstadt !<br/><br/>Game components<br/>    One large mounted map (96 cm &times; 67 cm),<br/>    216 15mm die-cut counters,<br/>    140 13mm die-cut counters,<br/>    110 playing cards,<br/>    One full-colour rules booklet,<br/>    Game aids,<br/>    Two 6-side dice,<br/>    A sturdy box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "18xx meets Scandinavia -- Railroads on Skis<br/><br/>Intro from the manual: &quot;18Scan is an '18xx' game set in the Scandinavian peninsula of Northern Europe. It includes most of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. 18Scan is a small game, in the style of Mark Derrick&rsquo;s 'one-state' games 18GA and 18AL, and is intended as a change from the more robust 18xx games often played.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Designer Notes: &quot;This is my second attempt at a 'small, short' 18xx game: the first, 18VA, has matured -- alas! -- into a solid, medium-length performer, but has become quite unsuited for a quick 'fill-in-the-cracks' session. I am hoping that 18Scan will not only prove to be a better short game, but will be sufficiently straightforward that it can also be used as an introduction to the 18xx system.  In 18Scan, I hope to bring to the table a simple game, yet with some strategic options, and a forgiving game -- unlike, say, 1830: Railways & Robber Barons. At the same time, 18Scan has a number of subsystems (Minor Companies, a merger railroad, Destinations, various categories of trains) that provide a panoply of the wide variety within the 18xx gaming space.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The Dutch first edition and German second edition include the first expansion for this game, Munchkin Bites! 2: Pants Macabre. The same applies to Italian edition.<br/><br/>",

This is the fourth game in the The Hunters series, and covers one of the largest fleets of submarines in the world at the time. You command one of many submarine models available starting in 1940, and look to successfully complete patrols until the armistice in September 1943.<br/><br/>While your mission is to destroy as much Allied shipping and as many Capital ships as possible, players will find it extremely challenging to survive until the Armistice.<br/><br/>Beneath the Med is purposely designed to deliver a brisk yet intensive gaming experience that forces many decisions upon you as you take command of the major Italian submarine classes. All the major classes are accounted for, with every level of detail, including period of service, armaments, crew make-up, damage capacity, and more. Fans of The Hunters will enjoy the same nail-biting game system, but will be challenged by the thick Allied air cover and the problematic fire control systems of the Italian boats.<br/><br/>Ten Italian submarine classes are profiled and available for you to choose from. Patrol zones reflect the period during the war at sea and will shift as the war progresses. All stages of the U-Boat campaign are represented; difficult missions include mine-laying, commando delivery, and the extremely dangerous harbor penetration missions.<br/><br/>The major Italian classes are are represented and accurately profiled for the patrols you will undertake during the war:<br/>- Acciaio Class<br/>- Adua Class<br/>- Cagni Class<br/>- Calvi Class<br/>- Foca Class<br/>- Glauco Class<br/>- Liuzzi Class<br/>- Marcello Class<br/>- Marconi Class<br/>- Perla Class<br/><br/>Patrol Assignments include:<br/>- Atlantic<br/>- Brazilian Coast<br/>- Caribbean<br/>- Eastern, Central and Western Mediterranean<br/>- Singapore<br/>- Spanish Coast<br/>- West African Coast<br/><br/>The game delivers an historical narrative as 480 ship targets are uniquely identified (including tonnage) with their historical counterparts that were sunk during the war, including freighters, tankers, and American ships.<br/><br/>Game System Highlights:<br/>- 10 Italian submarine classes represented<br/>- 9 different Patrol Assignments, including supply delivery to Japan<br/>- 480 named shipping targets, including 20 Capital ships<br/>- Special Missions for Commando Team Delivery, Supply Delivery, Human Torpedo attack, and Minelaying<br/>- Combat encounters with individual ships, ships with escort, convoys, enemy submarines, and aircraft<br/>- Daytime and Night Engagements<br/>- Submarine damage includes flooding, hull, torpedo doors, periscope, fuel tanks, crew injury (by crew type), engines, hydrophones, AA gun(s), deck gun, batteries, radio<br/>- Crew Advancement, Commander Promotion including decorations such as the  &quot;Medaglia d'oro al Valor Militare,&quot; the &quot;Medaglia d'argento al Valor Militare,&quot; and the &quot;Medaglia d'bronzo al Valor Militare,&quot; along with other Italian awards.

The crew of the ship transporting the loot turned pirate and hid the treasure on the Island of Cocos. Now YOU are trying to find it, but you'll need to share some information with your fellow pirates to make sure you find it before the Spanish catch you!<br/><br/>In the challenging deduction board game Loot of Lima, the Island of Cocos has 24 locations: 8 on the shore, 8 in the forest, and 8 in the mountains; the treasure is hidden in two of these locations. The game has a token for each of these locations, and at the start of the game, two tokens as placed back in the box (with these tokens indicating where the treasure is hidden). The rest of the tokens are then passed out evenly to the players; these represent places you have already searched and know where the treasure is not hidden.<br/><br/>Each turn, players roll three 12-sided dice to determine which questions they can ask their opponents. For example, how many locations have you searched between the southeast and the northwest? Or, how many locations in the forest have you searched between the west and the south?

        "description": "The Battle of Midway was the climactic carrier engagement of the Pacific War. Nerve-wracking and intense, the battle was decided by timing, strategy and good fortune. In the span of only four minutes the war in the Pacific was changed forever. The chance convergence of the Enterprise and Yorktown Strike Groups between 10:22 and 10:26 AM on June 4th led to the devastation of the Japanese flattops and sparked the infernos which would engulf the Japanese Empire.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor, The Hell of Stalingrad, Midway drops you right into the seat of the action. You make the strategic decisions necessary to first locate the enemy fleet and then destroy it! Scramble your fighters and organize your Strike Groups for their deadly missions. Will they destroy the enemy and make it back? Your squadrons must contend not just with the enemy's anti-aircraft fire and fight vicious engagements with the enemy's CAP, but also navigate the wide and empty expanses of the ocean. Do the survivors have enough fuel for the return trip to your fleet? Or will they too be lost forever to the misfortunes of war?<br/><br/>The Fires of Midway explores in separate scenarios the four major carrier battles of 1942: Coral Sea, Midway Island, Eastern Solomons, and Santa Cruz. Also included is a campaign game linking them all together in which players must husband their resources not knowing which of these battles, if any, will yield the decisive result and turn the tide of war in their favor like the historical battle of Midway did.<br/><br/>The Coral Sea can be played in as little as 1 hr and up to 2.5 hrs for the Midway Battle.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/><br/>     200 playing cards<br/>     1 sheets of counters<br/>     1 large deck of 18 Carrier Cards <br/>     3 Play Mats<br/>     A 16 Page color Flight Manual (Core Rules) <br/>     A 24 Page Operations Manual (Advanced Rules)<br/>     Dice (2 different colors, D-6)<br/>     Box<br/><br/><br/>",

Each game consists of five auction rounds; during each round, eight robot cards will be individually auctioned to the highest bidder though you won&rsquo;t necessarily get to see all eight of the robots in advance - it all depends on how fast McPUD is running the conveyor belt!<br/><br/>Mechanics pay for these cards using the power allocations on cards in hand which include, as the game progresses, robots they have already purchased.<br/><br/>After each round, and at the end of the game, mechanics can also allocate some of their cards to Production Units (special cards requiring sets of robots with particular symbols) for bonus points.<br/><br/>The winner is the mechanic with the most points.<br/><br/>&quot;Fzzzt! - Yesterday's men building tomorrow's world today&quot;.<br/><br/>",

If, however, an opponent lays out more cards of the same type, then characters of that type already on the table are discarded.

There are multiple worker types that a guardian can summon to reap the benefits of the land.

        "description": "Circus Train Second Edition, by designer Tom Decker, is a 1-5 player game in which you are the owner and operator of a small circus train in prohibition-era America. In this game, you and your opponents are vying to employ the best talent while putting on the most magnificent show each month. While touring the country by train, you will have the opportunity to perform while adding talent to your show through hiring the performers stranded in cities by defunct circuses. Just remember to keep an eye on your wages, because your talent definitely will.<br/><br/>Through clever card hand management, you control the movement of your train around the American northeast, making strategic business decisions about talent, performances and payroll in this fast-paced strategy game. Each turn represents one week of real time, and after six months, the circus season closes for the year and the game ends with one player declared as having The Greatest Show on Earth.<br/><br/>Inspired by Sara Gruen&rsquo;s novel, Water for Elephants, Circus Train Second Edition includes thematic elements such as improving your show&rsquo;s reputation by picking up alcohol for your talent and staff (legally, in Canada), the high costs of supplying big cats and elephants, and the ability to &ldquo;red light&rdquo; (firing by throwing off the train) disgruntled talent or talent that has simply become too expensive to maintain. These elements are blended into the game&rsquo;s mechanics, keeping it all simple while adding layers of depth and strategy.<br/><br/>What's New in 2nd Edition:<br/><br/>This new edition combines the first edition with its first expansion. Along with a graphic face-lift, it adds more players (3 more), thereby changing the experience for a gamer and how they play Circus Train 2nd Edition. It also adds new, never-before-seen Event cards into the mix.<br/><br/>",

When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.  No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances.  A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition.  Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clash of Giants II: The Campaigns of Galicia and First Ypres, 1914 is the sequel to Ted Raicer's acclaimed Clash of Giants: Campaigns of Tannenberg and the Marne, 1914. As with the original design, CoG II contains two separate games (both using the same basic system) covering two of the most interesting (and least-gamed) campaigns of the First World War, Galicia and First Ypres .<br/><br/> Galicia 1914  pitted the armies of Tsarist Russia and Habsburg Austria-Hungary in a ferocious struggle along a 200 mile front. The Austrian commander, General Conrad, refused to wait for the arrival of his 2nd Army, which had been initially deployed to the Serbian front, before going onto the offensive. The Austrian attack began on 19 August, with Conrad's 1st and 4th Armies on the Austrian left flank striking the Russian 4th and 5th Armies on the Tsarist right. The Austrians outnumbered the Russians on this flank, and initially drove them back, and Conrad began to dream of pocketing the entire Russian army group. But the absence of the Austrian 2nd Army gave the Russians an even greater numerical advantage on the opposite flank, as two Russian armies (the 3rd and 8th) struck the Austrian 3rd east of Lemberg (Lvov). Soon it was Conrad's armies that were in danger of being cut off and destroyed. The campaign was a catastrophe for Austria-Hungary, but in the end the result was a fatally incomplete victory for the Russians.<br/><br/>The  First Ypres  game is the first game to cover the climax of the &quot;Race to the Sea&quot; on the Western Front that followed the inconclusive Allied victory at the Marne. By 8 October the continued outflanking attempts by both sides had nearly reached the English Channel. A massive meeting engagement developed, with the Germans first attempting to launch a massive cavalry raid around the Allied northern flank in the direction of Abbeville. When this fizzled (due to the timely arrival of a French infantry corps), the French and British began their own offensive aimed at driving all the way to the German border. But the Allied attack quickly ran into German troops of the 6th Army, hurried north from Alsace-Lorraine. Falkenhayn, the German commander, now planned to play his trump card, striking the BEF with four newly-raised reserve corps of hurriedly-trained but enthusiastic volunteers. In a month of brutal struggle in which the British lost 60,000 men, the Germans lost well over 100,000. Not realizing that the BEF had been bled white and was on the point of breaking, Falkenhayn called off his attacks in mid-November. The attempts to end the war by Christmas were over.<br/><br/>Clash of Giants II uses a slightly modified version of the original system to model these dynamic and closely balanced contests. As in Clash of Giants, the game emphasizes the difficulty of commanding groups of armies, with a system where movement allowance for each army is separately determined by a command roll. But CoGII adds an interactive random chit-pull activation sequence, so that neither player knows which of his commands will move next. Each player has only one combat phase per turn, which he may declare at the end of any one of his command activations, but which covers the entire map. This leads to many difficult game decisions: &quot;Do I declare combat now, with only part of my forces in position to attack, or wait hoping to get more units into the line, but risking the enemy either pulling back or striking first?&quot;<br/><br/>Once combat is declared, CoGII uses the unique combat system so popular in Tannenberg and Marne, in which a unit's training, equipment, and morale are factored into a Tactical Effiency Rating that often counts more than mere numbers.<br/><br/>Galicia 1914 includes a corps/division OB and a map scaled at 9 miles to the hex that covers the entire front from Krakow to the Romanian border. The victory conditions force the Austrian player to attack initially in order to gain enough VPs to survive the strong Russian offensive certain to follow. Galicia features special rules for the great Austrian fortress of Przemysl, Russian cavalry replacements, rail supply, Offensive Support Markers (representing heavy artillery and the logistical and command preparations of a major assault), and the arrival of the Austrian 2nd Army.<br/>The OB for First Ypres is at division level (with the odd brigade). The map scale is 3.3 miles to the hex, from Lens in the south to the English Channel. Special rules include Offensive Support Markers, the Belgian retreat onto the map from Antwerp, flooding the Yser River line, French and German cavalry replacements, unknown Tactical Efficiency Ratings for the German New Reserve Corps, and British tenacity (represented by remnant counters). Victory goes to the player who controls 5 of the 9 victory hexes at the end of the game, and the game is sometimes decided on the final combat roll by a last-ditch attack or defense of a single key hex.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>    One 22&quot; x 34&quot; backprinted game map<br/>    Two 8.5 x 11 Player Aid Cards<br/>    Two 5/8&quot; Countersheets<br/>    Two Six-sided Dice<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT Games website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tuscany, 1259. As wealth from crafts and foreign trade elevated northern Italy&rsquo;s urban families above the landed lords, rivalries within and among their cities hardened into conflict between two great parties. The Ghibellines aligned with the Hohenstaufen emperors who ostensibly ruled Italy, while the Guelphs backed rival imperial claimants and the greatest challenger to the Emperor&rsquo;s authority, the Pope. Should any faction gain advantage, others coalesced to resist.<br/><br/>The comuni (republics) of Firenze (Florence) and Siena dominated inland Tuscany at the head of competing alliances. As Guelphs sealed their control of the more populous Firenze, Ghibelline Siena turned to the Hohenstaufen King Manfredi of Naples for help. Local rebellions and reprisals escalated on each side, as political exiles stirred the pot. After Manfredi dispatched German knights to protect his loyal Tuscans, Firenze mustered its people and allies to march on Siena, which responded with its own great army. Pisa and Lucca, Lombardia and Umbria joined in. Guelph and Ghibelline faced off en masse at Montaperti in September 1260, in what turned out a bloody Florentine defeat. As Ghibelline exiles returned to grip Firenze, its Guelphs rallied to Lucca and Arezzo, portending an eternal inferno of fighting.<br/><br/>Inferno&mdash;the third volume in Volko Ruhnke&rsquo;s Levy &amp; Campaign Series&mdash;visits the conflagration that was 13th-Century Tuscan warfare, factional conflict fueled by the money and burgeoning population of the region&rsquo;s well-to-do cities and mountain valleys. Veteran Italian wargame designer Enrico Acerbi applies his deep knowledge of the age to bring it to life within Volko&rsquo;s accessible medieval-operational system. Gathering enough transport and provender may not so much be the challenge here as the sudden impediment of rebel towns and castles along key roads. Tuscany&rsquo;s unruly berrovieri horsemen, famed elite crossbowmen, and distinctive palvesari shield bearers are just a few of the unique features of this volume.

The opponent Bot immediately loaded the crystal and proceed to rejoin his base; two other Bots were nearing and they didn't look too friendly! The mechanic sighed heavily as he knew this would inevitably end up in a melee, damaged Bots, and long hours in the repair shop afterwards...&quot;<br/><br/>In Twin Tin Bots, the robot-programming game for the new generation, many corporations have invested in crystal mining after they were discovered as a potent energy source. They designed and improved robots to harvest crystals and a few people can now run a big crystal harvesting rig. Many teams work on the same harvesting plant, but the game's always on to bring more crystals back than the others.<br/><br/>In the game, each player programs two robots to harvest crystals from the game board and bring them back to his base. The catch is that robots repeat their programming, but changes to the program from turn to turn are limited. Robots can also interact with other robots so even the best laid plans can end up slightly different than expected.<br/><br/>The player who harvests the most valuable crystals wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It Never Snows is a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game covering the pivotal Market Garden offensive in September, 1944. Using a system based on the well-received SCS Game Bastogne, It Never Snows covers the landings and ground offensive endeavoring to link up with them at 600m per hex with units generally companies. Each turn is half a day making for a 17 turn campaign game (uniquely playable among Market Garden games).<br/>  <br/>The expansive five map area allows each of the airborne division fights to be geographically isolated and separate, as was the case historically. What this does is that it allows each situation to be gamed as its own little tactical puzzle&mdash;making it such that a player might be &ldquo;winning&rdquo; in one region while &ldquo;losing&rdquo; in another, at the same time.

This game covers the German attack in the Ardennes in 1944, better known as the Battle of the Bulge.<br/><br/>From the publisher:<br/><br/>Dec. 16, 1944: Along 50 miles of front in Belgium, the German Wehrmacht shatters the stillness of the morning as it begins its last great offensive in the West. More than 1,000 tanks and 200,000 men are available to break through the thinly held American line. It is Hitler's last desperate bid to change the course of the war.<br/><br/>Ardennes is a game of this classic engagement, the Battle of the Bulge. It features all the color you'd expect from a study of this topic: against-all-odds American defenses, slashing Panzer assaults, dramatic bridge crossings, Nebelwerfers, para-drops, commandos and more -- but in a crisp, fast, fun game of the most popular battle in U.S. World War II history.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 Km<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full-color maps<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (560 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page SCS version 1.6 system rulebook<br/>One 16-page Ardennes specific rulebook<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-15 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Celt &mdash; Latin Celta, plural Celtae &mdash; were an early Indo-European people who from the second millennium BCE to the first century BCE spread over much of Europe. Their tribes and groups eventually ranged from the British Isles and Portugal to as far east as Transylvania, the Black Sea coasts, and Galatia in Anatolia, and they were in part absorbed into the Roman Empire as Britons, Gauls, Boii, Galatians, Celtiberians, and Lusitans.<br/><br/>Celtae is a &quot;worker swapping&quot; game powered by a rondel in which players choose actions to perform during their turn. On their turn, players swap one of their three active workers with one of the three workers on the action space they wish to perform, then they perform the action &mdash; which will be boosted if they have in their worker pool specific types of workers: farmers, builders, soldiers, and nobles.<br/><br/><br/>     The farming action allows players to draw cards, and it's boosted by farmers. Cards have three types of uses in the game: building, preparing for battle, and engaging with the druid order.<br/>     The build action allows players to build and expand citadels on the board by placing their discs on them, and it's boosted by builders. At game's end, only completed citadels will score, and players have to work together to complete them and score their presence on them. Each time players build in a citadel, they gain a bonus that was randomly assigned during set-up. The combination of these bonuses with a timely performed action often results in powerful combos.<br/>     The battle action, which is boosted by soldiers, allows players to defeat increasingly stronger Roman armies and to garrison the outskirts of the citadels on the map.<br/>     The recruit action, boosted by nobles, allows players to recruit workers to their tribe, increasing the number of available workers to boost future actions. However, if you manage to send certain types of workers from your tribe into the druid order, you'll get their favor and a druid worker who functions like a joker and boosts almost every type of action.<br/><br/><br/>Every player has a leader card assigned to their tribe at the beginning of the game. At a certain point on the game, players will have to choose if their leaders stay on its regular side and like that gain a small number of points at game's end or forfeit those meager points and flip it to its heroic side, which has much harder requirements for much larger endgame points.<br/><br/>Each time the action marker on the rondel completes a full turn, the player who currently holds the favor of Teutates places a progress marker on one of the progress cards next to the game board. At game's end, only progress cards with progress markers will score, so as the game advances, players determine what will score...and what will not.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This team of adventurers will make key decisions about where to go and how to respond to the world around them.<br/><br/>A full journey through the Divine Atlas takes approximately 20 hours to complete, encompassing around 16 of the Atlas's 50 locations. The decisions players make during exploration, combat, and character creation can significantly influence the story and the course of the adventure. With various ways to finish the game and multiple diverging paths and choices, no two adventures will be the same. Choices you make will be documented from session to session, creating a responsive experience where player decisions matter and their consequences have tangible effects on the story.<br/>Players can choose a character from 10 unique Origin stories, equip items, runes, and learn skills from 12 skill schools, each with 7 unique skills. Players use the skills acquired throughout the game to perform unique and powerful attacks, some with additional elemental effects. Most skills require a cooldown period before they can be used again, so choosing when to use them is critically important.<br/><br/>The iconic elemental interactions from Divinity: Original Sin are present here! You can, for example, cover an area in oil so that another player can ignite it with a fire spell, setting the entire area ablaze. Alternatively, your ally can cast rain to make the area wet, allowing you to use lightning to stun the enemy. Creating combinations is essential to ensure victory against the most challenging of enemies. However, be aware that enemies can also create combinations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a spymaster. Your mission: Dominate the world of undercover intelligence by deploying agents to complete vital missions. To complete your mission, you must first build an underground network of highly trained agents from different branches of espionage.<br/><br/>In the card game SpyNet, two to four players work alone or with a teammate to gather the information they need to recruit the best agents and disrupt their opponents' plans. With clever play and careful coordination, you can rise to the top of the intelligence community and become a dominant force in the world of covert espionage.<br/><br/>In more detail, the deck contains agents, funding, and missions. Players draft cards from a face-down line-up: Look at the first pile and take it or put it back in order to look at the second pile; look at the second pile, etc. After you take a pile, you add one card to empty spot in the line-up as well as each pile that you passed over, thereby enriching the haul for the next player.<br/><br/>Players lay down color-coded agents in order to gain strength in four fields: tech, infiltration, counterespionage, and enforcement. Funding can be applied to any agent, and some agents have special powers that take effect when played. A player can complete a mission only when their strength in that mission's field is stronger than all other opponents.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 532, Buddhism arrived in Japan, and took its place alongside Shintoism, which is the official religion. Prince Shotoku, seduced by this new religion, commissioned Buddhist monks to construct a village endowed with an immense garden, in which 8 pagodas (tajuto) would be erected. He announced that once the fourth tajuto was complete, it would make this city an important pilgrimage destination for all Buddhists around the world. The Buddhist monk who has attained the highest level of Spirituality, through deep Meditation and other mental qualities, at this precise moment will be rewarded, and the Prince will name them &quot;Great Guardian of the Sacred Garden of the Eight Pagodas&quot;, and this monk will become the overseer of pilgrimage.<br/><br/>In Tajuto, players take on the roles of the Buddhist monks, trying to achieve the highest spirituality. On their turn, they can activate their action tiles to draw (and build) pagoda tiles from the bag, make offerings to gain meditation points, and acquire tiles that will help them progress more quickly or earn them spirituality points. Activating more than one action tile or acquiring tiles costs meditation points. The game ends once the fourth pagoda is finished. The player with the most spirituality points wins.<br/><br/>The key feature of the game is drawing the pagoda tiles from the bag. The pagoda tiles have a decreasing size per level. Players are welcome to blindly rummage around to try to recognize the floor by its size, but they aren&rsquo;t likely to be able to detect the color this way, so drawing the floor size they want depends on their tactile recognition, but they have to weigh their odds to draw the color they want.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He follows that up by playing a unit, either German or Allied, that was available in the chosen year and could fight in the chosen environment, and the other players subsequently either pass or play a unit (of either nationality) that meets the same conditions.  When all players have made their selections, dice (sometimes) are rolled and totals are compared to determine whether the Germans or the Allies won.  The player who contributed the most to the winning team gets to decide how the convoy and the opposing enemy ships, which are all worth victory points and possibly an increased hand size, are to be distributed amongst the players who were on the winning side.  After twenty convoys have been fought over in this manner, the player with the most victory points' worth of convoys and captured ships wins the game!<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Pacific Typhoon<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Far Space Federation is leading an ongoing peacekeeping mission. The crew on the front lines are in constant need of new supplies and equipment, so the Federation has set up a massive supply line network. This network is composed of massive space stations called Foundries. Some Foundries are specialized in mining and processing ore from asteroids. Other Foundries are equipped with robotic manufacturing and repair facilities. Their job is to keep the flow of supplies going efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>The gameplay in Far Space Foundry occurs in two distinct halves: Space Foundry Alpha and Space Foundry Beta.<br/><br/>At Space Foundry Alpha, you mine skyrite (blue crystals) and rubion (red ore) and process the two to make galactium (purple metal). On your turn, you play a card that allows you to either land a shuttle on a docking bay or take off from one. The shuttle will transport raw materials either from the asteroid or to your freighters. Each docking bay has a special ability if activated that turn, like ore processing or galactic traders. At this foundry, you must also build a fleet of freighters to haul your items. To do this, you must visit the cantina to recruit help from various alien captains (with unique abilities). Once everyone has played all of their cards, it's time to head off to a new board...<br/><br/>At Space Foundry Beta, you take all of your acquired materials and transport them down to the station. There the robots will use that material to make various products of varying worth. Besides manufacturing, you may also upgrade your freighters or charge up your existing products for more points. Once the freighters are filled back up again, it's time to transport the items to their final destination for final scoring!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Europe Divided - a game of an expansionist Europe, a resurgent Russia, and a new Cold War<br/><br/>The end of the Cold War ushered in a new age of European expansion. Central and Eastern Europe had emerged from dictatorships and wanted to consolidate their democracies. They sought European integration to ensure they would not fall back into the Russian sphere of influence. Russia &mdash; a shell of its former power as the Soviet Union &mdash; could do nothing to slow the European expansion.<br/><br/><br/>But then things changed.<br/><br/><br/>Oil prices increased, bolstering Russia's economy. Putin came to power, and despite political discontent in Russia, his popularity remained strong. In 2008, war broke out between Russia and the NATO-aspirant, former Soviet country of Georgia. Russia's resurgence had begun, exemplified by the 2014 annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern Ukraine.<br/><br/><br/>In the game, you control of one of the two powers: Europe (controlling both NATO and the European Union) or Russia. Europe is powerful and rich, but bureaucratic and slow to react. Russia lacks Europe's resources, but can respond rapidly.<br/><br/><br/>Players score victory points by having dominant influence in contested countries in Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus. They can also score victory points by bringing key historical events to fruition. Gameplay is rich with history and includes today's potential flashpoints, but it features a fast-playing card-driven core mechanism. Players use cards associated with countries they control to establish political and military influence, gain financial resources, and deploy their military presence. An elegant deck-manipulation mechanism weakens players' decks as they increase their influence, creating tension between seeking to expand and overreaching.<br/><br/><br/>Will the Velvet Revolution result in the split of the Czech Republic and Slovakia? How will the Bosnian War end? The players will decide the fate of history throughout this period of Europe Divided.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A solitaire, CDG-flavoured, strategic-level game set during the Marcomannic Wars, 170CE-180CE. Playing from the perspective of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, your goal is to defeat and pacify three different tribes while managing off-map wars and rebellions, troop shortages, limited resources, and the effects of plague&mdash;all while maintaining your standing with the Senate and people of Rome.<br/><br/>The Marcomannic Wars were a series of conflicts fought by the Romans against a loose coalition of German and Sarmatian tribes along the Danube from 166CE to 180CE. After crushing a Roman army and killing as many as 20,000 Roman soldiers near Carnuntum, German barbarians ravaged the Danube provinces and besieged Aquileia, marking the first time a hostile force had entered Italy in nearly 300 years. Meanwhile, Sarmatians invaded Dacia and Costoboci descended deep into the Balkans and Greece as far as Athens. It took Rome more than a decade to restore peace, with war and plague extracting a terrible cost of human and material resources.<br/><br/>The game covers the war from the disastrous Battle of Carnuntum in 170CE to Marcus Aurelius' death in 180CE. Each turn (lasting one year) is divided into four rounds: early campaign, late campaign, winter and an attrition/house keeping round.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, the player draws three barbarian cards and resolves their effects. Barbarian cards activate enemy tribes (restoring their morale or causing them to advance), trigger off-map conflicts, or cause special events such as plague, mutiny, or rebellions.<br/><br/>On their turn, the Roman player draws a set number of cards (5 during the early campaign, 3 during the late campaign, and 1 during winter) and plays as many or few as they choose for either actions or events. Actions include: attacking barbarian tribes; building forts; moving legions; and increasing &quot;Imperium Points.&rdquo; Many cards can also be played for historically based events, such as the &quot;Lightning miracle&quot; depicted on the Column of Marcus Aurelius; and the &quot;Galen&quot; event that mitigates the effects of plague. All cards must be used by the end of the year or discarded, except for one card that can be held over into the next year by use of the &quot;Meditations&quot; deck.<br/><br/>Battles are resolved by rolling 1d6 for the Romans and 1d6 for the Barbarians. The Roman role is modified by the number of legions assigned to the front and the combat rating of the leader. Cards can be spend to commit &quot;reserves&quot; to avoid a defeat or eke out a victory. Other cards including &quot;Ambush,&quot; &quot;Tactical Superiority&quot; and &quot;Route&quot; can affect the outcome of battles. Enemy die rolls are modified by the morale of the tribe and the terrain, representing the barbarians' knowledge of the lands north of the Danube and Romans' difficulties in maintaining supply lines.<br/><br/>Players can lose in a number of ways: if the Marcomanni break through into Italy the game immediately ends. Suddenly death also occurs if the player's Imperium Points (IP) drop into &quot;usurpation.&quot; If all three tribes have not been defeated and pacified by 180CE the game also ends in a loss.<br/><br/>The player wins by driving barbarians back into their home space and defeating them there. Once a tribe is defeated they must be kept pacified by building forts and keeping troops assigned to garrisons, or they may break their treaty and rejoin the fight (as happened historically). Final victory occurs if all three tribes have surrendered. The player's score takes into account the number of years that have elapsed, their IP level, and the number of off-map conflicts they have resolved.<br/><br/>",

The two maps included are painted by original map artist Charlie Kibler. The military unit counters have been redesigned by Charlie Kibler to harken back to the counters in the original games in the series but with a more modern graphical treatment.<br/><br/>Atlanta Is Ours contains an updated version of the GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that all the other games in the series use.

The goal is to force the Confederates to fight outside the forts or abandon Atlanta. Tara is the fictional plantation in the movie Gone With The Wind, and is &quot;located&quot; a few miles from Jonesboro where the armies have their final battle.<br/>    Last Stand At Tara (8/31 - 9/2/1864; 3 turns): This scenario encompasses both the Confederate attack on the Union at Jonesboro and then the Confederate retreat and consolidation of their army at Lovejoy&rsquo;s Station to the south on the RR line.<br/><br/><br/> <br/>Advanced Game Scenarios<br/><br/>    To The Chattahoochee (Advanced scenario, May-July 1864): This scenario covers Johnston's retreat and the Union advance from the initial lines at Dalton to near Atlanta.<br/>    The Real Game For Atlanta (Advanced scenario, July-Sept. 1864): This scenario encompasses Hood's attacks near the Atlanta forts and Sherman's maneuvering resulting in the Union capture of Atlanta.<br/>    The Atlanta Campaign (Advanced scenario, May-Sept 1864): A &quot;grand campaign&quot; linking the two above advanced scenarios.<br/>    The Hardest Knocks (Advanced scenario, May-July or Sept 1864): Alternative setups to the May campaign startup.<br/>    Without Home Or Habitation (Advanced scenario, Sept &ndash; Oct 1864): After the fall of Atlanta, Hood heads north to cut Sherman&rsquo;s rail line.

You can even upgrade your troopers by collecting equipment and new weapons from the Battlefield, such as Machineguns, medipacks, grenades and more. But beware &ndash; you could be triggering a booby trap!<br/><br/>Deadzone marries the frantic action and fun of a tabletop game with the simplicity and elegance of a board game to create a truly innovative experience. With the Deadzone box, players take control of either the stalwart Enforcers or the horrific Plague, battling it out over scarce resources by combining deadly actions and an innovate Battle Card deck to lethal effect. Shoot to kill or claw your way through flesh as it doesn't matter how many should die in this urban landscape so long as players achieve their objectives.<br/><br/>All of this is set against a sci-fi backdrop brought to life using a grid-based gaming mat depicting the urban warzone that can be built up using Barricades and Buildings from the new modular Mantic Scenery Range, adding a vertical dimension to your games.

Each player directs the effort of one or more of the major powers, plus their minor allies, using the card-driven operations and point-to-point movement system of many of GMT&rsquo;s most highly-regarded games.  The cards help players enact Frederick&rsquo;s pre-war invasion planning, Austrian minister Kaunitz&rsquo;s diplomatic triumph in the 2nd Treaty of Versailles, the operational ascendancy of Prussian and Hanoverian light troops, formation of the Austrian General Staff, huge financial loans, court intrigue at Versailles, Vienna, and St. Petersburg, and dozens of other key political, economic, and military events.  COM also uses split decks, which foster play of each power&rsquo;s events in two phases -- Early War (usually through mid-1758), and Wider War (1758 to conclusion) &ndash; and allow a multi-player game to use exactly the same rules as a 2-player contest.  COM augments the CDG system with a Colonial Conflict sub-game, a fully-integrated treatment of light unit operations, and a Fortunes of War chit pull, which varies the occurrence and/or timing of events beyond players&rsquo; control each year -- severe weather, desertion, attrition, possible deaths of English king George II, Empress Elizabeth of Russia, et al, and Madame Pompadour&rsquo;s political influence over the French commanders, to add further uncertainty and drama to the campaigns.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately their car breaks down and they meet with pure darkness, the Psycho Raiders, once they are on your trail, they hunt to the death...<br/><br/>This horrifying halloween night may not be survived.  The true story of what happened on this fateful evening comes alive in the pages and gameplay of Halloween Nightmares.<br/><br/>Psycho Raiders is a horror simulation experience.  Unlike games that tend to aim for perfect balance, Psycho Raiders' main focus is delivering the terrifying experience that occurred on this Halloween night.   Characters and situations are not balanced to equal one another but created to simulate the actual experience.  The game begins very slanted to the raiders, they will assuredly destroy if fighting just ill prepared campers.  Through the use of finding weapons or alerting the nearby town folk of Crucible, the campers can possibly turn the tables on the raiders.  But there may also be a horrid realization that certain town folk are raiders themselves. The campers may not be able to trust anyone!  It might be best to run! RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN!<br/><br/>Psycho Raiders is a tactical hex and counter game with each token representing an individual character. Characters have sheets with some individual stats related to speed, strength and will to live. In the short game, the campers can win if any of them escape the north end of the map while hidden.<br/><br/>Psycho Raiders is a very visceral experience and we have rated it X. Anyone one under the age of 18 is NOT permitted to play.   Pregnant or players with a fragile or nervous disposition are strongly encouraged NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME!<br/><br/>GAME COMIC CREATED BY CHARLIE FOGEL!<br/><br/>Note: Psycho Raiders is the first game featured in our &quot;Halloween Nightmares Horrorgame Magazine&quot;, a game magazine dedicated to Halloween and the Horrorgame genre.  Players will need to xerox elements and provide two D6 and pencils to play this game<br/><br/>",

But business is anything but usual. As they broker contracts and flirt with crime, merchants must avoid arousing the suspicion of the Venetian Inquisition, lest they find themselves arrested and their businesses shut down.<br/><br/>In the game, players move their two gondolas around the board. When they move a gondola, they may activate the assistants they have placed previously on any building they pass, but they may train (and improve the capabilities of) only the one on which they end their movement. Assistants allow you to gain resources, trade, make money, and take an array of other actions depending on the buildings to which they are assigned. When resources are made, they are placed in the gondola, and these will be used to fulfill lucrative contracts.<br/><br/>Space is limited on the city's canals, however, and each time you pass another merchant's boat, gossip will spread, raising your suspicion level with the Inquisition. Lower your suspicion with visits and donations to the church, or academic institutions &mdash; or throw caution to the wind and engage in unsavory activities for money or information. During the game, being such a well-known merchant can be a boon to your political career, but at game end, the most suspicious player will be made an example of by the Inquisition &mdash; blocking your victory even if you have the most points.<br/><br/>Includes solo mode by David Turczi and Xavi Bordes<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fresh fruit and veggies! The best in the market! Look at these strawberries, ma'am!<br/><br/>In Veggies, a.k.a. Magazynier, 2-4 players compete to build the most successful produce stand in the market from eight cards that they'll place turn by turn. Each card contains six spots in a 2x3 layout, with those spots containing strawberries, bananas, grapes, carrots, mushrooms, an empty pallet, or rats. On a turn, play the card in your hand or a card of your choice from the row of three cards into your personal layout. You can overlap the cards as you wish so long as you retain a grid structure to how they're laid out. If you played from your hand, you draft a face-up card to end your turn, then reveal a new card.<br/><br/>When each player has placed eight cards, the game ends. Players score points for the largest group of the good of their choice, but the rest of the players also score this good, so try to dominate one type of good for yourself while also building up goods that others will score. Your score for a good is the number of distinct groups of that good multiplied by the number of crates in your largest group of that good. Empty pallets are worth 0 points, and rats are -2 points, so you better cover them up to keep from scaring customers! Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Work stations aren't locked out like most other worker placement games - if you really want to push someone out - you can, but their worker goes back to be reused this turn!

        "description": "[from the back of the flatpack edition]<br/><br/>Wellington's Victory : The Battle of Waterloo<br/><br/>- Four-color 68&rdquo; x 44&rdquo; contour map in four sections<br/>- Innovative Fire and Shock Combat mechanics<br/>- Line, Column, Square, Skirmish and Cavalry formations<br/>- Hougomont, La Haye Sainte and Plancenoit Scenarios<br/>- 40 Game-Turn Grand Battle Scenario<br/><br/>Wellington's Victory is a grand tactical simulation of the Battle of Waterloo which occurred on June 18, 1815, at a minor crossroads south of Brussels, Belgium.  The battle marked the first and only encounter of history's two most renowned generals, Sir Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Wellington, and Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France.  A brutal day-long French assault against the British held ridge brought Wellington's army to the brink of defeat.  By later afternoon, however, the arrival of Wellington's allies tipped the odds decisively against the French; Napoleon chose to stake his empire on the outcome of a final attack by his most trusted troops &ndash; the Imperial Guard.  Wellington's Victory is played on an innovative game map composed of four 34&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; map sections on which significant differences in ground contours are differentiated by color.  There are five distinct contour levels depicted on the map as well as an extremely accurate survey of all battle field terrain features including Hougomont, La Haye Sainte, and almost every other farm and dwelling, woods and orchards, streams and ponds, and raised and sunken roads.<br/><br/>Each of more than 500 French, Prussian and Anglo-Dutch combat and command units are fully identified by battalion, regiment, brigade, division and corps designations as well as numerical game values which differentiate each unit's strength, effectiveness, and mobility.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a fifteen minute Game-Turn.  Each mapsheet hex represents a distance of 100 yards.  Each Strength Point represents 100 infantry or cavalry troops or one gun or howitzer within an artillery battery.  Each Game-Turn employs a unique, asymmetrical, sequence of play in which Players alternately participate in a series of Phases covering activities which include the execution of chain of command mechanics (such as activating and committing reserve formations and initiating cavalry charges), rallying disordered and routed units, executing facing and formation changes (including a repertoire of infantry formations such as column, line, square and open order or skirmish formation), regular and grand tactical movement, and finally executing artillery and small arms fire as well as infantry and cavalry shock command.<br/><br/>The Fire and Shock Combat mechanics which decide the battle were also designed to yield realistic results without sacrificing playability.  Fire resolution requires no arithmetic calculation since each unit fires separately.  The Relative Firepower Table used to resolve Fire Combat is a new type of CRT which directly interrelates the strength, formation and quality of the firing unit with the formation and terrain cover employed by the defending unit.  The Shock Combat Table is also unique in that it employs an &ldquo;odds&rdquo; comparison to account for Troop strength differences between the attacker and defender and a &ldquo;differential&rdquo; comparison to account for any qualitative difference between the opposing forces.  Losses, which are recorded directly on the map by placing a Strength marker under the unit suffering casualties, may result from either Fire or Shock combat.  In general, however, Shock Combat is depicted as a &ldquo;morale showdown&rdquo; more useful for gaining ground than inflicting casualties.<br/><br/>Morale, which Napoleon deemed to be three times as important as numerical strength on the battlefield, is accurately accounted for in the Effectiveness Rating assigned to every infantry battalion, cavalry regiment and artillery battery crew.<br/><br/>Buyer's Guide for WELLINGTON'S VICTORY<br/>The following ratings are based on at least 100 player-replies to surveys conducted through Strategy &amp; Tactics Magazine.  Ratings are on a 1 (worst) to 9 (best) scale.  Average ratings (for over 60 historical games in print) are:  Acceptability-6.00, Complexity-5.00.<br/><br/>Acceptability Rating:        New Game<br/>Complexity Rating:        (est.) 7.8<br/>Avg.

        "description": "In the two-player card game Crazy Chicken, players try to collect as many types of chickens as possible. Each turn, they draw two cards &ndash; from the two draw piles or two discard piles, with each card coming from a different pile &ndash; then either discard one card or lay down a set of cards. To lay down a set, you need at least two cards if that type of chicken hasn't been played or more cards than are already on the table if it has been played. Any cards of the same type on the table are discarded onto a single discard pile. The round ends when one player has six types of chicken, all types of chicken are on the table, or only one draw pile remains. Players then earn points based on which types of chickens they own: for example, Marilyn Henroe has only six cards in the deck and is worth 6 points, while Billy the Chick has twenty cards and is worth 20 points.<br/><br/>After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>In 2005, SimplyFun republished Crazy Chicken as Drive, with rules for up to four players and a collectible car theme. Three rounds are played rather than four.<br/><br/>",

Of course, this is no picnic, hindered as it is by other players' rampaging armies and the frequent bumbling visitations of Groo the Wanderer, determined by the roll of a set of dice, which can also grant players resources with which to build and 'Groo heads' with which to damage the unfortunates who have Groo in their village. Players can also develop armies to attack other players' cities  Excellent fun for the beer-and-pretzels crowd.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Story<br/><br/>The King of Blackthorn rose to power on the strength of his sword, gaining the devotion of the people as he forged a nation and purged the ravages of war. Once a much needed beacon of strength for a foundling kingdom, he has now grown old and is no longer a vital part of a now robust and powerful country. Others have risen to prominence and power within his council. Adept in their machinations and plots, the councilors have their own self serving ambitions. In a shadowy battle of subterfuge they ruthlessly vie against one another for true control of Blackthorn. In this dance of treachery, each must seize as much power as able without drawing suspicion for whispers of treason echo through the halls of the King of Blackthorn. Whispers from fellow councilors designed to implicate and see the competition shortened by a head. The King will call for the axe for any he deems a traitor and there is always the risk that he is not as ignorant of the schemes as he seems.<br/><br/>As a member of the Council of Blackthorn, you must build influence with the kingdom&rsquo;s factions to expand your political influence. Rumors, bribes, spies and poison are the tools of your trade. Council of Blackthorn is about secretly gaining power while convincing your rival council members that you are not a threat. Deflect all eyes onto your most powerful enemy and take the keys to the kingdom as well as a great seat at his or her execution. Attract too much attention to yourself and the King&rsquo;s axe will find you!<br/><br/>Gain influence, accuse your rivals, keep your head!<br/><br/>Game Overview and Objective<br/><br/>Council of Blackthorn is a board game for 2 to 6 players. Each player assumes the role of a member of the Council of Blackthorn. There are several different council member characters to play. Each player must build influence with the kingdom&rsquo;s political factions by playing ally and building cards. Custom dice change the game conditions for each round. As players gain influence and power, they also gain hidden treason points. The players that appear to have the most power will typically gain more treason points. The player with the most treason points at the end of the game is beheaded for treason and is removed from the game. The remaining player with the most total influence points, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box:<br/>Descend deep into the interior of the earth, as you lead the three curious and heroic adventurers from  Jules Verne's classic novel: Professor Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans.  Begin your amazing journey by dropping into the crater of the dormant Icelandic volcano Snaefells.  Explore a dense forest of giant mushrooms, traverse a turbulent underground ocean, and then get hurled out of an Italian volcano to return to the earth's surface.<br/><br/>On your epic journey discover fossils both small and large, collect gold, and overcome dangerous obstacles. Explore the many parts of the vast subterranean cavern, using clever orienteering, critical equipment, and luck to overcome each new challenge along your breathtaking path. The player who escapes with the best collection of natural treasures wins! Will you direct our heroes on a journey of danger, discovery, and fortune?<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/>The players slip into the roles of three courageous explorers: mineralogy professor Otto Lidenbrock, his nephew Axel and their Icelandic guide Hans Bjelke. You explore the inside of the earth in three stages. You descend down the dormant Icelandic volcano Snaefells. You then cross a turbulent underground sea. Finally, you escape through a volcanic eruption on the Italian island of Stromboli. You make important discoveries by cleverly using equipment like Ruhmkorff's famed induction (electric) lamp, in search of fossils and experiences that will bring you international acclaim. By earning the most fame points you win!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The board has 3 areas: the descent through the mountain, the journey across the lake, and the exit through the volcano (~5 min only). There are 3 explorer tokens (red, yellow, blue) and 2 types of cards: equipment and explorer (players start with equal number, same mix of cards; there are face up cards and face down draw decks). Explorer cards are used to move explorers (3 colors; 1 card = 1 movement pt for that color explorer) while equipment cards modify movement.<br/><br/>In the first 2 parts, on your turn you either take 3 cards (any combination of face up/down explorer/equipment cards) OR move orthogonally; if moving, must advance (1 level deeper in mountain, 1 column further across in lake) at least 1 row/column. Each space costs 1 MP; some cost more (shown as 2 or 3 rocks). Equipment allows you to move diagonally, or get across pits/whirlpools, or make rock-spaces only cost 1 MP, or give you bonus MP. Moving over some spaces gives you a water token. If you end on specific spaces, you may discard a combination of 1-3 equipment cards (pictured on board) to draw as many fossil cards (lamp allows you to draw an extra fossil card to choose from). At the end of the Mountain part, you may keep 3 fossil cards for every water you discard. In the lake phase, all explorers are on 1 raft, so any single color may be used to move the entire raft.<br/><br/>After moving and resolving lake space effects, draw a random event card (may hurt someone or give bonus VP if [un]able to discard specific combo of explorer cards). The player getting the first explorer to the end of the Mountain, or the raft to the end of the Lake, scores bonus 4 VP. In the final Volcano phase, draw random explorer card and move raft to next like-colored space; players must discard cards shown, or pay penalty.<br/><br/>At the end, score VP = sum of values of fossils (various types, sets score higher if you have more parts of the set) + bonus VP + 1 VP/water token. Most VP wins!<br/><br/>",

But the mean black cat is still close when you try to fill your tummy with all the yummy food from the pantry and say &ldquo;Mmm!&rdquo;.  The players are mice feeding on the Smiths&rsquo; food in their pantry and should not be caught by the family&rsquo;s cat.<br/><br/>Roll three dice on each turn and place at least one die on food space which matches the symbol on the die. You can reroll the remaining dice as long as you place at least one die each time. When you've placed all your dice, your turn is done.  If you fail to place any dice during your turn, the cat will move one step closer to the pantry. If you placed all your dice on food spots, you need to hurry and cover them with mouse tokens, lest the cat still moves closer to the pantry. Try to cover all the food spaces on the board, or the mean black cat will reach the pantry and end the game.<br/><br/>Mmm! is a cooperative game for the smallest, but with special rules for ages 7 and up, it is also fun for the whole family!

One of the early Avalon Hill beginner war games.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Ever since men began making weapons they have used them to create legends: in early 1941, when his conquest of Europe was embarrassed by the rout of his Italian allies in Africa, Hitler dispatched General Erwin Rommel to forestall a seemingly inevitable Axis defeat. Reorganizing the forces under his command as the Deutsches Afrika Korps (DAK), Rommel immediately launched the first of his legendary desert offensives.<br/><br/>Now, the legend of &quot;The Desert Fox&quot; is recreated. From April 1941 through the climatic battle at El Alamein in later 1942. Afrika Korps simulates the mobile conflict between Rommel's Panzerarmee Afrika and the British Eighth Army defending Egypt and the Suez Canal. During each monthly game-turn, the initiative may switch from the Germany to the Allied player as both come to understand why Rommel called North Africa &quot;A tactician's paradise; a logistical officer's nightmare.&quot;<br/><br/>A 2 on Avalon Hill's complexity scale of 1(low) to 10(high).

Unmistakable traits such as large noses, red hair or cauliflower ears are depicted on the humorously-illustrated cards; these traits must be used to score points and be combined in engagements and births.

You get to choose your campaign. Anything from 1942 North Africa to 1945 Berlin, and everything in between.<br/><br/>Sherman Leader is a great game for both experienced strategy gamers and well as new players. Each campaign takes only 30 minutes to set-up, and each battle can be resolved in 15 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Being a solitaire game, you can play whenever you have time, at your pace. This is very important. Sherman Leader is not a multiplayer game that has solo play rules tacked on.

Several European nations are vying for the lucrative trade in spices and other goods. The goods brought back to Amsterdam at great peril and cost are rapidly growing merchant wealth and increasing trade. To increase working capital and spread risk, you and other merchants use stocks for the first time in history.<br/><br/>You are establishing your first warehouses in Amsterdam, contributing to the city that will grow to become the wealthiest city in the western world. You can become the best merchant, build chartered enterprises and purchase stock to profit from their expected growth. Your goal? Profit and wealth.<br/><br/>Players buy building cards to found chartered enterprises and purchase stock in them. Throughout the game they expand these enterprises, increasing their stock value and ultimately increasing players&rsquo; wealth. Enterprises merge to accelerate their growth and add floors to their warehouses to easily gain value. Players will aim to block enterprises they don't have stocks in but might be forced to help them grow. Buy the right stocks and build the right warehouses to put you on your way to profit and to victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After his long night, and all the work that led up to it, Santa always takes a vacation somewhere sunny and warm. As a reward for helping bring joy to children around the world, Santa takes his hardest working team of elves with him!<br/><br/>Can you lead your team of elves to claim their well-deserved reward? Not only are there toys to be built, but reindeer to be tended and coal to be mined (sadly, not all the children are on the &quot;nice&quot; list). Candy canes and gingerbread houses are nice, but by working hard-and smartly-you and your team of elves may find yourselves on a beach drinking something with an umbrella in it.<br/><br/>Santa's Workshop is a worker-placement game, taking place over nine rounds, in which players use their elves to collect materials in order to build gifts, and tend to the reindeer. Players may customize their workforce by sending elves to be trained in certain aspects of the game, which provide a benefit for the rest of the game. For some gifts, plastic may be substituted for the standard materials of fabric, wood or metal. This will cause those gifts to score fewer &quot;Christmas Cookies&quot;, but may allow a player to build more gifts in a shorter amount of time. This can be helpful when Santa comes around three times during the game for an inspection to see which team has made the most gifts.<br/><br/>Players will have to decide when to visit the mail room in order to pick which gifts to build, and when to tend to the reindeer. The reindeer accumulate points the longer they go untended &mdash; and each of the eight reindeer provides a unique bonus to the player.<br/><br/>",

Place the crystal marker next to the main board, then draw twelve random polyominoes from the box and place them in a circle around the main board.

In either case, draw a random polyomino from the box and place it where the crystal started this turn.<br/><br/>Instead of moving the crystal, you can choose a prophecy token from the main board and add it to a side of your player board. Each player board has four different colors around the four edges, e.g., blue, orange, black, and teal.<br/><br/>When you fill all the spaces of a level on your player board, take the largest level token from the main board.

        "description": "(in English, from the designer:)<br/><br/>Waterloo 1815, Fallen eagles is a regiment/battalion level game of the famous battle.<br/><br/>The game includes 400 counters (French, Anglo-allied and Prussian order of battle for June 18th 1815), a 108 x 75 cm map (200 meters per hexagon; 42.5 x 29.5 inches, in 2 parts), various play aids, a rule book and a playbook. It is a one hour of real time per turn game that can be completed in 5 to 10 hours of play. Beside the full battle game, several scenarios are available (Hougoumont, D'Erlon attack, Plancenoit). In addition, what if options will allow players to simulate alternate history variations to the battle.<br/><br/>Fallen Eagles provides a detailed view of the battle but in a playable way. The focus is on morale, attrition and commitment of formation (division &amp; corps) at the right time, rather than tactical chrome. The detailed order of battle and the scale of the game allow players to really see the action and the game system provides a quick but realistic resolution.<br/><br/>A new system has been created and combat result tables have been tested against actual historical results of this battle. This system is a mix of well-known concepts and new features to maximize playability and realism of outcomes.<br/><br/>Formation are given simple orders than limit their ability to freely react to any sudden change of priority. Orders take some time a while before being changed. Units are classically rated for size, quality and movement. Formations activate one after the other at player's choice but have to follow the order they received at the beginning of the turn or even before. Game features offensive fire, defensive fire, opportunity fire, charge and counter charge, retreat before combat and melee. A lot of classical &quot;prohibitions&quot; are transformed into options: for example, cavalry can move from ZOC to ZOC but risk counter charges or more opportunity fire. A ZOC of a strong unit is therefore not the same as the ZOC of a weaker one.<br/><br/>The game turn has a random ending procedure and players are never sure to have time to move all their formation reflecting the command control issues of any battle. Also, the fatigue and friction factors are built in a potentially shorter turn length in the latter stages of the battle. Focus on morale and attrition is a testimony of a battle which was a test of will of two densely packed armies fighting head to head. Players will have to choose which unit will &quot;lead&quot; the attack and take the first fire. Failing a key morale test can make the difference between a stalled attack or a promising breakthrough.<br/><br/>Game variations will include, for example, the Prussian arrival sooner or later than history, or a better weather the day before allowing for an earlier start of the french attack.<br/><br/>Victory is determined with &quot;sudden death&quot; objectives given to both sides in order to simulate historical constraints but also by control of key objectives and losses at the end of the game.<br/><br/>According to Wellington, Waterloo was a &quot;near run thing&quot;. Will the thin red line hold against the French furia again?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t================================================================(traduction fran&ccedil;aise du texte anglais:)<br/><br/>Waterloo 1815, la chute des Aigles est un jeu de niveau r&eacute;giment / bataillon de la c&eacute;l&egrave;bre bataille.<br/><br/>Le jeu comprend un peu plus de 400 pions (ordre de bataille fran&ccedil;ais, anglo-alli&eacute; et prussien du 18 Juin 1815), une carte 108 par 75 cm (200 m&egrave;tres par hexagone), diverses aides de jeu, un livret de r&egrave;gle et un livret de jeu. L'&eacute;chelle est d'une heure par tour et le jeu peut &ecirc;tre termin&eacute; en 5 &agrave; 10 heures. En plus de la bataille compl&egrave;te, plusieurs sc&eacute;narios sont disponibles (Hougoumont, d'Erlon attaque, Plancenoit). Des options permettront aux joueurs d'explorer des alternatives.<br/><br/>La chute des Aigles propose une vue d&eacute;taill&eacute;e mais jouable de la bataille. L'accent est mis sur le moral, l'attrition et l'engagement des formations (division et corps) au moment opportun, plut&ocirc;t que sur le chrome tactique. L'ordre de bataille d&eacute;taill&eacute; et l'&eacute;chelle du jeu permettent aux joueurs d'entrer dans l'action. Le syst&egrave;me offre une r&eacute;solution rapide mais r&eacute;aliste des combats.<br/><br/>Un nouveau syst&egrave;me a &eacute;t&eacute; cr&eacute;&eacute; et les tables de combat ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s par rapport aux r&eacute;sultats historiques. Ce syst&egrave;me est un m&eacute;lange de concepts bien connus et de nouvelles fonctionnalit&eacute;s pour optimiser jouabilit&eacute; et r&eacute;alisme.<br/><br/>Des ordres simples sont donn&eacute;s aux formations, limitant leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;agir &agrave; un changement soudain de priorit&eacute;. Les ordres peuvent se poursuivent avant d'&ecirc;tre chang&eacute;s. Les unit&eacute;s sont &eacute;valu&eacute;es de fa&ccedil;on habituelle par la taille, la qualit&eacute; et le mouvement. Les formations sont activ&eacute;es les unes apr&egrave;s les autres, au choix du joueur, mais doivent suivre l'ordre qu'elles ont re&ccedil;u au d&eacute;but du tour, voire avant. Le jeu inclut le feu offensif et d&eacute;fensif, les tirs d'opportunit&eacute;, la charge et la contre-charge, la retraite avant combat et la m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Un grand nombre d'&quot;interdictions&quot; classiques sont transform&eacute;es en options : par exemple, la cavalerie peut se d&eacute;placer de ZDC (zone de contr&ocirc;le) &agrave; ZDC, mais est menac&eacute;e par la contre-charge ou le feu d'opportunit&eacute;. Une ZDC d'une unit&eacute; puissante n'est donc pas la m&ecirc;me que la ZDC d'une unit&eacute; plus faible.<br/><br/>Le tour de jeu comprend une fin de tour al&eacute;atoire. Les joueurs ne sont jamais certains de disposer de toutes leurs formations, refl&eacute;tant les probl&egrave;mes de commandement durant toute bataille. En outre, la fatigue et la &quot;friction&quot; se traduisent dans des tours de jeu potentiellement plus courts &agrave; la fin. L'accent mis sur ​​le moral et l'usure, est un reflet de cette bataille qui fut une &eacute;preuve de d&eacute;termination pour ces deux arm&eacute;es, denses et combattant pied &agrave; pied. Les joueurs devront choisir l'unit&eacute; en t&ecirc;te qui conduira l'attaque et subira le premier feu. L'&eacute;chec d'un test de moral peut faire la diff&eacute;rence entre une attaque avort&eacute;e ou une perc&eacute;e prometteuse.<br/><br/>Les variantes pr&eacute;voient, par exemple, l'arriv&eacute;e pr&eacute;coce ou tardive des Prussiens, ou une meilleure m&eacute;t&eacute;o la veille, permettant une attaque fran&ccedil;aise plus t&ocirc;t.<br/><br/>La victoire est d&eacute;termin&eacute;e &agrave; la fois par des objectifs de &quot;mort subite&quot; donn&eacute;s aux deux camps afin de simuler les contraintes historiques pendant l'action, mais aussi par le contr&ocirc;le d'objectifs et les pertes inflig&eacute;es en fin de partie.<br/><br/>Selon Wellington, Waterloo fut une &laquo;affaire tr&eacute;s serr&eacute;e&raquo;. La mince ligne rouge tiendra t-elle &agrave; nouveau contre la &laquo;furia fran&ccedil;aise&raquo; ?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Koryŏ dynasty is now defunct, replaced by the Chosŏn dynasty founded by General Yi. Unfortunately, soon after its founding, figures of intrigue nicknamed the &quot;Watchers&quot; appeared all over the realm of Chosŏn. Since then, feud and disorder has sprouted everywhere, but instead of the usual political contests and sneaky manipulations, armed warfare has become the rule. The influence of the &quot;Watchers&quot; on some families has grown strong, and some whisper that their extraordinary powers even allow them to travel through time...<br/><br/>Chosŏn is a thematic sequel to Koryŏ set in the same uchronian and politico-steampunk universe, and gameplay is similar in the two games.<br/><br/>The game lasts eight rounds, and in each round, each player draws a specified number of cards, then simultaneously plays face down (1) as many characters as desired from one family, (2) one character from each of two different families, (3) one character and one event card, or (4) three event cards. Each family has a value ranging from 1 to 9, which indicates both the number of cards in the family and the number of victory points the player controlling this family will score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players reveal their cards in order clockwise from the round's start player. If she played one character and one event, she carries out the power of this event, swapping two characters or eliminating one held by another player. She also carries out the powers of any family that she controls, i.e., that she holds more cards of than any other player. The family powers let you protect one family, keep event cards, double the power of an event, steal the first player token, etc. At the end of each round, players discard characters in play (if needed) and discard everything in hand.<br/><br/>After eight rounds, players tally their scores based on the families they control, influence scored during the game, and possession of Yi's Legacy, which is acquired by playing three event cards. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Just as Zombie Fluxx draws on all those classic Zombie movies for inspiration, Martian Fluxx is about all those great alien invasion stories going back to the original, the War of the Worlds.<br/><br/>Some of the Keepers you'll find in the Martian Fluxx: Mars, the Mothership, the Flying Saucer, the Tripod, the City, the Cow, the Ray Gun, the Space Suit, and the Tentacle.<br/><br/>The Tentacle? I hear you asking. How is that a good thing? All those other things sound like great Keepers but what's good about a tentacle? Well, they're great if you're a Martian... which is what we are in this game!<br/><br/>In Martian Fluxx, the players are invaders from Mars, and the Creepers are those pesky Pathetic Humans who are always getting in our way, keeping us from winning. Cows of course are Keepers because for Humans and Martians alike, they're good eating. There are actually two Cow Keepers in the game; if you have them both you can win with the Goal &quot;Two All-Beef Earthlings.&quot;<br/><br/>The idea of making us the Martians came about as I realized the Martians are the ones who get all the cool stuff! Other cool Keepers you'll find include the Abduction Chamber (which you can hide your Pathetic Humans in), the Space Modulator and the Mind-Control Transmitter. And yes, you can use that Ray Gun to vaporize Pathetic Humans. (The Germs Creeper however is harder to get rid of...)<br/><br/>So that's a sneak peek at Martian Fluxx.<br/><br/>Part of the Fluxx series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Adventure, intrigue, and flowers! Botany is a strategy board game where you take on the role of a Victorian Era flower hunter as you explore the world to gather fortune and fame and be named the Royal Botanist. In Botany, each player takes on the role of a character whose abilities will shape the way they play the game. Will you focus on exploring the globe in search of the most valuable specimens? Will you make quick and efficient trips to gather reputation quickly and build your estate?<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a set of randomized goals that they then use to plot their path to victory. When players set out from their estate, they have access only to the coins they can carry with them. They can use these coins to traverse the globe and gain crew members and items to improve their odds of surviving the unknown, enhance their abilities, and increase the efficiency with which they traverse the map. However, there is danger in spending too freely, and players must ensure they have enough wealth on hand to return to England with their specimens intact.<br/><br/>Turns in Botany are streamlined in order to minimize downtime and keep players engaged. Players will move around the map, build their character, and experience the story of their rise to fame, all with an eye for efficiency. Points are gained by improving the quality of your garden, retrieving live specimens from around the globe, and adding preserved flowers to your botanical press. The specimens that players hunt, the goals they focus on to achieve victory, and the events they experience create a unique feel across each game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For those with the eldritch gift, temptation lurks around every corner, even in leisure. Just consider the possibilities available to the practitioner of magic. Imagine poker with spells! No person could resist such temptation, and even a casual review of history will prove that none could.<br/><br/><br/>    The famous last play of Ephippus of Athens? It was about Circe&rsquo;s never ending thirst for cheating at cards. <br/>    Morgan le Fay and Merlin regularly crossed wits over a deck. <br/>    Roger Bollingbroke&rsquo;s most heinous crime was the transparently bogus run of five straight flushes in a row. <br/><br/><br/>And so it has gone. The application of magic to card games is as natural as mixing mandrake and worm&rsquo;s husk.<br/><br/>For the first time, however, the rules for a game specifically created for wizards have been pieced together from fragments found in tombs, dusty used bookstores, and in the classified ads of one small newspaper. Though magic has largely been forgotten in the centuries since this game was invented, modern game design has given us a way to imitate the arcana outlined in the reconstructed rules. The result is a &ldquo;no-magic-required&rdquo; whimsical romp for 2-5 players.<br/><br/>Hocus places the players in the flamboyant boots of wizards, using their powerful advantages to create opportunities, manipulate the game, and alter the flow of cards. Wizards hate being pinned down and live by the mantra &ldquo;You shall not fold!&rdquo; Each turn, players choose one Spell to use. As you are new to Hocus, we shall first discuss the three Basic Spells.<br/><br/>Use the first basic Spell to play cards to the Community. Play thoughtfully, as everyone shares the cards in the Community! The second Spell is for building the Pot. In addition to Suit and Strength, every card has a point value. Cards played to the Pot contribute their points to the winner of each Showdown. Play cards to build a Pocket with the third Spell. (Never ask to see a wizard&rsquo;s pocket!) Each player takes one of their Pockets and combines it with the Community to form a hand during Showdowns. The best hand claims all points in the Pot.<br/><br/>There is, of course, a twist. Trust a wizard to provide a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can compete in multiple Showdowns if they have the Pockets. Hocus is not merely a matter of building good hands, but making a winning hand where your opponents least expect and profiting with a hefty Pot. Timing and careful, targeted play will win the day. And time is limited. You may have conjured a Straight Flush, but it&rsquo;s worthless with no points in the Pot!<br/><br/>Now, look at the other spells in the game. There are eight different spell books, each with their own unique approaches to the game, providing every wizard who plays with their own special abilities. The spell books raise the game to another level, with even more tools for bending luck to your advantage.<br/><br/>Travel way back to a dark, dank inn, shuffle the cards, and play the favorite game of the legendary Merlin and Morgan le Fay. Hocus is a little like poker, but a lot more magic!<br/><br/>",

The pizza delivery professionals have to find a pizza and deliver it to the right house in town, all while avoiding ghosts, barriers, and mystic teleportation runes. The first player to find and successfully deliver a pizza wins. Luckily for them, the pizza delivery professionals all possess mild psychic powers. They must use their abilities to sense and divine what's around them if they hope to deliver their pizzas.<br/><br/>The main role of mayor is to moderate play and make the town. The mayor wins if no one is able to deliver their pizza. The game begins with the mayor building a unique town map that includes the starting location for each player, pizza, and house. On a player's turn, they may choose to move one space in any of the four cardinal directions, attack in any of the four cardinal directions in hope of banishing a ghost, or use a psychic power. The mayor then resolves the action, tells the player the location of any barriers adjacent to the player, and whether or not the player senses any ghosts/pizzas/houses in any of the eight spaces surrounding the player.<br/><br/>Attacking removes ghosts from the board and lets players draw one psychic card. Psychic cards allow players to make special movements on the board such as diagonal, hop step, or warp back to start.<br/><br/>The players have only twenty turns to locate a pizza and deliver it to the matching house. The players have a gridded sheet of paper and a pencil to draw and record information about the town. The mayor has a special log sheet to track all the players moves and results.<br/><br/>The game also includes several variant tiles that can be added to the town to vary gameplay.<br/><br/>",

Now it's your turn to take on the roles of the dwarves, aiding Bilbo in his monumental quest to defy the odds and become a legend...<br/><br/>The Hobbit is a board game of adventure and treasure for 2-5 players. On his quest to the Lonely Mountain, Bilbo Baggins will need assistance and guidance from his stoic dwarf companions. As one of these dwarves, it is your responsibility to aide Bilbo on his journey and ensure that you recover the treasure that is destined for you.<br/><br/>Conceived by acclaimed designer Reiner Knizia, The Hobbit features elegant game play, combining strategic card play with the unpredictability of dice rolling. The objective of the game is to be the player who accumulates the most treasure by the end of the adventure. Treasure is won through Adventure Cards, which are drawn when Bilbo enters an Adventure Space. Adventure Cards present players with a challenge that can be overcome by using the game's custom dice.<br/><br/>Bilbo's dwarven companions have three stats that influence their ability to complete Adventures: Cunning, Strength, and Initiative. Cunning allows the player to re-roll dice when resolving Adventure Cards, Strength provides a number of axes to Adventure checks, and finally Initiative determines which player draws the Adventure Card first and how many shields they will contribute to battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The only thing that ever frightened me during the war was the U-Boat peril.&quot; - Winston Churchill<br/><br/>The Battle of the Atlantic was the longest continuous campaign of World War II running from 1939 through to the defeat of Germany in 1945. It involved thousands of ships, stretched over hundreds of miles of ocean, and involved hundreds of convoy battles and single-ship encounters. During the struggle advantage switched back and forth between the U-boats and Allies as new weapons, tactics, and countermeasures were developed and implemented.<br/><br/>U-Boat Leader takes the Leader series to new depths, letting players control a group of U-boats on missions in the Atlantic. The core system of the game will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to quickly get into the game.<br/><br/>A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you concentrate your submarines in one or two areas to form wolfpacks or spread them out in the shipping lanes to increase the chances of finding contacts, or do you send them on special missions (such as mine-laying)? You can also spend Special Operations Points to support your submarines by adding search planes to help find enemy ships or by sending supply ships and subs (Milk Cows) to extend the endurance of the submarines. During longer campaigns you need to manage the U-boat patrol rotation to keep subs on station.<br/><br/>When a patrolling U-boat comes into contact with an enemy force it can call other boats in the same patrol zone to form a wolfpack or attack alone. The action then shifts to the tactical display where the U-boats try to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to actually identify the ships.<br/><br/>U-Boat Leader includes the following type of U-boats: <br/>Type IIB/C coastal submarines <br/>Type VII A/B/C Atlantic submarines<br/>Type IX A/B/C long-range submarines<br/>Type XXI Elektro-boat<br/><br/>U-Boat Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Battle of the Atlantic:<br/><br/>The Battle Begins: covering operations at the start of World War II to about mid-1940.<br/><br/>The Happy Time: covering the period from mid-1940 to mid-1941 when the U-boats and wolfpacks dominated the seas.<br/><br/>Operation Drumbeat: covering operations off the American coast and in the Caribbean in early 1942.<br/><br/>The Hunted: covering the time period when the tide starts to turn against the U-boats.<br/><br/>-Dan Verssen Games<br/><br/>Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cover Your Kingdom is an absurdly ruthless set-collection party game for 2-8 players ages 9+. The game's cutthroat mechanics which make the game a highly-addictive riot-inducer are blunted by the punderfully-whimsical theme.<br/><br/>The pace of play is fast, with very little downtime, as interactions may occur involving any player at any moment keeping all players on the edge of their seats and prompting loads of impish banter, gloating, and murderous glares. due to its competitive nature, it might not be the best choice of game if you've got a table-flipper in your group.<br/><br/>However, as long as everyone has a good (or evil) sense of humor, the game will take you on a boisterous ride you'll want to repeat. Cover Your Kingdom is an excellent game for building relationships... or ending them. (Perfect for family reunions!)<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW:<br/><br/>In Cover Your Kingdom, you and your rivals will each become Rulers of your own fantasy Kingdom. Regrettably, the Kingdoms are creatureless and vacant, and no creatures means no magic. To remedy this problem, you'll contend with the other rulers as you try to convince lengenderpy Creatures (such as Pigxies, Hentaurs, Uniquehorns, and Sighclops) to join your Kingdom.<br/><br/>You can add them to your Kingdom by forming clans of two matching creatures (or one paired with a Wild Creature), or by recruiting (ahem- stealing) Clans from other Ruler's Kingdoms. Each Creature is worth a certain amount of Magic. The Ruler with the most Magic in their Kingdom at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Kingdoms are divided in two different regions, the Mountains, and the Valley and most creatures will only live in one region or the other.<br/><br/>As Clans are acquired, they are stacked one atop the other offset by 90 degrees. Each Ruler's Kingdom mat indicates where each kind of Creature may be placed. Only the top Clan in each stack is vulnerable to being recruited by rival Rulers and each new clan you add is an added layer of defense to those beneath it (yes, Clans are layered, like ogres).<br/><br/>To attempt to recruit another Ruler's Clan, you may show a matching Creature, or a Wild Creature from your hand. Your rival may counter with a Creature of their own, to which you can respond again. This continues until one Ruler cannot, or chooses not to respond.<br/><br/>The winner takes (or keeps) the Clan adding ALL Creatures used to recruit or defend it. This increases the Clan's value (sometime's drastically) and its allure to other Rulers and if they have the opportunity the will try to swipe it for themselves.<br/><br/>Rulers take either 1-2 actions per turn, forming Clans, attempting to recruit Clans, adding Creatures to existing Clans, replacing unwanted Creatures by discarding and drawing. and employing the services of Free Creatures.<br/><br/>Free Creatures do not join Kingdoms, but instead perform an action. Things like forcing another ruler to swap a top Clan from their Kingdom with one of yours, or move a Clan from the top to the bottom of its stack, or remove a Clan from the game entirely.<br/><br/>The hook of the game lies in its ability to conceive a roller-coaster of emotions, with bursts of elation and despair occurring repeatedly for each player throughout the game. The actions you take, and the order in which you take them, on your turn can have a tremendous impact on your success or failure.<br/><br/>The end-game is also super intense, as the outcome of the entire game can often be decided in the last few turns, or even with the final card played. It'll keep you all on the edge of your thrones and also make it difficult to put away without &quot;just one more round&quot;.<br/><br/>Cover Your Kingdom is as fun (and violent) as the people you play it with.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The worm sections come in six colors and range from 1 cm to 6 cm long. On any turn, a player can place her daisy (or strawberry) tile above the worm that she thinks will reach the daisies (or strawberries) first. If that worm does indeed poke its head into view through the slot before any other, then that player can add the daisy (or strawberry) tile to her own worm.

        "description": "Hood Strikes North is the latest design in the award-winning Great Campaigns of the American Civil War (GCACW) series. It depicts the desperate offensive undertaken by General John Bell Hood&rsquo;s Army of Tennessee in November 1864 through central Tennessee in an effort to capture Union-held Nashville. Union forces defending the critical Nashville-Chattanooga corridor, led by Maj. Gen. George Thomas (&ldquo;The Rock of Chickamauga&rdquo;), were initially scattered and ill-prepared to meet Hood&rsquo;s thrust. But under Thomas&rsquo; prudent and patient leadership, the Rebels were stopped at the gates of Nashville and then thoroughly defeated by a Union offensive in mid-December.<br/><br/>Hood Strikes North will include a single map, two countersheets, and limited special rules, thereby making it a highly suitable game for newcomers to the Great Campaigns of the American Civil War series. The game is designed by Joe Balkoski (the original GCACW series creator), Chris Withers, and Ed Beach. Based on mid-19th century Tennessee county maps, the game map will adhere to the high graphic standards of its predecessors, with map design executed by artist Charlie Kibler&mdash;whose work on the series dates back to its creation in 1992.<br/><br/>Hood Strikes North will use the latest version of the GCACW Standard Basic Game Rules that all other games in the series use. After more than a quarter of a century of refinement, these rules are extremely well organized and relatively easy to learn, even for series newcomers. The Advanced Game rules will cover situations specifically applicable to the November &ndash; December 1864 timeframe.<br/><br/>Hood Strikes North includes eight Basic Game scenarios and one Advanced Game campaign, all extensively playtested:<br/><br/>    Here Come the Rebels! (November 24, 1864, 1 turn): Introductory scenario, great for learning how to play, depicting the arrival of Nathan Bedford *Forrest&rsquo;s Rebel cavalry in central Tennessee, as Union forces under Maj. Gen. John Schofield hastily retreat to Columbia, Tennessee, covered by their cavalry.<br/>    The Race for Columbia (November 23 &ndash; 29, 1864, 7 turns): The initial attempt by Hood to cut off Union forces in southern Tennessee from Nashville.<br/>    A Great Chance Was Lost (November 28 &ndash; 29, 1864, 2 turns): Hood&rsquo;s army outflanks Union troops defending Columbia, Tennessee, and at Spring Hill attempts to cut them off from Nashville.<br/>    We Will Make the Fight (November 30 &ndash; December 1, 1864, 2 turns): Union troops under Maj. Gen. John Schofield make a stand against Hood&rsquo;s onrushing army at Franklin, Tennessee in their attempt to escape to Nashville.<br/>    The Battle of Nashville (December 15 &ndash; 16, 1864, 2 turns): Thomas takes the offensive and strikes hard at Hood&rsquo;s Rebel army entrenched on the outskirts of Nashville.<br/>    The Enemy Was Badly Whipped (December 4 &ndash; 7, 1864, 4 turns): While the Rebels entrench south of Nashville, Hood orders Nathan Bedford Forrest to attack the Union stronghold at Murfreesboro in an attempt to relieve pressure on Hood&rsquo;s eastern flank.<br/>    Hood&rsquo;s Retreat (December 17 &ndash; 19, 1864, 3 turns): Maj. Gen. James Wilson&rsquo;s Federal cavalry aggressively pursues Hood&rsquo;s beaten army, but Forrest&rsquo;s Rebel cavalry stands in the way.<br/>    That Devil Forrest (December 23 &ndash; 24, 1864, 2 turns): A fast-playing introductory scenario for learning how to play multiple turns. Forrest&rsquo;s Rebel cavalry is the rear guard trying to delay pursuing Union infantry and cavalry.<br/>    Hood Strikes North (November 23 &ndash; December 24, 1864, 32 turns): advanced scenario - A depiction of the entire campaign.<br/><br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>    GCACW Series rules booklet (24 pages, including illustrations, play examples, charts)<br/>    Hood Strikes North rules booklet (36 pages, including scenarios, the Game as History, map gazetteer, etc.)<br/>    one 22&quot; x 32&quot; full-color map sheet<br/>    two countersheets (560 counters)<br/>    one Terrain Effects Chart<br/>    two full-color Force Displays<br/>    two 4-page color Charts and Tables<br/>    two 6-sided Dice<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Become the head of a Great House of Luthadel in this game of negotiation and betrayal set in the world of Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn novels. Contend with myriad problems plaguing the Final Empire &mdash; rampaging koloss, disease, social unrest, even the heroes of the novels &mdash; and with every step jockey for the Lord Ruler's favor. At the end of the story, will you rise to power and prestige &mdash; or fall in ruin and disgrace?<br/><br/>Mistborn: House War is a resource-management game set during the events of the first Mistborn novel. Three to five players assume the roles of various factions and must work together to solve the &quot;Problems&quot; facing the Final Empire. In order to solve these problems players must expend a certain combination of resources, but in return they receive Favor from the Lord Ruler.<br/><br/>Each round, players produce resources (food, money, prestige, skaa, warriors, and atium) in different proportions and combinations based on their faction. You can convert between different resources to get something that is missing, but in the long run the players must work together, pooling their resources, to succeed.<br/><br/>There are four tiers of &quot;Problems&quot;; at the start of each turn a problem is added to the board in the corresponding column and each pre-existing problem moves up one tier. If a problem passes tier 4, than it is said to &quot;Erupt&quot; (a reference to the novel) and it causes various problems for the players, such as increasing the level of &quot;Unrest&quot; or giving players &quot;Disfavor&quot;. The main part of gameplay is the negotiation between players to solve these problems. Anything except Favor gained in previous turns can be negotiated: resources, Personality cards (which can have a variety of effects), out-of-game favors, etc.<br/><br/>The game can end in two ways, either the Unrest reaches 8 or a special problem card (Vin) is resolved. If she is not defeated and is allowed to erupt she increases the Unrest by 4. If the players are able to defeat Vin, then the player who has the highest amount of Favor wins. If the Unrest reaches 8, then the rebellion occurs and the player with the least Favor (the faction furthest from the Lord Ruler) wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nertz, also known widely as Pounce, is a fast paced card game where every player has their own standard deck of cards and engage in a form of multi-player solitaire.  Decks with different backs are a must.  Players all deal 13 cards into a draw pile and four cards out in front of themselves.  When play commences, players simultaneously try to empty their draw pile by building on the four cards in front of them (red sevens on black eights, black sixes on red sevens etc.) and try to put cards into set piles in the middle of the table starting with the Ace of a given suit and then the two and three and so on. Players build on each others' set piles so this can lead to some very energetic competitions.  The remaining cards that a player has are kept in a deck and counted out and turned over three at a time, placed face up, and then the top facing card can be added to the set piles or to the four working piles in front of the player.  When a player has emptied the draw pile and yells out &quot;Nertz&quot; play stops and points are counted up - one point for each card in the middle of the table in the set piles, and -2 points for every card left in the draw pile.  First player to an agreed upon score is the winner.<br/><br/>This game has been packaged and released as Solitaire Frenzy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stalingrad: Inferno on the Volga recreates one of the most epic battles of World War 2 with a game mechanism that makes this work in FOUR different game modes, including a true solitaire (versus AI) version.<br/><br/>The well-known campaign became a clash of wills between Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin, involving hundreds of thousands of troops in a death struggle which eventually led to the German defeat in the entire war.<br/><br/>Inferno's  map is generated from highly detailed air recon photographs and depicts both the city and outskirts in extreme detail, as it was in August 23, 1942, when the battle began.  The map scope includes the main city and the its suburbs from Lateschanka to Kuspornoe, along 30 km of the volga river, and extends to the west as far as Gumrak Airfield, Orlovka, and Alexandrovka. Map scale is 1:33000, with hexes that represent 1,1 kilometer along each side.<br/><br/>The wooden-block units in the game represent regiments for the Germans (with some assault battalions) and brigades/divisions for the Soviets.<br/><br/>The game has one campaign, covering August 23 to November 20 and taking from 1 to 2 hours  to play. There are several shorter scenarios in development, such as the September attack to the southern part of the city and the October attack to the industrial sector.<br/><br/>The unit wooden blocks provide fog-of-war and easy recording of strength, while a card-driven system that allows for key historical events and dramatic surprises in battle...<br/><br/>The game offers FOUR different modes of play:<br/><br/>Solitaire (German player versus Soviet AI)<br/>Cooperative (two German players vs Soviet AI)<br/>Competitive:2 (German player vs Soviet Player)<br/>Competitive:3 (two German players vs Soviet Player)<br/><br/>Complexity level is medium/high.<br/><br/>The game is played out over a detailed 84x60 cm (33&quot;x24&quot;), laminated multicolor mapboard. The game features&nbsp;more than 200 wooden/plastic components and near 50 event cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Be the first to reach supremacy in one field to make history, but keep an eye on how your opponents are advancing. Forming a temporary alliance might be the best way to keep a player from triumphing&hellip;and remember that offense is sometimes the best defense!<br/><br/>In more detail, a player wins when they reach supremacy in a field; if this doesn't happen, when no more cards can be drawn, the game ends and players go through a majority scoring to determine the winner.<br/><br/>CIV includes six fields of competition: Army, Religion, Economics, Science, Culture, and Utopia. The 104 cards in the game are split in three ages, which represent the natural evolution of global civilization through the timeline, but the cards of each field aren't split equally. Once the second age has finished, for example, if you haven't yet reached supremacy of Religion, it's time to think about another strategy.<br/><br/>Each field gives powers to the player who succeeds in reaching the limit of cards in their play area (depending on the number of players). There are different kinds of powers, two levels of permanent effects, and one sacrifice effect for each field. Using these powers in combination will be necessary to be the first to reach supremacy &mdash; but using these powers is also a way to keep competitors from reaching victory.<br/><br/>You will need all your diplomacy skills to get help from others and prevent the leading player from winning, yet today's friend could be tomorrow's enemy, so pay attention to all and think about which combination of powers might lead to a surprise victory! Be the first to use it!<br/><br/>The game includes rules for 1v1 play, 2v2 team play, and 3-4 player games.<br/><br/>",

The game models the full order of battle that could be expected in 1980&rsquo;s wartime, from multi-regiment Soviet Tu-22 Backfire bombers to multiple US carrier groups.<br/><br/>The game is card driven, with each card providing points to move units or trigger special events such as &lsquo;KGB Assassinations&rsquo; and &lsquo;Space Shuttle&rsquo;. There is also a reaction mechanic where most cards can be used in the other player&rsquo;s turn to perform a spoiling event such as &lsquo;Raid Aborts&rsquo; and &lsquo;Friendly Fire&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is detection. Task Forces can only be attacked once detected. By contrast, land air-bases can always be attacked &ndash; their enemy knows where they are. The race to detect opposing Task Forces begins as soon as they enter potential striking range of units such as the formidable Soviet bomber formations, or perhaps the Soviet&rsquo;s submarine fleet which, whilst it has considerable strength, cannot effectively detect enemy forces without help from its comrades.<br/><br/>NATO must not only deliver convoys, but also protect its allies! Norway will be hard pressed, as will Denmark. Both will require urgent reinforcement. In the Mediterranean Sea, Soviet forces must be halted by naval aviation strikes. In the deeper seas, NATO may enact it&rsquo;s promised attack on the Soviet nuclear deterrent and the Soviets may attempt to respond. Perhaps the Typhoon SSBNs will flee under the Arctic ice to await doomsday, or hole-up in the White Sea. Perhaps the Soviets will use nuclear weapons and scatter those NATO forces that are no-doubt determined to bomb the Soviet&rsquo;s Kola Peninsula bases.<br/><br/>The game models Politburo approval (Soviet leadership) through a stability mechanism, and whether the Soviets feel they can reduce New York to cinders through the use of &lsquo;First Strike Points&rsquo; &ndash; these allow the use of things like chemical or nuclear weapons.

There are Explorer cards, Quicksand cards, and Wild cards. Your hand size is always six cards. By playing cards strategically, you and your opponents, move the six explorers towards the temple.<br/><br/>Since no one knows which explorer each player is playing, you will also be advancing other Explorer markers on the path towards the Temple. This is not only to keep the other players in the dark about your identity, but also because you need to play those cards in order to draw more cards from the deck. You want to have the most favourable cards for your own Explorer in your hand as you approach the finish line (the Temple location).<br/><br/>One of the ways to slow down your opponents is to &quot;put them in quicksand&quot;. You do this by playing the Quicksand card. Then they must play a card just to &quot;get them out&quot; before they can play cards to advance them further along the path.<br/><br/>In addition to hand management, there is also blocking and movement strategies to best position your Explorer's piece, while encumbering the opponent.<br/><br/>",

All players worship the same Great Old One, but they are emphatically not allies. When they awaken their Great Old One, he will decide which among them is the best (based on VPs) and appoint that priest, and that priest only, to be the High Priest, who wins.<br/><br/>The game contains cards, cardboard tokens, and multiple different boards - each player has an inner sanctum, plus a priest board to manage his sect. In addition there is a town board, representing Lovecraft country; a ritual board, representing magic spells; and a cult board, representing the Great Old One you seek to release.<br/><br/>The game is performed in Action phases. the players take turns moving their cultists to activate various sites on the different boards, gathering resources, summoning monsters, shattering Elder Signs, and launching investigator raids (which attack all players). When all players run out of cultists, the Action phase ends, and players recover their cultists, freeing up the board sites for the next Action phase. Victory is determined when the last Elder Sign blocking your Great Old One is shattered, and at this point everyone totes up points. Different resources are worth different amounts, but the most valuable are the Elder Signs.<br/><br/>Driving the game are the player's need to recruit more cultists &amp; gather more resources, balanced against his need to shatter Elder Signs and protect himself against the deadly investigator raids. Unusual among worker placement games, the cult board can be swapped out between games, for a different experience. The Cthulhu cult board does not play the same as the Black Goat cult board, and they require different tactics and planning.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Soldiers in Postmen's Uniforms&quot; is a skirmish-level solitaire wargame that takes place in the Free City of Danzig on the first day of the Second World War.<br/><br/>Danzig (present-day Gdańsk) came into being in 1920, in accordance with the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. Over the next two decades the city became a flash-point in Polish-German relations, which culminated in the Danzig Crisis of 1939. On the first day of the Second World War, German forces moved in to seize Polish installations in Danzig. Two of the installations were on alert and under orders to hold out: the Military Transit Depot on the peninsula of Westerplatte and the Polish Postal Office No. 1. The personnel of the post office repulsed repeated assaults, and were forced to surrender only after a day-long siege, when the post office was doused with gasoline and set alight. Though German propaganda cast these acts of defiance as futile and a failure, they were viewed by the Polish people as symbolic of their stand against a materially superior aggressor.<br/><br/>In Soldiers in Postmen&rsquo;s Uniforms you take control of the valiant defenders of Polish Postal Office No. 1 in the Free City of Danzig on the first day of WW2. Under your command, the defenders must fend off relentless attacks from the Danzig Schutzpolizei and two German SS units.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tObject of the GameThe goal of Soldiers in Postmen&rsquo;s Uniforms is to recreate the incredible historic accomplishment of the Polish postal workers by defending the post office during the day-long siege. You must last until the three enemy card decks are depleted, while protecting the postal workers and non-combatants. You score points for defenders that survive the assault &mdash; the higher your score, the better.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGameplaySoldiers in Postmen&rsquo;s Uniforms is divided into three attack periods, each of which is represented by a deck of enemy cards.<br/><br/><br/>     Attack 1 took place during the morning hours. This was the Danzig Schutzpolizei&rsquo;s initial assault, which targeted  the rear of the post office.<br/>     Attack 2 took place during midday. In this assault, the Schutzpolizei attacked the front of the post office and were supported by armored vehicles as well as infantry guns and a howitzer from SS units.<br/>     Attack 3 took place in the evening. This final assault was conducted by elements of two SS units against the front of the post office. It ended when the attackers brought up a fire engine filled with gasoline, pumped it into the building, and ignited it with a hand grenade.<br/><br/><br/>Each attack period is divided into turns, and each turn consists of three or four phases (depending on the attack period):<br/><br/><br/>     Enemy Phase: Resolve five enemy cards.<br/>     Defense Phase: Perform four moves and four actions with defenders.<br/>     Clearing Phase: Assault counters inside the building remove defenders.<br/>     Escape Phase (Attack 3 only): Defenders escape from the building.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the turn when you draw the enemy fire engine card during Attack 3. At the end of the game, your score is based on the number of noncombatants and postal workers that survived the attacks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each round consists of two phases: (1) drawing and placing action counters and (2) performing actions. In the first phase, all players draw six action counters from the bag, then place them on their individual playing panels. Most action counters show both a resource (five types possible) and a person (four types), while managers are on counters of their own. Each playing panel has columns for the five types of resources and the five types of workers, with space for two counters in each column. Players can also allocate counters to the &quot;research facility&quot; below their panel.<br/><br/>In the second phase, players take actions one at a time until everyone has no actions remaining or passes. A resource or worker action can be taken only if both spaces are filled in the appropriate column; when a player takes an action, he removes all action counters in the column, returns them to the bag, then takes the action.<br/><br/>&bull; The &quot;research facility&quot; action must be carried out first, with the player taking the designated resources from the supply and placing one resource in any location that doesn't already have that resource available.<br/><br/>&bull; The worker actions allow a player to place a salesman in a stock exchange, place a worker in Vladivostok, move workers up to three spaces, move a manager to any action space, or claim an investment tile; each investment tile corresponds to a particular resource or worker action and is placed on the player panel permanently, allowing the player to take this action more easily in the future since the column is always half-filled.<br/><br/>&bull; Each resource action allows a player to remove that resource from all areas where he has a worker, then immediately sell them on one of the stock exchanges where he has a salesman.<br/><br/>A player can keep up to ten action counters on his playing panel at the end of a round, allowing him to prepare for and build up actions for future rounds. The game ends at the end of any round in which three of the five resources have no supply remaining or eight areas have had all their resources removed. (Once an area is exhausted, nothing can be placed in it for the remainder of the game.) The player who has the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

In Truck Off, you send your food truck team hoping to score a sweet parking spot at a lucrative venue. Your timing and game plan will be critical to your success while your opponents will look for the perfect opportunity to get you to, ahem, truck off!<br/><br/>Truck Off is played over five rounds, after which the player with the most money earned wins. In each round, players simultaneously select, then reveal which venue they will park at placing their food trucks next to that venue.  A die is then rolled at each venue to determine how many people actually showed up at each venue.  Each player then simultaneously selects which special action(s) they choose to execute this round. Starting with the first player token, players play and execute one action in a clockwise manner until all actions have been played and executed.  After players are done executing actions, profits are split between each truck at the venue.<br/><br/>Truck Off gameplay mechanically captures the ups and downs of food truck ownership by rewarding both long-term planning and short-term tactics as well as throwing many curve balls such as low venue attendance, competition, and crazy weather.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Between Two Cities is a 30-minute tile-drafting game for 1-7 players in which each tile is part of a city. You work with the player on your left to build one city center while simultaneously working with the player on your right to build a second city center. On each turn you select two tiles from your hand, reveal them, then work with your partners to place one of your selected tiles into each of your two cities.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each city is scored for its architectural grandiosity. Your final score is the lower of the scores of the two cities you helped design, and the player with the highest final score wins the game. To win, you have to share your attention and your devotion equally Between Two Cities.<br/><br/>The Essential Edition combines components from the original game and the Capitals expansion into one cohesive whole. While it features a bigger box than the original game, different art on some tiles, and a scorepad instead of a board, there are no new gameplay elements (i.e., if you own Between Two Cities and the Capitals Expansion, you already have everything).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Figures' stats are kept track of via dials on their bases, which change depending on how much damage they've taken.<br/><br/>As in most miniatures games, players each create an army with the same number of points (with each miniature having a different point value), then take turns moving and attacking until all of the opponent's forces are dead or captured, the opponent withdraws, or your pre-determined time limit expires.<br/><br/>The same figures could be used in two other games:<br/><br/>    Mage Knight Conquest<br/>    Mage Knight Dungeons<br/><br/><br/>Mage Knight 2.0<br/><br/>Mage Knight 2.0 changed many rules which overhauled or expanded, they introduced new strategic possibilities to the game, including capabilities to customize Unique warriors and battles via styrene cards called Items, Domains, and Constructed Terrain.<br/><br/>Later expansions introduced more options via Spellbooks, Spells, and Adventuring Companies.<br/><br/>It was eventually counted as a new game since the old figures were ruled obsolete for all tournaments that utilized the Mage Knight 2.0 format.<br/><br/>The two &quot;versions&quot; can be distinguished by their logos; the original Mage Knight sets feature a straight short sword through the logo while &quot;2.0&quot; and its subsequent expansions have a curved scimitar.<br/><br/>",

Each defeated monster provides you with a new spell. The tougher the defeated enemy, the better spell you will get. Castle defenders should try to be as efficient as possible. If you take too many actions to defeat your threats, the bastion will fall.<br/><br/>Bastion is a cooperative adventure: you either defend the city by concerted efforts or it will fall under the pressure of the attacking hordes.

        "description": "Keltis: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel recreates Reiner Knizia's Keltis gaming system as a dice game, with players once again trying to blaze through regions of negative points to reach sweet, VP-rich territory.<br/><br/>Keltis: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel has five dice (with a different colored symbol on each face), a game board, 40 wishing stone tiles, and 16 wooden playing pieces. On a turn, a player rolls all the dice, rerolls any number of dice once, then chooses on which of the five tracks on the game board he advances one of his four playing pieces.<br/><br/>The first spaces on a track are worth negative points to whoever sits on them at game's end, so players must make sure to advance their pieces far enough to score points. Along the way, they also collect wishing stones, either by rolling two wishing stone symbols or by moving a playing piece onto a wishing stone field; a player also earns or loses points based on the number of wishing stones collected.<br/><br/>After a certain number of playing pieces reach the far fields on the track, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Players proceed to struggle for influence in the unindustrialized regions of the world, and the subsequent resources such influence entails.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided into action phases and colonization phases. During action phases, players use cards to secretly bid influence in the six regions of the game board. During colonization phases, all cards in play are revealed, the placement of influence is resolved, and conflict occurs.<br/><br/>Whenever all native influence is eliminated from a region, that region's resources are collected. The amount of resources collected by each player depends on each players' influence in the region. At the end of the game, the player who collects the most resources wins.<br/><br/>",

The Icarites had not yet descended upon the city and the Wastelanders were still deciding whether they wanted any part of it.<br/><br/>Since it has become clear that the two factions cannot share control, it is time for you to pick a side. Choose your faction, find your allies, banish those who oppose you, and ensure your place at the top of the dystopian society to follow. Now it's your chance to Choose a Better Oppressor!<br/><br/>Leaders of Euphoria: Choose a Better Oppressor is a social deduction game in the style of Good Cop Bad Cop, but set in the world of Euphoria. It takes place earlier in the timeline than Euphoria, when the city was young and foolish. Players will have 3 cards in front of them that determine whether they are on the Euphorian or Subterran team that will be investigated throughout the game to figure out who's on their team and who's not.<br/><br/>Instead of the equipment cards from Good Cop Bad Cop, players now use and give artifacts from the Old World in a new Artifact Phase or as a standard action. In Leaders of Euphoria, you can use your turn to Hide one of your Recruit cards, which is important because, unlike Good Cop Bad Cop, you may not use important actions without having a hidden recruit to expose. Also, there is no player elimination like there was in GCBC, as players who are banished from the city become Wastelanders and have a new victory condition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Arctic Front: Battle for Norway' is the third game of the Third World War series, uses the same rules as its predecessors but presents a very different gaming situation.<br/><br/>The Soviet Leningrad Front, with its special airborne, amphibious, and arctic-equipped contingents, assaults Norway, reinforced with a few elite units from the U.S., Britain, Canada, and other NATO nations.<br/><br/>Norway presents a constricted front to offensive operations. Along the Soviet border, the relatively open terrain in conjunction with possible outflanking moves through Finnish Lappland allows a rapid Soviet advance. The rest of the Norwegian Arctic is mountainous and can be a formidable barrier if well defended. The Soviet player must make full use of his airmobile, airlanding, and marine forces to penetrate this region, while guarding against raids from U.S. marines and British commandos.<br/><br/>The complex relations between the Soviet Union and the neutral Scandinavian nations - Finland and Sweden - has its effects in the game. Soviet forces may attempt to pass through the Finnish Arctic, and Finland may allow violation of its neutrality or offer limited or full resistance. Sweden will always defend its territory, but its effort may not be total. Also, Sweden may volunteer an expeditionary force to join NATO in Norway even if Sweden neutrality is not violated. Finally, the Soviet high command may mandate a general offensive in Scandinavia rather than just operations against Norway, providing additional forces from the strategic reserve for combat in Finland and Sweden.<br/><br/>Additional rules allow Arctic Front to be combined and played with The Third World War: Battle for Germany and Southern Front: Race for the Turkish Straits, thus covering all the European war zones of the Third World War. Players can reinforce one front with forces from the others, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to Norway can turn the tide there for either side, but at what cost to the central or southern front, where every unit is desperately needed?<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>    240 die-cut counters<br/>    two 17&quot; x 22&quot; maps<br/>    one rules booklet<br/>    one briefing/background sheet <br/>    one set of game charts<br/>    two dice<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Third World War series<br/><br/><br/>Microbadges<br/><br/><br/>      The Third World War fan - Mushroom Cloud<br/><br/><br/>",

You set your armies on the table board and move units of aliens or human soldiers to fight to achieve goals, either by defending your position or vaporizing your opponents. This tactical tabletop game features rules by veteran designer Jake Thornton and a host of stunning Mantic miniatures that can be used straight out of the box or painted to add even more character to your games.<br/><br/>- Martian Mayhem: Mars Attacks is full of wacky events and cinematic action made possible by the simple set of game mechanics that are very easy to learn, and by the game's Event Card deck.<br/><br/>- Story Driven Action: Follow our heroes during the battle of Greenville with fun playable scenarios, each with their own objectives: eliminate the enemy, capture the intelligence - escape the Martian invaders!<br/><br/>- Easy to play: Much like a board game, Mars Attacks is played on a gaming mat made of squares and players take it in turn to activate their models, choosing whether to move, shoot or fight in hand-to-hand combat.<br/><br/>- Simple Dice Mechanics: Shooting and hand-to-hand combat is made easy by rolling eight-sided dice to decide whether a weapon has hit its target, or whether the opponent manages to dodge out of the way.<br/><br/>- Highly Tactical: move a figure out from behind cover and you&rsquo;re likely to get your model killed. Similarly, ganging up on an opponent or making use of a figure&rsquo;s special abilities could be the difference between making a clean kill, or engaging in a frantic game of cat and mouse!<br/><br/>All of this is detailed in the comic-book sized Mars Attacks &ndash; The Miniatures Game rulebook which also includes a number of playable missions. These battles are fought in Greenville, a town brought to life through our stunning modular ruined scenery. You will fight amongst the devastated town capturing objectives such as intelligence and weapons - or with the sole goal of eliminating your enemy.<br/><br/>Whether you&rsquo;re a veteran gamer or new to the hobby, you&rsquo;ll be able to enjoy the fun of Mars Attacks, making it a game suitable for all ages.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Malifaux, a twisted mirror of an alternate Earth in the 1900s; a world of gothic horror, Victorian structures, steampunk constructs, and wild west gunslingers. Rife with undead amalgamations, monstrous vengeful apparitions, and other creatures that bump in the night, these near-lawless lands are still worth treading for some, as the Soulstones deep within the cavernous catacombs are worth more than the sweat and blood it takes to obtain them.<br/><br/>Malifaux Third Edition is a story-driven skirmish game that carries the events from the lore directly into the characters&rsquo; mechanics. With a streamlined hiring system, straightforward and updated rules that don&rsquo;t get in the way of the fun, and enough strategic depth to keep those mental gears turning for years to come, it&rsquo;s never been a better time to dive into the world of Malifaux.<br/><br/>Seek your fortune, test your luck, and stake your claim in this fast-paced and brutal tabletop miniature skirmish game.<br/><br/>No longer do you have to trust the fickle fate of a dice roll. In Malifaux, you use cards called a Fate Deck to lead your crew to victory. If strategy, tactics, and resource management can&rsquo;t help you achieve your goals, don&rsquo;t worry, as you can always Cheat Fate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Carefully use the town&rsquo;s retainers to complete the Shogun&rsquo;s tasks and win favour. The most prosperous Daimyo will be granted the title to the town.<br/><br/>Micro Dojo&nbsp;is a 20 min tactical euro game for two players, intended to fit comfortably in a pocket or purse. In Micro Dojo, players take control of the Ninja, Samurai, Sumo and Geisha meeples to generate resources, develop the town, and score points by achieving the Shogun&rsquo;s tasks.<br/><br/>Each turn players move one of the four meeples to an adjacent space and take the action there - either gathering resources, taking a building, or activating a scoring objective. The catch? You can't move the last meeple either you or your opponent moved. The games end when the last objective is triggered, or a player reaches 7 points.<br/><br/>Movement is tight, requiring you to second guess your opponents plan. Timing is crucial, triggering objective scoring only when it benefits you. Like a sparring match, every move should be chosen with precision and efficiency, or your opponent will strike.<br/><br/>",

Then, each player selects 3 of their Quests to keep and returns the remainder facedown to the bottom of the Quest Deck. Each round players draft a 7 card hand. Cards are passed either clockwise or counter clockwise depending on the round. Players then take turns playing as many cards as they can from their hand, provided they have the resources to do so.<br/><br/>Randomly determine which player will play first during the Play Phase. The starting player will alternate in a clockwise fashion during each of the four rounds.<br/><br/>Playing Cards:<br/>To play Heroes and Weapons, players must spend Gold equal to the Gold Cost in the upper left corner of the card. Spent Gold is returned to the common pool of available Gold.<br/><br/>Heroes and Weapons remain in front of you when played. Some Heroes and Weapons have special text abilities that take effect when played.<br/><br/>All Heroes and Weapons will only have effects that last for the remainder of the round, with the exception of providing Attack, Gold, and XP (i.e. ignore everything but the numbers and symbols on the left side of the card during future rounds).<br/><br/>Class Icons:<br/>Each Hero and Weapon has a class. Classes are indicated by card color and icon. Class is very important! Many powers on Heroes and Weapons can only be used if you control enough cards of the appropriate class.<br/><br/>Monsters<br/>To defeat Monsters, players must have Attack equal to or greater than the Monster Attack Cost in the upper left corner of the card. Attack is not &ldquo;spent&rdquo; like Gold, so a player can defeat any number of Monsters whose Attack Cost is lower than or equal to the combined Attack of all cards you control.<br/><br/>Some Monsters have a text box with special effects on the card. After you defeat one of these Monsters, follow the instructions and then put the Monster into the Draft Deck Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Some Monsters have XP or Gold values on the card. After you defeat one of these Monsters, take the corresponding XP and/or Gold from the corresponding pool and then put the Monster into the Draft Deck Discard Pile.<br/><br/>Quests<br/>To play Quests, players must have Heroes and Weapons of the appropriate class. Quests have no cost other than this requirement. Unlike Heroes and Weapons, Quest Cards may have abilities that can be used over multiple rounds.<br/><br/>End of Turn<br/>Once a player has finished playing any cards they wish to play (and has the resources to play), they must:<br/>&bull; Discard all unplayed Draft Cards to the Draft Deck Discard Pile (do not discard Quest Cards OR played Heroes and Weapons).<br/>&bull; Gain 5 Gold plus additional Gold equal to the total Gold Production on all cards in front of you.<br/>&bull; Play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>End of Round<br/>Once all players have completed the Play Phase, the next round will begin. In each round, the starting player will rotate clockwise (i.e. the player who played second in the previous round will start the next round). TIP: At the end of each round, it is helpful to stack all of your played Heroes and Weapons so that only their icons are visible. This clears room for the next round&rsquo;s cards and helps to avoid confusion since only the icon powers remain in effect for future rounds.<br/><br/>After four rounds have been completed, players tally up XP to determine the winner. The player with the most XP at the end of the game is the winner! Huzzah!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "4049: The galaxy hums with prosperity and peace two millennia after the dawn of space travel. But as mankind and its neighbors colonized the stars, the burgeoning need for resources was apparent. One by one, new geological discoveries revolutionized terraform, construction and energy technology. The sub-temperature properties of the mineral Ice-9 allowed life-giving water to flow on uninhabitable planets. Crystallized Cobalt was accidentally found to be incredibly strong, resistant to extreme pressure. And a single chunk of Deuterium could power a sprawling metropolis for a month!<br/><br/>As a plucky entrepreneur you must explore the edges of space searching for precious minerals. Will you buy the fastest ship in the sector or hire the best pilot in the galaxy? Purchase the latest state-of-the-art gadgets, invest in planetary refineries, or pay off your rising debt? The cargo you haul could be worth fortune, so grab your helmet and suit up! The cosmos and a mountain of credits call!<br/><br/>In Starship Merchants, each player runs a fledgling corporation looking to stake a claim in the lucrative mining business. Player will buy starships, explore the galaxy and deliver cargo for interstellar credits, all the while expanding their operations.<br/><br/>Starting at the shipyard and ending at the dock, players will move clockwise around the four quadrants on the board to complete an entire Business Cycle. During each turn, a player either performs one action at the current quadrant or advances to the next, performing an action there. As players take actions or advance they spread apart across all four quadrants while completing individual Business Cycles.<br/><br/>The Shipyard is where you can buy a speedy scout or a heavy load bearing tug. The Market is where Gear, Pilots, Refineries, and claims can be purchased. In the belt, starships are run by spending energy points to explore, pickup mines, or fly to another destination. The final quadrant is the Dock where delivered cargo is traded for credits.<br/><br/>A player that ends his turn at the Dock with 100+ credits can declare the Final Run, ending the game. But after completing the Final Run, the player with the most credits wins!<br/><br/>",

The world is facing an ecological catastrophe caused by previously unknown marine life forms. Each player represents a nation sending their scientists out to confront the threat.<br/><br/>The action cards form the core of the game. For each round, the cards are shuffled and placed in a row. Each player in turn order takes the leftmost card from the row, until there are no more cards left. Instead of the leftmost card, players can also buy a different card by paying with victory points.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players score points according to the sizes of their largest research networks. At the end of the game, extra points are given out based on whether research stations are connected to the center of the game board.<br/><br/>",

Cards drive the impulses that take place during each turn, and each player has a deck of cards, made up from the troops under his or her command. Each soldier's &quot;deck&quot; of cards reflects abilities and traits-- perhaps about how well they shoot or how slowly they move or how attracted they are to things like fresh milk, hot food, or loot. There are some Soldiers (called &quot;Characters&quot;) included in the base game (Day of Days) which are common, but the others in DoD and all that are purchased separately have unique characteristics (which all balance out to be &quot;equal&quot; according to a complex math formula which is seamless to the players). So players can only get the best out of their forces after they have learned each soldier's strengths and weaknesses. &quot;Day of Days&quot; includes moveable mapboard tiles, hand-painted 20mm miniatures (by FAA), scenarios, cards (several decks!) and everything needed to play. Additional Soldiers give more choices and more fun.<br/><br/>",

As the boss of one of the city's most notorious crime organizations, robbing that vault for all it's worth is constantly on your mind. There's only one problem&mdash;this job is too big for just your crew alone. You're going to need help from some of your biggest rival crime bosses if you want to succeed. You'll need to join forces on a series of smaller jobs in order to acquire the skills and resources you'll need to pull off the biggest heist the city has ever seen&mdash;but watch your back! Once you and your new partners in crime are inside the bank vault, it'll be every boss for himself. If you manage to safely escape the scene with more loot than your rivals, you'll be revered as the city's most notorious crime boss. Hire your crew, plan the heist, and get ready for the big score!<br/><br/>The Big Score is a competitive game for 1-6 players that plays in 30-60 minutes. The game is structured into two distinct halves.<br/><br/>In the first half of the game, players use card drafting to carefully choose which specialists to add to their crew. They secretly decide how to assign them to various small heists throughout the city, and they need to pick just the right moment to send in their most skilled expert to ensure a job's success! If these plans go well, players steal a variety of loot: cold hard cash, diamonds that escalate in value as more are gained, artifacts that are profitable for the player with the largest collection, and hard drives full of information that become lucrative only if hacked with a digital key.<br/><br/>In the second half of the game, individual player abilities come into play as the players attempt the mother of all heists&mdash;the big score. Players risk being busted by the cops as they steal even more loot in an exciting, press-your-luck grand finale inside the vault at Centennial City Bank!<br/><br/>The Big Score also features a challenging solo-play mode designed by A.J. Porfirio (Hostage Negotiator).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Sky Tango, you trace the cycles of the moon and the sun by creating series of cards that illustrate the passing of time. Eclipses can appear and ruin your paths, but don't let them discourage you for the sun and moon will always reappear. Will your solar and lunar cycles lead you to victory?<br/><br/>In game terms, the deck of cards consists of numbered sun and moon cards (some of which feature animals) as well as eclipse cards. Players place the cards in stacks in ascending order, either in front of themselves or in front of others. When a stack is five cards high, it can be removed and scored for points. Stacks can be interrupted by eclipse cards, which in turn can be covered by the appropriate sun or moon cards. Playing a card with an animal allows a player to play again, which is sometimes advantageous, but sometimes not. The player who removes the most cards from play wins!<br/><br/>",

Each citizen can have one of two potion types played onto it, and you play each token face down so you know the personality of the citizen, but none of the other players do. Once all citizens on two of the scene cards are covered with potions, all potions are resolved in the following order:<br/><br/><br/>     A lone choleric wins, whereas two or more are discarded, after which...<br/>     Two or more sanguines win, whereas a single one is discarded, after which...<br/>     Exactly two melancholics win, whereas more than two are discarded and a single one sneaks away, after which...<br/>     Any number of phlegmatics win.<br/><br/><br/>Place winning potions on the corresponding scene in the kingdom.. If a melancholic token sneaks away, place the potion on an adjacent scene connected by a path or bridge. After all potions have been placed, see whether you've completed any of the four randomized goals on display, such as having a potion on each of the six map tiles or occupying two pairs of locations that are connected by bridges. Then reveal four new scene cards and begin another round.<br/><br/>When a player completes an objective, the first party tile is resolved.  Party tiles are similar to scenes with citizens, but they are available to play onto on your turn at any point in the game.  Once the players at the table have completed six total objectives, the last party tile is resolved and the game ends.  The player with the most objectives completed wins!<br/><br/>Alternatively, instead of using a shared kingdom board, you can play in &quot;Fiefdom Mode&quot;, with each player having their own fiefdom board. After resolving scene cards, players place their winning personality potion covering a matching character in your fiefdom.  The objectives now encourage you to cover all characters of certain types or to create a specific pattern within your Fiefdom.<br/><br/>",

He decides he wishes to marry her and sets off to find her. Unfortunately, he doesn't actually remember anything about her and is left wondering aloud to all: &quot;Does anyone know Cinderella?&quot; Hearing this, many influential people begin spreading rumors that their servant is the actual Cinderella.<br/><br/>In Too Many Cinderellas, players represent powerful people in the far-off country who are trying to influence the Prince's decision about who is the real Cinderella, pointing him towards their &quot;Cinderella&quot;. If anyone tries to spread misinformation about your &quot;Cinderella&quot;, you can just say &quot;NO!&quot; at the audience with the Prince. Many Cinderellas have gathered; who will be recognized as the real &quot;Cinderella&quot; by the Prince?<br/><br/>In game terms, the deck of cards is shuffled and each player receives four cards. The person with the smallest feet starts first. A player wins a round when she has the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. To find the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella, each player lays down a card. The card dictates which card will be or won't be the real Cinderella. When a card is laid down, everyone secretly votes whether or not they want the new rule for that round. This repeats until each player has played two cards. Then everyone reveals their hand, and whoever has the card that matches all the rules laid out in the round is the winner for having the &quot;true&quot; Cinderella. In cases of ties, the winner is the player with the highest card.<br/><br/>Game #3 in 'The Mike Line' of games from Grail Games.<br/><br/>",

Genesis is not a simulation of events during this era. Much like its ancestor game, Pax Romana, Genesis is a game that provides the players with the historical dramatis personae and allows them to forge their own empires. It also has a great emphasis on the control of the important trade routes and commercial centers and the building of the spectacular monuments these civilizations left for posterity and wonder. Genesis can be played by from one to five gamers.<br/><br/>Each player represents one of the major Mesopotamian Bronze Age empires:  Egypt, The Hittites, The Mitanni, Assyria, Babylonia. There are several &ldquo;minor&rdquo; kingdoms that come into play through the use of the Event Cards:  Arzawa (Apasa, Milawata, Mallarima, Mira, Hindawa, Hapalla), Canaan (Hazor, Qatna, Meggido and Kadesh), and Elam (Susa).<br/><br/>Each is trying to expand its economic reach, allowing them to build their empire to greater levels...and this will mean coming into inimical contact with each other. Gods play a major role, as do the great caravan centers of the age,bringing in luxury items from as far away as what would be Afghanistan.  And then there are the peasants and slaves which who can be most useful (some times), as well as the great techno advantages in chariotry.<br/><br/>(from Game Rules introduction)<br/><br/>",

Another 8 cards are added to a common Play Pile. Players then take turns rolling a die to determine what type of clues can be given, starting the timer, selecting a card from their hand, and trying to get the other players to guess what is on that card as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>The four types of clues that can be given to describe your cards are:<br/><br/>    Cloodle - provide clues by drawing and doodling<br/>    Tongue-Tied - use alliteration to give as many clues as possible that start with a single letter<br/>    Soundstage - act out or provide sound effects for clues (but you can't use words!)<br/>    Tweener - give hints in the form &quot;It's bigger than blank but smaller than blank&quot;, using two objects that imply the answer<br/><br/><br/>After someone guesses the card in play, stop the timer and draw a new card from the Play Pile. The next player takes the die and repeats the same process, until either no cards are left or the available 15 minutes are gone.<br/><br/>Players who are stuck on a particular card can choose to discard that card, but two new cards must then be added to the game instead - one card is placed directly in that player's hand, and a penalty card is added to the Play Pile.<br/><br/>The game is won by all players if they can work together to guess all of the cards in play before the timer runs out.<br/><br/>",

You need to control the links in the production chain to get your cut of the cash, to make sure the cocao flows through your businesses instead of your competitors'.<br/><br/>Sometimes you need to help your customers and suppliers to help yourself. If you are wily, you can figure out a way for your competitors to do the work for you. Create monopolies, cut off the supply chain, disrupt other players' finely honed plans &mdash; do whatever it takes to become King Chocolate.<br/><br/>The fruit of the cacao tree goes through six steps to become chocolate. You can control only a few of these steps, so you  must work with your fellow chocolate makers to keep the chocolate flowing through the production chain. It sounds cooperative and friendly &mdash; but did we mention that the chocolate maker with the most money wins? Things always get complicated when money is involved.<br/><br/>To ensure your portion of the production process is used the most so that it earns you cash, occasionally you'll help your customers and suppliers. At the same time, you will attempt to crush your competitors, force others to help you, and manipulate the supply chain.<br/><br/>You'll do whatever it takes to become the king of chocolate.<br/><br/>",

Player craft items, gain special abilities and tools using a variety of resources. Players choose to draw resources and/or guild cards but the cards can also be purchased from other players or players can purchase resources from a warehouse. Use abilities to change the rules, tools to use fewer resources in making orders or sell crafted items. Special King's Items made for the King are revealed at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are three types of Resources (metals, gems, and runes) and four types of Guild cards(Apprentices, Tools, Items and King's Items). Metals and Gems must be refined into resources before they can be used to craft orders. Guild cards are crafted on the 3rd phase of your turn and then completed on the 2nd phase of the next turn.<br/><br/>There are four phases of the game; Refine Resource cards, Complete Guild card, Actions (6), Draw cards. Refine metal and gem cards by turning cards 180 degrees into refined resources. Then, all Guild cards crafted on the player&rsquo;s previous turn are now complete and can be used. There are six repeatable Actions in the game: Play a card, Craft a Guild card, Move or Swap a card, Buy a card from another player or from the warehouse, Discard a Guild card and Sell Resource cards. At the end of the player&rsquo;s turn, the player must draw four cards but cannot exceed their hand limit. Lastly, straighten any tilted cards placed into the player's market on their turn.<br/><br/>Play continues until one Player has completed four King's Orders, or either the Guild or Mine decks run out, and then all players get one last turn. Resources are sold from the player's market and then the King's Orders are revealed, bonus coins are given for the highest valued King&lsquo;s Item (for each subtype). Count up your coins and the player with the most coins at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Lost Battles&quot; is forty games in one. The game covers battles and campaigns in the Mediterranean and Near East from the Persian defeat at Marathon in 490 BC to Caesar's victory at Pharsalus in 48 BC.  It has been exhaustively tested and refined over the past several years, and is based on Professor Philip Sabin's decades of research and simulation design on ancient warfare; and it includes an updated copy of his book, with extensive historical and design notes on every scenario.<br/><br/>The game can be fought on three levels - the grand tactical, the grand strategic, or a combination of the two.  At the grand tactical level, 1 or 2 players may refight any of 35 different land battles such as Leuctra, Gaugamela, Raphia, Cannae, Cynoscephalae or the Sambre - far more than in any other single boxed game.  At the grand strategic level, 1 to 4 players may refight the epic duels of the two centuries from 350 to 150 BC, starting with the eclipse of Achaemenid Persia by Alexander of Macedon, and ending with Hannibal's campaigns and the conquest of Carthage and the Hellenistic states by the resurgent Roman republic.  The most ambitious games combine these two levels, and see 1 to 4 players using tactical battles to resolve strategic campaigns across part or all of this two century period, or else refighting a series of historical battles to decide conflicts such as the three-cornered contest for dominance between Athens, Sparta and Thebes from the start of the Peloponnesian War to the death of Epaminondas.<br/><br/>The accent throughout is on combining historical accuracy with speed and accessibility.  The free-standing strategic game may be completed in just 30 minutes, while individual land battles may be re-fought in two hours or less.  There is constant player interaction, and a series of tortuous dilemmas - how should the scarce command points be allocated across the battlefront, which troop types should be put in the lead against particular opponents, should units attack all-out at the cost of becoming exhausted themselves, and should generals join the fighting to rally their disheartened men at the risk of being killed and so making things far worse?  The game includes all the many troop types from hoplites, legionaries, phalangites and archers to cataphracts, scythed chariots and war elephants, and it includes simple rules to reflect the huge differences in generalship and troop quality and to allow outclassed armies to win a handicapped 'game victory' even if they are defeated on the field, as long as they do better than they did historically.  All aspects of the game are avowedly solitaire-friendly, and can be run by a single player swapping sides just as easily as by one or more players per side.<br/><br/>Tactical battles are fought on a 5 x 4 grid of full-colour 5 inch square hard mounted terrain tiles, which dovetail to form any desired battlefield.  The individually die-cut counters have rounded corners and are also in full-colour; they depict the various different troop types. The strategic game is fought on a hard mounted map showing the area from Spain to India.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "<br/>Siege Storm is a deck building game. You have cards, your enemy has cards. You both cast some creatures and spells, then one of you wins.<br/><br/>Close your eyes. Imagine you are a mighty lord commanding an army. Or a magician summoning creatures onto a battlefield. Or a farmer who grows his units on a cornfield right in the storm of battle. So you build your army, choose your enemy and try to bring the pain to him, before he brings the pain to you.<br/><br/>Between you and your enemy there are 2 tracks: one that your armies use to travel towards enemy, and a similar one where your enemy&rsquo;s units travel to you. Again, just imagine whatever you want &ndash; two epic castles in a war or a slow, magic-fest between old, smelly wizards with rheumatism.<br/><br/>Cards are everything here: your life bar, your mana, your library and so on. When you draw them into your hand you can either play them or discard them to pay for some more expensive, fancy card&rsquo;s cost. But there are even more decisions from here!<br/><br/>When you play a card, you can play it as an instant and get a trigger effect. Alternatively, you can play it as a creature on your track, then its passive ability will work. It will defend you at first, and once it moves up to the end of your track, it will be able to:<br/>a)    Activate (attack and trigger its effect)<br/>b)    Become your supporter (our fancy term for mana) <br/>c)    Or stay in the middle of the track and make its passive ability work all the time<br/><br/>So, you can build powerful combos, you can zombie-rush, you can build your economy and all sorts of other cool stuff. But whenever your enemy hits you, you will lose cards from your resources, so there is that. No cards to draw? You lose.<br/><br/>If you like it we might even get some expansions going pretty soon.<br/><br/>A co-op mode has also been added.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was originally designed by a teacher to be used as a learning tool.  There are several different editions of this game (originally released in the UK as Railway Rivals), but most feature several different hexagonal maps of real locations, such as Tennessee and Germany.  Starting from one of the cities pictured on the map, players build track during the first part of the game.  Players receive a small bonus for reaching a city before anyone else, but otherwise funds are quite limited.  After nearly every city has been connected to someone's rail line, several races are held on the resultant track.  The starting city and destination city are determined randomly, and players can use each other's track (for a nominal fee, of course).  After all races have been held, the player with largest bank account is the winner.<br/><br/>This series of games is very similar to Mayfair Game's crayon rail games series, though they use erasable marker pens instead of crayons.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eastern Empires is a board game for 3 to 9 players and covers the development of ancient civilizations over 8000 years of history. Eastern Empires can take up to 12 hours to complete, and still yet, it has a simple mechanism and is easy to learn. The players lead their civilizations, as they expand and collapse, from the Stone Age, through the Bronze Age to the end of the Iron Age. Eastern Empires provides a full day of fun for larger groups.<br/><br/>Culture<br/>Though it may seem at first glance, Eastern Empires is not a wargame. Yes, conflict may be involved, but rather it is a game about history, culture, trade, development, and... calamities. The civilizations involved are all situated along the Silk Road and the Arabian Peninsula. The Babylonians, The Indus Valley civilization and The Nubians. Players develop their own unique civilization in arts, crafts, science, civics and religion. Each player starts his civilization with a single population token, 8000 BC, but grows and grows over time, and eventually cities can be built. Cities of course bring wealth and fortune, but also&hellip; natural calamities such as epidemics, famine or earthquakes, or civil calamities such as pirate attacks, slave revolts and civil disorder.<br/><br/>Trading<br/>This wealth is expressed in trade cards. The more cities, the more cards a player gets. These cards provide both trading commodities, and calamities. Trading is the heart of the game. A real social experience, where all players simultaneously trade with each other during a limited time. As soon as trading has ended, the players that end up with calamities will suffer them.<br/><br/>Develop advances<br/>And then, of course, it's time to do something about it. Build walls, give your citizens music and architecture. Develop religion, democracy, improve science&hellip; 51 different advances can be developed in five different categories.<br/><br/>Maybe a player can even construct a wonder of the world, or scatter their people all over the map, and gain cultural ascendancy. The player that knows best how to work together, trade or battle for territory, defend his people against nature or enemies like barbarian hordes, and stand the test of time, eventually will win the game. After up to 12 hours of playing that is.<br/><br/>Additional components<br/>Compared to its counterpart Western Empires (2019), Eastern Empires game adds additional components and scenarios that enable games with less than 5 players. Though the base game is especially designed for interaction between larger numbers, these new rules and components provide a well balanced smaller game that can even be used with its counterpart Western Empires. The game can be expanded with Eastern Empires: The Special Buildings Expansion (2019).<br/><br/>Mega Empires<br/>When combining the board games Western Empires (2019) and Eastern Empires (2021) this forms: Mega Empires (2021), an 18-player experience. A full game of Mega Empires takes up to 13 hours to complete. This bundle contains both stand alone games, each of which can be played by 3-9 players and can be expanded with the two Special Buildings Expansions (2019) for either game or the combination of both games. Where Western Empires has a focus on sea travel and trade on the Mediterrainean Sea, Eastern Empires follows the Silk Road to India and trading is done through the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>",

You'll fight on three fronts with armies you create for each battle, making every battle a new experience.<br/><br/>Each Pocket Battles game depicts two armies. The rules for combat are the same in each Pocket Battles game so you can have armies from different series fighting: Elves vs. Romans! WW2 soldiers vs. Napoleonic forces! It's all possible with Pocket Battles.<br/><br/>The basic rules of the game are simple; two armies face each other in battle. The armies are split into three columns and two rows. Players must decide, at the start of the game, how many points they will give to their armies, determining how many points it will take to defeat the opponents army. (At least half of the points).<br/><br/>On you turn; you have to choose which faction of your army you will send off to battle! Attacks are made by using Order Tokens. If no Order Tokens are present on a unit, it costs just 1 token to issue orders to that unit. Issuing orders to the same unit in the same Battle Round would cost you the number of tokens present on the unit, plus 1. (So if there is one token on you unit, it would cost you two more tokens; if you had three, it would cost you four tokens, and so on).<br/><br/>After a round of battle, you may choose to redeploy you units. (Units may move from the back row to the front row, from the back of a row to the back of another row, or from the front of a row to the front of another row). Redeployment will not cost you any Order tokens.<br/><br/>The battle is over when one army defeats the other.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>60 tiles, 6 dice, 20 wound/order tokens, 2 player aids, 1 set of rules.<br/><br/>Macedonians: 1 agema, 2 agriganes, 1 alexandros, 1 argyraspides, 1 chiliarch, 5 cretan archers, 4 hetairoi, 4 hypaspistai, 4 peltasts, 4 pezhetairoi, 2 prodromoi and 1 standard bearer.<br/><br/>Persians: 6 archers, 1 baivarapatis, 1 chariot, 1 darius, 2 elephants, 3 immortals, 3 kardaka, 3 levies, 3 median calary, 1 scyted chariot, 2 sparabara, 1 standard bearer and 3 takabara.<br/><br/>",

As the first company to offer extended-stay space vacations, we are excited to have you working for us! As a supervisor of this company, you&rsquo;ll be expected to not only build these shuttles and satisfy our guests, but also to help the company thrive by enhancing our company network, inventing new technologies, and growing our workforce.  We are a united company, and you&rsquo;ll often find that what another supervisor does will make your job easier. Let me be clear, though, this is a competition. The supervisor who comes out on top will become CEO of the company.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will either place a worker to take two actions in the ever-expanding network, launch a shuttle and send one of your workers to space as a pilot, or recall all your earthbound workers to collect funding bonuses. Actions include acquiring blueprints, constructing shuttles, attracting guests, and building developments&ndash;connections between locations that increase action selection throughout the game. You will also be affecting resource markets that ebb and flow with the actions of all the players.<br/><br/>When you launch a shuttle, one of your workers will accompany it as a pilot, navigating the shuttle to various destinations and &ldquo;days in space,&rdquo; where guests will reward you for all your hard work.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you will also be competing with your fellow supervisors to complete company goals, which will earn you progress cubes throughout the game. Progress cubes are also placed when you launch shuttles, and when a certain number of cubes are placed onto the company&rsquo;s progress track, the game ends, and the player with the most Victory Points becomes the new CEO of Galactic Cruise.<br/><br/>Do you still think you have what it takes to work for us? You do? Great. Let&rsquo;s get started.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knit Wit is a word game along the lines of Scattergories, with players trying to think up unique answers to particular categories in order to score points, but instead of using fixed categories, players generate their own categories while playing the game.<br/><br/>To set up, each player takes numbered spools and looped strings based on the number of players, along with an answer sheet. A number of bonus buttons, which have 1-4 holes, are stacked on the table, again based on the number of players. Going clockwise around the table, each player (after the first) places one loop on the table so that it surrounds exactly one spool, then draws a word tag from the box and attaches it to this loop, then places one spool in one section of loop(s) that has no spool in it. (Think of a Venn diagram; two overlapping circles form three sections, with one section having both circles in common and two sections being part of only one circle.)<br/><br/>Once all of the spools have been placed, everyone races to think of words, names, or phrases for each spool based on the word tags associated with that spool. If a spool has three loops around it, for example, it has three words associated with it, and your answer must relate to those words in some manner.<br/><br/>As soon as someone has finished or can't think of more answers, they grab the topmost button on the stack (the one with the most holes). Once the final button is grabbed, players can't write more answers. Players then compare answers, crossing out those they have in common with someone else, then scoring points for the remaining answers; each answer is worth as many points as the number of loops around the spool with the same number. Buttons are worth as many points as the number of holes they have, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kodama Duo is a two-player standalone version of Kodama: The Tree Spirits and a 6th player expansion. You will grow a tree by placing branch cards in clever arrangements, making a happy home for your Kodama!<br/><br/>Kodama Duo is a card placement game for 2 players that plays in 30 minutes. Players will turn over one Decree card per season to set the unique conditions. During the Growing Phase, players take turns revealing branch cards and splitting them into two piles until each player has added four branch cards to their tree. In the Kodama phase, players will each choose one of their Kodama to score and live in their tree. The game last 3 seasons (12 turns) and whoever cares for their Kodama best will be remembered for generations!<br/><br/>There are a couple of cool twists on the original Kodama rules for Duo.<br/><br/>First, instead of a display of branch cards to choose, each turn one player (the splitter) will reveal three branch cards from the deck. They will then split those cards into two piles. The other player (the chooser) will select one of the branch piles. The other pile will go to the splitter. Then, both players will add one of the branch cards they received to their tree. The player who received two branch cards will discard the extra card.<br/><br/>Second, Duo introduces spirit tokens, which are tokens with the six features from Kodama. After the player that received two branch cards discards one, the other player receives a spirit token from the discarded branch card. They pick one of the features from that card and take the corresponding spirit token. That player then places that token over one of the icons on their tree. This allows interesting scoring interactions as feature chains can be shortened or lengthened to increase the scoring potential for future branch placements.<br/><br/>Additionally, most of the new Kodama cards and Decree cards interact with the spirit tokens and splitter/chooser mechanic. All of these changes provide an interesting twist on the core mechanics you already love about Kodama.<br/><br/>Duo also introduces the ability to play Kodama: the Tree Spirits with six players. With this update, we've included new rules for branch selection. Each player will secretly choose from four branch cards simultaneously in a draft format. Players will also be allowed to place and score their branch cards simultaneously. This will shorten the downtime that could have been added by including more players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Amateurs to Arms! is a historical simulation game of the War of 1812. One player assumes the role of the British (including Canadian) forces, and the other plays the Americans. This often-overlooked conflict ended in a draw historically, but this was not the only possible outcome. The Americans clearly wished to annex Canada to their young nation, while the British wanted to teach their former colonies a lesson. The game includes all of the theaters of battle from the war: the US/ Canadian border and the Great Lakes (of course) but also the wilderness of the old Northwest, the Atlantic coast of the US, the Civilized Indians of the south, and the site of the final conflict at New Orleans.<br/><br/>Each turn represents a few months of time (depending on the season). A typical turn consists of dealing out to each player the number of cards indicated on the turn track. The winter and spring turns require a few special tasks. The Americans will have more resources to commit to the war- until Napoleon is defeated in Europe, and the English player can focus more resources on their efforts in North America. Each card can be played for the event described on the card, or for the card&rsquo;s Operations Points, to move Expeditions, build ships and fortifications, or raise troops.<br/><br/>Events on the cards and on the map will cause the markers on the Peace Track to move forward.  This represents the war weariness of each side&rsquo;s people: bad events will cause your people to demand peace.  Most events push inexorably towards peace; only a few rally your people for a longer war. When the two markers meet on the Peace Track, the game proceeds to the negotiations at Ghent, and the winner is determined.  Oh yes, and then each player plays one more card, while news of the peace travels across the Atlantic!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cactus Town is an asymmetric action programming game for 2 to 4 players (1-5 with the Lone Ranger Expansion). A highly interactive game of fast paced chase &amp; escape.<br/><br/>Sleepy little Cactus Town is going to see some action: you can put yourself the Sheriff&rsquo;s badge, join a group of dangerous bandits, seek ransom as a bounty hunter or even use the power of seduction being an avenging Can Can dancer. Each party has its own objectives and its own special actions, making this a perfect gateway game for asymmetric gameplay. With playing time of 10-15 minutes per player, you can swap and play various parties each session.<br/><br/>Players program their actions with 3 out of 4 action cards each turn. Sounds easy enough, right? But careful, actions alternate between players and action cards are programmed in reverse order, meaning the last card programmed comes up first. Mastering this is a real challenge. Can you out-think your opponents, guess their moves and get in your own. Or will you out-think yourself and create some hilarious chaos?<br/><br/>Each player's characters move through a 5x5 building-card grid, which is set up randomly face down each game. The game includes an advanced version with building effects and several variants, giving you even more replay value.<br/><br/>Are you ready for a duel? Will you plunder for gold? Are you in the mood to dance a Can Can? Going to steal a horse, are you? A lot of things are going to happen in Cactus Town, create your own cinematic Western story!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the station has been invaded by creeps, alien creatures that slowly advance toward food (the colonists) so that they can multiply. The only thing keeping the colonists from being completely wiped out is your knowledge of the station, a couple of specialty tools and abilities unique to each of you, and a little bit of problem-solving code installed so you could do your jobs efficiently.<br/><br/>Jupiter Rescue is a co-operative strategy game in which players work together to escort 28 colonists to an escape pod before they're converted into alien creeps. Each turn, players may take five actions, choosing from common options &mdash; moving themselves, moving nearby colonists, or killing alien creeps &mdash; and a series of programming cards that grant them special abilities. These cards can be played on the player's turn to activate the ability. Each player also gets to choose one card to be his &quot;core&quot; ability, letting him use it every turn instead of discarding it.<br/><br/>New creeps are added to the board, which is composed of tiles, at the end of each player's turn by rolling a die; if a tile fills up with creeps, it's destroyed and removed from the game. Players lose if enough colonists get turned into creeps, or if certain key board tiles are all destroyed. Double-sided tiles allow for hundreds of station variations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Micro Robots, a simultaneous play game inspired by Alex Randolph's classic Ricochet Robots, challenges players to quickly determine how a robot can move from one spot on the grid to another.<br/><br/>To set up, choose to use the black or copper side of the four game boards, then arrange them in a 2x2 square. Each game board shows nine dice, and once arranged the completed grid shows 36 dice, with the dice being numbered 1-6 and showing six colors, with each combination of number and color appearing exactly once. Roll the color die and number die to determine the starting location for the transparent robot, then mark this space with the transparent starting token.<br/><br/>In a round, roll the two dice to determine the target space; you can mark this space with a transparent victory token or simply have everyone remember which space they're trying to reach. Everyone simultaneously tries to figure out how to move the robot to the target space, and to move the robot, it must move orthogonally to a space that shares either the color or number of its current location. If the robot starts on &quot;3-green&quot;, for example, it can move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 3 or is green; if you'd move it to &quot;5-green&quot;, it can now once again move orthogonally to any space that shows either a 5 or is green; and so on.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has a solution, they yell out the number of moves, then take the robot and demonstrate the solution. If the solution takes exactly the number of moves claimed, the player earns a victory token; if not, the player gives one of their victory tokens (if they have any) to the player with the fewest tokens. In either case, the former target space becomes the new starting space for the next round.<br/><br/>If any player possesses five victory tokens, they win! If the 25 victory tokens are distributed before someone collects five, then whoever holds the most tokens wins, with ties being possible.<br/><br/>Expert Micro Robots players can increase the challenge of the game by placing the target victory token on the board, then rolling the two dice once again. The players must now determine a solution that first moves the robot to the space showing on the dice, then to the final destination.<br/><br/>The transparent robot in Micro Robots can also be used in Ricochet Robots. This robot moves like any other robot in that game except that for an additional move it can pass through a wall instead of stopping at it. It cannot move through the central barrier or the exterior walls, and the only target space on which it can land is the colored vortex.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Schnapsen is a point trick-taking game for 2 players using a 20 card deck consisting of ace, ten, king, queen, jack of the four suits. (Value and rank are the same as in Skat and Schafkopf.) Each round players are dealt five cards, replenishing from stock after each trick, with one turned up to indicate trump. The goal in each deal is to accumulate sixty-six trick points, where the card values are A=11, T=10, K=4, Q=3, J=2.  The suit led does not need to be followed until the stock is closed or exhausted, at which point suit must be followed, the trick must be won if possible, and you must trump if you cannot follow suit.<br/><br/>Sixty-Six is a variant including nines and therefore 24 cards in total. Instead of five, six cards are dealt each round.<br/><br/>Depending on the margin by which a player wins the deal, that player scores 1-3 game points.  A player who reaches 7 points wins the whole game. If the other player failed to gain any points in the meantime, the game is a Bummerl of double value. This only matters if playing a match of multiple games, which ends once a player reaches a previously agreed upon number of points. Detailed rules can be found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://psellos.com/schnapsen/rules.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://psellos.com/schnapsen/rules.html</a>.<br/><br/>There also exists a - more complex - variant for three to four players: Bauernschnapsen.<br/>Commercial variants include WOO and Route 66: Get Your Tricks<br/><br/>",

Players take turns making guesses using a &quot;clock&quot; mechanism about their unknown suspect&rsquo;s identity. The other players (who can see every suspect but their own) will tell you whether you've got a lead on your suspect; if not, it's a dead-end. Figure out enough leads to deduce the suspect's identity, and you get to snag a clue that leads to Furriarty. Each clue is labeled with a variable number of victory points. Every round, Furriarty pads his way closer to escape, putting tension on the players to guess &mdash; quickly! &mdash; to solve the case.

At the start of the game, each player chooses a class deck and a race deck, then shuffles them together to create unique character combinations, such as a Human Paladin or Goblin Druid. Each combination creates unique tactics and strategies to use when you battle.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to defeat your opponent by reducing them to zero life. Players do this by playing moves that act as both attacks and blocks as well as with special cards and abilities granted by the player's choice of class and race.<br/><br/>During a turn, a player adds cards to their &quot;aggression pile&quot;, then chooses how many cards to draw from their aggression pile into their hand. The player uses the aggression provided by the cards that remain in their aggression pile to play move cards to block incoming enemy attacks. If an attack isn't blocked, the player takes damage, specifically one damage per unblocked enemy attack. Then all the moves played by that player become attacks for the opponent to deal with on the opponent's next turn. There's more to it than that, but those are the basics...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "8bit MockUp (8ビットモックアップ) (later republished as Legendary Forests) is a multiplayer solitaire game akin to Take it Easy! or Karuba. Each player has an identical set of tiles and plays the same tile at the same time to their own tableau, but where each player places each tile may differ.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player creates their own world by connecting the landscapes on their tiles. Each player starts the game with the same starting tile in play. One player, the &quot;Leader&quot;, shuffles their tiles face down, then removes five tiles from play without looking at them. On a turn, the Leader reveals the next tile, calls out the number on it, then everyone places that same tile somewhere in their landscape, with the adjacent edges of each pair of tiles needing to match.<br/><br/>When the Leader draws a tile with a red number, everyone places their piece, then starting with the player who holds the God piece (initially the Leader), everyone draws a monument tile from the center of the playing area and places it on an area in their landscape. Monuments come in three colors (while the landscapes have areas in four colors), and you use only two monuments of a color for each player in the game. After placing monuments, pass the God piece clockwise to the next player.<br/><br/>The game ends after everyone has placed their twenty tiles, then players score points based on the areas where they have monuments. Each non-purple edge of a tile has a half-circle on it; when two such edges are placed together, the owner of those tiles has created a &quot;cookie&quot; in that area. To score, you look at each area where you have a monument. If you have no half-circles in this area &mdash; that is, the area is completely enclosed &mdash; then you score 2 points for each cookie in that area.

        "description": "The inhabitants of the villages surrounding a dormant volcano were happily living in peace until &mdash; KABOOM! &mdash; the old volcano sprung back to life, unleashing rivers of molten lava in every direction and blasting volcanic rock into the sky. The villages, now faced with destruction, must do whatever they can to protect their homes from the incoming surge of lava.<br/><br/>Your village is about to burn up &mdash; can you take the heat?<br/><br/>Eruption is a competitive survival game in which each player struggles to save his or her own village from destruction caused by an onslaught of lava from an erupting volcano. As lava enters a village, its temperature increases until it has burned up completely. Players can protect their own villages by placing lava tiles defensively and strategically building walls of various materials to hold back the lava. They are also rewarded with action cards for directing lava to other villages. Action cards allow players to rotate, replace, or remove the hexagonal lava tiles as well as cool down and fortify their own villages. Once the volcano has fully unleashed its fury, the player whose village is at the lowest temperature wins.<br/><br/>",

It is also the first historical boardgame published, in two decades, to address galley warfare. As such, GMT's War Galley is almost a complete history for this era of war at sea.<br/><br/>What is best about War Galley is how easy it is to play -- the rules are about half the length of the usual GBoH game -- and that means that most battles can be complete in several hours, at the most. The battles themselves, cover all aspects of galley tactics, from the line against line of big ships at Salamis (Cyprus), to the Chase, Turn and Fight of Chios, to the Line Astern vs. Line Abreast at Side, to probably the most unusual of all ancient battles, the Roman arrowhead against the Carthaginian Lines Astern at Drepanum in 249 B.C.<br/><br/>War Galley wars and battles covered by the scenarios are:<br/><br/><br/>     Ionian Revolt- Lade, 494 BC<br/>     Peloponnesian War- Arginusae, 406 BC<br/>     The Silician Wars- Catana, 397 BC<br/>     The First Successor War- Salamis, 306 BC (Cyprus)<br/>     The First Punic War<br/>         Ecnomus, 256 BC<br/>         Drepanum, 249 BC<br/>         Aegatian Islands, 242 BC <br/>    <br/>     The Macedonian Wars- Chios, 201 BC<br/>     The War with Antiochus<br/>         Side, 190 BC<br/>         Myonessus, 190 BC <br/>    <br/>     The Civil War<br/>         Tauris, 47 BC<br/>         Naulochus, 36 BC<br/>         Actium, 31 BC <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

Overall, Tide of Iron: Next Wave is much more informative and organized. The rules are improved with corrected errors which make it better than the rules found in the 2007 edition. Also, a few of the scenarios have been adjusted for better game play. These and other improvements make this edition better than the older edition. Also included in Tide of Iron: Next Wave are some additional and useful items that were later introduced to TOI in some of the game expansions. Because of these differences, the two products have different entries on BoardGameGeek. For more information about the older 2007 version of Tide of Iron, you can Click Here.<br/><br/>Tide of Iron is a game of World War II tactical conflict for two to four players. The components in this base game allow players to simulate the dramatic struggle that took place between American and German forces in Northern Europe during the years 1944 and 1945.<br/><br/>Tide of Iron is a scenario-based game, with the available forces, objectives, map, and victory conditions being set by each given scenario. It features loads of plastic figures, including soldiers, equipment, heavy weapons, and combat vehicles, cards, dice, cardboard markers, and modular game boards that will represent the customizable terrain of this scenario-based wargame.<br/><br/>The twelve double-sided map tiles, plus the dozens of included terrain hexes, allow for limitless potential combinations, and each scenario can be enhanced by special rules, objective markers, troop allotments, and other variations.

        "description": "In a fantasy world dominated by goblins, when the blood moon rises in the sky, a new war begins and new warlords raise their armies.<br/><br/>GOSU 2: Tactics plays like a hybrid of Race for the Galaxy and Magic: The Gathering with each player trying to recruit an army of goblins made up of soldiers, heroes, magicians, and other classes &ndash; then swing it into action against the other players. Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, use a goblin's power, draw cards, or pass. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.<br/><br/>Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles. The first player to win three battles wins the game.<br/><br/>While the game play in GOSU2 remains much the same as in GOSU, some changes make it a different game:<br/><br/><br/>    The game no longer includes activation tokens, which were used to draw cards or activate a goblin's power.<br/>    All text has been removed from the cards to make them (and the game as a whole) fully multilingual.<br/>    Goblin abilities are now based on seven symbols, each with a basic and a MAX version.<br/>    The game includes a new &laquo;link&raquo; ability.<br/>    The goblin clans are structured differently.<br/><br/><br/>Additionally, all cards are &quot;cold foil&quot; printed to make them shiny.

In each turn, they take an action by deploying one of their workers or their truck to brew an increasing variety of beers, improving the brewing process with new advancements like refrigeration machines or beer filters, or increasing the efficiency of their workers, to name but a few. Action cards also play an important role, and with beer deliveries and other actions, they can earn victory points. Actions take place on the game board and their own player tableau, the player order is important and influenced by the players, bonus workers enable additional actions but must first be earned by placing the right worker on the right action space.<br/><br/>Beer Pioneers extends over an indefinite number of rounds.

        "description": "Field of Glory: The Card Game is a quick-playing game for two players inspired by Field of Glory, the miniatures rule system designed by Richard Bodley Scott for ancient and medieval tabletop battles.<br/><br/>The game is split into two parts. You first decide with which units to fight, constructing a deck of 24 unit cards. You then fight a battle across a battlefield made up of five terrain cards; to win the game, you must take control of three of these terrain cards. The army cards represent the main troop types of the period, such as heavy infantry, light cavalry and elephants, each having its own strengths and weaknesses. To be able to play units onto the battlefield, you must discard other cards to pay the movement costs involved, giving you a number of difficult decisions to make.<br/><br/>Field of Glory: The Card Game is of medium complexity and should take 20-30 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We are in the early XXth century, but the world is not as we know it. In 1895, exploring Amazonia, Auguste Copperpot discovered a gate to a lost valley, occupied by a primitive civilisation. Wiraqocha Valley was the name he gave to this remote Eden. This world enclosed a treasure that was going to revolutionize modern sciences, namely the Somnium, an orange luminescent crystal showing amazing properties. It can be used as fuel, affects matter and even time. Immediately, this virgin land became a new Eldorado for European colonists. Empress Victoria II decided to send several conglomerates to share this promised land and reap the fruits to her benefit. Zeppelin fleet, full of scientists, adventurers and looters, clouded the Atlantic sky.<br/><br/>Wiraqocha Valley is represented by an adjustable board consisting of 22 hexagonal tiles, each of them being identified by a number from 1 to 12, or a dice combo (pairs or straights). In his turn, each player rolls some six-sided dice, combining them to take possession of territories, or to protect from the opponents the ones he already owns. Every hexagon affords resources or special capacities, which are means to influence die results to fit one&rsquo;s strategy. There are three ways to win: bring back a huge cargo of Somnium to the Empress; acquire enough scientific knowledge to build the Leviathan, a terrifying weapon serving the Kingdom; or find in the temple depths the four relics that will allow you to reach Wiraqocha&rsquo;s treasure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Earth is in mortal danger!<br/><br/>Invaders is a card-driven board game of warfare and horror featuring asymmetrical game-play for two players. In the game, the players take on the roles of commanding forces on opposite sides of the conflict.<br/><br/>One player leads the extraterrestrial conquerors whose goal is to transform the Earth and subjugate its inhabitants. The Invaders possess unthinkable weapons and unknowable technologies. More so, within their galactic armada the aliens hold bound a terrifying array of eldritch creatures engineered specifically to sow the chaos and destruction that heralds the arrival of their masters.<br/><br/>The other player commands the unyielding forces of a united Earth. In the shadow of a planet-wide scourge, the nations of the Earth have joined forces to confront the arrival of a doom spawned on the other side of the galaxy. The Terran alliance is a desperation-forged bulwark upon which the invading forces crash and are repelled time and again. Outgunned, with salvaged or untested technology and one foot in the grave, the determined network of military machinery, elite strike-teams, warfare scientists, and neighborhood militias are surprisingly capable of bloodying the Invaders' noses whenever the two forces meet.<br/><br/>The eponymous Invaders seek to destroy the forces defending the Earth and exhaust their reserves. They do this by defeating the defending forces at key locations while also causing the Earth player to disrupt cards from their deck to their discard pile. The Invader must be cunning when deploying their creatures and war-machines, or enacting their schemes, as the cost to bring assets into the war often involves the discarding of other assets.<br/><br/>Mankind must work desperately to defend critical resources and locations from the corruption and incursion of the alien threat. They do this by building formidable and deadly defenses, predicting where the alien player will strike and setting traps designed to deprive the Invaders of key units and wear-down their options. Like the Invader, the humans need to be clever in what they deploy and how they deploy it because their heroes may be bold but they are small in number, and the Invaders are inexorable.<br/><br/>Invaders is a science-fiction game piled thick with the trappings of war and horror. It is steeped in difficult decisions, but built upon a simple, elegant set of rules, and because of this, you will find each game telling a slightly different story each time you play. Both sides use cards to represent their units, plans, resources and events, but as this is an asymmetrical battle game, the way in which those cards are played and how they forward their owner's goals are very different. Regardless, knowing when to let an asset go in favor of a better one, how to exploit a weakness in your enemy's ranks, and where to press an advantage or feint a trap will be key in seeing your side emerge as the victor from the morass of galactic war.<br/><br/>One question remains: Which side are YOU on?<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of each round, players have to work their way through their sliding puzzle controllers simultaneously, trying to create the sequence of actions they want their car to perform during the round.<br/><br/>Each symbol on the puzzle corresponds to one of the possible actions &mdash; but only the two middle rows of commands on your controllers will be applied, so there's room for maneuvers, but be quick! The first player to put down their controller will be the first to move their car during the round. Each player then executes the program they created, and the sooner you play during a round, the safer you are that your actions will actually play out as planned rather than crashing into unexpected obstacles...or other cars!<br/><br/>But trying to be quick might also increase your chances of making mistakes, and every time you take damage, you lose battery power, which will slow you down. But hey, mistakes happen, right? You can always recharge and be back in the race.<br/><br/>This is a fierce race, with pitfalls around every corner and unscrupulous adversaries!

        "description": "The world of horseracing has long been associated with cheating in all its forms.  But few games ever attempt to simulate that aspect.  Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die.  This would be rather boring if the game didn't allow for the players to bet on another player's horse, so the dilemma is whether or not to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win.  Even that could be boring, but then each player is issued cards that allow them to commit dirty tricks, for instance making a horse fall or forcing the winner to take a drug test.  All in all, it makes for some very interesting racing.<br/><br/>",

Felinia is a trading, collecting, and exploring board game that is modular and includes both a beginner and an advanced game.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Gold! Spices! Felinia is a mysterious continent, full of exotic riches! It&lsquo;s up to you to establish profitable trading posts, but beware: the competition is stiff.<br/>Alone or with a partner, hire a ship, fill its hulls full of refined merchandise, and set off to make yourself a fortune.<br/><br/>Felinia is extremely interactive. It mixes an original bidding system with clever movement rules. Felinia is fascinating and addictive, for players new to games as well as confirmed masters.<br/><br/>From the rule booklet:<br/><br/>In the City of Katzburg, merchants are all discussing the big news. The mayor, Henry-Cat, has signed a trade agreement with the newly-discovered continent of Felinia. In exchange for precious goods (rare books, fine wines, precision watches, luxury clothing, and refined glassware), the Kingdoms of Felinia have agreed to let them install trading posts.<br/><br/>Space is limited: You will have to act very quickly!<br/><br/>Four ships have been chartered by the City to visit the five countries on Felinia. To board them, you must have a specific combination of merchandise provided by the markets of the City and requested by the leaders of Felinia. This also means you will have to earn money to be able to afford those purchases.<br/><br/>The prices of the various merchandises are set by supply and demand, and can sometimes go very high! But it is the price you must pay to be on board one of the ships with hopes to establish a trading post on Felinia. Maybe you can collect gold and spices in the process!<br/><br/>Each player represents a Family of Merchants whose goal is to have the highest prosperity at the time the last ship leaves Katzburg.<br/><br/>Felinia is part three of &quot;The Gold Trilogy&quot; (besides The Golden City and Valdora)<br/><br/>",

More simulation of a Napoleonic battle rather than just a re-creation.<br/><br/>At Quatre-Bras, Wellington's army arrived at the last minute to counter Ney's advancing troops. At the end of the day, the Anglo-Allied outnumbered the French and were able to counter attack.<br/><br/>Several scenarios are available: Quatre-bras historical, Quatre-bras with variable reinforcements (what if D'Erlon or Uxbridge had arrived?), and two other what if scenarios: Ney's morning attack, Wellington already concentrated versus Ney<br/><br/>This game will link up with Ligny 1815: Last Eagles to provide a full campaign experience with interaction between both battles. Using hidden units with fog of war and variable reinforcements, the players will be as close as possible to the real life situation. Where are the French attacking? When exactly my reinforcements will arrive?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The death of king Charles II of Habsburg left the throne vacant and started a war all over Europe to settle the matter of the Spanish Succession. The Archduke Charles III of Austria, the Habsburg heir, was discarded by the last will of Charles II, signed almost on his deathbed, in favor of Phillip of Anjou, Louis XIV&rsquo;s grandson, the Bourbon heir. The Grand Alliance has been formed, by the Treaty of Den Haag, by Great Britain, the Dutch Republic, Austria, Portugal and Savoy to preserve Europe&rsquo;s balance of power and reclaim the throne for the Archduke Charles.<br/><br/>The players, representing the powers of the Grand Alliance, will fight the Bourbon forces composed by French, Castilian and Bavarian troops. Their goal, defined by a hidden agenda, is to obtain the best commercial and territorial concessions, and conquer the Bourbon territories. But this is no cooperative game: the winning player will need strategy and negotiation skills to achieve the best deals with the enemy and thus be the country with the most benefits thanks to the Peace of Utrecht.<br/><br/>In previous turn reverse order, each player decides how to play one of the seeded cards for the current turn. The players may pay from their resources to use the card&rsquo;s text or may prefer to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the card to execute one action. Each action is available only once for each turn and the players cannot execute the same action in two consecutive turns. The available actions are Recruit troops, Move them across the map or Attack the enemy in adjacent areas. Other choices include obtaining Resources or paying attention to their own countries Public Opinion (a.k.a. Will to Fight), for this will decide the order in which the new Concessions will be dealed. The card deck, composed by the most relevant battles, events and characters throughout the war, includes the exploits of the Bourbon armies to counter the player&rsquo;s actions.<br/><br/><br/>[Catal&agrave;]<br/><br/>Europa, 1702. La mort del rei Carles II d&rsquo;Habsburg ha deixat el tron desocupat i ha provocat una guerra per tot Europa per arranjar la q&uuml;esti&oacute; de la successi&oacute; espanyola. L&rsquo;arxiduc Carles III d&rsquo;&Agrave;ustria, l&rsquo;hereu de la casa Habsburg, ha estat descartat pel testament de Carles II, signat gaireb&eacute; al seu llit de mort i que afavoreix Felip d&rsquo;Anjou, n&eacute;t de Llu&iacute;s XIV, l&rsquo;hereu de la casa Borb&oacute;. S&rsquo;ha format la Gran Alian&ccedil;a, pel Tractat de la Haia signat per la Gran Bretanya, les Prov&iacute;ncies Unides dels Pa&iuml;sos Baixos, &Agrave;ustria, Portugal i Savoia per mantenir l&rsquo;equilibri de poder a Europa i reclamar el tron per a l&rsquo;arxiduc Carles.<br/><br/>Els jugadors representen els poders de la Gran Alian&ccedil;a i lluiten contra les forces borb&ograve;niques compostes per tropes franceses, castellanes i bavareses. El seu prop&ograve;sit, definit per uns objectius secrets, &eacute;s aconseguir les millors concessions territorials i comercials, i conquerir els territoris borb&ograve;nics.

Els jugadors poden pagar amb els seus recursos per activar l&rsquo;esdeveniment de la carta o poden &laquo;vendre&raquo; la carta per fer una acci&oacute;. Cada acci&oacute; est&agrave; disponible un sol cop per torn i els jugadors no poden fer la mateixa acci&oacute; en dos torns consecutius.

The everyday lives of the people rely on the alchemy factories that this first pioneer built.<br/><br/>In Ars Alchimia, you work at one of these factories. As an overseer belonging to the Academy, you take orders from the people, gather resources, and transmute them &mdash; but you need to be more efficient than your competition.<br/><br/>The game lasts four rounds, with each round representing a year. Each round, players take turns placing one or more of their workers on one action they want to do: gather resources, take up an order, employ an assistant, or transmute at the alchemy forges. The trick is that the more workers on one spot, the less effective an action becomes; if you want to place workers on a spot where there are already some, you'll have to exceed the number of workers already there.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The theme of this game is economic and cultural development in the Netherlands in the 17th century.<br/><br/>The game is played on a large game board of the Netherlands, divided into provinces. In addition, there are boxes for the East and the West Indies, and track round the edge of the board with the majority of spaces listing two of the ten provinces (in various combinations) that earn players varying amounts of income based on their influences in those provinces, or income spaces that earn players a flat income.<br/><br/>The aim of the players is to be the first player to earn 33 victory points, which are acquired through earning money to extend influence in the provinces, patronize artists, invest in businesses, establish colonies in the Indies, or obtain civic advancements.  These are represented by purchasing cards from one of six decks, with each deck having a special focus.  Investment cards provide cash payouts, with bigger payouts for collecting sets of different values (single cards are worth less than three-card sets).  Artists provide a potentially large source of victory points, but require multiple turns of patronage (i.e., cash) before they pay out.  Colonization cards provide ships, captains, and cannons to outfit expeditions to establish colonies which earn victory points and access to the higher-paying spice investment card deck.  Civics cards can provide governorships in the provinces (victory points and income), civic improvements (victory points), a special action that allows the holder to alter the normal rules for advancing a token on the board track.  There are cards that work with some of the other decks as well, in the civics deck (e.g., investments, expedition components, etc).<br/><br/>",

Beginning with the Russian invasions of Prussia and Galicia in August and ending after the Battle of Lodz in December, it recreates the ebb and flow of the huge forces sent marching across the Eastern Front in 1914.<br/><br/>The game features an innovative combat system which takes into account the magnitude of the forces involved in each individual combat and various factors such as amount and type of artillery present, flank attacks, and fieldworks, among other things. It also features a fluid Movement, Counter-Movement, Forced March movement system and Combat Effectiveness Level tracking system that requires formations to periodically rest and recuperate.<br/><br/>All the scenarios except the introductory scenario allow both sides to be simultaneously on the offensive and defensive on different parts of the battlefield. Additionally, armies that were on the offensive one game turn can quickly find themselves on the defensive a game turn later.<br/><br/>The game includes five scenarios: First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, Lublin, Battle for Galicia, Tannenberg Campaign and the Grand Campaign game.<br/><br/>A support magazine &quot;Dispatches 1914&quot; was published in 2012.<br/><br/>",

Grab the treasure and run.<br/><br/>Admit it. You love it.<br/><br/>This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...<br/><br/>And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOtherPart of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSequels:<br/>    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin<br/>    Munchkin Apocalypse<br/>    Munchkin Axe Cop<br/>    Munchkin Bites!<br/>    Munchkin Booty<br/>    Munchkin Conan<br/>    Munchkin Cthulhu<br/>    Munchkin Fu<br/>    Munchkin Impossible<br/>    Munchkin Legends<br/>    Munchkin Pathfinder<br/>    Munchkin Zombies<br/>    Star Munchkin<br/>    Super Munchkin<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRelated Board Games<br/>    Munchkin Quest<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOnline play<br/>     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>&quot;B-29 Superfortress is a solitaire game featuring the technologically most advanced bomber of the Second World War - the B-29 - flying as part of the Twentieth Air Force from the Marianas Islands against targets in and around Japan in late 1944 and 1945.<br/><br/>The game puts you in the cockpit of a B-29 Superfortress as you fly your missions over Japan. Your goal: successfully complete a tour of 35 missions and return home a hero for bringing the war with Japan to a close without a bloody hard-fought invasion of the homeland.<br/><br/>Your missions will be varied: high level, low level, day and night. You will face fighter attacks, flak, searchlight spotting, and bad weather; not to mention damage to your aircraft to include a shattered windshield and compromised cabin pressure, loss of oxygen supply, damaged landing gear, knocked out navigation or communication equipment, ruptured fuel tanks, inoperable machine gun armament, and just about anything else that can go wrong with a 100 ton aircraft flying 1,500 miles to its target only to be met with fierce resistance from a determined enemy.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Watch all the suspects carefully and find out which of them is the chief of spies using the clues that you and the other investigators uncover. Be the first to find the chief of spies and become the best hound dog!<br/><br/>In the game, each player receives a clue that reveals one out of five possible traits of the chief of spies. Each player keeps revealing cards, indicating whether each character is a suspect or not. As the game progresses, players gather more and more clues to lead them towards the chief of spies. This chief of spies will coincide with five out of five possible clues, and his aides will match four out of those five. Whoever accuses the chief of spies on time gets the most points. Players who accuse the aides will also earn some points, while the other players might not receive any points at all &mdash; or even negative rewards. The game includes two optional rules that add more strategy to the gameplay.<br/><br/>Checkpoint Charlie is set during the cold war, and the subject of detectives and spies is applied using cartoon-stylized dogs and cats.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a course built in our solar system, players are spaceship (powership) pilots. The pilots try to manouver their powership quickly, while rounding three space buoys and finally landing on the finish planet.<br/><br/>The modular board in Powerships consists of 16 tiles to build different solar system constellations. Altogether this board contains about 662 race hexagon spaces around the sun, with all solar system planets and several space dust hexagons in between.<br/><br/>The dice system, with 3-sided dice, simulates accelerating and decelerating. At the start of each turn, you have your dice showing your speed from your former turn. You may add or remove 1 die maximum. For the dice you keep from your former turn, you can choose which to roll and which to keep unchanged! Then, before moving your powership, you can turn it one side to the left or right in its hexagon space. Now, move it by the speed determined by the sum of the numbers on your dice.<br/><br/>Finding the best route for your powership is a challenge because space dust, planets, and the sun block your paths. Crashing into them makes you lose your speed and damages your powership, which limits your maximum number of dice. Other powerships might possibly occupy your desired space, though you can also use them as a bumper to reach a desired space.<br/><br/>Special spaces make your powership shift a space, turn to the left or right, double your speed, or make you move over/under obstacles.<br/><br/>",

You will have a choice between a swift and agile but fragile ship; a well-balanced ship, if you want to play it safe; and a heavy and slow but strong ship.<br/><br/>With our ship, we will try to become the most famous and well-known captain of all seven seas and get a place in history. How? We can transform our ship into a frightening man-o-war and loot boarded ships or into the fastest sailboat ever imagined. We will be able to trade in the market to get doubloons, grow our crew, improve our weapons and load capacity, enrol on a mission and get a reward, explore the ocean to search for treasures, fight against or with others, and above all acquire wealth. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s a sandbox board game, so you set the limits or the board does.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, we will make contact with other ships commanded by our friends (although we know in a board game is better not to rely on friendships). While exploring the map, we will start catching sight of other ships belonging to the different nations in the game. These are Spain, Holland, France, England, and pirates and corsairs. During the game, you will be able to decide if you want to side with any of these nations which will give you a variety of perks. However, nothing in this life comes for free and your acts might take you to make enemies of some other nations which will make their ships come after yours and try to sink you into the ocean.<br/><br/>Can you be a pirate and become another nation&rsquo;s ally? Of course! You will sign a letter of marque with that nation and you will become a corsair/pirate. This way you will be able to get up to mischief but you will be loyal to the other nation and leave their ships alone.<br/><br/>As the game moves forward, the sea and wind might not always be in your favour, a storm might surprise us. What if the wind stops all of the sudden or there is low tide? We will have to be ready to deal with our enemies as well as the ever-changing weather.<br/>This is just an overview of the game but, fear not! Once you purchase it, you will get an in-depth instruction manual. After finishing this &ldquo;captain&rsquo;s log&rdquo; and if you reach the required fame before the rest of the players, you will be crowned the most famous captain in the history of the Caribbean!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player, as either Ottoman Turks or Knights of St John, musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their path before the two armies clash in an epic siege over three fronts on the tiny island of Malta: Birgu, Senglea, and the doomed fortress of Saint Elmo.<br/><br/>Every beautiful card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, the game is non-collectable, and there is no deck building required. Each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins.<br/><br/>Note on title: When, after a relentless show of strength, the small fortress of St. Elmo's finally fell to the Turks they butchered the bodies of the Knights and floated the corpses across the bay to the remaining two forts to deter them from resisting further, lest they suffer the same fate. Instead, the Maltese forces chose to fight with 'the spirit of St. Elmo's'. When they eventually turned the tides against the Turks and chased them away the people of Malta chanted 'St. Elmo's Pay' - an expression they still use today to mean 'no mercy.'<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The explorer may then take an action (such as reveal an unrevealed tile, or move various revealed tiles to other locations).

        "description": "A fantasy miniatures game that is based on the same system as De Bellis Antiquitatis: Quick Play Wargame Rules with Army Lists for Ancient and Medieval Battles and De Bellis Multitudinis: Wargames Rules for Ancient and Medieval Battles – 3000 BC to 1500 AD. The first edition was published in 1991, with a much more clearly written second edition being published in 2002. The game consists of a single rulebook.<br/><br/>The player's miniatures are organized onto stands or 'elements', an army consisting of about 10-14 such elements. Troop types range from powerful Heroes, Magicians, and Dragons, through such things as Blades, Riders, and Spears and down to the humble Hordes of the game title.<br/><br/>Movement is alternate, with each player dicing for action points (PIPs) which allow them to move single elements or groups of elements, deploy certain element types and use magicians to be-spell enemy troops. Combat between elements is resolved by each player rolling a die and adding the element's combat factor. Highest score wins, with some elements automatically destroying others and most others being destroyed if their final score is half, or less, than that of the opponent.<br/><br/>The strength of the game is that there are no 'fixed' armies. With only a few restrictions (concerned with which elements can be generals and the proportion of 'powerful' troop types) you can construct your army any way you wish. This means you can create armies to represent those from any work of fantasy fiction, myth, legend, film, TV, anything else that your imagination desires. A large number of example army lists, from a variety of sources, are included in the rules book.<br/><br/>",

Each player secretly &quot;owns&quot; two of the twelve characters in the house, and each character starts in a different room of the house. On a turn, a player either moves any character that is alone in a room into an adjacent room or starts a fight in a room that contains at least two characters. Well, it's not much of a fight really, as the player removes one character from the room and places it in a line with other removed characters. Once a single character remains, the round ends. The first two characters removed are worth zero points, while the third through eleventh characters are worth 1-9 points; the character that remains in the house is worth ten points. Each player collects points only for his most valuable character.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>Integrates with<br/><br/>    Rumble in the Dungeon<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer/publisher:<br/><br/>A quarter of a billion years ago, an unknown catastrophe engulfs the Earth. The swamps and ice caps of the Permian are replaced by the blistering deserts of the Triassic. On both land and sea, 96% of the animal species die.<br/><br/>In the corner of Pangea that will be known as America, small survivors cautiously sniff the post-holocaust air at the dawn of the Mesozoic Era. Some of these unspecialized  quadrupeds have sloppy ever-replacing reptile teeth, these will be the dinosaurs. Others have sculpted &quot;one-shot&quot; teeth, these will be the mammals. The victor in this titanic  ecological struggle will determine the masters of the planet.<br/><br/>Clearly, the ruling reptiles triumphed since that day, 248 million years ago, and dominated for 170 million years. Only to be overthrown, in what must be the upset of the eon, by the  mammals. Yet the contest is not over.<br/><br/>American Megafauna pits dinosaurs against mammals in ancient America. The game is designed for two to four players, from  ages 9 to adult, or can be played solitaire. It recreates the titanic contest of these two types of prehistoric beasts from the  Triassic to the present.<br/><br/>This is a game of ecology, evolution, and DNA. Players start as one of four nondescript archetypes, but can branch out to new species from this basic type by bidding on genotype and DNA cards as they are revealed. For auction &quot;currency,&quot; players use  gene coins from a &quot;gene pool.&quot; DNA cards allow players to create strange animals, from cud-chewing crocodiles with antlers, to  saber-tooth meat-eating camels.<br/><br/>In the advanced version, the continent of Laurentia is occasionally flooded or glaciated; greenhouse levels change; and the three Milankovich cycles are handled by cards that occur with historical probabilities. Biome cards, including cicada prairies, mountains, ice sheets, and mangrove swamps, appear on the map in succession according to &quot;climax&quot; ratings.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    American Megafauna  (Second Edition): Expansion Set<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Bios: Megafauna<br/><br/><br/>",

You'd see cages being cleaned and souvenir stands being restocked. If you were lucky, you might catch an impromptu seal show or moonlight nightingale concert.<br/><br/>And if you stayed late enough, long after the last employee had left for the night, you just might see the greatest, and most secret, of all zoo attractions&mdash;the late-night Kung Fu fights!<br/><br/>Welcome to Kung Fu Zoo!<br/><br/>Kung Fu Zoo is a dice-flicking dexterity game for 2-4 players. You control a team of highly-trained animals, from crocodiles to zebras, in a Kung Fu battle against your rivals. Who will be tonight&rsquo;s champions of the zoo? Grab some dice and find out!<br/><br/>In Kung Fu Zoo, players use six-sided animal dice to do battle in an enclosed arena. There are two gameplay variants: Cage Battle and Points Match. In either variant, players start with a team of dice-animals. But the similarities stop there. In a Cage Battle, players take turns flicking their animals into the arena. Your goal is to knock your opponent&rsquo;s animals onto their backs (stunning them) or through holes on the board (the &ldquo;cages&rdquo;). You win the match when all of your opponent&rsquo;s animals are stunned or in cages. The first player to win three matches wins! In a Points Match, players take turns flicking their animals into the arena. Your goal is to score 21 points before your opponent. Points are awarded at the end of each round, based upon the position of your dice that are left on the board.<br/><br/>",

Adventures, new ports and powerful rituals are waiting for you. Sometimes pirates have to rely on the other pirates, but don't forget that you can get stabbed in the back anytime.<br/><br/>As the waves break on your ship, take a turn for the topsy-turvy motion of the ocean by rolling your ship dice &mdash; but remember that where they land on the board means as much as what you roll! Choose to remain an independent vagabond, or maybe cut a deal with a Governor to become all official-like in your pirating ways. Consult with a shaman to curse the other pirates or pay a visit to the cartographer to find a map with some hidden treasure.<br/><br/>In the game, the turn begins with players choosing the character card whose action they want to play &mdash; because each character has its own ability to help you get rich quickly &mdash; and places it facedown in front of them. When everyone has chosen their character cards, the first player announces the characters one by one. When you hear your character, you reveal your character card and play your adventure, curse, or port card, and everyone gets involved in a new adventure, which usually ends with a grandiose sea battles, or some curse, or finding a new port.<br/><br/>The pirate with the most booty wins the day, but a pirate's life isn't always on the up and up.

You must complete both a Doomsday Machine and an Escape Plan, with higher level Doomsday Machines and Escape Plans garnering more victory points, and you need to do it quickly. Scotland Yard is getting suspicious, after all, so you have to do what you need to do in 15 turns. Players can earn additional victory points for fitting in with society, eccentricity, security and inventions.<br/><br/>Play time is approximately 25-30 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The old king is dying without an heir, and the country is in turmoil. Four lords have come to the capital city, each claiming to be the king's rightful successor. Now the lords are vying for control of the city, for they know that who ever wins the city will win the throne. You and your opponents are playing the feudal lords, trying to secure your claims by surrounding the most important locations in the capital (such as the palace, the royal library, and the wizard's tower) with shops, barracks, and other city districts under your control. Watch where you place your districts, however, because your opponents may build their neighborhoods over yours, or worse - send the dragon to burn your territory down. King's Gate is a tense game about tile-laying and destruction.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Interceptor Ace: Daylight Air Defense Over Germany, 1943-44 is a solitaire, tactical level game which places you in command of a German fighter during World War II. Each turn consists of several days, during which a combat mission will be flown from one of many bases in Europe, attempting to intercept incoming American Bombers. Interceptor Ace is based on the popular, action-packed Nightfighter Ace game system by Gregory M. Smith with a strong narrative around the pilot as you look to increase your prestige, earn skills, and rise in rank through promotion and receive awards.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to conduct numerous sorties in the role of a German interceptor pilot and rack up kills. Pilots may use the experience gained to improve their odds of success by purchasing skills. As their prestige increases, they may request a transfer to other fighter bases in an attempt to get &ldquo;closer to the action&rdquo; or request a newer type of fighter. Awards and ace status help to narrate the player&rsquo;s eventual goal &ndash; to become the top &ldquo;Viermot&rdquo; killer of the war.<br/><br/>The system is packed with rich technical detail but without the complexity to capture the key historical facets of the day bombing campaign over Germany. In terms of fighters alone, there are 30 aircraft models available to pilot. The families of fighters include:<br/><br/>        Bf109 (11 aircraft)<br/>        Bf110 (4 aircraft)<br/>        Me410 (2 aircraft)<br/>        Fw190 (13 aircraft)<br/><br/><br/>For each interceptor, you will be using the date of availability, speed, area of operations based on originating base, individual weapon systems, damage, and crew status.<br/><br/>Fighters can be assigned to one of seven possible major geographic base &ldquo;groups&rdquo; as follows:<br/><br/>        Dutch: Woensdrecht, Schiphol, Deelen, Wevelgem<br/>        Bremen: Husum, Jever, Oldenburg, Hildesheim<br/>        French: St. Brieuc, Poix, Vannes-Meucon, Evreax<br/>        Ruhr: Jever, M&ouml;nchen-Gladbach<br/>        Munich: Neubiberg<br/>        Műnster: M&uuml;nster-Handorf, Bad Lippspringe, Rheine<br/>        Frankfurt: Ansbach, Wertheim<br/><br/><br/>Besides the focus on hardware, the soft aspects of the war are also faithfully rendered for each pilot and crew. For example, air crew is characterized by various, including numerous Pilot skills, Wingman skills, Bordschuetze (Rear Gunner) skills, and Prestige Level. The emphasis on various skills and benefits to gaining experience creates even a stronger narrative when compared to the Hunters game system, which helps weave a tense and dramatic narrative during play. One major change in Interceptor Ace over Hunters is the ability to choose your crew improvements instead of randomly rolling for them. As these greatly impact on your combat capability (and survival), it is a major decision you must make. Another major change in the system is the wingman concept, who can possibly pull you out of a bad situation if he is still flying.<br/><br/>Game play moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once you have your initial pilot and crew along with your nightfighter assignment, play proceeds by checking for incoming raid information while checking for weather prior to take off. Following successful take off, play proceeds by flying to the area you expect to intercept the American. As location boxes are entered, you will roll for possible intercept in which combat may ensue. Combat may consist of numerous rounds after which returning to base and landing operations occurs, with the weather playing a factor again as part of the landing procedure. When the mission is completed, you will ascertain any awards, Prestige points, or Experience points gained prior to you next sortie. Here you can also spend Prestige and Experience points if desired to gain skills, request a new fighter, or request a change of base. You will repeat this process by going to your next sortie until shot down and killed, or until February 1944 should you make it through unscathed.<br/><br/>This game is highly accessible to those familiar with The Hunters, Silent Victory, or Nightfighter Ace and designed by Gregory M. Smith. The game system lends itself very well to capturing the tense air defense over Germany. While Interceptor Ace is designed as a solitaire gaming experience, additional options for play are provided for both multi-player cooperative and competitive gaming sessions.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>    Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>    Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10<br/>    Time Scale: 3-4 days per Turn<br/>    Map Scale: Abstract<br/>    Unit Scale: individual aircraft, individual weapon systems, individual electronic systems, specific crew members, and ammo rounds<br/>    Players: one (with option for two or more)<br/>    Playing Time: two to three hours<br/><br/>Components:<br/>    One Countersheet of 9/16&Prime; unit-counters<br/>    Fifteen Aircraft Display Mats 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime; (double-sided, 30 total)<br/>    Four Player Aid Cards 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>    One Combat Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>    Two Bomber Target Mats 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>    One Pilot Awards Display Mat 8.5&Prime; x 11&Prime;<br/>    One Air Operations Display Mat 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo;<br/>    Eight Ace Pilot Cards<br/>    Sixty Combat Cards<br/>    Rules Booklet featuring extensive Historical Background<br/>    One Logsheet 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;<br/>    Two 6-sided, one 10-sided, and one 20-sided die<br/>    Box and Lid<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Liberals strive for social progress, including repeal of the Corn Laws to help feed the working classes, expansion of the electorate to create a real democracy, and Home Rule for Ireland. Conservatives want to slow the pace of change, while advancing their own agenda to maintain order, protect traditional values, and secure the Empire. Her Majesty occasionally interferes in politics, but it&rsquo;s the Prime Minister who really governs the country and sets the political agenda. Ten different Prime Ministers served during Victoria&rsquo;s reign, with varying degrees of success. Now it&rsquo;s your turn to experience Victorian political life, taking on the role of a historical politician. Will you make your mark as a Backbencher? Stir up trouble as a wily Opposition Leader? Or successfully govern the world&rsquo;s greatest empire as Prime Minister?<br/><br/>In Prime Minister, 1 to 4 players vie for political power and prestige by campaigning for public support, selecting and debating bills, pursuing official appointments, recruiting influential Victorians as supporters, garnering favor with the Queen, and, when the time is right, challenging other players for their leadership roles. Gameplay is partly cooperative with shifting alliances, but only one player can win by holding the Prime Minister&rsquo;s seat at the game&rsquo;s end.<br/><br/>In addition to the standard multiplayer game, Prime Minister includes a dozen scenarios of varying length and a &ldquo;Clockwork&quot; system featuring automated opponents for solitaire play.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Luther criticized the selling of indulgences and stated that the Catholic doctrine of the merits of the saints had no foundation in the gospel. The &quot;Protestants&quot; soon incorporated doctrinal changes such as Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone) and Sola Fide (faith alone). These changes turned out to be not only theological, but also influential in the Reformation in other ways: the rise of nationalism, the Western Schism that eroded people's faith in the Papacy, the perceived corruption of the Roman Curia, the impact of humanism, and the new learning of the Renaissance that questioned much of traditional thought. The Roman Catholic church responded with a counter-reformation initiated by the Council of Trent.<br/><br/>In the two-player game Sola Fide: The Reformation, by the renowned design team of Jason Mathews and Christian Leonhard, players attempt to install Reformation in the Holy Roman Empire or try to prevent it, battling the Holy Roman Empire's Imperial Circles.<br/><br/>",

Napoleon's battle near Moscow; September 5th to the 7th, 1812.  Serried ranks of French and Russians clash on a narrow field where more than 1000 guns thunder and tear asunder man and beast. It was the single bloodiest day of battle up until WWI.<br/><br/>The scale is 100 meters per hex. 100 men per infantry strength point, 50 men per cavalry strength point and 2 to 4 guns per strength point for artillery.  It has 4 maps and over 1400 counters.<br/><br/>This edition uses a new, simplified and faster playing set of La Bataille rules called Le Reglement des Marie-Louises (named for the French conscripts of 1814 who, in turn, were named for Napoleon's Empress; mother of his son).  The game is also fully compatible with the advanced La Bataille rules called Le Reglement de l'An XXX.<br/><br/>",

Deceive your opponents as an agent secretly working for a European power, recruiting key assets, buying off politicians, and instigating sabotage against foreign capitals. However, you will need the reluctant (or unwitting) support of your opponents to position your homeland for European domination, so tread carefully and do not reveal your true identity.<br/><br/>Game Overview:<br/>At the start of the game, you receive an Alignment Token, which tells you which one of the competing European nations you secretly work for.<br/><br/>The rest of the game unfolds over the course of 14 rounds, with each player (spy) performing 3 Actions per round. These actions include moving around the map, acquiring resources in the form of Supply Tokens, improving your abilities by recruiting Assets, manipulating the otherwise-random Politicians to your advantage, or even directly harassing opposing spies.<br/><br/>But any action you take will directly affect at least one Nation, in the form of gains or losses in Influence points. Your mission during the game is to generate Influence for your own Nation, while at the same time preventing your opponents&rsquo; Nations from gaining too much&mdash;if you can deduce which Nations they are!<br/><br/>Influence is tallied and compared during Scoring Phases, which take place at set intervals throughout the game. In a Scoring Phase, each Nation receives Power points based on how much Influence it has accumulated so far.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players reveal their Alignment Tokens, and the player whose Nation has the most Power is the winner.<br/><br/>",

One player controls the French forces, and the other player controls the Viet Minh forces.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1954, General Giap shocked the world by doing what had previously been considered impossible&mdash;defeating a Western occupying force. Storm Over Dien Bien Phu simulates the climactic moment when the isolated French forces (composed of French legionnaires and elite paratrooper units), and crumbled under the unrelenting pressure of the Chinese&ndash;backed Viet Minh forces.<br/><br/>Using the Area Move system redefined in Storm Over Stalingrad, the game features the use of cards to augment game play, adding to the tension experienced by both sides. The rules are similar in length to those seen in Storm Over Stalingrad, and are of the same level of complexity, with additions made for the situations encountered in this battle.<br/><br/>Additional rules added to the game include sapping, assaulting, and the French supply situation. In addition to these new rules, new cards have been created in order to represent events encountered during the battle. These include &ldquo;Detonate Mine Shaft&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rats of the Nam Yum&rdquo;, &ldquo;Giap Demands Success&rdquo;, &ldquo;Propaganda&rdquo;, &ldquo;D&eacute;bouchez &agrave; Z&eacute;ro!&rdquo;, and &ldquo;B-26 Bombers&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 week<br/>Map: Area<br/>Unit: Infantry Platoons/Companies<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheet<br/>One and a half countersheets (264 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 12 page Game Rulebook<br/>Card deck with 55 full-color cards<br/>Four six-sided dice<br/><br/>Complexity - Low<br/>Solitaire suitability - Low<br/>Playing time - Up to 3 hours<br/><br/>Designer: Nick Richardson<br/>Developer: Brian Youse<br/>Game Artwork: Nicolas Eskubi<br/><br/>",

With multiple sets, even more players can participate in the same game.<br/><br/>Each player has an identical set of 12 tiles displaying part of a network of computer cables. A further set is shuffled and placed face down in the centre of a 3x3 grid, representing the nine rooms through which the cabling will flow. Four markers are placed around the edge of the grid and these represent the only points at which the cabling can leave the grid. The top card of the centre pile is turned over and players have to re-arrange their own tiles in front of them to form a valid network, using the same centre tile as displayed and connecting up the four &ldquo;perimeter&rdquo; markers. First one to complete a valid network wins the centre tile (1 VP). He then rearranges the perimeter markers if he wishes and turns over the next card to be played for.<br/><br/>The updated edition, Turbo Taxi, features city streets rather than computer cables. The markers on the edge of the grid are a yellow taxi, yellow house, black taxi and black house. Players must ensure that their tiles create valid routes leading the yellow taxi to the yellow house, and black taxi to the black house.<br/><br/>This game can also be played solo as you try to complete a grid in the least amount of time.<br/><br/>The contents of Turbo Taxi is:<br/><br/>1 rulebook (the number may vary for multilanguage editions)<br/>1 city board<br/><br/>60 cardboard tiles:<br/><br/>     12 green player<br/>     12 yellow player<br/>     12 blue player<br/>     12 orange player<br/>     12 neutral (with a medal in its back)<br/><br/><br/>4 wooden pawns<br/><br/>     2 black pawns<br/>     2 yellow pawns<br/><br/><br/>",

A race through space during which they demonstrate their spaceship-controlling skills and problem-solving abilities. This race is not linear, and spaceships can pass checkpoints on the planets and comet in any order. Once a ship lands, the player claims the appropriate planet/comet token; the earlier you arrive, the more victory points (VPs) that token is worth. Each game turn is divided into four phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Events: The active player chooses one of three available events, which then affects all players. Events won't necessarily affect everyone the same way, though, depending on where they are in space and what they're doing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Orders: All players present their movement orders simultaneously using a direction rose with six possible directions. Each turn, a player can place up to three units of fuel in any of those six directions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Flying: Each ship flies one cell for each unit of fuel spent on movement in a particular direction; if a player fueled multiple directions, the ship moves in all directions fueled. Fuel units are not removed after each turn &ndash; there's no friction in space, right? &ndash; so each turn allows a captain to further increase speed (by adding fuel to units already in place) or slow down his ship (by accelerating in the opposite direction).<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Planet Movement: The active player moves all planets, then passes the active player token to the player on his right.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when someone returns to Earth after visiting all but one planet. Players receive VPs for their landing tokens and completed missions, and whoever has the most VPs wins!<br/><br/>",

The players play one to four characters from the Iron Kingdoms universe as they try to weed out a nefarious evil that has been lurking in the Undercity of Corvis.<br/><br/>All players will be playing on the same team and the game requires no game master. The players work together defeating enemies, achieving objectives, and gaining experience that can be used to give new skills to their characters that can be used in subsequent adventures in the campaign.<br/><br/>The game will come with almost 40 different miniatures with 16 different sculpts. The four heroes are Milo Boggs (the alchemist), Canice Gormleigh (the gun mage), Gardek Stonebrow (a trollkin warrior), and Pog (a gobber mechanic) that controls a light warjack named Doorstop.<br/><br/>Each character has a starting stat sheet, but players can purchase character ability cards with XP gained from the adventure to enhance and customize their characters.<br/><br/>Combat is based on rolling dice against opposing attributes. Players will be able to use feats and abilities to give boosts to these dice rolls, similar in many ways to other games based in the Iron Kingdoms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thunder at the Crossroads: The Battle of Gettysburg July 1-3, 1863<br/><br/>(from the back of the box:)<br/><br/>On the evening of July 1st. 1863, George Gordon Meade mounted his horse for the short ride north to the small Pennsylvania town of Gettysburg. Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.<br/><br/>Turning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities. For the North. it was the beginning of the march which would eventually win the war.<br/><br/>David Powell has completely revised his earlier Thunder at the Crossroads. New scenarios allow more in-depth looks at particular actions of the battle (with smaller map and play times, too). Revised unit and leader ratings allow full integration with the Second Edition Series Rules. Graphics has been upgraded to the latest series standards.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 30 minutes<br/>Hex: 200 yards <br/>Units: Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets<br/>Two countersheets (560 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 32 page Civil War Brigade Series rules booklet<br/>Two 20 page game exclusive rule booklets<br/>Two dice<br/><br/>Playing Time: 18 Hour Plus<br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>",

Inside each box, an apprentice will find a succession scroll. Contained on the scroll is the last piece of knowledge required to become the Drago Magi &mdash; but only one can claim the title. Each scroll holds a different &quot;Spell of Succession&quot; that may be executed only with the correct combination of rare gems. These magically imbued gems appear in sets of three only during times of succession and must be collected by dragons at the command of each apprentice. The competitor who is first to collect the gems needed to complete his Spell of Succession becomes the new Drago Magi. For the loser, the unofficial title whispered under the breath of the people is &quot;Novitius Eterna&quot; or &quot;Forever a Novice&quot;.<br/><br/>Be swift and remember, there is little room for error.<br/><br/>Draco Magi is a card game designed by Richard Launius and Robert Burke. To start, each player selects an apprentice dragon mage he wishes to play. Each mage receives a deck of dragon cards that includes multiple copies of four different chromatic dragons (Green, Red, Black &amp; Purple), four different metallic dragons (Gold, Silver, Brass &amp; Bronze), and two special dragon cards (the Battle dragon and the Polar dragon). Each dragon has a different strength, weakness and special ability. Players will send their dragons, one at a time, to capture gems on different battlefields; each battlefield offers a different effect that may give an advantage or disadvantage to certain types of dragons.<br/><br/>Players alternate playing dragon cards on battlefields until they have played all eight of their Dragon cards. Each player can play a maximum of three dragons on a single battlefield. When a dragon is placed, it may make a ranged attack. Not all dragons have a ranged attack breath weapon, but those that do have a breath weapon icon with a number. The number indicates the number of battle cards the player may reveal when attempting to hit with a ranged attack. A defender may defend with the number of cards equal to the dragon's shield value. A ranged attack can take place immediately only when the card is played against an opposing dragon. If a ranged attack is not used at this moment, the ranged attack is forfeited for the current round.<br/><br/>After all dragon cards have been played, the melee phase of the battle begins. Each dragon has a &quot;melee attack&quot; value printed on its card which represents the number of battle cards the player can draw for the battle. The melee battle mechanism is a unique attack and counter system that provides opportunity for deduction, subtlety, and deadly combos. Players will also earn advance battle cards that build up their decks over the course of the game. The player with the most dragons present on a battlefield wins that gem. In the case of a tie, the dragons and gem remain for the next round.<br/><br/>Draco Magi is a fast game heavily connected to its theme that incorporates area control, bluffing, hand management, deck building and deduction.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All those carrots look so tempting that you might just snatch them &ndash; but what if the wolves have been expecting exactly that, a greedy rabbit just like you? You never know...<br/><br/>In Om Nom Nom, during the game you will roll dice, which will represent various kinds of prey. By clever play of your hunter cards, you will try to eat the prey and thus gain victory points. At the end of the game the winner will be the player with the most points.<br/><br/>The game consists of 3 rounds. Each round is divided into 4 phases &ndash; roll, play, score and cleanup. During the &quot;Roll&quot; phase one of the players rolls all the dice. After rolling the dice are arranged on the game boards. During the &quot;Play&quot; phase all players will play all 6 of their predator cards one by one. When everyone has selected their first card, they are revealed simultaneously. This is where the action happens. Did You manage to guess what everyone else will play? Were You the only one brave enough to sneak Your mouse after the cheese? Or did You like everyone else play the wolf, because no rabbit surely could resist that amount of carrots. During this phase, players resolve all their played cards by capturing dice and cards of other players. During the &quot;Score&quot; phase players score points for captured cards and dice. And during the &quot;Cleanup&quot;, when all 6 cards have been played, players gather all their cards back in hand and a new round can begin. At the end of the third round, player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GMT's fifth epic game in its award-winning series of east front games, Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov. This is a two-player, or two-team, operational level game depicting the battles of the southern wing of the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union during 1941. This game picks up where an earlier game in this series, Barbarossa: Army Group South, left off. It begins in mid-August and ends in December 1941, historically near the cities Kharkov and Rostov.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/><br/>     Three 22 x 34 inch maps<br/>     One 24 x 34 inch map<br/>     1120 counters<br/>     Series rule book plus a scenarios book<br/>     Various player aid cards for charts and tables<br/>     Set up cards for each scenario<br/><br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>This comprehensive game system was designed at a scale for divisions but it accommodates the many independent brigades, regiments, and special battalions that were also available for this campaign. These include units for rocket artillery, heavy artillery, armored trains, assault guns, engineers, Stukas, Sturmoviks, anti-aircraft guns, NKVD, Stormtroopers, militia, base units, and more. You can tailor your army to fight a lengthy campaign over variable conditions.<br/><br/>Despite its size we have kept the overall rules within the context of other games in this series thereby leaving nearly all mechanics familiar to veteran East Front Series (EFS) players. Such familiar mechanics include ranged artillery, air units for close support or interdiction, Soviet HQs, retreat or stand orders, weather, reaction movement, railroad movement, strategic movement, overruns, combined arms, fortifications, special supply situations, and more. Veteran players should be able to pick up game play right away. For those who are new to the series, many examples of play will be found in the rules book as well as a Learning scenario to fully illustrate game play and some of the decision making for each battle.<br/><br/>Note that all games of the Barbarossa, or EFS, series are built to fit together. If space is at a premium for you, please note that four of the eight scenarios here in this game alone require only one map or less.<br/><br/>Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov challenges you to balance your attack and defense in each sector of the game map, regardless of scenario. Neither side has sufficient resources in either troops or supplies so the key to winning will be good game play and a sound plan. Can you do better than the titans that struggled for the Ukraine in the summer and fall of 1941?<br/><br/>THE SCENARIOS<br/><br/><br/>     Learning Scenario: Rostov Redeemed. The German 3rd Motorized Corps has just taken Rostov and now attempts to hold it against a massive Soviet counteroffensive. This was the first in what turned out to be a series of disasters that befell the German army during the winter of 1941/42.<br/>     Kiev Pocket. In mid-August the Germans had just cleared the Uman Pocket (the last battle of the Barbarossa: Army Group South game in this series) and looked to exploit their advantage to quickly conquer the rest of the Ukraine. Meanwhile, the Soviets had built a whole new group of armies to the east of the Dnepr River. This campaign resulted in the greatest encirclement battle of the war, perhaps of all time, as the Soviets over-committed to the defense of the river. Yet this was not a sure victory. Play testers have called this scenario the best yet in the entire series of games. You simply must experience this battle, one of the decisive battles of the war in the east.<br/>     Battle on the Sea of Azov. In late September with disaster looming to the north and a German offensive building against the Crimea, the relatively untouched Soviet 9 and 18 Armies in the southern portion of the Dnepr Bend were called upon to act, this time to save their comrades defending the Crimea by striking toward the rear of the German 11th Army. While their attack made but small headway, some Romanian defenders were overwhelmed. The situation could have opened up to destroy the German rear and then threaten the rear of the rest of German Army Group South. Perhaps this offensive could as well reverse the tide of the German advance. Or was someone in the Kremlin just dreaming?<br/>     Battle of Sumy. Some small battles lend themselves wonderfully to focus treatment and this battle at the end of September near the north Ukrainian town of Sumy certainly qualifies. Handled on its own special map this becomes a contest of mobility between a German motorized corps on the one hand and a strong Soviet cavalry corps on the other, with the Soviets getting timely reinforcements from the 1 Guards Motorized Rifle Division. This very balanced situation plays quickly and perhaps is the best introduction in the series to the game system.<br/>     To Kharkov. It has become almost trite to say Russia is vast but for this scenario the German player will declare this many times. Even though the German has just won the Kiev Pocket Battle, now the great industrial city of Kharkov beckons in the distant east. The Soviets have reassembled their armed forces yet again but this time the German has sent his panzers north to Moscow and out of this game (see GMT's Typhoon! Game). German 6th Army, a true hard-luck formation, gets the honor of leading the advance and they now experience their first starvation of the war, similar to that they will suffer at Stalingrad a year later, although without the desperation of that later battle. Even so, the 6th Army is formidable; so will the arrival of mud be the only thing saving the Soviet's behind? Or, will he have finally mastered the art of war against the Nazis?<br/>     To Rostov. The most dramatic moment of the late drive to the east was the drive to Rostov, the gateway to the Caucasus where lay the oilfields the Germans so vitally needed to run their war machine. The Germans have won victory after victory for nearly six months even though the Soviets have set successive armies in their path. Is this perhaps the Soviet last ditch and their last army? Are the Germans truly at the end of their supply line? Will winter stop the Germans? Historically in this near even contest, the panzers actually got into the streets of Rostov; can you?<br/>     Kiev to Rostov. This is the full campaign, mid-August through December, a very full 57 turns over vast distances. The Germans begin in supply difficulty and will have to pick a pause to advance their main bases. The Soviet player will have to take care he does not expend all his effort too far to the west, thereby leaving nothing for the final battles. Neither player has resources to do it all but it can be fun trying. The East Front experience is not complete without playing this full-size scenario. <br/><br/><br/>",

Now there is only sand, and the only hope is in the humidity.<br/><br/>Travelers cross the desert that stretches from the slopes of the Akaishi Mountains to the cliffs of Seaclaw. Half-ruined ancient cities are home to the last human communities struggling to survive by foraging for what little green remains standing. These desert travelers transport goods on the backs of their caterpillars. Although their only goal is to make as much money as they can, at the same time and in a more or less deliberate way, they are helping to bring life back to the desert by carrying small plants from the artificial greenhouses of the cities to the most remote corners of this ocean of sand.<br/><br/>Designed by Ariel Di Costanzo and Javier Pelizzari and illustrated by Ernest Sala, Sand is a game with a main mechanism of pick-up-and-deliver that can be enjoyed alone or in groups of up to four players in games of about 120 minutes long. Players have to earn as much gold as possible after six rounds (five in a four-player game) to win.<br/><br/>In Sand, players put themselves in the shoes of these intrepid desert travelers who travel the paths of the board and visit the different towns. They collect goods to take them to other places and thus earn gold for the transport service. They cross the dunes on the backs of their faithful caterpillars, which, cared for, will grow and help players complete their tasks more effectively. Along the way they will be joined by helpful companions and be entrusted with missions that, if completed, will bring good benefits at the end of the journey. Help the plants take root again, and perhaps there is still some hope for this desolate place...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the movie-making game Hollywood, each player is a studio boss who tries to produce the most successful blockbuster. Players construct movies from game cards that they draft or purchase. Players compete to get the most popular stars to perform in their movies because this brings them more money and more Hollywood Awards (which are pictured on some cards).<br/><br/>First, players take turns choosing cards with the aid of drafting. Second, players purchase additional star cards (the strongest cards in the game) at the auction. Third, each player uses his nine cards in hand to make one or several movies. A movie must have a minimum of three cards: a Script, a Director and an Actor (or Actress). Additional cast members are optional, but they add to a movie's total box office. Quality films bring a large amount of profit to the player.<br/><br/>Players go through three production years, then after the third year Hollywood Awards bring extra money to the players, and the richest player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Storm Above the Reich&quot; is a solitaire wargame depicting a Luftwaffe squadron of Fw190s struggling to deter and destroy the relentless daylight raids over Germany during World War Two. The player&rsquo;s individual aircraft, each represented by a stickered block, must confront the mighty &ldquo;combat box&rdquo; formation of the United States Army Air Force, a deadly terrain of B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. Like its counterpart, Skies Above the Reich, the game is a broad strokes depiction that presents the arc of the desperate air war. Stretching from late 1942 to early 1945, Storm Above the Reich follows that trajectory in a series of missions strung together to make a campaign. Each mission will take a half hour or more to play, while a campaign can last anywhere between 6 to 60 missions.<br/><br/>Stand-Alone and an Expansion: &quot;Storm Above the Reich&quot; is a stand-alone game; you don&rsquo;t need &quot;Skies Above the Reich&quot; to play. However, it can also serve as an expansion for that game. Storm uses the same rules as Skies, and components in one game transfer seamlessly to the other. Combined, Storm and Skies present eight formation maps, six pursuit maps, B-17s and B-24s. In Storm, you get an oversized staffel of 18 Fw190s, with the option of augmenting it into a Sturmbocke staffel. In Skies, you get a staffel of Bf109s, and with the games combined, the staffels can also be combined.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This one uses the sort of colored marker pens you can wipe off with a damp cloth after the game. The game goes through phases; initially you draw tracks and earn money for linking cities. When a number of cities are joined, you start racing, the cities being chosen randomly. The races are simple dice-rollers and the 1st &amp; 2nd place get prize money. After a couple of races, you draw some more tracks, then race some more and so on.<br/><br/>The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.<br/><br/>The board has a UK map on one side and a US map on the other, both giving amusing challenges, and the game has good repeat value. The designer David Watts has published a lot of stand alone Railway Rivals maps, and there is another edition of this game, Dampfross published by Laurin.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Dampfross<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Over all of Spain, the sky is clear.&quot;<br/><br/>On July 17, 1936, this phrase was broadcast throughout Spain, signaling the beginning of the Spanish Civil War, one of the bloodiest civil wars of the modern era, and what could be considered the beginning of World War II. Within a day, one third of Spain was under the control of Nationalist forces attempting to stage a military coup. Over the next three years, what began as a military rebellion evolved into the physical battle lines of the much larger ideological conflict spreading across Europe between Fascism and Communism.<br/><br/>Popular Front recreates this conflict in 90-minute strategy game form, leading players to compete against their ideological counterparts not only for military positioning, but for political victory. Players must be concerned about the position of their forces on the board, but the composition of a player's hand will affect their success in combat more often than not. Plays with two, four, or six players split into two teams. Players each have an identical 20-card deck (with unique, original propaganda posters actually used in the war) that results in the use of your cards being more important than the luck of the draw. Strategic thinking, trickery, teamwork, and a dash of courage are what lead to victory in Popular Front.<br/><br/>",

Together the players try to solve the issues faced by the young republic -- wars, debt, financial panics, the growth of the Union, north-south division, and more. Every four years the most popular politicians from each party square off to see who becomes the next president.<br/><br/>Somewhat similar to The Republic of Rome, but with many modifications to suit the topic, including a completely different way of resolving elections and a more nuanced treatment of Issue cards (rather than simply Wars), plus novelties such as the Public Support Track, spendable Influence, political parties, more offices, tax cards, counterfactual events and an ever-expanding map of the United States.<br/><br/>If diplomacy is not your cup of tea, a variant printed in the rules removes all requirements to negotiate and makes it a matter of cardplay, drafting and utilization of resources.<br/><br/>Living rules available: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/founding-fathers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/founding-fathers</a>:-green-edition<br/><br/>",

This is done by each player, in turn, offering two cards from their hand. The opposing player takes one of the two for his/her pyramid, leaving the other for the first player to put on their pyramid. Cards already on a pyramid can be covered once (after that they are covered by a jaguar stone), an action that triggers movement along the jungle path (scoring track). Certain steps on the path also contain events that can alter construction of the pyramids. The person who completes their pyramid first gets extra steps along the path. The round ends when a player has completed his pyramid, has only one or zero cards left in hand or when either player cannot legally play a card. After each round the top card of the draw deck is revealed - if the number on the card is lower than the position of the explorer that won the last round than that explorer has won, if not another round is played.<br/><br/>Die Pyramiden des Jaguar is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "M.U.L.E. was first published as a computer game in 1983. Inspired by board games, it became a breakthrough, then a classic. Now this warm-hearted game of cut-throat capitalism is finally available as a board game!<br/><br/>In M.U.L.E. The Board Game, you are one of the pioneering and industrious species of a Galactic Federation. Together with your fellow colonists, you attempt to settle the distant Planet Irata with the so-called help of a mule-like machine you all learn to hate. But for now, he's all you've got. Well, him and your fellow colonists. I wouldn't count on their help, though &mdash; not unless there's profit. Good luck. You'll need it.<br/><br/>In M.U.L.E. (abbreviated from &ldquo;Multiple Use Labor Element&rdquo;), players claim plots of land and install mechanical robots (M.U.L.E.s) to work on them. M.U.L.E.s produce goods that colonists can use, sell for profit, or stockpile for (hopefully) even more profit:<br/>- Smithore is a metal that cannot be used by players directly, but can be sold to The Store. The Store uses Smithore to manufacture M.U.L.E.s. Since players need M.U.L.E.s to produce their Goods, they must sell Smithore to increase their production.<br/>- Crystite is a luxury mineral with a highly volatile price. It is not needed for anything on Planet Irata, but can be exported to other worlds for great profits (unless stolen by Pirates &ndash; you have been warned!)<br/>- Food is needed by players to take Development Actions, such as Assaying Lands or Installing/Refitting M.U.L.E.s.<br/>- Energy is needed to power M.U.L.E.s. You'll know the value of Energy when you lack it.<br/><br/>There will be unexpected surpluses and shortages of different goods, causing market prices to fluctuate. Players must plan ahead while maintaining flexibility to change their plans as all kinds of &rdquo;fun&rdquo; planetary disasters hit them. Interaction between colonists is highly opportunistic: they will gladly help you if there's profit in it for them. Or maybe not. You'll get to see the true colors of your friends by playing M.U.L.E. with them. The most cunning settler and trader receives fame, fortune, and the honorary title of First Founder! There is also an overall Colony Retirement score, describing how your colony succeeded (or failed) as a whole.<br/><br/>",

The gentlemen of the Reform Club have made a bet on his failure, since they don&rsquo;t believe this eccentric dandy could ever succeed! However, the most troubling part of this story is the strange coincidence between the rash departure of Phileas Fogg, accompanied by his loyal valet Passepartout, and the theft of 50,000 pounds from the Bank of England!<br/><br/>The first lady or gentleman to return to London wins the game. However, since you left the British capital suspected of stealing from Her Majesty&rsquo;s bank, you will have to return to London without any Rumor cards and 10&pound; or less in your pocket (or rather, in your hand) in order to prove your innocence in the eyes of the world! Players will quickly discover that moving too fast drains their wallet just as fast. To win, you will have to alternate between cautious and ambitious advances, waiting for the right moment to return to the city!<br/><br/>Around the World in 80 Days is a beautiful and modern reimplementation of the first ever Spiel des Jahres winner (the most prestigious Game of the Year award in 1979), thematically revisited around the timeless and beloved novel of the same name by Jules Verne.<br/><br/>",

As secret agents working for different organizations, players scour the globe seeking information that will help them find the location of a hidden explosive device. Agents must trade information and sell secrets in order to learn the location of the device and grab it before it falls into the hands of another agency! On a player's turn, you must choose one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Share Info: Trade one card from your hand with one card from any other agent. The target agent must trade and may not look at the card she is being given before handing over her card to the active agent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Hack the Cache: Trade one card from your hand with one card in the cache. The card from your hand becomes a part of the cache and should be face up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Sell Secrets: Reveal two cards from your hand to another agent, who must then answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to reveal whether or not she has a card equal to the sum of those cards. If she says &quot;yes&quot;, she must hand a card of that value to the active agent in exchange for one of the cards shown. The active agent chooses which card to hand over.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a turn, after performing a regular action, the active agent may choose to Grab The Drop: Place two cards from your hand face up next to the card in the middle of the table. Then, secretly look at the card in the middle to determine whether this card is equal to the sum of the two face-up cards. If you guessed correctly, you win the round; if you're wrong, you're out of the round. (In a three- or four-player game, if an agent is eliminated, she must place her cards face up in front of her. Other agents may trade with an eliminated agent's cards by placing the card traded from their hand face up in place of the card they take.) The first player to win three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Dead Drop includes three sets of cards with different artwork (Spies, Monsters, and Kids). Dead Drop Deluxe features the same gameplay as Dead Drop, but it includes eight decks of cards instead of three, each illustrated by a different artist with a different theme.

If a player has discarded all their cards, the remaining players count the points in their hand. When a player reaches the agreed maximum score, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>If you can't or don't want to play a card, you draw one from the deck. There are four colors with numbers from 1 to 9. You can either play color on color or number on number. Sounds boring so far, doesn't it? Well, that's why we have the special cards. For example, have someone draw four cards from the deck, or give a fellow player two cards out of your hand. And the fun part: You always get to choose who gets these cards!<br/><br/>But wait, there's more: We come to the black cards, also numbered from 1 to 9. You can play these only on a number, not on the same color, and every time a black card is played, it activates an event card. These event cards go from Friday, the Thirteenth &mdash; where nothing happens &ndash; to Tornado, where all hand cards get shuffled together and handed out again.<br/><br/>",

The Pope and the Empire, the two universal powers that dominated the previous centuries, were breaking apart. Science and technology were beginning to flourish again. Society was rapidly changing, as cities revived and gained autonomy while the feudal system was starting to crumble. <br/>In Medioevo Universale, you have to lead one of the great kingdoms of those times, while taking control of trade, diplomacy, infrastructure development, scientific progress, and military strategy. Build forts and fortifications, bring war to your enemies, conquer new lands, discover new technologies, expand your commerce, repel the barbarians on the frontiers, recruit armies and fleets, forge alliances, and defeat your opponents in battle!<br/><br/>Medioevo Universale is a game full of components (more than 1700!) with many aspects to manage, deep interactions with other players, and the ability to give you an immersive experience in the medieval era.<br/><br/>In addition of the normal game rules, the box contains also the original prototype rulebook of Nicola Iannone and the elements to play his experimental game version.<br/><br/>",

Direct each plane in multiple fighter and bomber squadrons to lead attacks on the enemy&rsquo;s carriers and island bases. No dice, no rulers, only dozens of planes and ships! A fast-paced and streamlined game mechanic that plunges you in the heart of the battle. Move each plane individually on a hex grid. When you maneuver to get an enemy plane in your sights, it must try to dodge or else take damage. Some planes can use torpedoes and bombs to destroy ships and ground installations. Stay in formation to keep the initiative and dominate your opponent. Each plane has its own attributes in terms of speed, armor, and special abilities. Each piece is illustrated as close as possible to its historical model to maximize your immersion!<br/><br/>The Fighters of the Pacific series includes a CORE GAME, and TWO EXPANSIONS. The CORE GAME contains everything you need to play hours of battle over the Pacific Ocean: a huge modular board, 4 aircraft carriers, 4 destroyers, 94 aircraft tokens, 91 game tokens and 8 reference cards. The complete rules and 10 scenarios are also included of course. The carrier and aircraft tokens represent the forces of 4 real aircraft carriers fighting in 1942, with a ratio of 1 token to 3 aircraft. For the Japanese, the AKAGI and KAGA form the 1st aircraft division that participated in the attack of Pearl Harbor and the battle of Midway. For the Americans, the USS HORNET and USS YORKTOWN were participating in the Doolittle Raid and the Battle of Midway too.<br/><br/>The first expansion, Battle of Midway contains enough tokens to complete the base game to have all the forces present in this battle, including the aircraft at the base on Midway Island. This includes 3 new American aircraft models, the old F2A Buffalo fighter, the B-26 Mitchell bomber that launched the very first counterattack on the Japanese forces, and some brand new TBF Avengers. Most importantly, this expansion includes 5 scenarios to relive one of the most unpredictable and decisive battles of the war as if you were there. The tokens are laid down, the story is in your hands!<br/><br/>One month before the Battle of Midway, the first ever naval air battle took place. It is known as the Battle of the Coral Sea. Relive this battle with this expansion pack that provides 3 new Japanese aircraft carriers, the SHOKAKU, ZUIKAKU and SHOHO, the USS LEXINGTON forces and 4 exciting scenarios. Will you manage to save the SHOHO and the USS LEXINGTON?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are multiple difficulty levels and separate modes for solo and 2-player games.<br/><br/>Smitten was inspired by comic book cards from Jamey's youth, specifically a set where various cards formed a cohesive 9-card panorama image. In trying to complete two of these images in Smitten, there is no set turn order; rather, players indicate a preference to play or not play a card. The played card has instructions for the other player to place a card, which they must do or the game instantly ends.<br/><br/>Smitten is packaged inside a paper envelope; it's an entirely plastic-free, eco-friendly product.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For example, Ladybohn: Manche m&ouml;gen's heiss! still has six &quot;Gartenbohnen&quot;, but now four of the cards are male, one is female, and one is a baby; there are 21 &quot;Blauen Bohnen&quot;, 11 of which are male, with five females and five babies.  As with the original Ladybohn expansion, the female beans have better beanometers than the male beans, so if you harvest a field with a lady on top, you'll likely receive more coins. The new babies have no beanometer, so harvesting a field topped by a baby is worthless; when a baby is planted in a field, however, a female bean in the field can move two cards toward the top of the stack, which means the babies can bring the superior females where they are needed most.<br/><br/>In English, Ladybohn: Manche m&ouml;gen's heiss! is included in the standalone expansion Bohnanza: Ladies &amp; Gangsters.<br/><br/>",

Illusions of Glory takes this game system to a new and exciting level by applying its focus to the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>The Allied Powers bring massive forces to bear against Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey while trying to prevent a game-changing revolution in Russia.  The Central Powers must defeat Russia, hold off Italy, and win the upper hand in the Balkans or face demoralization and rebellion at home.  Players test their generalship and strategic abilities as Illusions of Glory lets you recreate the dramatic events of World War I&rsquo;s Eastern Front.<br/><br/>Your hand of strategy cards present you with a rich array of strategic and operational choices.  You must decide whether to use each card for its historic event, unit movement, combat, or troop replacements. You must commit your forces to a variety of objectives: winning the dynamic war of maneuver between German-led and Russian armies; seizing the Balkans and its vital objectives; or prevailing in the conflict between Austria-Hungary and Italy.<br/><br/>Illusions of Glory offers complete campaigns and shorter playing scenarios.<br/><br/>GAME SCENARIOS:<br/>    Campaign Game<br/>    Mobilization<br/>    Limited War<br/>    Total War<br/>    Italian Front Mini Game<br/><br/>GAME SCALE:<br/>    Historical Duration:  1914 to 1918<br/>    Units:  Corps and Divisions<br/>    Time:  Three months per turn<br/>    Map:  Point to Point<br/>    Players: 2-4<br/><br/>",

The first player to create a stack of six or more pieces &mdash; with their own color on top &mdash; wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "North Africa &lsquo;41 covers the campaign in North Africa from Rommel&rsquo;s first offensive in late March 1941 through the end of December 1941. During that period Rommel&rsquo;s forces dashed across Cyrenaica and made it to the Egyptian frontier. However, he was not able to take the critical port of Tobruk defended by the stubborn Australians. With superior tanks, combined arms doctrine, and 88mm Flak guns (used as anti-tank weapons) the Axis forces successfully fought off two counterattacks from the east&mdash;the Allied operations called Brevity and Battleaxe. Later in the year, before Rommel could make his planned assault against Tobruk, the Allies launched Operation Crusader and drove the Axis forces back to their original starting positions at El Agheila.<br/><br/>North Africa &rsquo;41 allows players to study the campaign and refight it with their own strategies. The game includes a detailed map of the Western Desert and a meticulously researched order of battle.<br/><br/>The game uses the simple Move-Fight-Supply game system developed in Normandy &rsquo;44 and Holland &rsquo;44.

Adding together your skill levels in each of these areas with the dice you have assigned gives you a total number of points in each of these areas to spend, for example if you have a Movement skill of 3 and assign a 4 dice to it, you would have 7 Movement points to spend that turn.<br/><br/>After each room, you may upgrade one of your four skills - Movement, Attack, Defense, and Range.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The Mongol War Machine in the 13th Century&quot; - Volume X in the Great Battles of History Series (GBoH).<br/><br/><br/>(from GMT Games website:)<br/><br/>The Great Battles of History series is back with Devil's Horsemen, an examination of the military tactics of steppe tribe warfare, as immortalized by the mighty armies of Genghis Khan and the Mongols. The game focuses on cavalry and archery action, featuring mounted archers of exceptional skill. Devil's Horsemen depicts the four major battles of the era - The Indus, The Kalka, Liegnitz and Ayn Jalut.<br/><br/>Devil's Horsemen features basic rules for both regular and SimpleGBoH play. The rules bring the system into full flower of mounted archery, with a detailed, augmented set of archery and cavalry mechanics that include various types of Shower Fire (as opposed to plain Volley Fire), Impetuosity and Aggression, Feigned Retreat, Harass and Disperse tactics, and Rally to Standards, with the various armies and units being rated for their ability to use these.<br/><br/>Devil's Horsemen presens a truly colorful array of armies for you to lead into battle: there are 10 full tumen (divisions) of Mongols, plus Polovtsians, Galicians, Chernigovians, Kievans, Persian Khwarazmians, Poles, Silesians, Bohemians, the great Teutonic Knights, and the first army to ever significantly defeat the Mongols, The Mamluks.<br/><br/>These mighty armies show up in four great battles of the period (ranging from battles needing 1/2 mapsheet to two full-mapsheets).<br/><br/>The Indus (Genghis Khan vs. Shah Jalal ad-Din and the Khwarazmian Persians, 1221). One mapsheet in size, this is the battle that gave The Mongols control over all of Central Asia.<br/>     <br/>The Kalka (Prince Subudei vs. the combined Armies of Rus, 1223). Two mapsheets in size, this battle includes two massive (and very nattily dressed) armies, with the Rus suffering under fractured command, and the Mongols giving us a foretaste of the famous Zulu horns of the buffalo tactics.<br/>     <br/>Liegnitz (Prices Baidan and Kaidan vs. Henry the Pious and an army of Eastern Europeans, 1241). A 1/2 mapsheet battle which introduced Europe to the Mongols, and from which we get the famous Christian prayer of the era, From the Fury of the Tartars, oh Lord, Deliver Us. But you do get to use the best European heavy cavalry of the day, the Teutonic knights, under fearsome commander, Poppo.<br/>     <br/>Ayn Jalut (Prince Ketbugha vs. The Mamluks, 1260). A 1/2 mapsheet battle that saw the first real defeat of a Mongol Army, this time by the new Middle East Muslim power, the Mamluks. Granted, this was a second-rate, rear-guard group of Mongols, but the Mamluks showed they were a new force to reckon with.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/>979 full-color counters<br/>Two full-color double-sided 22x34&quot; mapsheets<br/>Rules Book<br/>Scenario Book<br/>One Player Aid Card<br/>One 10-sided die<br/><br/>DESIGNERS: Mark Herman and Richard Berg<br/>ART DIRECTOR/PACKAGE DESIGN: Rodger B.

        "description": "Beyond the Rhine: The Campaign for Northwest Europe, September 1944 - April 1945, begins with the German Army reeling from a string of near-fatal defeats, and in full retreat to the safety of the West Wall where it hopes to make a stand. The Allies, flush with victory, believe one more push will bring them home for Christmas.<br/><br/>The expected walk-over was not to be, and players will find either army a challenge to command. Allied material superiority is (mostly) balanced by German tenacity, rugged terrain, and lousy weather. Defensive-minded players will be happiest playing the Germans, but players of all temperaments will discover that there is still plenty of torque left in the Axis even at this late stage of the war. The Allies will not cross the Rhine without a tough fight!<br/><br/>Beyond the Rhine is a big game, with 3.5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. At this scale the various Western Front battles&mdash;Market-Garden, H&uuml;rtgen, Bulge, Nordwind, Remagen, etc.&mdash;have an operational ebb and flow, but can also be viewed in relation to the whole front. A comprehensive game like this one, covering the entire Western Front, was long overdue.<br/><br/>Special rules in this 14th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this fascinating campaign. They include:<br/><br/>Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning DAK. These cover things like Fuel Shortages, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, Lost Couriers, Railway Strikes, and Dambuster Raids. The 58 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.<br/>The importance and difficulty of the Rhine crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and pontoons to be emplaced.<br/>Background effects of Allied air interdiction are simple and elegant (built into the Terrain Effects Chart and Weather), but the player does have the option to switch some of these planes to normal barrages and sweeps.<br/>The strategic significance of the Ruhr and the Saar, of clearing the left bank of the Rhine, and of major ports such as Antwerp are reflected by simple economic effects and the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;Broadfront&rdquo; restrictions on US supply placement and usage.<br/>The Wacht am Rhein counter-offensive is recreated by simple mechanics for off-map buildup and operational surprise.<br/>Many options are included for players wanting even more realism. For instance, there are rules for German Kampfgruppen and extra restrictions on the plethora of Allied independent units.<br/>Beyond the Rhine features three monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,000 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including a 9-turn Bulge game played on a special map (otherwise, portions of all four maps would be needed).<br/><br/>Grand Campaign: 4 maps, 70 turns<br/>Fall of &lsquo;44 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 26 turns<br/>Fall of &lsquo;44 (Bradley): 2 maps, 26 turns<br/>Operation Queen: 1 map, 9 turns<br/>Bulge Campaign: 4 maps, 40 turns<br/>A Time for Trumpets: 1 map, 9 turns<br/>Nordwind: 1 map, 13 turns<br/>Endkampf Campaign: 4 maps, 24 turns<br/>Spring of &lsquo;45 (Montgomery): 2 maps, 24 turns<br/>Spring of &lsquo;45 (Bradley): 2 maps, 24 turns.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 Week<br/>Hex: 3.5 miles / 5.6 Km <br/>Units: Company to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Five 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets<br/>Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 48 page OCS rules booklet<br/>One 64 page Beyond the Rhine game rules booklet<br/>Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders<br/>Two 8 page Beyond the Rhine Charts &amp; Tables folders (one each for Allied &amp; Axis)<br/>Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>",

Some orders are easy, like the Cowabunga. One Cow Meat, one Bun. Some are a little harder, like the Chickabunga Conga: same as a Chickabunga (Bird Meat plus Bun), plus Fries and a Drink. Sound easy? Now try your hand at a Lord of the Fries, a Meat Munch, or the infamous Patriarch (Fish Meat, Cheese, Bun, Fries, Drink, and the oft-maligned Strawberry Pie).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crime Zoom is a series of investigation game for 1 or more players which plays in about an hour.<br/><br/>Each investigation tells a different story, but almost always begins with a crime scene.<br/><br/>This crime scene is spread over several cards to form a great illustration. To investigate, simply flip a card to take a closer look. An item intrigues you? Flip the card over and find out what the little piece of paper on the bedside table is.<br/><br/>An address? You can now take the card that corresponds to this track. Unless another element on the crime scene appeals you even more?<br/><br/>In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss among players to choose the tracks to follow. When you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty? What is their motive? What is the murder weapon? And some follow-up questions, of course.<br/><br/>Make sure to identify the culprit, otherwise you will lose the game. But if you answer the questions correctly, the number of cards you do not reveal will determine your score.<br/><br/>The solution will answer each of the questions. The epilogue will tell the whole story or a testimony history to understand the plot that has been played.<br/><br/>Crime Zoom: His Last Card is the first case in the Crime Zoom series. It takes place in Brooklyn in 1980.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The battlefield consists of six lanes, each with three sectors, radiating out from the tower. On these lanes, the orcish hordes will try to charge all the way towards the tower. Your job is to defeat them before they can reach you.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each game round players draw a fate card, which will determine which category of creatures will advance one sector towards the tower and sometimes implement a nasty rule change for that particular game round. There are three categories of orcs which differ in strength and special abilities that are conveyed to a player once an orc is defeated.<br/><br/>The game ends when you run out of orcs on one of the four lanes. During the final scoring, players count up their defeated orcs and multiply them by the number on the creature counter, get points for each support spell learned and subtract points for each poison card in their deck. Whoever has the most points will be declared &quot;Master Mage&quot;!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your day job fiercely competes for every bit of free time and patience with the demands of family life and the lure of hobbies. The consequences of wild nightlife, sloth and other sins are barely balanced by the occasional burst of sport activity and more-or-less random jabs at a healthy lifestyle.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? No, we are not talking about your life, but about what you are up against in Infarkt (&quot;Heart Attack&quot;), a party game in which you want to be the last one left at the party &ndash; literally.<br/><br/>Each player has an individual player board on which she'll track her blood pressure, depression, lung health, weight and so on. Everyone starts out as healthy as possible, with some money ($1) in the pocket, too. Each round, a number of event cards equal to one more than the number of players is revealed. In turn, each player will choose an event card and suffer the effects of that card, moving her health indicators as needed. Did you run out of gas? Or have a bout of diarrhea? Man, life sucks.<br/><br/>Players then simultaneously deploy three action markers to indicate where they plan to go that day: the supermarket, the office, a pharmacy, a flea market, the gym, and so on. In turn order, players then execute all three of their actions in whatever order they desire. Maybe you'll hit the office to earn money, but at the cost of having your depression grow more intense. A trip to the supermarket will let you buy food, which you can then eat later at home or give to your neighbors who come to the party you throw. Force them to eat cake and get fat! If you have extra money on hand, you might want to visit the pharmacy to buy drugs; you never know what the pharmacist will give you, but if you don't like it (or the food you've acquired), you can hit the flea market to swap food and drugs &ndash; and maybe pick up some change in the bargain.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, you check your health levels to see whether your body is deteriorating without you even knowing. Get too depressed, for example, and the depression only gets worse; high blood pressure can affect your blood cholesterol level, and vice versa. If a health indicator rises to the tombstone at the top of the column, you've partied your last and are now out of the game. (Everyone else has to chip in for the funeral, suffering depression if they can't afford to pony up for a decent burial for a good friend like you.) The last player alive in the game wins and dances on the graves of everyone else!<br/><br/>",

Each player's path is unique &mdash; and only you know the way. However, you cannot traverse the forest alone. Your teammates are needed to open the sealed portals along each step. Give clever clues, hope your teammates can read your mind, and complete your journey!<br/><br/>To complete the journey, each player takes a turn providing clues about which portal is their next step. Each step can have up to five different portals, but only one is the correct one, so players give clues that relate (hopefully) to the correct next step.<br/><br/>The challenge is that the only clues available are cards that have been dealt, so sometimes the clues may not relate to the next portal of a journey, which means you have to get creative. This is where you need to try to read the minds of your teammates. For example, the next portal on your journey could be the word &quot;anteater&quot;, and your clues are limited to cards you are dealt, like scary, or tall, or handsome. Which would you choose as your clue?<br/><br/>The game takes place in five rounds.

As a commitment to this alliance, the world&rsquo;s first airborne city, named Skyward, is to be built above the intersecting borders of the four realms. Tasked with building this new city, you and other cultural luminaries vie for control by becoming the Warden, and ultimately declared &ldquo;Founder of Skyward&rdquo;.<br/><br/>In Skyward, the Warden deals cards from the central deck and splits them into piles however they see fit. Each player chooses a pile, providing them with buildings and resources. However, being the Warden is a double edged sword. While you wield the power of the split, everyone else gets to choose first, leaving you with the remaining pile.<br/><br/>Skyward is played over several rounds. Each round starts with The Split, followed by individual player turns. The goal of the game is to launch a combination of buildings that yield the most Victory Points. The end game is triggered when any player launches their 6th building or the central deck is emptied. Complete the current round as you would normally, then complete one final split. The player with the most Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Northern Italy, 14 June, 1800: The out-manoeuvred Austrian army attacked the French under Bonaparte, took them by surprise and defeated them quickly in the morning fight. Thinking that the battle was over, they pursued the retreating French. However, when General Desaix arrived with reinforcements in the late afternoon, the French started a defiant counterattack and turned the Battle of Marengo into a glorious triumph.<br/><br/>This game recreates that dramatic battle. One player takes the role of Bonaparte whose troops are scattered at the beginning, while the other attacks with the Austrians. He has to defeat the French, before they can strike back with their reinforcements. Triomphe &agrave; Marengo is fast playing. Departing from almost all wargame conventions, it brings the look of the 19th century linear warfare onto the table.<br/><br/>Based on the award winning Bonaparte at Marengo and improving it in many aspects, Triomphe &agrave; Marengo offers a unique game experience: The redesigned map gives you wide open spaces for clever manoeuvres; the modified combat system is full of drama; and the novel locale-based morale system is nothing but thrill and tension. Since fights are resolved without dice, it's not Dame Fortune who will decide defeat or victory.<br/><br/>",

Map cards are placed in the middle of the table. Around these map cards, players place action cards, with them consulting one another to decide the best choice to make from those available: draw a card, turn over a card, discard, etc. Urgent cards, which should be read entirely before doing anything else, can change the game in an instant. Object cards are placed in front of players and can be useful throughout the game. The game includes a tutorial to accompany the first game, and its simple and original playing system allows you to explore the scenario several times before discovering all of the game's secrets.<br/><br/>In Cartaventura: Oklahoma, it's 1854 in the United States. Your name is Bass Reeves, and you are about to turn twenty-three years old. Born a slave, the son and grandson of slaves, you spent your early years working your fingers to the bone in cotton and sugarcane fields. One day soon, you know you'll escape and then...whatever happens, happens! Will you find the Indian camp? Will you become a Marshall? Can you win the poker game? Can you escape your former master? Can you find your way to freedom?<br/><br/>You play Oklahoma by flipping over the story cards, building out the map, and making decisions that will impact the ending you receive! The game is simple to play and will lead you through the game mechanics as you move through the story.<br/><br/>",

Special units such as airmobile, airborne, and amphibious troops, with their abilities to outflank a line, become even more important.<br/>Another important feature is the tangled web of Balkan politics, Romania is the least reliable of the Pact countries, and its participation is half-hearted at best. A second scenario allows for its total neutrality, forcing the Soviets to reinforce their armies and invade before taking on NATO. Greece and Turkey are uneasy allies, and rules allow for Greek withdrawal from NATO. And Albania is completely unpredictable.<br/><br/>Additional rules allow Southern Front to be combined with The Third World War: Battle for Germany; players can reinforce one front with forces from the other, requiring a host of new decisions on the strategic level. One or two new divisions or air units sent to the Balkans can turn the tide there, but at what cost to the main front, where every unit is desperately needed ?<br/><br/>",

A fully cooperative, campaign-driven, miniatures board game, Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay tells the story of 5 heroes from the Wanderer's Guild, and their struggle to free the small fishing town of Barnacle Bay from the slimy claws of Elder Bane. Driven mad by power, and physically twisted from dark magic, Elder Bane has created a cult of mutated townsfolk that only desire to spread their message of madness to the rest of the world, bending it to their whim along the way.<br/><br/>In Wander: The Cult of Barnacle Bay, players will select one of five unique heroes, outfit their hero with starting gear (represented by mini cards on a player dashboard), and join their friends to take back Barnacle Bay. Defeating foes and surviving random encounters earns players experience points and loot. Loot, like weapons and armor, is a persistent upgrade, staying with the heroes as they continue on their adventure. Experience points are used to level up heroes during their current adventure in the campaign. A dual-facing upgrade tree allows players to continually try new combinations of skills each adventure to determine what fits their play style, or current set of foes, best.<br/><br/>Using a modular board, players assemble maps as indicated in the campaign book, then use action points to move or attack with their hero.<br/><br/>All enemies in the game are controlled by a simple line of sight A.I., and automatically hit the players' heroes once they're able to. This means there is no player rolling for success for enemies' attacks. Heroes will, however, be able to roll for defense in an effort to prevent incoming wounds. One set of custom dice determines a hero's success for both defending and attacking. Random encounter cards, which are revealed when players enter an  unexplored &quot;darkness&quot; space, also promise that no campaign adventure is ever be the same.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On a turn, the active player voices his suspicions in the form of a sentence &ndash; &quot;I suspect ....... of having been seen at ....... at around ....... hundred in possession of .......&quot; &ndash; filling in the blanks with one of the eight possibilities in each category. All players then secretly note whether or not they hold the evidence card for one of the four things named by placing a verdict card inside a folder. The active player shuffles these folders to disguise who answered in which ways, then reveals them. If all four items guessed were false, then you cover those four guesses on the game board with Holmes' business cards; otherwise players mentally note how many of the items were correct and try to decipher which ones those might be.<br/><br/>Players then participate in a deduction round in which each player can:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a deduction token on a clue.<br/>    Say &quot;I pass&quot;.<br/>    Attempt an accusation.<br/><br/><br/>If all players pass successively, the round ends and the next player in clockwise order then voices a suspicion. Otherwise a player can pass, then place a deduction token or attempt an accusation later in the same round.<br/><br/>Each player has nine deduction tokens in his color, three each of 0, 1 and 2. To place a token, you place it face-down on the clue of your choice to the right of any tokens already present; if any of those tokens are face-down, you reveal those tokens. At most four tokens can be placed on a clue.<br/><br/>To attempt an accusation, you say, &quot;I accuse (suspect) of having been been seen at (place) at around (time) in possession of (object)&quot;, then all players submit their verdict cards the same way they normally do. If all of them are positive, you've solved the case &ndash; but not necessarily won the game. All tokens on incorrect clues and all tokens belonging to players who made a false accusation are removed, then players tally the numbers on their tokens, scoring bonus points if they have a token on each piece of evidence, or if they made a correct suspicion or accusation. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>With three or five players, you decrease (increase) the number of evidence cards handed out at the start of the game and the number of tokens that can be placed on a clue.<br/><br/>",

You are a member of a rescue team sent to aid them, but as you investigate the site, you encounter something terrible that seeks to destroy your team from within...<br/><br/>You'll need intuition, nerves of steel, and clever acting if you're going to survive and win the game. Who will believe you? Who is whom, and who is what? You can't trust anyone and no one will trust you, so block the doors, quarantine a suspect, reveal your identity to your &quot;allies&quot;, grab a flamethrower, or run away &mdash; but look carefully where you will end up because &quot;The Thing&quot; might be closer than you think...<br/><br/>In Stay Away!, 4-12 players try to track down &quot;The Thing&quot;, a creature  awakened from a nauseating eternal slumber on the emerged R'lyeh island that has the capability of possessing the human body, cloning it, then taking its place, so as you play you won't know who &quot;The Thing&quot; is or when someone will become &quot;The Thing&quot; or who is infected or not. The archaeologists are looking for The Thing; their goal is to work together to identify which player is The Thing and roast it with a &quot;Flamethrower&quot; card. You remain Human until The Thing passes an &quot;Infected!&quot; card to you during a card exchange, at which point you become an Infected and take on that new Role: You are now an ally of The Thing and must take care that its identity is not revealed.<br/><br/>",

You are the absolute best there ever has been, a necromancer at the top of their game. The only downside is that no one likes you on account of the creeping around with dead bodies and the lack of sunlight. But who needs friends when you can make them?<br/><br/>Dead Man's Cabal is a mid-weight strategy game from Daniel Newman, with game development from Jonathan Gilmour (Dead of Winter, Dinosaur Island). In the game, 2-4 players compete to bring the dead back to life so that they can throw a party with actual, you know, guests.<br/><br/>The gameplay is a clever interplay of a unique action selection mechanism that allows players to choose both a private action followed by a group action, requiring tense decision-making on the timing of the different phases of the game. Collect bodies, crystal skulls, and runes, then bring the dead back to life. This might sound simple enough, but triggering the actions in just the right order requires careful planning to make sure you aren't helping your competitors more than yourself.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Vehicles, especially tanks, also clatter onto the battlefield to take on pesky infantry and, of course, each other. M4A1 Shermans, M5A1 Stuarts, Fireflies, and Cromwells square off against Panzer IIIs and IVs as well as the big cats: Panthers and Tigers.<br/><br/>Heroes of Normandy has 30 scenarios and tell the battles of the men from the 101st Airborne, 82nd Airborne, British 6th Airborne, 17th SS Panzergrenadier, 6th Fallschirmjager, 91st Airlanding, and 352nd Infantry Divisions.

Each round the tiles are shuffled in the bag and dropped onto the table. The face up symbols show the spoils of today's hunt.  <br/> The tiles are then divided by a unique mechanic: When it is your turn, you may either A) Take any number of tiles from the pool, or B) Claim that another player has been too greedy, taking all of that player's tiles, but returning at least one tile to the pool (you must of course show yourself to be a little less greedy).<br/><br/>The next player without tiles then follows in turn. This way the size of the pool will gradually increase, and the round is over once the last player without tiles decides to take what's left in the pool. Every player will then have a share of tiles, and a scoring phase follows.<br/><br/>Tactical play will help you get the meat, fur, tusks, animals, and tools you want (each tile has a different way of scoring), but you may also play cards for immediate effects or to secretly influence the scoring.<br/><br/>- Game material is language independent -<br/><br/>",

Players use their Advanced Skills, Top Secret Spy Gear, and Allies as they traverse exotic locations in order to locate Dr. Lobo and his Henchmen. A simple dice mechanic is utilized to resolve encounters.<br/><br/>Our Epic Edition takes Agents of SMERSH to a whole new level by focusing on the most Epic part of the game - The Story - while giving the graphic design a fresh upgrade and streamlining some of the older mechanics to provide a more focused, engaging experience. For example, where you travel to on the world map now provides you with different bonuses and upgrades amongst the many hundreds of unique encounters. Instead of collecting Intel just to win the game, you now collect it to locate and encounter Dr. Lobo&rsquo;s Henchmen, and eventually Dr. Lobo himself. Henchmen and Dr. Lobo have their own individual &ldquo;Choose your Own Adventure-like&rdquo; stories and encounters. Defeat one or all of the Henchmen first and you&rsquo;ll gain an advantage against Dr. Lobo in the End Game.<br/><br/>Did you defeat Dr. Lobo? Are you sure? In the Epic Edition of SMERSH, there may be more than one Dr. Lobo. So it seems . . . something strange is going on in the world.<br/><br/>The Story Briefing:<br/><br/>The Director of the United Nations Intelligence Committee has contacted you through a secure channel. He tells you that hundreds of Secret Government Spies worldwide have been disappearing and turning up dead. Only the best of the best, the elite of the elite are still alive: YOU are one of those Spies. He&rsquo;s putting together a global inter-agency cooperating task force, and he needs your help to prevent more death and to stop the world&rsquo;s most infamous evil mastermind, Dr. Lobo. Reports say that Lobo has put together his own force, a force for evil and death called &ldquo;SMERSH&rdquo; with objectives not only to bring &ldquo;Death to all Spies&rdquo; but ultimately to take over the world using his most influential and powerful henchmen.<br/><br/>Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to work together with our other allied spies to bring down Lobo&rsquo;s henchmen and force them to lead you to Lobo himself. Once you find Lobo, take him down by any means necessary. &quot;I will do whatever I can to help from here in the UN, all of our resources, tech, spy gear, and Intel are yours for the taking. We have other agents out in the field, in hiding now, perhaps to meet you on your encounters in the field. Do your best to stay alive, and bring down Lobo and his Henchmen as soon as possible. Good Luck.&quot; - The Director<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Down In Flames is our tactical air combat card game. It was first released back in the mid 1990&rsquo;s and was again released as a computer game through Battlefront in 2004. Brian Marrs did all the programming for the computer game.<br/><br/>Down In Flames places each player in the cockpit of a Leader and Wingman as they enter combat against other aircraft. By playing cards, you gain advantageous positions on your targets, fire your guns, and send them down in flames!<br/><br/>The game is based on a unique action-reaction card mechanic. Each card can be countered by specific other cards. At the bottom of every card is the list of cards it is allowed to cancel. This makes for exciting card play back and forth between players&hellip;<br/><br/>Player #1: &ldquo;I Play an In My Sights for 3 Hits. If you don&rsquo;t stop it, you&rsquo;re going down.&rdquo; Player #2: &ldquo;I counter with a Barrel Roll.&rdquo; Player #1: &ldquo;I react with a Yo-Yo.&rdquo; Player #2: &ldquo;You got me.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Each aircraft is accurately simulated with a several ratings including: Performance (the maximum cards you can hold), Horsepower (the maximum cards you can draw each turn), Bursts (how many times you can fire), Damage (how much damage your attacks inflict), and Airframe (how much damage your aircraft can sustain).<br/><br/>The air combat is simulated using a Positioning system that allows aircraft to be Advantaged, Tailing, Disadvantaged, or Tailed in relation to other aircraft. An aircraft&rsquo;s position determine if it can aircraft, and how many bonus Bursts it receives if it is Advantaged or Tailing.<br/><br/>The game uses a simple Altitude system to add this vital aspect of air combat. Aircraft get to draw cards when diving, and must discard cards when climbing.<br/><br/>The game also includes Light, Medium, and Heavy Bombers that are used in the historical campaign games.<br/><br/>Down In Flames has won several awards through the years and continues to be a favorite for both serious and casual gamers.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    110 Full color Action Cards<br/>    110 Full Color Aircraft Cards<br/>    Full Color Rulebook<br/>    Full Color Counter Sheet (88 - 5/8&rdquo; counters)<br/>    6 Full Color Campaign Sheets<br/><br/><br/>(from the Publisher's Website)<br/><br/>",

Players construct their lazer paths with various pre-formed punchboard pieces that are placed according to speed and desired direction.<br/><br/>In Lazer Ryderz, players take on the role of one of four Ryderz as they race to capture all three Prisms needed to charge the Portal to their next destination. The Portal only allows one Ryder to pass through before moving on to a new location in the galaxy, so speed is essential to meet your goal. But the faster a Ryder goes the harder it is to turn, and if a Ryder runs into another player's lazer, that Ryder is toast! Who will continue on their quest and who will be left behind?<br/><br/>Will it be the Galactic Waveryder - the adrenaline-fueled surfer who's seeking the next great thrill and most radical solar waves? Or the Lazer Shark  - always on the hunt for her next prey as she seeks the fabled Blood Nebula to restart her species? Perhaps the Super Sheriff - greatest of the Law Star Rangers who travels to the outer reaches of the known (and unknown) galaxy to bring the universe's criminals to speedy justice? Or will it be the Phantom Cosmonaut - the ghost from a long-distant era whose true quest is a mystery to those he encounters, but with speed that is without question as he moves in the blink of an eye?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Whist is a trick taking standard deck playing card game that was played widely in the 18th and 19th centuries and is often mentioned in literature from that time period.<br/><br/>The most basic version of the game features fixed partnerships with no bidding. The game uses a single deck, and follows the basic mechanics of most trick taking games: the starting player leads a suit, and then the other players are forced to follow unless they have none of that suit left, in which case they are allowed to either toss a useless card of another suit, or to play a trump.<br/><br/>The object of Whist is to acquire tricks in excess of 6, each 1 of which scores 1 point. In this basic form the game usually goes to 5, though 7 and 9 point variations were also common. The trumps in standard Whist were determined by facing the last card to be dealt.<br/><br/>In addition, like most card games, there are a large variety of variants. A common one involves pre-determing the trump suit, and running them in order from hand to hand. (For instance: Hearts first, then Diamonds, Spades, and finally Clubs, and then start over again)<br/><br/>Another, less popular and luck oriented variant involves giving a 4 point bonus to a partnership if it held the 'Honours' run of A - K - Q - J in the suit that was trump for that hand or 2 points if it had 3 of the 4. As this is based on the cards as dealt it is a very luck based option, and as such has fallen out of common use though it was once considered a standard way to play the game.<br/><br/>Other variants include bidding (quite common, and turn the game into something closely resembling Spades) and two player adaptations.<br/><br/>",

For the high and mighty this is easy, but the smaller, weaker vampires have the strength to do this only in groups. Thus, you as the vampire lord might want to play out several with low values together in order not to be surpassed. Whatever you do in Vampire Queen, though, be sure to rid yourself of an intrusive vampire hunter because no one wants to get stuck with that!<br/><br/>The deck consists of cards numbered 1-13, four vampire queens that have variable value, and two vampire hunters. Players start with a hand of 9-13 cards depending on the player count, and the start player for a round plays from their hand either a single card, multiple cards of the same value, or a vampire hunter. Vampire queens on their own (or in a pair, triplet, or quartet) are valued at 14, but they can be played with other cards and adopt the value of those cards. For a single card or a set of cards (e.g., three 6s), each other player in turn can either pass or play the same number of cards but of a higher value (e.g., three 9s). Whoever plays the highest card(s) wins the round and leads off the next round.<br/><br/>If the round's start player leads a vampire hunter, it counts as value 0 and each other player must play exactly one (non-vampire hunter) card of whatever value they want. Whoever plays the highest card takes all played cards into their hand, then leads off the next round, but they cannot lead with the same vampire hunter they just won.<br/><br/>When one or more players have emptied their hand at the end of a round, the round ends. Players then score points for all cards still in hand, with number cards being worth their face value, queens being 14, and vampire hunter cards being 15 or 20, as indicated. Players with vampire hunters in hand keep them, then shuffle all cards and deal new hands to all players, with the player who holds the 20 starting. After five rounds, whoever has scored the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

The Mongol princess Khutulun, a Worldbreaker and a descendent of the great Chinggis Khan, is reuniting the distant tribes of the Mongol Empire. However, other factions are rising to oppose her, each with their own agenda.<br/><br/>Worldbreakers: Advent of the Khanate is a customizable two-player card game. Players start the game with a Worldbreaker that has a unique special ability and a deck of 30 cards. Each player aims to be the first to reach 10 power, which is gained by developing Location cards and by attacking the opponent.<br/><br/>The game is divided into rounds, during each of which the players alternate taking turns. A turn is composed of one action, such as gaining mythium (the currency of the game), drawing a card, playing a card, or attacking the opponent. Worldbreakers has three card types: events, followers, and locations. Events are impactful one-time effects. Followers are people who join your cause and can either defend your board or attack your opponent. Finally, Locations are places where mythium can be collected. They have a numbered list of stages, each of which can be developed for a one-time bonus such as power or resources.<br/><br/>Proper timing and resource management is key to victory: wait too long, and your opponent will mount a crushing attack or finish developing their Locations for a power advantage. Who will wrestle control of mythium and forever reshape history?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Your token moves around the perimeter of an array of ingredient cards, and you pick one from the row or column where you stop. The number on the card you pick dictates how many spaces you move on your next turn.<br/><br/>To score points, you need to collect sets of four matching ingredients; if you have only one of a particular ingredient, you'll score penalty points instead. The scoring rules can be made more complicated if the players desire, but for most the basic rules are satisfying. A touch of memory is involved since you can see only the most recently chosen ingredient on your stack of cards.<br/><br/>Glastonbury is a new edition of the 2001 release Kupferkessel Co. with slight changes to the game. Now the game can be played by up to four players instead of being strictly a two-player game. The game includes additional ingredient cards and new spell cards that allow special actions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "City building has never been so easy: Just roll the dice, then build a building. However, each die must be selected carefully to fit the building requirements. Push your luck too far &ndash; or select carelessly &ndash; and a player may find himself demolishing his city instead of building it up. Choose each die wisely and build efficiently in order to erect magnificent skyscrapers and create the best skyline!<br/><br/>Skyline is a quick push-your-luck dice game involving set collection. Unlike other dice games that provide no relationship from turn to turn and no player interaction, this game allows players to literally build upon their decisions each turn and react to their opponents' actions.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose to roll dice from either the Construction Yard or the Abandoned District, with the goal of erecting urban buildings. Buildings are made up of three types of dice: Ground Floor dice, Mid-Floor dice and Penthouse dice. Some buildings are safer to build but provide little reward, while other buildings have poor probabilities but can have substantial impact on the success of a player's skyline.<br/><br/>After rolling their selected dice, the player must use at least one of these dice to take one of three possible actions: Abandon, Build, or Cancel Construction. The Build action is the desired outcome, of course, but can be carried out only if the die result matches what they need to build. For instance, all Ground Floor dice can be built without restriction, but a High-Rise Mid-Floor die result can be built only on top of a High-Rise Ground Floor die. Likewise, a Mid-Rise Penthouse die can be built only on a Mid-Rise Mid-Floor die. If the rolled results do not allow them to Build, then the player must Cancel Construction on one of their existing buildings. If a player does not want to Cancel Construction, then they must Abandon by placing that die in the Abandoned District, which gives their opponents the opportunity to capitalize on this failure.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, points are rewarded for completed buildings according to their height. A Level 3 building &ndash; that is, a building comprised of three dice &ndash; is worth 9 points, while a Level 4 building is worth 16, and so on.<br/><br/>Remember, the dice control the results...but the players control the dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This interesting dexterity game is played on a table-like board that is a wooden lattice with a piece of linen stretched over the bottom.  Little colored balls are placed in the resulting holes, and then players use long wooden mallets to strike the bottom of the table.  When a ball is hit correctly, it will pop out of the space it's in and land in another space closer to the opposite side of the board.  Landing on another player's ball lets you capture it, but if your ball lands off the board, it's out of the game.<br/><br/>",
