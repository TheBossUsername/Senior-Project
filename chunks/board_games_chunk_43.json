        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionPilo is a finite territory game for two players: Blue and Orange. It is played on the spaces (squares) of an initially empty square board. The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 10x10 squares.<br/><br/>Both players must have access to a sufficient number of disks of their own color and a sufficient number of neutral blocks.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA stack is a disk lying directly on the board along with all other disks piled onto it on the same square.<br/><br/>The height of a stack is the number of disks in it.<br/><br/>A group is a stack along with all other like-colored stacks one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent stacks of its color.<br/><br/>Similarly, a patch is a square not occupied by a block along with all other such squares one could reach from it through a series of steps between orthogonally adjacent squares not occupied by blocks. Note a patch may contain any number of groups, as well as empty squares.<br/><br/>The size of a group or patch is the number of squares it spans.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlue plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, if possible, make exactly one of these board plays:<br/><br/>- Place a disk of your color on an empty square.<br/><br/>- Move a stack of your color any number of squares in a straight orthogonal line, without jumping over any blocks or enemy stacks, to a square occupied by an enemy stack of the same height. Then, remove this enemy stack, add a disk to your stack on that square and place a block on the square from which you just moved your stack. Note a stack can jump over friendly stacks.<br/><br/>If you have no board plays available on your turn, you must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, for each patch on the board, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from it until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over in a patch owns the patch. Empty patches are owned by neither player.<br/><br/>The player with the higher score in the resulting position wins. Your score is the sum of the sizes of the patches that you own. If there is a tie, whoever made the last board play loses.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means Orange will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

The key to expanding Wilderness Dice is making sure to include the proper number of dice. For the first two players, add 12 dice. Each additional player should add 3 dice to the total. Players will still only complete three rounds of dice rolls. This does mean that more players will have leftover cards at the end of each round.<br/><br/>The Exotic expansion includes animals from both Australia and Africa.

        "description": "Trifoil is a long-form, 2 player turn based strategy game in the vein of chess or go that can be played with 6 or more Blinks. Players take turns placing links, pushing them, and rotating sections of the board to try to build a long chain before their opponent can.<br/>The rules are flexible along with the initial board state, so the game can evolve to be simple, complex, or even just different depending on what you want to play!<br/><br/>Setup<br/>The base board setup with 6 blinks is as follows:<br/><br/>There are 2 players, red and blue. The board's background color is lit up with the current player's color. Each turn, players can use up to 2 actions (see available actions), except for the first turn of the game where a player can only use one action.<br/>A player wins when they have a chain of 5 links of their own color! The game also ends when either player has placed 9 links, in which case the player with the longest chain wins (see end game rules).<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>On the first turn of the game, the player going first only gets 1 action. Every turn afterwards each player gets 2 actions. Note: You cannot make a move which returns the board to the previous board state.<br/>Place a link<br/>You can place a link by first clicking the blink you wish to place on, then clicking the blink touching the face (direction) where want to place the link<br/><br/>This means that you can't place any links facing outwards from the formation.<br/>Spin<br/>You can disconnect, rotate, and reattach one of 3-blink triangles that form the corners of the board as one of your actions. They are labelled &quot;&Delta;&quot;, &quot;&Omega;&quot;, and &quot;&theta;&quot; in the board above!<br/>Players are allowed to do this ONLY if they have less links on that triangle than their opponents. This is referred to as the &quot;minority rule.&quot; If they have the same amount of links as the opponent, they cannot spin it.<br/><br/>Push<br/>You can push a link outwards from a Blink the using the same input as placing a link. E.g. if you attempt to place a link where a link already exists, you will instead push it--pushing any other links in the way in a straight line as well! You can only push links of your own color.<br/><br/>Ending your turns<br/>Once you have made your moves, double click any Blink to commit a move and pass the turn to the other player<br/><br/>Win Condition<br/>Be the first to create a chain of at least 5 links. Only 2 links to Blinks are counted toward the final score. Scale chain length according to amount of Blinks (see below)<br/><br/>Variations<br/>The rulebook and the board are flexible, so use your imagination--the possibilities are endless! See Examples below<br/>Rule Variations<br/>Try limiting number the total number of links you can place to . If either player runs out of links, the player with the longest chain wins.<br/>Try playing until any one Blink is filled with 6 links of any color. When that happens, the longest chain wins.<br/>Try playing with 3 moves instead of 2! You might need to increase the winning chain length.<br/>Removing the limit of links that a Blink can contribute to a chain creates a much more defensive game!<br/><br/>",

In Mathematicus two different dice are used, the tetrahedral die (4 faces) and the dodecahedral die (12 faces), leaving the player to choose from time to time which one to use.<br/><br/>You advance along the path by answering the questions (of the level chosen) posed by the cards. Questions must be answered within the indicated times.<br/><br/>Goal of the game: to collect as many figures of famous mathematicians as possible, even taking them away from other players, (using the &quot;Fields Medal&quot; or event card) but you cannot have two figures of the same mathematician.<br/><br/>In advanced mode the game allows you to become familiar with ancient calculation tools (Napier's Sticks and the Calculator Rule), with interesting numbering systems used by various civilizations of the past, and also with binary calculation, essential in the current world of electronics and information technology.<br/><br/>Extracted translation from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Festival Guru is a board game developed by festival organizers and Spieltrieb.<br/><br/>Players need to catch 6 live performances within 4 different stages in one festival day. We all know it's easier said than done. Pack up your festival bag and get ready for a  muddy, crazy, chilled, rowdy and epic adventure!<br/><br/>Get through an unpredictable action-packed festival day while you try and catch all your favorite bands live.  This game now includes 24 independent bands from across the globe that you can watch, via a QR-Code, at the end of every round.<br/><br/>In a festival, one prefers to be with friends when watching bands live or having drinks at the beer stands.  Hence, players get more chances to earn Fun Points when they meet friends or other rockers in the game.  As you advance across the festival ground, one should take other player's movements into account.<br/><br/>The one who gained the most Fun Points on the Fun Barometer, at the end of the game, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mur is an abstract strategy board game for two players, which was invented by Canadian, Desmond R Davies, in Atlantic Canada in 2021. The concept behind Mur's game design draws inspiration from the book of Genesis. The Mur board is a round grid with 25 intersections and the playing pieces are small checkers engraved with ancient galleys making the game set reminiscent of the ancient city of Atlantis as described by Plato in his Critias dialogue.<br/><br/>There are a total of 15 game pieces: 14 ships and one kraken. Seven ships are black and belong to the first player, seven ships are white and belong to the second player, and one piece&mdash;the kraken&mdash;is red and is a neutral piece. During a turn a player may either place, move or (if forced) withdraw a ship. Since there is no capturing and therefore no permanent elimination of material or territory, the game of Mur functions as a perpetually shifting puzzle. A ship forced into or found in a surrounded solitary position, which is called a trap, must be removed from the board by the owner, not the opponent. The goal of the game is to be the first player to surround the kraken OR acquire three ship traps. Visit murfederation.com to learn more!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beat to Quarters is an official expansion to Flying Colors by GMT Games, LLC and requires a copy of that game (preferably the latest deluxe edition) to play.<br/><br/>One of the most common criticisms of Flying Colors is the clutter of status markers on the map and that they may detract from game play. This concern can be minimized somewhat by using status sheets and a handy pencil to keep track of things on paper. This, however, adds a separate record-keeping aspect that the design of the game goes out of its way to avoid.<br/><br/>Beat to Quarters provides the ultimate way by which to keep track of the status of individual ships through the use of individual tracking cards that are kept conveniently near the map and that are laid out to conveniently hold a variety of status markers such as Broadsides Fired, Sail State, Rigging Damage, and Hull Damage. The cards are designed to be printed at a standard 3.5 by 2.5 inch size so that they can be slipped into card protectors for extended usage.<br/><br/>Individual tracking cards are included for all 562 individually named ships included with the latest, deluxe version of Flying Colors. But that&rsquo;s not all!<br/><br/>As a bonus, Beat to Quarters also includes the print-and-play components for an entirely new way to play Flying Colors. Drawing from games such as Naval War, Modern Naval Battles, and (in particular) Enemy in Sight, Beat to Quarters can be played with just the ship tracking cards, a special set of markers and 8.5 x 11 inch tracking board, and the status markers from Flying Colors. The ship cards are organized into squadrons that maneuver and fire against the opposing fleet within a relatively small playing area. With Beat to Quarters, you can play the battle of Trafalgar without the space requirements for three game maps.<br/><br/>With Beat to Quarters, you can either enhance or completely change your enjoyment of Flying Colors!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Beat to Quarters can be purchased from:<br/><br/> Volume I - Flying Colors<br/> Volume II - Serpents-of-the-Seas<br/><br/>",

The result of long-standing commercial tensions, the war was primarily fought in the Caribbean; the British tried to capture key Spanish ports in the region, including Porto Bello and Chagres in Panama, Havana, and Cartagena de Indias in present-day Colombia.<br/><br/>Two previous naval attacks in 1740 had failed and for the third attempt in March 1741, the British had opted for a combined naval and land attack. After a series of unsuccessful assaults in the campaign, the British were forced to retreat, having suffered over 9,500&ndash;11,500 fatalities, in great part to disease, and considerable material losses. Some units suffered death rates of 80 to 90 percent. The victory demonstrated Spain's ability to defend its position and largely ended military operations in this area. Both countries shifted their focus to the wider European War of the Austrian Succession and hostilities ended with the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.<br/><br/>In this two-player game, one player will take the control of the Spanish forces and the other the control of the British forces. The British player will have to make a way thru the bay of Cartagena de Indias to conquer the Spanish while the Spanish player will have to defend the city to achieve victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dark Overlord Reigns is a semi-abstract game of warfare that takes place in a forsaken fantasy world. White cubes represent forces that allow you to protect, fight, and perform tasks. You also manage three heroic leaders that journey around the tile map to aid your forces against the Dark Overlord; the rising threat to the free nations.<br/><br/>Designed as a solitaire game, forces of the Dark Overlord are controlled by the game system. These forces consist of black cubes (dark army), blue cubes (hellbreed), and purple cubes (ghoul hordes). The dark army represents the overlord&rsquo;s regular army, the hellbreed represents his supernatural army, and the ghoul hordes represent his enslaved army.<br/><br/>Throughout the game you are attempting to build up your white cubes while keeping the rival cubes to a minimum. A major feature in the game is &ldquo;worker placement&rdquo;. To overcome the Dark Overlord you must have your task force cubes (workers) fulfill various missions in order to recruit more forces and outwit the Dark Overlord. Ultimately, you must prevail in a final battle on the center tile in order to win the game.<br/><br/>A game turn consists of 3 phases. The first phase involves the emergence of rival cubes.

The third phase of the turn allows you decision-making opportunities using your heroes.

        "description": "Catpitals is a geography-themed card game that engages memory skills, knowledge of capitals of the world, and strategy used as you learn your opponent&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses.  The goal of the game is to win the most cards. Gameplay is directed by one of 6 different cats that appear on the cards. Three cats provide players the opportunity to see the country map and its capital on their opponents&rsquo; cards, which players will be challenged to successfully remember later in play. The other 3 cats direct various play that allow players to steal or win cards by either correctly naming the capital for a given country, or by carefully selecting an opponent who will not likely know or remember the correct answer.<br/><br/>Each of the 60 cards has a unique colorful map depicting several countries with one or more capitals identified.  One round of the game takes approximately 20 minutes.  The game moves fast enough that several rounds can be played, which has the benefit of introducing more countries and capitals into play.  A more challenging game can be played by requiring all capitals on a given card to be correctly named in order to win the card.<br/><br/>The game can be enjoyed by people of varied ages and knowledge as everyone gets an opportunity to win cards based on their own competencies and strategy.  Ultimately though, as one learns more capitals of the world a distinct advantage will develop, especially if one plays repeatedly.<br/><br/>",

However, the day to day campaign activity of the combatants included reconnaissance, raids, probing actions, resupply and a host of other minor operations that frequently lead to small skirmishes.<br/><br/>What I want to do in this volume of Refighting History is to take some of these actions, however small, and however sketchy in terms of accounts, and turn them into wargames. They will also demonstrate that you do not need large armies to wargame the Seven Years War.<br/>The Western Theatre accounts provide details of the day to day activity by both armies. Coupled with this, the great variety of light and irregular troops provides a whole range of different unit.<br/><br/>The result is this volume with small historical actions refought on the wargame table.

        "description": "Battle of Legends: Rome vs Macedon: Print &amp; Play Edition, which is a reimplementation of Battle of Legends: Print &amp; Play Edition (2019 Wargame Print &amp; Play Contest Winner), is a two-player board game that focuses on four battles fought between Roman Republic and Macedonian Kingdom in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, namely Elis (208 BC), Aous (198 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC), and Pydna (168 BC). It is developed to simulate those battles on a tactical level with a hex grid board, terrain tiles, unit counters, faction cards, and d6 dice.<br/><br/>The game board is divided into hex spaces for unit placement and terrain tiles are placed onto them to create the battlefield of a chosen scenario. The Hill, River, and Forest are the terrain types which affects unit movement and combat in different ways. For instance, in battle Cynoscephalae (197 BC), which is mainly a hill battle, one hit is ignored if a unit on ground is attacking against a target unit on hill, in order to reflect the difficulty of uphill combat.<br/> A unit is represented by a number of counters (equal to unit strength) on a hex space. The Roman army consists of Principe, Triarii, Velites, Elephants, and Equites units; whereas the Macedon army contains Pezhetairoi, Hypaspists, Peltasts, Hetairoi, and Cretans units, each having its own movement-attack-defense powers, special skills and abilities. Great effort has been made to bring out the differences in fighting formations of two armies, &ldquo;Legion&rdquo; vs &ldquo;Phalanx&rdquo;, while preserving a simple and streamlined game mechanism.<br/><br/>A leader is attached onto a unit and moves with it while upgrading friendly units in range. Leader influenced units make more powerful attacks, and hold the ground better. Therefore, effective positioning of a leader allows you to take the advantage in the course of battle. <br/> Faction cards lie at the heart of the game. They are kept secret and played to order units (green), activate their offensive (red)-defensive (blue) abilities, or start an event. Each faction has its own unique set and the content is changing from one scenario to another. Order cards allow you to position your units strategically across the battlefield to best coordinate your attacks, while ability &amp; event cards empower you to apply some combat tactics such as charging, flanking, envelopment, phalanx, testudo, and withdraw. There is also a scenario card in each deck which takes the place of a key event happened in that battle. For example, the surprising pass of Romans through a secret path in Aous Battle (198 BC) is simulated by an order card which upgrades their movement up to 5 hexes.<br/><br/>BoL is played over a number of game rounds (scenario specific) in which players take their turns respectively. Each turn consists of three steps:<br/>1.Order Units: Order a group of units by playing an order card from your hand.<br/>2.Move Units: Move each of ordered units either by marching, or attacking. Play an ability, or event card where possible.<br/>3.Select Cards: Manage your hand by discarding-taking cards from your faction deck.<br/>This ordering of steps imposes a strategic depth to the gameplay by forcing you foresee upcoming events and make necessary adjustments beforehand.<br/><br/>The dice combat system is kept simple yet efficient, in which engagements are resolved quickly by referencing unit cards. To succeed in combat, you must consider unit types, unit strength, ranges, terrain effects and leadership.<br/><br/>To win the game, you must bring your opponent down to zero morale, or stand higher on morale at the end of the last round. Morale status may be changed with losses of units, or strategic places on board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You will be taking the old miser Ebenezer Scrooge on a journey through Christmases of the Past, Present, and Future, showing him the consequences of his actions. Hopefully he will change his ways before he runs out of time!<br/><br/>Players will move Scrooge through scenes from the classic story, taking actions using a simple rondel. Your goal is to present ten pivotal moments in Scrooge's life to the old miser, playing combinations of Spirit cards (Contentment, Compassion, and Charity) to meet the requirements for each Scene. Each action you take will require Scrooge to spend his precious Shillings. You can only convince him to part with 15 Shillings during each journey this night, and if these run out, everyone loses the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Refuge at Emerald Island is an isolated and exclusive resort that, ironically, none of the travel agents have ever heard of.

The week after their stay, the resort is scheduled to be demolished by its owner and rebuilt as an industrial hub. Once the group arrives, they are excited for sand, sun and relaxation. That quickly changes when a member of their team is found dead with a harpoon in the back. The person who committed the crime must be one of the travel agency guests or the resort staff. Trapped on an island with a bloodthirsty killer, the body count is certain to go up as the suspect list goes down.

Carve out the best strategy to navigate the terrain and build structures to control land. But be on your guard! Pitfalls await you around every turn, and your entire strategy can quickly unravel&hellip;<br/><br/>Ground Assault&reg; is a military-themed game where two to four players navigate challenging terrain, build structures to take control of land, and battle to defend their land.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to control six pieces of land at the same time across the battlefield before your opponents do the same. Each time you play, the tiles forming the battlefield are randomized, making each game a unique challenge!<br/><br/>A turn starts with 10 actions points that can be used in various ways. The most common ways to use the AP are moving troops around the board and using a combination of AP and skill cards to build something on a terrain tile which represents a piece of land. For instance, if you're on a river tile and you have the correct skill card (in this case the Engineer skill card) you can build a bridge across the river (you flip the tile over and the river becomes a bridge). Then you put your land control cube on the tile to mark that you own it.<br/><br/>The game ends for a specific player if they run out of troops. Troops can be lost in battles. The game ends altogether when one player acquires six pieces of land.<br/><br/>The catchphrase of the game is &quot;Control the Field, Win the War.&quot; So it's all about maneuvering your troops around the battlefield (made up of terrain tiles), building structures to take control, and then defending them against attack.<br/>With 100% hand-painted artwork by graphic novel illustrator Mark Woods-Hawkins and unique mechanics, Ground Assault&reg; is a must have game in your collection!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fraywick, the last great human city, is constantly under threat by the dangerous wild monsters of the world. But when Fraywick would fall, the Moxian Guard stands tall against the menace. Using the charismatic power of Moxie, the Moxian Guard command their own monsters to fend off threats from beyond the gates. You have discovered your own Moxie, and set off on a journey to rally your own band of monsters together. Tryouts for the Moxian Guard begin in eight weeks, do you have what it takes to make the cut?<br/><br/>Moxie: A Journey of Monsters is played over a series of 8 rounds, culminating in a final tournament between the players. Each round has two phases, a scouting phase in which players search various decks of cards, called routes, for monsters to recruit to their team, and a battle phase where they will face off against another player, pitting their recruited monsters against one another for rewards.<br/><br/>In the scouting phase, there are no turns. Instead, players act simultaneously, scouting routes they've reached. Players begin with just a handful of moxie tokens, which they'll spend to scout these routes. Players can search each deck they've reached one time each round, choosing only a single card from it to join their team, and so must choose how best to spend their moxie tokens to cover the most ground. By committing many moxie tokens to a route, players draw more cards from that route, giving them more options to choose from, but at the cost of less moxie to search other routes with. Once each player has spent all of their moxie tokens for the round, the game proceeds to the battle phase.<br/><br/>In the battle phase, players pair off against each other to pit their team against the others. Each player prepares their team for battle by determining the order they'll send their monsters out, attempting to position each monster where it will best counter their opponents. Once players have committed their order, the battle begins, with players sending their monsters out one at a time to do battle until they run out of strength. Monsters strength is determined by that monsters particular strength dice, by comparing monsters types to see if one or the other can score a critical hit, and by utilizing the various effects of each monster to further alter the outcome. Once only one player has any monsters remaining, they win the battle that round.<br/><br/>After each battle phase, players are rewarded based on their performance. Players who win their battle progress along the route tracker, opening up a new route for them to scout going forward in future rounds. Players who lose their battle, on the other hand, are rewarded additional moxie tokens to allow them to scout further into the routes they've already reached. In addition, defeated players may advance one of their monsters into a powerful new form, granting it new strengths and abilities.<br/><br/>Play continues in this way until the end of the eighth round, where players will compete in a final tournament bracket to determine the games final victor.<br/><br/>",

(1-2 hours) In this game each player controls one of the 5 ancient cultures that settled around the Mediterranean Sea in a fictive period BC: Romans, Greeks, Persians, Egyptians and  Carthaginians.<br/><br/>Each turn in the game represents a period roughly around 30 years, and it covers the rise (and fall) of the reign of one king. Every ruler will usually be specialized in one of the 5 aspects of the game and will improve its nation in one of those 5 areas: military, science, seafaring, city building and nation expansion. Each representing a type of action the players may execute on their turn.<br/><br/>Every turn, as an action, each player will play one set of cards from his hand, but all cards played must be of the same type. Each action may be activated up to 5 times throughout the game. Every time a player wants to activate the same action, one more card is always required than the previous time. The game ends the moment some player manages to activate any action for the 5th time.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the player will draw an amount of cards equals to the number of resources his nation controls, but (out of those cards) he will get to keep only a number of cards equal to the number of UNIQUE resources he has.<br/><br/>Players will collect 2 types of victory points: Glory and Culture. Final score is the LOWER of these 2 types of points. At the end of the game, the player with the highest final score wins.<br/><br/>",

Players can experience the action of a fighting game and RPG in less than 3 minutes per player.<br/><br/>The idea is simple: each player chooses a character that represents a fighting class. You can use a printed or digital version of it, it's the same! Then using dice, the players will take turns to defeat each other. The last one standing wins.<br/><br/>And something important, depending on the table you play at, it will change the battlefield.<br/>For example a table of 4, or for 6. Or in a bar!

Players take on the role of an enclave governor who must lead their people in a fight for survival using a brand new base-defense tactical deck-building game mechanic.<br/><br/>Somehow, you have cobbled together a band of basic fighting men and women to help you survive in the inhospitable wasteland you call home. However, you&rsquo;ve noticed another group of survivors competing for resources in your area. If you are going to survive for long, you are going to need to spend your ever-dwindling resources to convince new and capable people to join you in the constant struggle...but finding them can be just as difficult as convincing them to come back with you.<br/><br/>Players take turns attacking their opponent, fortifying their enclave, and searching the Dunes to acquire new and powerful characters to join their fight. Defeat your opponent by crippling their authority, and do it quickly -- your opponent will only grow stronger the longer you let them live. Unfortunately, they know it, too.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with an 11 card deck. Then players choose which factions they want to be represented. Combine your favorite three factions to create the six card Dunes deck. This is where you will find powerful allies to join your enclave. On their turn, players play cards, pick cards, and arrange/navigate cards on their side. The game ends when one player has had their Authority (life) reduced to 0 due to actions happening in the game. A player wins by reducing their opponents Authority (life) to 0 or below.<br/><br/>Along with the four starting factions, Splintered Lands has five expansions already planned out. Each expansion contains two new factions, plus exclusive bonus content. These unique boosters create new ways to engage with the world of Splintered Lands, giving players optional new ways to defeat their opponents, new and interesting mechanics to discover, and unusual aberrant creatures to defend with or against.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the bloodied dead body suggests there are one too many guests. Was it a jealous lover? Or filthy blackmail? Or plain old fashioned Envy? This is the bloody 1920's at its worst.<br/><br/>Envy is a printable escape room game that transforms any space into a 1920's Gatsby style murder mystery escape room experience. What's it like? Well, imagine what would happen if you mixed an escape room and a house party in a cocktail shaker. That's Envy.<br/><br/>This printable escape room kit combines the teamwork, tension, and puzzle-solving of escape rooms with the laidback ease of group party games. Players will work together to solve the mystery of Lord Carnegie&rsquo;s murder, before time runs out. Gameplay is centered on a series of puzzle sheets hidden around the room. Each puzzle solved puts you one step closer to cuffing the killer red-handed (literally&hellip; there&rsquo;s blood everywhere!).<br/><br/>Game setup is quick and spoiler-free, and hints are handled by an online hint system that players access on their smartphones. This means that no game master is required to supervise the experience, so you can join the game alongside your players.<br/><br/>The game can expand to accommodate any number of players by dividing your group into teams of 2-4, and then pitting them against each other to see who finishes the game first. In addition, you can edit the game file before printing to customize your own escape room experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With this adventure booklet you can experience another exciting adventure of Robin Hood and his companions. It plays around the same time as chapter 4. The story of the adventure plays independently of the others and therefore no prior knowledge of other chapters is necessary.<br/><br/>Since new elements and tiles from later adventures have been added, it is recommended that you have already played the basic game. All outlaws already have their own special abilities. The functions for new items can be found on the following page. No prior knowledge of this adventure is required.<br/><br/>Robin and his friends took the injured Guardian to the secret camp and were concerned if he would survive this unpredictable onslaught. Robin paced frantically, pondering who was behind this evil could. Because only he can save the keeper so that he can recover. It was clear that the Sheriff of Nottingham must be behind this curse, for the sheriff had been following her for a long time. The forest was a good hiding place and the guards always had great difficulty finding them. Suddenly voices were heard nearby. The sheriff's guards were alarmed, because Nottingham was swarming with soldiers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first place winner of the 2021 Zenobia Awards, Tyranny of Blood models the rise and fall of British colonialism in India from 1750 to around 1947, and the ensuing social displacement&mdash;in the religious, military, economic, and labor domains&mdash;that still resonate today. The game seeks to answer the lofty questions: how do classes with disparate bases of power work together in a society, how do they struggle against each other, and who are the victims of this process?<br/><br/>In this asymmetric card-driven game, each player plays as one of the four major caste groups (Brahmin, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra/Dalit) with the end goal of shaping the coming independent Indian nation-state to support their interests while dealing with their unique and unequal places in the hierarchy. Each faction has its own role to play in the game and its own method of earning victory points based on its distinct goals.<br/><br/>In this game, the British are not a playable faction, but a non-player force that players will have to respond to, either by fighting against colonial forces, or working with them to oppose the other players.<br/><br/>Designer note: Tyranny of Blood is about a hierarchical system that has oppressed people throughout history and has lingering effects that continue to cause suffering today. The game is meant as a condemnation of the system and a method of understanding it, not an endorsement or celebration. I hope that learning about this history will inspire players to think critically about the inequalities that plague the world today, and to struggle against them.<br/><br/>",

Build your web, grow your colony and enhance your skills as you struggle to gain food and fend off attackers. There is an ominous humming sound as the Hoover-Bot 3000 gets closer and closer to the web, threatening a to destroy to your colony in a horrible Hoovergeddon. Your only chance is build an EMP (Electro Magnetic Pulse weapon) from parts you find in the lab and fire it off to destroy the Hoover-Bot. Can you build the EMP in time, or will you be overrun by attacking critters and meet your Hoovergeddon.<br/><br/>Game Description<br/><br/>Arachnid is a cooperative game for 2-4 players. Each player is a spider with unique abilities controlled by their own action board with upgradable worker placement spots. The center play area is a hex grid, where the spiders reside and tiles are placed as the web is spun. This shared web is the spider&rsquo;s home, where food is trapped, new skills are acquired, and new workers are hatched.<br/><br/>Flies occasionally fly by, becoming trapped, and eventually, food. Players influence when the Flies are triggered, but this also increases the risk of Critters attacking the web. It's a fine balance between starvation and safety. Players can also enhance their spider skills, but this involves sacrificing parts of their valuable web home.<br/><br/>How to lose<br/><br/>-If the web somehow becomes detached from the edges of the board due to critter attacks, it will mean the end of the colony.<br/><br/>-if the Golden Scarab reached the Den in the center of the web , then &quot;Activates&quot;, the colony will be destroyed.<br/><br/>-If the the Hoover-Bot reaches the web, the game will end in a horrible Hoovergeddon.<br/><br/>How to win<br/><br/>Find enough spare parts to create the EMP, then all spiders meet at the Den to set it off and fry the Hoover-Bot.

All the best things in life are there: good food, wine, beautiful servants, and interesting conversation. You are a guest, and after you get comfortable your host makes a request of you: make a speech in praise of love. Every guest gives a speech, the contents of which are directed by a different metaphysical perspective. If your speech is the best one, the host will award you the relevant card.<br/><br/>After this initial round of play the role of host shifts, new perspectives are selected, and a new Question card is drawn by a new host; introducing the players to a variety of interesting questions. (What is is to be wise? What is courage? Why do I still love them?) Fresh speeches are given, and the card is awarded. Play continues in this manner until the You are drunk card is selected, at which point the game is over. The guest with the most cards at the end of the game not only wins, but is also the wisest.<br/><br/>",

At the end of your turn, you flip back all cards.<br/><br/>Some advancements of the routes require visa cards which need to be placed before you are able to advance, and the visa cards are shared between North &amp; East and shared between South &amp; West. Visa cards cannot be saved. The end point of Amsterdam can also not be saved.<br/><br/>This game can be summarized as a game of memory, where you can safe cards for later use and where their is a small competition for visa cards between players (South&amp;West and North&amp;East).<br/><br/>",

The chess pieces move on the rink along lines connected to boxes, so it is a point-to-point movement, in an attempt to get into scoring position.<br/><br/>A game is complete when one team has scored a goal.  A longer version can be played by allowing 12 movement turns per team to complete one period of play with as many goals as can be scored within that 12 move period.

As you move closer to your opponent you will find new terrain and different weather systems which may help or hinder your progress. When you meet your opponent's army, be ready to attack and/or defend yourself so you can stop or slow down their advances on your homeland. Your survival is based on your success in keeping your opponent from advancing. Your goal is take over their homeland before they take yours.<br/><br/>In the base game you will start as Viking or knights with other types of people to come later. Each type of person comes with historical aspect to each person on the team.<br/><br/>This game also comes with a great twist of the dice roll. In a game that would normally have a pair dice to roll and move your army's around you draw cards instead. These cards are call Math dice and they come in different levels of Math. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, division and Algebra and all the choices you could use. Each player would draw a card and have the opponent draw it solve it to get a bonus for each battle.<br/><br/>So for this game you will learn a little fun history and solve a few math problems. With the upgraded armies to miniatures you gain a great chess set.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After each round the role of the Agent goes to a new player.<br/><br/>Victory depends on how much Evil you can spread throughout the world, with points being given based on how well the plan fit with the target of your evil deeds.<br/><br/>Every round, the Evil players lay down one of their Plot cards, face down on one Target card, matching all the Plots symbols with the symbols on the Target card. No two players can place their Plot on the same Target. The player acting as the Agent then tries to guess which symbols each Evil player has used on each Target, and place their D.I.C. Agent card with the symbol of their choice on each Plot. If the Agent guess right, no points are given to the Evil player. If the Agent guess wrong, the Evil player gets points according to the Plot and the corresponding symbols on the Target. The Agent does not get any victory points even if they foil a Plot. Chase cards may be used by the Evil player to escape with their points if the Agent guessed right, and the Agent may respond in kind. The players then replenish their hand and may buy new Chase cards for a victory point cost.<br/>First player to 20 points wins and ends the game.<br/><br/>",

There your white brothers will not trouble you; they will have no claim to the land, and you can live upon it, you and all your children, as long as the grass grows or the water runs, in peace and plenty. It will be yours forever.<br/><br/>President Andrew Jackson<br/><br/>AS LONG AS THE GRASS GROWS is a board game that adapts the COIN Series developed by GMT Games to the Conquest of the American West from 1845-1881. Players use Events, Commands and Special Abilities to place and move pieces on the map to achieve victory. The players take the roles of four Factions; the Great Plains Tribal Faction (GP) consisting of the Comanche and their Kiowa allies; and the Dakota, Lakota, Yankton, and Yanktonai Sioux with their Arapaho, Blackfoot, Cheyenne, and Cree allies. The Northwestern Tribal Faction (NW) has the Chinook, Modoc, Nez Perce, Rogues, Umatilla, Yakima of the Pacific Northwest; the Yaqui of Mexico; the Navajo enemies of the Apaches; and the Crow, Flathead, and Pawnee enemies of the Sioux. The Southwestern Tribal Faction (SW) has the Chiricahua, Lipan, Mescalero and Western Apaches, their Mojave and Yuma allies, and the Bannock, Paiute, Shoshone, and Ute Tribes of the Great Basin. The United States Faction (US) includes the federal, state and territorial governments; the US Army; and militia, miners, pioneers, settlers, buffalo hunters, and railroad companies.<br/><br/>Cards are drawn from the deck one at time, with one card in play and the following card face up on top of the deck. Each Event card shows the order in which Eligible Factions may choose to resolve the Event or one of their own Commands, sometimes with one of their Special Abilities. Resolving an Event or Command makes the Faction Ineligible for the next card. President Events interrupt play as the Factions determine victory, collect revenue, pay upkeep, make treaties, and relocate pieces.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If a player cannot place a ball or knocks a ball from the pyramid, including one just placed, the game ends, that player loses, and whoever has the fewest balls remaining wins.<br/><br/>",

They continue to draw a tile at each turn, using the tiles to correctly build out the map, but only setting tiles in the regions where Ricky the Cat is currently visiting. Players can only move the cat to new regions based on their play. Some caution is required to ensure your tiles actually correspond with the country or land mass you intend to use them on. Knowledge of global maps or experience with puzzles is helpful.<br/><br/>The winner must get all their tiles onto the map first, and this is best accomplished by retaining tiles for strategic regions, passing or acting on certain opportunities, and, maintaining options to move Ricky the Cat when and where desired. After someone wins, the remaining players can continue the game to complete the global map competing with moves to use up their tiles soonest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pletore is a drawless territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>Two stones, or a stone and an empty point, see each other if they lie on the same row or column and there are no other stones between them along that line. You pinch a point if it sees stones of your color in at least one horizontal direction and one vertical direction. You control a point if you pinch it while your opponent does not. To flip a stone is to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions: a) Pass, provided that there are no empty points or every empty point is controlled by some player. b) Place a stone of your color on an empty point not controlled by your opponent. c) Flip an enemy stone on a point you control. On even-sized boards only, to prevent mirror play, the position after White's first move must be such that flipping the two stones on the board is not equivalent to rotating the board by 180&ordm;. The game ends when both players pass in succession. The player with the higher score in the final position wins. Your score is the number of stones of your color on the board, plus the number of empty points you control, plus komi in the case of White. The button is used to avoid ties.<br/><br/>Komi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as compensation for going second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. Alternatively, experienced players may agree on a standard value for all games. The button is a special token which is placed next to the board at the start of the game. It is only used when komi and the board size have the same parity (i.e. they are both odd or both even). On your turn, if neither player has taken the button yet, you may not pass, but you may take the button instead of making a board play. At the end of the game, a half point is added to the score of the player who has taken the button.<br/><br/>Pletore was inspired by Michał Zapała's Tumbleweed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It has been a long time since Cherry &ldquo;the Good Magician&rdquo; lost her grandfather in the great magical battle that would change the world of Kawarando forever. Since then, the young magician has been taking care of the Magical Forest with the help of her inseparable friend Ito, a brave and crazy character from the culopochos village. Together they take care of the crops in the garden where the best obakameshi (consciously evolved foods) fruits and vegetables grow, and that's not an easy task. When the harvesting season arrives, they must face the so-called Bad Roots, who will not hesitate to bite the harvesters and try to eat the other obakameshi roots.<br/><br/>In this game there are 3 types of root cards: radishes, turnips and carrots. Although the 3 are differentiated by the back side of the cards, they are shuffled together to form an unique playing deck. After this, the first 3 cards are placed face down on the table, and the active player will choose which root shoot to draw (reveal). The obtained roots will be placed on the table from left to right, forming rows of each type of root. If a Bad Root appears, it should be placed to the left of the row of cards of its root type. If the player doesn't do anything to remove the Bad Root it will eat one root of its type at the end of every turn.If a second Bad Root (no matter what class it is) appears on the same player's table, they will both devour each other. A misterious character named Tomatenstein will also appears on the cards. When it shows up it will take all the Bad Roots that are in play directly to the discard area.<br/><br/>In addition, each player will have 4 Ito action cards from the beginning of the game. With them they can send the Bad Roots to other players' zones, eliminate them, or cancel the last revealed card.<br/><br/>Each root collected has a score. When the cards in the game deck are gone, the game will be over. The player with the most root points will be the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It will be largely modified and completed in order to integrate the scenarios of the Earth Cycle and to allow an even greater immersion in the Pajan universe. This booklet allows to link a large number of unpublished scenarios or spread in the different boxes and extensions of the Water Cycle and Earth Cycle to create a huge campaign using more than 50 different scenarios and quests.<br/><br/>In the course of their adventure, Heroes will travel across much of the empire, from the cold city of the Silver Silks to the azure seas of the south to the snowy mountains of the 7 Monasteries range. Depending on the circumstances, their choices, their successes (or failures), the sequence of scenarios will be completely different, allowing for a unique adventure.<br/><br/>",

And aircraft will be forced to &quot;retire&quot;, as newer, better aircraft become available.<br/><br/>Victory conditions are two-fold, and are scored at the end of each turn - most cash on hand, and most major airports under control.<br/><br/>In addition to this, the game has a Bot system that not only allows every game to have 6 companies, but actually speed up play in the process.<br/><br/>Turbofans comes in two flavors - the Basic game can be played in 60-90 minutes, and the Standard game comes in around the time it takes to play most 18XX games.

It won't be easy but it will be rewarding when you manipulate, cheat, lie, beg, borrow and steal your way to a victory in Villain VS.<br/><br/>Villain VS is a cutthroat, win at all cost challenge to any serious strategist to test their true skill in a game that requires you to work with and against other players for a chance to survive till the end and win the game. VVS is not meant to be a fair game.<br/><br/>Players deal and trade Evidence Cards in the first stage until they have the enough of the required Evidence Cards to capture an escaped Villain Card and build their Villain Teams.  Once all players have a completed Villain Team the Battle Stage starts. Players battle their Villains against the other player's Villain Teams until only one Team or Villain remains.<br/><br/>The player who survives till the end wins the game.<br/><br/>There is a companion Journal called &quot;Journal #27 Creating VVS &amp; The Singularity&quot; explaining the history of the Game and its creation by Dr. Penelope I. Primrose High Priestess Coven of The Eternal and why she chose to trap the evil that bore our realm it's worst Villains.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the weary eight-year-long full-scale anti-fascist war, the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC), temporarily united to resist invasion by militaristic Japan, were once again faced with the crisis of breaking up. An outright war that would soon engulf the whole country was about to come.<br/><br/>This strategic-level wargame applies our innovative game system specially designed for the Chinese Civil War. You will play as the Chinese Nationalist Party or the Chinese Communist Party through the civil war between 1945 and 1949. With a unique attack-and-reaction system and area control system, you can experience different tactics such as mobile warfare and guerrilla warfare in the Chinese Civil War, deploying resources across the whole country. With a political simulation and event system, you can also experience the political gambles of both sides in the civil war.<br/><br/>This is a war that will determine the fate of China's future. Should you concentrate your superior forces to destroy the enemy in one move, or reserve your strength by mobile operations? Should you strive to lead your side to a total victory in the war or conduct negotiations to gain an advantage in the coalition government? The choice is up to you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "StarForce Commander is a game of tactical starship combat. It uses streamlined and intuitive game mechanics so you can focus on tactical decision-making. You are NOT merely resolving the battle by doing bookkeeping and rolling dice. You have decisions to make, and your decisions matter. There are tactical tradeoffs for every choice. This is an accessible and fun game, whether you are a new cadet or a crusty old spacer. Optional rules let you tailor the complexity to your preferences.<br/><br/>Check Out our first instructional video on YouTube. THis video covers Basic Maneuvering, or search for &quot;StarForce Commander Mariner Games&quot; to find other videos as we add them.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://youtu.be/iT6T6sQeBak\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://youtu.be/iT6T6sQeBak</a><br/><br/>As the Captain, you decide where the ship&rsquo;s emphasis is; weapons, shields, or maneuvering? You will manage individual ships by allocating energy, arming weapons, maintaining shields, using sensors, and deciding how to outmaneuver your opponent. It sounds like a lot, but most ships have 6-8 points of energy to distribute, so you won&rsquo;t need an accounting staff! Your crew works out details.<br/><br/>Strike the right balance between weapons, maneuvering, shields, and sensors to gain an advantage on your enemy. Weapons require power and have firing arcs, so you must maneuver to hit the enemy where they are weak. Your ship has four shields protecting all sides, so maneuvering, repairing, and reinforcing weakened shields are vital to survival. Seven turn templates handle maneuvering for 20-60 degree turns depending on your ship&rsquo;s speed and maneuverability.<br/><br/>Managing a ship is easy enough that with a bit of practice, you can promote yourself to commodore and command 3-4 ships, or even admiral if you want to fight a larger battle. A game takes about 45 minutes per ship on the board, though duels can finish more quickly.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What was life like for the millions of professional, conscripted or recruited soldiers, who fought in the Ypres salient during the great war? The trench experience involved the terror of mud, slime and disease and the constant threat of shellfire. Heavy artillery and new weapons such as poison gas and machine guns threatened<br/>death from afar; but hand to hand combat with clubs and knives killed many during the grisly business of trench raids. <br/>When troops were not fighting, they were locked into trench deadlock, at which point  boredom also became a serious issue. Luckily there where the letters from home and regular<br/>behind the lines periods to keep the soldiers going.<br/><br/>This game, or rather simulation, lets you lead your character(s) through the great war.<br/>It&rsquo;s very uncertain that a soldier who starts at the beginning of the war will make it until November 11,1918 but maybe he is lucky.<br/>Best is to take into account that this game will make you have several soldiers who will at a certain moment during the war get killed in the field, die of wounds, get wounded but rejoin their unit, get a wound that will get them home as a cripple, have them hospitalized with health problems from which they maybe recover but equally have a chance to be send home; unfit for further duty. Finaly there are mental problems like shell shock in the game. A soldier has the chance to get fit for duty after a while or be send home to a mental institute but there is also a chance that he will be threatened as a coward who is unwilling to serve. In that case he will end before the firing squad.<br/><br/>This is a role playing game for 1 to six players where you build the stories of soldiers around Ypres by using cards, tables and some sheets. Let your imagination create their lives and death while in Flanders fields.<br/>Like real life soldiers you for your character will have almost no influence on it.<br/>But you have some topics that you can get changes on. That, in the end, could become the difference between life and death.<br/><br/>The game is mainly card driven. Since the trench lines only fluctuated little  during the conflict around Ypres there is no use for a map of the area.<br/>For the soldiers a trench was a trench, maps where something for the higher ranks.<br/>Each game round plays over a two months period in which a series of events will take place.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Advancing Fire normally works only on deeply historical games, but this time we are proud to produce the work of an important external developer, that is a unique and very interesting release.<br/><br/>TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR&rsquo;S PACK is the collection of ASL scenarios designed by Enrico Catanzaro (known in ASL community as ecz)  with an experience of about thirty years as ASL player and Tournament Director of ASL tournaments, as well as wargamer and chess player. His main attention turned in particular to the balance and replayability, while trying to develop interesting and innovative dynamics. The Tournament Director's Pack features 16 scenarios all using dedicated new rules which are used to decide sides and Victory Conditions at once. We made sure the scenarios were playtested by many different level players, from the best who won many tournaments to the inexperienced ones, and they have shown, with their rules for determining the VCs, to be suitable for all levels, and to have a very high replayability. These scenarios are ideal for use in tournaments or to practice competitive ASL, maintaining a high adherence to the war events they represent.<br/><br/>ecz1 The Bet,  Tr&oslash;gstad, Norway, April 1940. An old classic first created for a scenario design contest on the Game Squad forum and later published by Le Franc Tireur (LFT 181). This is the scenario where CBS made its debut. The Germans must control a village defended by a Norwegian MG company. 5.5 turns on two boards.<br/><br/>ecz2 Liberating Bukovina, Bukovina, July 1941. 6.5 turns and three boards for a Romanian attack vs Russians in the first stage of Barbarossa. Cavalry and tin cans in the OB.<br/><br/>ecz3 Turf Wars in Mongolia, Mongolian-Manchurian border dispute in May 1939. Two boards and 5 turns for this all-cavalry action (with the exception of only two MMCs not mounted at the start). In this scenario Steppe terrain and Sun Blindness are in effect.<br/><br/>ecz4 Flash and Thunder, Neuville-au-plain River, Normandy June 1944, in the first hours of the D-Day. A company of Paratroopers tries to find their officers, regroup, and move toward its objective, avoiding the German garrison patrolling the area and increasing its presence turn by turn. Three boards and 7.5 turns for this scenario where movement is crucial.<br/><br/>ecz5 The Good and the Bad, Montefiorino Italy, July 1944. The final action of the largest Partisan battle fought in Italy. In this scenario (three boards and 7 turns), Fascists and SS using Armored Cars, Flamethrowers, OBA and a lot of firepower, jointly attack a small town defended by elements of the Partisan Division &lsquo;Modena&rsquo;. The Defenders must stay in the town as long as possible to prevent the Fascists from making a large scale encirclement and exiting off the opposite board edge, and try to save their lives by retreating into the woods before it is too late.<br/><br/>ecz6 A Diurnal Assault, Central Stalingrad, October 1942. 7 turns. This time the Russians are on the attack, but they must watch for a German counterattack. In this scenario, setup is sequential, counter by counter. Both players have the chance to attack in depth or to play more conservatively to parry the enemy offensive blow by blow. Soviets have Rocket OBA!<br/><br/>ecz7 Clash of Cans, Guadalajara, Spain, March 1937. The first attempt at a large scale armored blitz by the Italian army during the Spanish civil war in this all (tin can) armor scenario. Six Italian L35s face 4 Light Russian tanks in a three board, 6 turn scenario. Clash of Cans is a complementary scenario to &lsquo;The Puma Prowls&rsquo; that could easily be used as a teaching tool for AFV rules, particularly the platoon-movement rules which aren&rsquo;t used in the Puma Prowls scenario.<br/><br/>ecz8 A Hot Week in Sicily, Sicily, August 1943. Again in Sicily for the crucial moment of the battle for Troina. The men in Monte Basilio were isolated, flanked and were suffering ammo and water shortage, but they held heroically against the final push of the 15th Panzer Granadier division in this 6 turn, three board scenario.<br/><br/>ecz9 Culquaber, Ethiopia, November 1941. This time the action moves to the Italian East-African colony where the elite &lsquo;Carabinieri&rsquo; fought a hopeless battle against an overwhelmingly superior enemy force on the famous &lsquo;Cliff of the Crags&rsquo;. In this 7 turn, two board scenario there are also warbands of natives fighting each other as allies of the Commonwealth and of the Italians.<br/><br/>ecz10 The Capture of Malta, Krendi Airfield, Malta, July 1942. A fictional, &lsquo;what if&hellip;&rsquo; scenario in which the Italians and Germans jointly launch &lsquo;Operation Hercules&rsquo;. We can see German Paratroopers and Italian Marines of the &lsquo;Battaglione San Marco&rsquo; fighting together against the Malta garrison in a 6.5 turn scenario on three half boards for the capture of a small airport in the south of the island.<br/><br/>ecz11 Blood and Brine, Calais, France, May 1940. Another scenario created for a design contest on the Game Squad forum. In the dramatic days of the great retreat of the BEF, the battle of Calais was decisive to delay the German advance to Dunkirk. Blood and Brine is a two board, 6.5 turn scenario featuring a very peculiar SSR about &lsquo;random (German) air attacks&rsquo; on the British units tied to the SAN.<br/><br/>ecz12 A Tragic Victory, Vilnius, Poland, July 1944. Another scenario coming from a design contest. The dramatic last battle of the Polish Home Army, winning on the field against the Germans, but doomed to deportation by Soviet hands in the following days. In this 5.5 turn, two board scenario, with the help of the Russians of the Belorussian Front, the Polish force successfully closed any escape path for the Germans trapped in Vilnius.<br/><br/>ecz13 Leaving Changsha, South-Central China, October 1939. This urban, 5.5 turns, Sino-Japanese battle on two half boards depicts the attempt of the Japanese 13th Division to break the encirclement and leave Changsha.

        "description": "Chak is a Chess and Xiangqi style game designed by Couch Tomato in 2021 specifically to answer the hypothetical question of what a chess variant developed by mesoamerican cultures would look like. The design philosophy was to start from scratch and use only the common elements from all forms of chess: a king, a rook-type piece, a knight-like piece, and some sort of pawns; the rest would develop organically infusing a specific Mesoamerican culture -- in this case, the Maya.<br/><br/>The various pieces move and capture in different ways by replacing the captured piece, as in chess, and victory is achieved by checkmating or stalemating the opposing king. An alternate win condition called &quot;altar mate&quot; is achieved by moving the king into the opponent's space on the board called the &quot;temple.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In March 1915 they sent a fleet of battleships through the Dardanelles in an effort to reach the Turkish capitol, Constantinople, and force the Ottoman government to surrender.<br/><br/>However, the Dardanelles were well defended by forts and sea mines and the Allied fleet suffered heavy losses. The naval campaign was abandoned until the forts could be captured by amphibious assault.<br/><br/>The game focuses on the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) sector of the campaign; thus, it does not cover the British and French landings at Cape Helles or Suvla Bay.<br/><br/>The board presents one of the narrowest sections of the Gallipoli Peninsula, from ANZAC Cove to Mal Tepe and Khetia Bay. The ANZAC goal was to capture this area and cut off the Turkish forces fighting the British and French at Cape Helles further south.<br/><br/>The heights of Chunuk Bair and Mal Tepe were considered especially important because they provided observation of both sides of the Peninsula. From here the ANZACs could capture the forts which dominated the Narrows and thus allow the battleships of the Royal Navy to sail up to Constantinople. At least that is what was supposed to happen.<br/><br/>In fact, the British commanders had seriously under-estimated the Turkish resistance. The Turkish soldiers were veterans of the Balkan Wars, armed with modern, German-made rifles and artillery. Inspired by the leadership of Colonel Kemal and Lieutenant Colonel Sefik, they stopped the ANZACs in their tracks. The ANZACs only managed to establish a small beachhead, which was repeatedly counterattacked by the Turks.<br/><br/>In August 1915, the British and ANZACs made another attempt to seize the ridges of Sari Bair. The New Zealanders and Gurkhas managed to capture the heights for two days but were eventually overwhelmed by Turkish counterattacks. In December, after eight months of fighting, the ANZAC forces were evacuated.<br/><br/>In the words of Australian war correspondent, Charles Bean: &ldquo;ANZAC stands for reckless valour in a good cause, for enterprise, resourcefulness, fidelity, comradeship and endurance that will never admit defeat.&rdquo;<br/><br/>So what went wrong?<br/><br/>To quote the 'Gallipoli 1915' Facebook page: &quot;At Gallipoli, inexperienced troops, led by untested commanders, supported by staffs that had yet to learn their jobs were sent with wholly inadequate artillery, ammunition and logistical support to perform one of the most challenging operations of war: an opposed landing on an enemy shore. Add in the nature of the terrain and we can begin to understand how it was that 4,000 Australians landing that early morning of 25th April 1915 were held up by a force that, initially, numbered only around 80 Turks.&quot;<br/><br/>Lest we forget.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1938 went from bad to worse for the Republican cause in Spain. Successes the previous year at Guadalajara, Teruel and Belchite were undone by Nationalist victories that overran Vizcaya as well as continued and massive military support from Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. Madrid was finally cut off and fell in the early summer and many outside of Spain felt the cause was lost. However, there was some hope in the Republican enclave centered on Barcelona. A new and friendly government came to power in France that reopened shipments of badly needed arms and supplies, and new shipments of arms from the Soviet Union successfully made it past the Nationalist blockade, reinvigorating the Republican forces still in the field. A larger war in Europe was increasingly apparent, and it was hoped that if the Republican forces could hold out long enough, they could be part of this larger conflict against fascism. As such, the Republican military decided upon a bold offensive across the Ebro River to retake ground in Valencia, as well as demonstrate that all was not lost.<br/><br/>Each copy of Tercio de la Muerte is composed of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Two 11 by 17 inch map sections with Turn and Game Record tracks.<br/>     154 un-mounted, double sided units.<br/>     This set of rules.<br/><br/><br/>Players will also need a standard deck of playing cards and a six-sided die (D6) to play the game. Units represent regiments or brigades or regiments (infantry, cavalry) and companies (infantry detachments and armor). Each turn represents three days of time. A map hex is a little less than 1.5 miles across.<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of playing cards (a custom card set is available from the publisher) to activate their units and determine some game events (Random Event and End of Turn occurrence). A six-sided die is used to determine how air and artillery strikes a player has each turn, as well to resolve those types of attacks as well as for resolving ground combat between opposing units.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In Mafia: Cards, designed for 7-20 players, some players take on the roles of mafia members, while others become civilians of the criminal community. Every night the mafia kills another person, and every day the civilians have a chance to discuss the murder, choose suspects, and sentence one of them to death. Because each role is secret, you never know who is an innocent bystander and who is part of the mafia. If the mob kills enough civilians, the community will become a permanent haven for criminals, but if the civilians rid their community of the mob, they win.<br/><br/>Mafia: Crime Scene offers 24 different character cards, as well as 55 superpower cards for a fun game. You can play as a don, a doctor, an innocent bystander, or a cunning minion. Whatever your role, play it convincingly, make your choices carefully, and trust no one.<br/><br/>As a gift also comes a premium subscription - 1 month, for our application, with which your game will be even cooler and more interesting.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We hit the dirt and looked around with anxious waiting eyes, and said a prayer as mortars came raining from the skies&rdquo; &ndash;Opening stanza of an anonymous veteran&rsquo;s poem about the attack at Tan Son Nhut.<br/><br/>When the Communist forces of North and South Vietnam launched the 1968 Tet Offensive one component was an attack on the Tan Son Nhut airbase north and west if Saigon. This was the largest airbase in South Vietnam, with its aircraft ferrying men and material from the US, as well as basing combat aircraft that support military operations throughout all the region.<br/><br/>The Communist offensive was supported by the National Liberation Front&rsquo;s 9th Infantry Division  that had recently been rebuilt following extensive losses fighting the US and ARVN (Army of the Republic of [South] Vietnam) by the attachment of the 267th and 269th Main Force Battalions. The assault force would also include sappers attached to the division&rsquo;s 1st Battalion of the 271st Regiment who were armed with satchel demolition charges used to destroy the base&rsquo;s aircraft and air control towers, as well as the division&rsquo;s mortar and rocket artillery batteries. The battle here would usher in a new phase of the Vietnam conflict. Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>Each copy of Nothing to Lose is composed of the following:<br/><br/>Two 11 by 17 inch map area map sheets with game tracks and tables.<br/><br/>One sheet of 80 double-sided, unmounted counters<br/><br/>One rules booklet<br/><br/>A standard deck of playing cards (a custom card set is available) and ten sided die are needed to play the game.<br/><br/>Each turn of the game represents one hour of time. Units are mostly companies (I). Tank units represent 2 (full strength) or 1 (reduced) vehicles. An inch on the map is about 200 yards.<br/><br/>Players use playing cards to determine which player gets to activate and with how many units, as well as determine when to determine random events for the turn and the end of the turn. The die is used to resolve combats (assault, air and artillery strikes), rally units and perform other game functions. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by Nils Johansson.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

There is one other little problem&ndash;the mansion is haunted.<br/>You will arrive at the mansion as night falls. The clock marks off the hours as you explore the decaying rooms and dark halls in search of the fortune. But you aren&rsquo;t the only creatures that walk those floors. Monsters haunt the rooms of the mansion and intend to make you one of them.<br/><br/>If the monsters wound you three times, you will become one of the walking dead who hunt the live players, for by wounding them you can be restored to life. The living player who has collected the most money by sunrise will be declared the winner.<br/>Yet the mansion holds another secret. Somewhere in the dust-covered rooms are six pages of scripture verses that can end the mansion&rsquo;s curse and bring the dead players back to life. If you can find the six verses and give them all to one player before sunrise, the curse will end and all of my money will be distributed to the players equally.<br/><br/>The choice is yours: work together to assemble the verses before sunrise and share the victory, or work alone to avoid the monsters and dead players and try to collect the most money for yourself!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You will find troop stats and special rules for Irish Gallowglass, Hussite War Wagons, and Landsknecht Pikemen along with all the other troop types to be found on battlefields of the period, from Hundred Years&rsquo; War France to Renaissance Italy.<br/><br/>The game uses a card-driven turn sequence and simple but exciting combat mechanisms (with loads of dice being rolled!) to produce battles that are full of period flavour but always unpredictable.<br/><br/>The following are the Theatres and Conflicts in this book:<br/><br/><br/>     Albion &ndash; The Wars of the Roses<br/>     Gallia &ndash; The Hundred Years&rsquo; War<br/>     Bohemia &ndash; The Hussite Wars<br/>     Helvetia &ndash; The Swiss-Burgundian War<br/>     Italia &ndash; The Italian Wars<br/>     Northumbria &ndash; The Anglo-Scottish Border Reivers<br/>     Lusitania &ndash; Late Medieval Portugal<br/>     Hibernia &ndash; Warfare in Ireland<br/><br/><br/>Finally, there is a Modelling Masterclass chapter with a comprehensive guide to painting, modelling, and kitbashing 28mm plastic figures.<br/><br/>The book is an A4, 180-page, full-colour, softback (perfect bound) publication.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Treating each day at the shop as a &ldquo;game day&rdquo;, Clyde challenges his employees to outshine each other on the field of battle (behind the counter).

Flavors will vary in point value based on your hidden assignment.<br/><br/>On your turn, utilize special scooper tricks to manipulate your and/or your opponents' scoops to your benefit: swap a scoop from one cone to another, mix the order of scoops on a single cone, or plop a random scoop from the deck on any cone.

Minutes after the officer radios in the grotesque findings, a courier delivers a package containing a disturbing VHS tape. Your friend, Phil Herbert with VFPD, gives you a call to immediately bring you in on the case because you were so helpful during Duel, the previous Scourge case.

Players select their first 5-man army for the first battle, and assign each general a troop type based on that generals allowances and the strategic advantages that player wants to pursue. Then each player assigns those units to the first battlefield.<br/><br/>Generals move about the battlefield, attacking enemy generals, but with a twist. The skills that each general has allow him to do more than just make basic attacks. They allow him to both manipulate the enemy units and his own to his advantage, but, more importantly, the correct use of a skill can trigger another friendly general to use one of his skills, adding more damage to the attack. That general's use of a skill could trigger another, an so on. The real strategy is trying to make the most of your generals' skills and build wildly powerful combos of attacks on the battlefield to destroy your opponent's army.<br/><br/>After each battle, the winning player gains Mandate according to the number of his generals still alive. After 6 battles, if one player has more Mandate, that player is the winner. If players are tied, there will be a 7th and final battle, using all 10 of those players' generals, to determine the victor.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "5D20 Football is a game built for the solo gamer. Everything runs off the roll of 5 d20 dice. The game is fairly simple yet has depth in how plays turnout. The tabletop version uses charts and dice.<br/><br/>To begin with the dice are rolled to get the play type, depth, and the who which is all based off a teams' offensive chart. The plays take into account the down, distance, and the ball location on the field. Later in the game, time left and the score can affect the play calls as well. This roll also on occasion can trigger a fumbled snap or a pre-snap penalty.<br/><br/>Once the play is known we progress to the play itself which require rolling 5d20 dice. To start, the red die gets you the defender for the play (this player comes off the defensive teams chart), and who the player is also depends on the game situation (a passing situation is more likely to get a player from the secondary while a run play is more likely to have a lineman).<br/><br/>For a PASS: The white die gives you how the defender affects the play. They can get pressure on a QB, get a chance to break up a pass, allow an open receiver, which will result in the receiver making a catch, a drop, or yards after a catch. The blue die is checked against the QB or the receiver, depending on what the defensive player allowed. The black die gets your yardage and the yellow die is for a possible penalty.<br/><br/>For a RUN: The white die gives you how the defender affects the play. They can get penetration and hit a runner in the backfield, hit the runner at the line, or allow a hole for the runner to run through. The blue die gets how the runner reacts to what the defense gave them by spinning away from a loss, to breaking a run through a hole. The black die gets you the yardage gained and the yellow die is used for a possible penalty.<br/><br/>Special team plays are as simple as rolling the 5d20 and using them to get distance, the returner and yardage, along with chances for penalties and fumbles.<br/><br/>Players are rated so that their impact in the game reflect their real life styles. So while the game may seem simple there is a ton of interaction allowing everything that happens in a football game to happen on the tabletop with 5D20 Football.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Revolution: State of War is a 2 player asymmetric military strategy on the Armed struggle for American Independence.  The primary objective is to establish and maintain the support of the population for your cause, but to do so often requires one to have control or possession of the territory where people live, and for that one must take command of your nation's forces, maneuver and engage in battles to secure the colonies.<br/><br/>Both sides have very unique and distinct advantages.  The British with their professional force and naval prowess can dominate coastal positions, but may have some difficulty when getting too far away from their coastal bases.  They know the longer the war drags on the more chances Americans will have to secure French support along with building up their forces to a higher standard.  As such, the British will want to hit the ground running and maintain the pressure, seeking out engagement after engagement to decimate the rebel forces so when they are better trained it will be immaterial at that point, or a day late and a dollar short.<br/><br/>The American's on the other hand need time to secure an alliance with the French and convert this rag-tag band of revolutionaries into a professional army to really flip the script but one doesn't always get the army they want, when they need it and have to fight with the army they have.  As such, to buy time and save face with the population the American forces will need to make the British advance as costly as possible by occupying advantageous terrain, leveraging the support of the population with Militia forces, and knowing when to simply run away.<br/><br/>The game incorporates cards but is not a card driven game, the cards provide enhancements and bonus abilities as well as enable deception actions that can really through a wrench in the works for your opponent.<br/><br/>When forces contest territory on the Game Board, the game zooms in to a unique battle sequence, which is a mini-game itself; units deploy into lanes of combat and roll dice to score hits and kills with bonuses and enhancements for aspects like rout, exposed flank (enfilade), and Dragoon Charge.<br/><br/>Can you lead your nations forces to victory?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The moon is the next frontier of human civilization and mega-corporations rush to build colonies on the harsh lunar landscape. Joint ventures must be formed to complete the behemoth cities of the future, but the corporations, desperate to maximize profits and secure their legacy, never stop fighting for majority control.<br/><br/>In Lunar Chess, you and an opponent play as two such corporations. On your turn, you will add a card to the shared colony, enlarging groups of various development types: housing, crystal farms, and solar arrays. Every card you lay also activates the movement of your Speculator who is dispatched to make investments on your behalf. At the end of the game, you will identify the largest group of each development type. The player who made the majority of investments in these groups is the winner.<br/><br/>Lunar Chess borrows elements from Western chess and blends them with modern mechanisms like area control and tile-laying to create a unique gaming experience that feels part abstract and part strategy game. Lunar Chess is both tactical and strategic and is full of surprises.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion for Lion Rampant: Medieval Wargaming Rules explores the Mediterranean world before the crusades through the adventures of the exiled Viking prince Harald Hardrada (&ldquo;hard ruler&rdquo;). Harald is best known for his invasion of England in 1066 as king of Norway, and for his death at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, which was a prelude to the Norman conquest of England. However, between 1033 and 1042 Harald spent his formative years as a commander in the famous Varangian Guard of Byzantium, taking part in campaigns in Upper Mesopotamia, Palestine, the Aegean Sea, Southern Italy, and the Balkans.<br/><br/>In this supplement you will find historical information, new upgrades (from new tactics, such as Feigned Retreat, to terrain upgrades, among others), and three mini-campaigns based on extracts from Norse sagas and Mediterranean chronicles. The first campaign is a fight against a bandit boss in the Holy Land during an armed pilgrimage to rebuild the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem; the second takes place during a Byzantine attempt to retake Sicily from its Muslim rulers; and the third one tackles the early stages of the Norman conquest of Southern Italy.<br/><br/>At the same time, there is no requirement to use Harald and the Varangians. This supplement includes five army lists (Varangians, Muslim Powers, Byzantines, Normans, Lombard and Byzantine Italian principalities), and alternative leaders for each of the campaigns with suggested skills based on their back stories.<br/><br/>The campaigns are also easily adaptable to other medieval contexts and to other rules sets.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But what if there was a new version of  Mafia, where the game experience becomes more diverse, unused and balanced with each card having a special ability. A team of players with 5 years of experience playing Mafia came up with an advanced version of Mafia. Our team has tested this version of Mafia in London for the last half a year. The result is that after playing Fantasy Mafia no one wanted to play the usual city  Mafia ever again. The cards for this Mafia are for sale in two languages ​​​​(English and Russian).There are also two different card designs themed in &quot;Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Science fiction&quot; settings. The cards also exist in two formats - &quot;Poker&quot; size  and &quot;Tarot &quot; size.<br/><br/>Different timeline settings - this version of Mafia has either :<br/><br/><br/>     High Fantasy styled cards<br/>     Science fiction styled cards<br/><br/><br/>In this version of Mafia each Card has a different ability, so up to 21 abilities per pack of 21 cards.<br/><br/>Some &quot;abilities&quot; examples:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot; After the death a player gains a new card chosen from 5&quot;<br/>     &quot;The Player can choose whom he starts the game as Mafia, Killer or Villager &quot;   <br/><br/><br/>",

Quests give you goals to accomplish in order to earn influence. Production adds resources to the game board. Crafting allows you to add resources and workers to your buildings. Harvest is a time to feed your workers and prepare them for the year. Finally, the Action phase is the core of the game where you'll use your workers to move, collect resources, improve the land, build structures, and even attack other workers.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hell on Halloween is a 1-vs-all retro horror themed game. One person acts as the killer and tries to murder all players before midnight, while all victims try their best to survive until midnight on Halloween night.<br/><br/>There are six rounds indicated by hours during the night eg. 6-7pm. Each round consists these phases: stalking, trick or treat, location, encounter, combat, regroup.<br/><br/>Stalking is when the killer plans the round, drawing location cards and selecting a hidden area they are stalking. They also lay traps around town.<br/><br/>Victims will go trick-or-treating around the board, rolling for candy to use in the location phase. The killer also rolls for a chance to place razor blades in candy to cause injuries, forcing a victim to visit the hospital.<br/><br/>During the location phase, the killer reveals the traps they have laid causing further damage. The killer shows victims where they have been prowling, causing some to hide. Victims consume the candy they collected to relocate to better areas where they can search for supplies later on.<br/><br/>The encounter phase is when the killer reveals their hidden stalked location card. This phase will play out differently depending on where victims are in relation to the killer, but various things happen such as sabotaging supplies, finding fuel and med kits, and searching locations for weapons and trait cards. Relocating to stay in groups can also occur.<br/><br/>The Combat Phase initiates any time a victim is at the same location as the killer. Weapon cards would have been collected by now at locations and during game set-up. Each weapon card has allocated strike cards red/green. Each player will draw strike cards equal to their weapon cards. All hits are added together and combat is resolved, taking items or inflicting damage.<br/><br/>Regroup is when the board is reset for the next hour of Halloween night and the only time victims can share their items collected during the previous round/hour.<br/><br/>If at least one victim reaches midnight alive, the team wins, and if the killer murders all victims, they will be victorious.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You enter the temple courtyard, a monk logger puts away wood, he greets you and welcomes you, on your left, two residents in full meditation.<br/><br/>Yautman and El Choucas, these two legendary guides, congratulate you on having arrived so far...<br/><br/>...But rest, you will need it, they are giving you a new challenge!<br/><br/>The Ultimate Trek contains 3 Mountains: the bottom one with white squares, the middle one with green squares, and the top one with blue squares.<br/>You can play Ultimate Trek in Expedition Mode (Multiplayer or Free Solo). Namely that the Shipping is done in one go and not in 3 steps. The end goal is to achieve the highest score (you don't earn reputation stars during the Trek ultimatum)<br/><br/>The normal rules of Trek 12 apply, plus the following constraints:<br/><br/>     It is mandatory to start from the bottom mountain, in one of the 4 lowest squares. Then, the classic rules (enter a value in an adjacent box) apply until the 3 mountains are completely filled.<br/>     Each mountain has its own table for choosing the outcome of the dice. You must necessarily fill in the boxes of a mountain with the table specific to this mountain (it is for example forbidden to fill in a box of the white mountain using the table of the blue mountain). (to help you: pay attention to the arrows).<br/>     The passage from one mountain to another is done only via Rope Paths (represented by dotted junctions). It is forbidden to move from one mountain to another with a Zone.<br/>     BONUS: the first player to connect a lower square (therefore without a compass) with a square adjacent to a flag surrounds the latter. This will bring him a corresponding bonus at the end of the game. In the event of a tie, both players score the bonus. In Free Solo, there is no need to indicate anything since both players score the bonus anyway. Better to score it anyway in order to try to beat the absolute record of the ascent!<br/>     The use of Assistance cards is possible (but not compulsory, we advise you to warm up with a simple game before!). Obtaining an Assistance Card is done in different ways:<br/>         Setup: Shuffle all assist cards and make a face down draw pile.<br/>         Each time an area of 0, 1 or 2 is made, draw 3 cards and keep one. Discard the other 2.<br/>         When the stack is empty shuffle the discard pile and create a new stack.<br/>        You can use as many Assistance Cards as you want during a game, but the limit of 3 Assistance Cards in hand is still valid. At the end of the game, the unused cards in hand always bring a bonus of 3 points!<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Almighty: A Game of Gods &amp; Ends is a competitive game of divine proportions. You are a primordial cosmic deity who wants to build and control an eclectic pantheon of gods and act upon your various followers in all the ways that ancient deities tend to do: create marvelous miracles, bring about horrible curses, generate mysterious omens, and make increasingly outrageous demands &mdash; all to amass the divine power needed to perform even greater acts, attract even better followers, fulfill the best top-shelf prophecies, and prove once and for all that YOU are the almightiest in the universe!<br/><br/>Almighty is a tableau-building game of hand and resource management, with a dash of tile placement and area control. Each turn, players choose a god in their pantheon to perform an act card from their hand, impacting one or more of their followers. Acts and followers generate boons, such as Belief (used to buy new gods from an open market, as well as better acts and followers), Power (needed at increasingly higher levels to perform better acts and impact better followers), more followers (with higher, more valuable populations), and Souls (which grant endgame victory points, but offer bonuses if spent during the game). Acts are performed in one of four lands shared between all players; the more presence you have in a land, the cheaper it will be for you to build temples there, and each land grants a different amount of victory points for temples at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game is broken into several ages, during which players compete to have the most boons of a specific type. Players also have three private prophecy cards to work toward, but must choose only one to score at the End of Days &mdash; the final, apocalyptic doomsday round of the game in which every player does their almighty best to make their final mark on the doomed mortal plane. The player with the most points at the end wins the title of ALMIGHTY!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Whilst some Winter Sports enthusiasts might disagree the Slider event down a narrow,twisting and banked ice track isn't really a spectator sport. With only one sled on the run at any one time each might seem very similar to all the others give or take the odd 'drama' of a brush with an ice wall, or a trip too high up a banked curve, etc. But one aspect makes every run different and exciting - the intermediate Time Checks that are flashed onto large electronic scoreboards for all to see, so that everyone is aware just how close the sled currently on the run is to the run-leader, how much time needs to be made up in the remaining Sectors. Take those time checks away and, dare I suggest, you have a boring spectacle for live and television spectators?<br/><br/>But all this is lucky for us when presenting a replay simulation of the sport.<br/><br/>In sliding events start speed is vital. After 50 metres we get the first time check and that reflects how quickly the sled has been launched down the runway - in the team events that involves strength and running speed and a quick and tidy entry into the sled and settlement into the seats, in individual events 'pushing off' with feet or gloved hands.<br/><br/>But also the start is all about getting the sled moving as quickly as possible on its journey down the course, for what speed is achieved in that first 50 metres is the momentum that will build up over the run as the weight of sled and crew and the laws of gravity get to work. In 'Sliders' we provide a Start Rating, based on actual start times, which not only sets the first segment of elapsed time for the run but also determines what we call Raw Speed (momentum) which is carried forward to the next Sector. So a good start will bring two advantages, a low Elapsed Time and a good Raw Speed carry forward. Start Ratings range from 0 to 10.<br/><br/>Driver Skill (the range is 0 to 4) can be used in two ways. From Sector 2 onwards one DS can be used to increase the RS by 3 before the time for that Sector is determined, or used to improve the sled's Stability (ST) by 2. This represents the driver's ability to keep to the best racing line, and to ensure that the sled is 'in shape' and stable. The increase of 3 RS converts to a time saving of 0.03 secs., but again, as RS is carried forward, that is 0.03 secs. for this and each of the remaining Sectors, so gaining that advantage high up on the track is reflected all the way down. Stability is both a driver and team function, with the driver dictating the sled's line and the crew using their weight to keep the sled at the best angle and maintaining the narrow runners in best contact with the track. High up the course stability isn't really a problem, but as speeds build steadily down the run it becomes a vital factor and there is less time to get everything right. Once a sled starts to get 'out of shape', like RS, it is carried forward to the next Sector and as each Sector has a Stability Check it becomes progressively more of a problem, maybe needing the expenditure of a valuable DS to help correct the situation.<br/><br/>Initially the Stability Rating can be as high as 8, and until that is reduced there is unlikely to be a problem, but with lower Ratings failure of the Stability Check is likely and this will eat further into the ST figure and also reduce RS. 'Braking' (most sleds have some form of crude brakes) is a last resort for RS is automatically reduced by 20 in regaining some (1D6) STABILITY points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ephemeral Path is a quick and customizable skirmish game for two players. Ephemeral Path uses no set miniatures or figures but instead allows players to play with either printable pieces or miniatures they already own. Players create customized stats and ability combinations for each figure they play with by making figure stat sheets on the game's website and printing them off. Games are short, and use no custom dice or cards. Other than standard polyhedral dice, everything players need to play with is printable.<br/><br/>Story: The paths have opened up across space and time. Intelligent beings of all types have been lured through the mystifying black gates that mark the path&rsquo;s root. Whatever the being&rsquo;s reason for embarking along the path, science, curiosity, instinct, their aspirations have shifted to mere survival. Once the gate had been activated it vanishes shortly after, never returning. Those who managed to traverse the path found themselves on a desolate planet, with no way home. The planet grew more crowded and dangerous by the hour as intelligent creatures from every corner of the universe flooded its barren surface. After some time, the gates that mark the head of the path began to appear on this planet as well. With resources running thin, most chose to take their chances with these newly opened gates. If they could only get to them before they close.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 40cm x 40cm play area with a round, 9cm gate placed on the board. Each player begins the game with a set of between two and six figures.  Each figure has only two or three actions per game so players must use their actions precisely in order to maximize their chances of winning.  Players win by having the most figures in contact with the gate after each player has run out of actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Rune Forge adventure book introduces a different way of playing D100 Dungeon, and will give you choices much like a choose your own adventure game. It uses all of the D100 Dungeon rules from the main rulebook with a few modifications. Also included are new rules called &quot;Random Dungeons&quot;, that can be implemented into any of your games; whether you're playing a quest, campaign, or using the World Builder expansion.<br/><br/>You will need the D100 Dungeonrule book to use this book<br/><br/>THE RUNE FORGE ADVENTURE<br/><br/>Deep in the mountains to the northeast of the Arcane Tower is the Ruin Forge. It was built by the dwarves exactly 100 years after they completed the Arcane Tower. Work began in the year -2489 and took just nine years to complete. The Council of Seven, who commissioned its construction, chose its location beneath the Irontorn mountains, in an effort to hide it away from preying eyes, but alas it fell foul to a powerful demon named Vakanar. Vakanar is one of a handful of demon lords that first emerged from the Demon Gate after its construction in -2790. He craved a huge arcane power and set off on a mission to capture the White Tower. Along the way he summoned a horde of minions, but when he reach the Arcane Tower he learnt of a more powerful structure being built, The Rune Forge. He changed course and waited for its completion. Whilst the dwarves dug, he planned the attack and on the day the Rune Forge was finished, Vakanar and his minions devoured its caverns, spreading torture and fire to its darkest corners. Many dwarves escaped with their lives, but an unlucky few were left behind and were tortured to death to reveal the secret of the nine rune crystals the arcane council placed within its depths. One crystal for each scripture of magic and two more for balancing the arcane power of the forge.<br/><br/>Numerous battles took place to regain its control, but alas the Arcane Council and their battle mages failed to breach its depths. Then, after the Great Icing of -2300 and The Melting of -1400, the location of the Ruin Forge became lost. The Lair of Vakanar (another name for the lost forge) is now where the demon lord and his minions use the power of the nine arcane crystals to sustain and power their existence, preventing them from diminishing back to the demon realm.<br/><br/>You have heard this tale a thousand times, as it's told in every tavern across Terra. Warming your back to the camp fire, you keep watch and recount the story you overheard a few days ago in The Broken Claw, a scruffy little inn at the heart of Blitsworth&hellip;<br/><br/>By chance, you have found the entrance to the Rune Forge and must now delve its depths, find the forge and use its power to enchant an item. If you can present the enchanted item to the Council of Seven at the White Tower, it will prove you have found the location of their Lost Forge and secure a handsome reward.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players may perform the actions shown across their Cosmic Power card display in any order. Once a Cosmic Power has been used, players should add it to a face up discard pile. A player may perform as many actions as they wish, but they must end their Main Action Phase with at least two Cosmic Power cards still in their display area.<br/><br/>Upkeep Phase:<br/><br/>Once a player has concluded their Main Action Phase, they must then decide whether to keep any Cosmic Power cards they have left on display, (which may be used on their next turn), or discard any number of them. After a player has completed their upkeep phase, the next player begins their turn.<br/><br/>Additional Actions:<br/><br/>During your turn you may perform any number of the following additional actions at any time:<br/><br/>1. If you have any &ldquo;Instant Action&rdquo; Entity cards dormant (face-down) on your player board, you may turn them face-up to activate the action on them.<br/><br/>2. If you are currently positioned on a galaxy with a Gateway, you may move to any other Gateway at any time (Though no resources may be harvested).<br/><br/>3.

        "description": "Nightshift is a thematic board game that immerses players into the role of a strip club Dancer. The Customer stories and gameplay are inspired by the creator&rsquo;s personal experience working as a stripper, providing an authentic and empowering take on this often misunderstood profession.<br/><br/>Players must select from five different Dancers who each have a distinct approach to charming Customers. The goal is to earn the most money over the night. Be careful about interfering with another Dancer&rsquo;s Customer or your night may not run so smoothly...<br/><br/>Players use Action Points to Navigate the club and discover new Customers. Each Customer is unique and has variable wealth and loyalty, as well as a diverse range of potential outcomes. Some of them will have a preference for one particular Dancer. Choose your Customers wisely! Engaging with a Customer involves rolling the dice, which combined with the Player's abilities, Power Cards, and potentially a few Drinks, will determine the outcome.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Successfully getting a Customer to the Private Room, or even better, the VIP Room, initiates a theme-based &ldquo;push-your-luck&rdquo; challenge. The aim is to maximise earnings from the Customer without breaking the illusion... This is achieved by performing a combination of dance moves (via card draws) in the Private Room, or deepening your connection (via dice rolls) in the VIP Room, with the ultimate goal of making the Customer fall in love.<br/><br/>Players can purchase Drinks from the Bar. Champagne is a valuable tool for persuading Customers to extend their time with you in the Private Room or VIP Room, whilst Shots can help you get them in there.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Watch out for the Full Moon, this can trigger strange Events&hellip; Players must also keep track of when they are rostered on Stage, which provides benefits such as acquiring extra Tips and Power Cards. Don&rsquo;t miss your Stage or the club will fine you! These unique Power Cards add another layer of strategy and interaction - will you help out your fellow dancers, or will you play dirty?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But if our interest appears to be purely selfish, anti-Communist and part of the Cold War &ndash; if it appears to the Indian people that our motives are purely political &ndash; then we shall play into the hands of Communist and neutralist propagandists, cruelly distort America's image abroad, and undo much of the psychological effect that we expect from our generosity.&rdquo;  -- Senator John Fitzgerald Kennedy 1959<br/><br/>The year is 1959.  The next decade will unleash a cascading series of events that will catapult the Cold War into a new, farther-flung region of the world.  Twilight Struggle: South Asian Monsoon is the latest stand-alone two player game in the Twilight Struggle series.  This game covers the era from the Tibetan Insurrection in China to the normalization of relations between the People&rsquo;s Republic and the United States.  It is a four turn game, longer than Twilight Struggle: Red Sea, but much shorter than a full game of Twilight Struggle.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle: South Asian Monsoon is intended to provide experienced players of Twilight Struggle with a new, more nuanced challenge.  The nations represented in this game &ndash; in South Asia, the Indian Ocean and along China&rsquo;s Asian periphery - are more remote and independent minded.  All of the countries represented joined the Non-Aligned Movement.  Unlike other parts of the globe, the United States and the Soviet Union can only project military force into the region with difficulty.  In short, this is the region of the Cold War where nations felt emboldened to assert their independence and resist the bi-polar world that the superpowers had created elsewhere.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle players will be asked to contend with newly independent countries, the relationship between the Non-Aligned Movement and increased tensions along the DEFCON track. The game incorporates a new system called &ldquo;Engagement Actions&rdquo; and players must plan with the future of China after Mao.  The ability of players to master these new factors will be the key to victory in Twilight Struggle: South Asian Monsoon.<br/><br/>The game also highlights the history of many giants of the Cold War era that receive less attention in other parts of the Twilight Struggle system: Nehru, Mao, the Dali Lama, Zhou Enlai, Indira Gandhi, Khrushchev and more all make their presence felt in this pivotal region of the globe.<br/><br/>This is your chance to answer Chairman Mao&rsquo;s call and &ldquo;Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game will feature backward and forward compatibility.  Cards from South Asian Monsoon will be usable in Twilight Struggle, and cards from Twilight Struggle will be usable in South Asian Monsoon.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fantasy Planet is a science-fantasy skirmish game played on an ever-changing battlefield. You are a hero sent to explore a new and mysterious planet brimming with mana. Through tactical cunning and military prowess your goal is to scare off any opposition and claim this planet as your own. But the journey is not without risk: the terrain of the planet is ever-changing and volatile. Shape the planet and use its terrain to your advantage to win.<br/><br/>At the start of the game you take turns building up the board by laying down hexflowers. Each flower has two sides with seven hexes on each side. Every hex has one of six different terrain types that govern how you can move across the board. Stepping in lava will burn your foot and trying to swim across a large body of water is impossible lest you know how to fly. Setting up the board to your advantage and utilizing the terrain is detrimental to your success.<br/><br/>You take control of one the game&rsquo;s six asymmetric factions vying for control of the mysterious planet. What faction you choose to play will highly influence your experience. Each faction presents a different twist on a fantasy race. The orcs have been taken over by plants, the dwarves got taken over by a malicious AI, and the dragons are now bleak images of their former selves due to an abundance of cross-species unions.<br/><br/>Each turn you will draw a bunch of cards from a deck that you can play by spending mana. In the beginning you will only have access to cards that let you put more units onto the field. But, whenever you play a unit you get to draw four cards and add two of them to your deck. These new cards will let you alter the terrain, cast spells, and trigger abilities unique to your faction. Elves can lay traps, the undead cast curses, and the turtles can build structures to name a few. Building an effective deck tailored to both the battlefield and your opponents&rsquo; strategy is a sure path to victory.<br/><br/>If you like magic, science fiction, fantastical creatures and tactical gameplay then this is the game for you. Take the chance and step into a rich alternate universe with a fresh take on playing with a modular board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Kickstarter Exclusive brings a whole new way to play Marvel United, in the form of Campaigns! Each of these uses the full breadth of existing Marvel United components to recreate iconic story arcs from the comics! Players must battle through a series of 4 or 5 Games on average, facing events based on those comic storylines and living with the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter Exclusive Campaign Decks set contains 8 different Campaigns, for a total of 114 cards:<br/><br/>The Age of Apocalypse &ndash; 7 Games (23 cards)<br/>War of Kings &ndash; 4 Games (16 cards)<br/>Dark Phoenix Saga &ndash; 6 Games (16 cards)<br/>Avengers vs. X-Men &ndash; 5 Games (17 cards)<br/>X-Cutioner&rsquo;s Song &ndash; 4 Games (13 cards)<br/>Age of Ultron &ndash; 4 Games (8 cards)<br/>Maximum Carnage &ndash; 3 Games (8 cards)<br/>World War Hulk &ndash; 4 Games (13 cards)<br/><br/>Each campaign starts with a roster of Heroes that can be used in each game. As the campaign progresses, depending on what happens, new Heroes may be added to this roster while others are removed. New Heroes may even show up mid-game, depending on events!<br/><br/>At the start of each game, the Rules card indicates which Villain must be used, any mandatory Locations that must be in play, and any other special setup instructions. A few games will even require playing with certain Challenges or in different modes, like Team vs Team, Super Villain, or Clash of Heroes (one particular case even calls for a Commander Solo Mode game).<br/><br/>The back of a game&rsquo;s Rules card indicates any special rules that must be used in that game, as well as listing triggers for specific Event cards. These could be if the Villain accomplishes a specific task, if the Heroes defeat a specific Henchman, if a specific Hero is KO&rsquo;d, or many others. There are also usually triggers for winning the game or losing it (and also how the game is lost). When these triggers take place, players reveal the indicated Event card and resolve it. These might introduce a whole new set of rules to the game being played, changing it to a lesser or greater degree, they might affect the Heroes in specific ways, or add consequences for future games.<br/><br/>Winning the game, players then proceed to the next game in the campaign, oftentimes with special changes depending on how victory was achieved. However, losing the game does not necessarily mean the campaign is lost. Depending on how they lose, players may be able to tackle the same game again, with a special handicap or additional aid, or just proceed to the next game carrying a negative consequence. Defeated Heroes may be removed from the available roster, and eventually players may simply lose the campaign outright. If they manage to come through each adversity, unlocking special surprises along the way, players will emerge victorious at the end of richly thematic campaign!<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Story<br/><br/>Edith, Bernd and Paul had been close friends since their student days. Together they had expanded the Stettenwerke, which Paul had taken over from his parents 49 years ago, into a successful mechanical engineering company. Their common path through life has fatefully welded the three friends together.<br/><br/>Six months ago Paul had sold his company. In order to spend his old age in style and with all amenities, he has rented a luxurious retirement home for himself, Edith and Bernd and their spouses. Since then, the five companions have lived in their own wing on the first floor of a historical building ensemble. Two personal carers lovingly take care of their well-being.<br/><br/>But this afternoon Paul lay lifeless in his bed. Deaths are the order of the day in a retirement home, but a possibly unnatural death would mean great damage to the image of the facility. The residence management is therefore determined to resolve the matter internally without making a fuss.<br/><br/>Die Geschichte<br/><br/>Edith, Bernd und Paul verband seit Studientagen eine enge Freundschaft. Gemeinsam hatten sie die Stettenwerke, die Paul vor 49 Jahren von seinen Eltern &uuml;bernommen hatte, zu einem erfolgreichen Maschinenbauunternehmen ausgebaut. Ihr gemeinsamer Lebensweg hat die drei Freunde schicksalhaft zusammengeschwei&szlig;t.<br/><br/>Vor einem halben Jahr hatte Paul seine Firma verkauft. Um seinen Lebensabend stilvoll und mit allen Annehmlichkeiten zu verbringen, hat er sich, Edith und Bernd sowie deren Ehepartner in einer luxuri&ouml;sen Seniorenresidenz eingemietet. Die f&uuml;nf Weggef&auml;hrten bewohnen seither einen eigenen Trakt im ersten Obergeschoss eines historischen Geb&auml;udeensembles. Zwei pers&ouml;nliche Pflegekr&auml;fte k&uuml;mmern sich liebevoll um ihr Wohlergehen.<br/><br/>Doch heute Nachmittag lag Paul leblos in seinem Bett. Sterbef&auml;lle sind in einer Seniorenresidenz zwar an der Tagesordnung, aber ein m&ouml;glicherweise unnat&uuml;rliches Ableben w&uuml;rde einen gro&szlig;en Imageschaden f&uuml;r die Einrichtung bedeuten. Deshalb ist die Residenzleitung fest entschlossen, die Angelegenheit ohne gro&szlig;es Aufsehen intern zu kl&auml;ren.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ultra Quick Pro Basketball is really two games in one.<br/><br/>We offer you the familiar method employed in Ultra Quick College Hoops, which resolves a game in two rolls of the dice, and a quarter-by-quarter method, which closely resembles the method employed in Ultra Quick Hockey.  The Quarter-by-Quarter method has provisions for &quot;Big Games&quot; as well as &quot;Bad Games&quot; and features a very unique and simple season normalization process.<br/><br/>We added the quarter-by quarter method as it provides a little more drama as the game unfolds, and only adds a slight bit of gaming time. The quarter-by-quarter method also allows you to play cross-era match-ups efficiently and accurately, with our season normalization ratings, so you can easily match-up teams from yesterday and today and get unbiased results.<br/>Both methods are accurate and as the name implies, both methods play ultra-quick!<br/><br/>Each season has ratings for both methods of play.<br/><br/>The Printed game ships with the rules, charts, random number sheets and two six-sided dice.<br/><br/><br/>        To Play, a season yearbook is required**<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

The space hulk is on the brink of annihilation, chunks of it torn away by the catastrophic crash of an Imperial prison barge. As it drifts ever-closer to destruction, long-confined distress signals emitted by an Ironkin of the Leagues of Votann finally break through to the galaxy beyond &ndash; and now The Reachfar, a cruiser of the Trans-Hyperian Alliance, speeds to the hulk to rescue their lost comrade. This will be no easy task, however, for they are hunted by a pack of Fellgor Ravagers &ndash; fearsome Chaos Beastmen hunters who stand among the Gallowdark&rsquo;s most ferocious and cunning denizens.<br/><br/>Kill Team: Gallowfall is a full expansion box for Warhammer 40,000: Kill Team, the ultimate sci-fi skirmish game. It includes miniatures for two new Kill Teams &ndash; the hardened warriors of the Leagues of Votann&rsquo;s Hearthkyn Salvagers, and the savage Chaos Beastmen of the Fellgor Ravagers. They&rsquo;re packed together with loads of space hulk terrain, which is fully compatible with that found in Killzone Gallowdark, along with more than 500 transfers, a double-sided game board, and a rules manual including missions, background material exploring the mysterious setting, and full rosters for the two kill teams.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

And that's where you come in! Your company will take on the mission to receive the treasure, but for that you'll need to hire the bravest (and why not the cheapest) heroes, after all, the money left over is yours!<br/><br/>Furthermore, no one will question if some valuable items rescued by the heroes ended up in your hands. &ldquo;It's part of the mission,&rdquo; you'll reply. In case of your mission to profit more.<br/><br/>But be careful, competing companies will be around, trying to take the best opportunities before you!<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds, each round has 2 phases: in the first one players engage in an inverted auction to see who gets what quest and the money.<br/><br/>In the next phase players go to a location in the city, to pay to contract adventures (such as Rogues, Warriors, Mages or Clerics), each location has a special rule change.<br/><br/>By completing a quest a player receives loot cards that can give single use abilities and/or can be sold at the end of the game, and if this is part of a set the profit will be higher.<br/><br/>The game ends after some rounds (depending on the number of players), then the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Meigo is a territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). There is also an off-board location called prison. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones of their own color. One of the two sides of each stone is marked.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA chain is a stone along with all stones one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent stones of its color.<br/><br/>A liberty of a chain is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to it.<br/><br/>A stone is marked if its marked side is up, and unmarked otherwise.<br/><br/>A point reaches a stone if a path along the lines of the board can take you from one to the other without stepping onto an unmarked stone. Note that the path can go through marked stones of any colors.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your first turn of the game, place an unmarked stone of your color on an empty point. On any other turn, play or hold. To hold, remove an enemy stone from the prison. To play, follow these steps:<br/><br/><br/>     Select an empty point.<br/>     If the selected point is orthogonally adjacent to both marked and unmarked friendly stones, unmark (by flipping them) all marked friendly stones reached by the selected point.<br/>     If the selected point reaches a marked friendly stone or no friendly stones at all, place a marked friendly stone on that point. Otherwise, place an unmarked friendly stone on that point.<br/>     Move to the prison all enemy chains without liberties. After this, the stone you just placed must be part of a chain with at least one liberty.<br/><br/><br/>You cannot place a marked stone and move a marked stone to the prison on the same turn if the last stone placed on the board was marked.<br/><br/>The last player to play or hold wins.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, to make it fair, the first player places a number of black stones in the prison, and then the second player chooses sides. For handicap games, the weaker player takes Black and opens instead by placing on the board a number of unmarked black stones proportional to the skill gap between the players.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesMeigo is a seemingly finite game that plays almost like Go. It was inspired by Cavity, a Go variant created by Michael Amundsen. Christopher Field provided valuable input that helped refine the rules of the game. The prison mechanism was introduced by David Wolfe and Elwyn Berlekamp in their book Mathematical Go: Chilling Gets the Last Point.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Combine two decks to play with up to 4 players.<br/><br/>Premise: It is the 23rd century and the golden age of galactic exploration has begun. As proud members of the Stellar Alliance, your crew has been sent out on a mission of discovery. But you are just one of many crews, and everybody wants the prestigious honor of discovering new planets. Set your phasers to &ldquo;stunning&rdquo; as you deploy a daring cast of Crew Members &amp; Special Guests for a fun-filled episode as you outwit your friends to boldly go and get there first!<br/><br/>Cards: 18 standard crew members &amp; 3 cadets make up the core game, and 8 included special guests can be mixed in to open up new avenues of strategy and tactics. The fast-paced play and infinite replayability will keep you and your friends coming back for &quot;just one more&quot; to settle the score.<br/><br/>Landing Party is a small game of deep strategy. Each player starts with 7 unique crew member cards on their starship and 1 crew member hidden in their ship's transporter buffer. Each player takes turns beaming down a crew member of equal or higher rank to take command on a newfound world. The last player able to beam down a crew member wins the mission for their crew.<br/><br/>Designed to minimize luck and richly reward skillful play. Since all the cards in play (except for 2) are known by all players, the game becomes one of evolving tactics and strategy. The highest ranked crew members are not necessarily the best. Each crew member and special guest has a unique special ability. Mastering when &amp; how to use these abilities is the real secret to success.<br/><br/>There's always an interesting choice to be made! Will you try to crush your opponents with high ranking Officers? Or will you try to draw out their low cards and trap them with a clever Secret Agent? Will you use your Tactician to force an opponent to play that key crew member too soon? Or will you sacrifice your Red Shirt to revive a stunned character in a shocking turn of events? Do you keep your crew member's rank or do you stun it to activate its special ability? The possible strategies and tactics are endless!<br/><br/>Stuck in a bind? Activate your Starship and fire phasers to stun whatever character is in command on the planet. But each player can only do this once, so use this ability wisely!<br/><br/>The beauty of the game comes from the deep interactions between the crew members and their special abilities as well as reading your opponents and guessing their strategy. The more you play, the more tricks &amp; tactics you will discover. And since each round only takes about 10 minutes, there's always time for one more!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each round players utilise different events in order to acquire the most Renowned Tomes collection. When a player acquires their 8th Tome then everyone calculates their Renown Points, the player with the highest Renown is the winner.<br/><br/>Players have a number of Resources that they can use to purchase Tomes from the common sale area. Each Tome is part of a larger collection which adds to the Renown that the owner gains at the end of the game. At the start of each round new Tomes are placed up for sale and the First Player chooses an Event card to play later in the round secretly, then passes them to the next player who chooses their event card for the round and so on.<br/><br/>The Events determine the player turn order and each includes a special ability that the player can use when it is their turn; Henry Armitage can prevent other Events playing, Creative Banking lets players steal resources from other players, Viewing lets players gain resources from the Lost Tomes Collection, Guard Dogs prevent a players Tomes being stolen, Wise Investments allow players to gain Resources, Collector allows players to acquire more than 1 Tome per Round, Wilbur Whateley allows players to steal Tomes and the Stars are Right makes acquiring Tomes cheaper. But players must beware, owning certain Tomes can lead to players becoming Unstable and unlocking bizarre game twisting actions such as swapping Tomes, moving the First Player and losing resources.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This army, commanded by the Russian General Lacy with the support of the British General Craig, approximately 15,000 men strong, is now the only Coalition force on mainland Europe. <br/>Will they be able to defend Naples, or will they evacuate leaving the wretched Neapolitan army to its fate? Will Marshal Massena secure the Two Sicilies for his Emperor, or will the Coalition be able to save Ferdinand&rsquo;s last stronghold, the island of Sicily itself?<br/>The Limits of Glory series examines the influence of 'skill and luck' on the commanders present in a campaign. A Glory rating is attributed to all the significant participants in the campaign, made up from the skill they exhibited and the luck from which they benefited. Players must make difficult decisions as to when to use their commanders Glory to mitigate the situation on the board to their advantage by attempting to manage favourable and  unfavourable events thrown up by the Event Clock as the campaign unfolds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Round Table is a game where players take the role of a ruler of Britain. They recruit knights, give them equipment, and grant them titles in an effort to conquer regions of Britain.<br/><br/>The game is based on the Arthurian legends and the first printing includes 254 cards: 204 main cards, 20 different lands (called Demesnes), and 30 Regions to conquer.<br/><br/>Players construct two decks - one with their Demesnes (lands) and the other with their main cards (Knights, Equipment, Titles, Quests, and Redirects). During play, players can choose to draw from their Demesne deck or their Main deck. A third smaller deck of 5 Regions is used to identify the lands of Britain the players are trying to conquer. Each Region has a Resistance and a Renown value. The player with the most Renown when the game ends wins the game.<br/><br/>Players start with a Farm (worth 1 Resource Point or RP) in play. Players draw a hand up to 10 cards coming from both decks. Players can add RP to their pool every turn by improving their Demesnes. There are 5 different Demesne types that provide different amounts of RP:<br/><br/>     Farms provide 1 RP<br/>     Manors provide an additional 2 RP (for a total of 3)<br/>     Large Manors provide an additional 4 RP (for a total of 7)<br/>     Keeps provide 7 more RP (for 14 RP)<br/>     and Castles provide 11 RP for a total of 25.<br/><br/><br/>Demesnes can only be upgraded to the next highest level (you can't just add a Castle to a Farm, it must &quot;improve&quot; a Keep).<br/><br/>Players pay recruit Knights and provide Equipment and Titles by using their available RP and must pay for them every turn.  Players are able to stop playing for any item in play and return it to their hand during the round.<br/><br/>The game is played in Rounds consisting of Seasons. There are specific actions each player can take during each Season with the Active Player taking actions first and other players following. When all players pass, play moves to the next Season. When play moves from Fall to Winter, the next player becomes the Active Player.<br/><br/>The Regions are a common goal that lies between the play areas. The Regions deck usually consists of 5 cards with 3 in play at the start of the game. Players use their Knights (with Equipment and Titles) to attack the Regions (as many as they want) and their opponents use their Knights to attack as well. At this point, players may send their opponent's Knights (or theirs) on Quests so they are unable to join the campaigns. Players may play Redirects to &quot;cancel&quot; the Quest and redirect the Knight back to campaigning. Whichever army of knights has more Influence (power) than the opposing army's Resistance (toughness) and that of the Region conquers the Region and gains the Renown.<br/><br/>Play ends when the final Region is captured or one of the players can no longer draw a card when they are required to. Renown totals are calculated and the winner is determined.<br/><br/>",

An event and supply card are revealed each round to determine which breweries have beers and events.

Players collect the beer at the selected brewery and must share beer supplies if multiple players chose the same brewery.

The Hope abilities are identical to the original love letter, allowing you to play with classic love letter rules.<br/><br/>Playing the Monokuma mode - named after the key villain from the video game - players first set up an active fate for the game by randomly choosing between Fate and Despair. Characters played trigger their abilities based on the active fate. However, once per game when a player discards a card with an opposing fate to the active one, they then use that new fate for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Use the combination of Hope and Despair abilities to aim for victory and outlast your opponents!<br/><br/>",

Over four ages (with a set up time of under 2 minutes and a play time of 30 minutes per player), the scale of the Anthropocene (i.e., humanity's impact on the Earth) can be experienced.<br/><br/>Players can win by gaining wealth (i.e., victory points), by completing special tasks using instant win conditions, or by the fact that Earth's resources are exhausted and everyone else was greedier (for wealth) than you were.<br/><br/>The game turn is very simple: Either you play a card, activate a card or score your player tableau to achieve wealth. At the end of the turn, a new innovation (i.e. card) is drawn.<br/><br/>The depth of play in &quot;Anthropo10&quot; comes from 160 individual cards with effects that give players powerful abilities. <br/>The discovery of ever new possible combinations of these cards exerts a special charm in this racing game.<br/><br/>The wealthier a player is, the more powerful his abilities become (requiring more and more resources). <br/>&quot;Anthropo10&quot; illustrates the dilemma between the world's finite resources and the drive for progress. If too many resources are used, someone else may win.<br/><br/>Through scoring tasks on the cards, &quot;Anthropo10&quot; lets you experience that only what society (of players) values counts in life. Together, the players shape the planet according to their ideas through abilities. Visually and playfully, &quot;Anthropo10&quot; creates an awareness of how much influence the individual has on the overall construct of the earth. Do all players want to live harmoniously side by side? No problem. Do you want to fight bitterly over territories and resources? That is also possible. Even the loser profits from defeat in &quot;Anthropo10&quot;.<br/><br/>In the end, Anthropocene asks each player an important question: What kind of story are you telling? <br/>It's not just about whether you win, but at what cost. Or would you like to be remembered by setting off a nuclear bomb?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players that you meet may become your kind allies, or perhaps, even your worst enemies.<br/>No matter what, all players will be tested when they face their foes in a final battle. Will you be corrupted on the way and fight to be the last and best hero standing with the treasure, or team up with fellow heroes to win together? Watch the animations on YouTube by following Tales of Alethrion's channel<br/><br/>Gameplay Summary:<br/>Each round a new location is revealed and players decide where they would like to explore. The game length is variable: it can be modified to be longer or shorter, based on the player's needs that day! You will recruit new heroes, which have unique abilities; gain new weapons and spells; gain experience points (XP) to improve your heroes; and gain gold to buy upgraded cards. But... if that is not enough for you then you can weaken other players with curses and gain benefits in exchange for Greed points; but be careful, as these might corrupt you in the end.<br/><br/>How to win?<br/>Make your heroes as strong as possible on your journey, so you have the biggest chance of winning the final battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s Halloween night, and word of Monster Metal Mayhem, the newest rock concert sensation, has made its way to the monster world. Lured in by this unfamiliar sound, a new generation of monsters seek to join in this Halloween extravaganza, and party down in the mosh pits! From far and wide, they are showing up to learn what new moves humans have for these crazy tunes, and they are bringing some ghastly and ghoulish moves of their own. Gone are the twists and mashes, here are the kicks and thrashes. Among the party goers and revelers there is one who keeps watch over the citizens of the human world, the Monster Hunter. Can the monsters dance their way past him and prove their prowess in the pit? Or will he put an end to their night?<br/><br/>In Monster Mosh Pit you will shuffle and deal 5 cards to all players. The top 5 cards of the deck are then flipped over to form a row that will become The Crowd. Place the deck to the left of this 1st card. Place the 5 Card Placement Markers above these cards in ascending order, starting with the &ldquo;1&rdquo; marker above the card closest to the deck. Place the Round Tracker token above the &ldquo;1&rdquo; Card Placement Marker. The last person to attend a concert receives the 1st player marker and starts the game.<br/><br/>On your turn you will draw cards from the deck, crowd, discard pile, or any combination of these choices until you have 6 cards in your hand. You may then play 1 set of numbered cards (cards of the same suit in a sequential run) and 1 non-numbered card (Field Effect, Monster Hunter, Back to the Pit, Wall of Death, Crowd Surfing). These cards can be played in any order you choose. You may choose to play only numbered cards, or a non-numbered card, but you must play at least 1 card on your turn. After you have finished playing cards, you may discard as many cards from your hand as you wish. After you discard, you will advance the crowd, placing the card that started in the 5th position in the discard pile (if it is still in the crowd), and shifting all cards as far right as they can go. You will then refill the crowd from right to left with cards from the deck, and pass play to the next player. If they have the 1st Player Token, they advance the Round Tracker token to the next number at the start of their turn.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game: Earn Mosh Points as you play cards to start and continue your monster&rsquo;s mosh. Form sets, play bonus cards, and send monster hunters after your opponents. At the end of the game, the player with the most Mosh Points is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ukraine 2022 is a fast play combined arms game, aimed at using printable unit chits provided along with the rules. 6mm or 15mm miniatures can also be used if desired. <br/>The game covers all the main units used in the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, from infantry armed with a variety of support weapons such as NLAWs, Stugna-Ps, RPO-As, and SA-7s, to the usual BTR and BMP variants, to tanks, APCs, helicopters and UAVs. Fixed-wing aircraft and larger SAM systems are not represented, as the focus is on ground combat, with support from helicopters and drones.<br/><br/>The unit chits provided allow for easy reference of move distances, weapon types and ranges, as well as situational awareness. This game does not use a grid, and is still a traditional wargame in the sense of measuring distances and freedom of movement. The chits are 1&quot; x 1.5&quot; in size, making for easy handling and good readability.<br/><br/>Ukraine 2022 uses a novel order system, where players write orders on slips of paper and place them in a bag. Orders are randomly drawn from this bag, so you don't always have direct control of your forces - they may be reacting to orders from long ago, or you may see the enemy activating instead of your own forces. This inject chaos and uncertaintly into the game, and creates a kind of &quot;hands off&quot; approach to unit activation. There are 4 orders: Move, Attack, Defensive Ambush, and Cautious Advance, and each order must have a direction such as &quot;North&quot;, Northeast&quot; etc. Units can conduct movement, detection and attacks in a 90 degree cone pointing in the direction of the order.<br/><br/>Solo play rules are provided, using the same chaotic order system, but done on a single sheet of paper and using a D6 to randomize which order is selected.<br/><br/>A printer-friendly version of the rules is also provided. Note that the printer-friendly version does not have the printable unit chits in the PDF - these should be printed from the full color PDF, on to thin card.<br/><br/>Play mat is not provided. A 4' x 4' play area is recommended for smaller games, and 6' x 4' for larger games.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this expandable card game, players use pre-constructed and highly-thematic decks representing crew among unique starships, illustrated through gorgeous art by Norwegian artist Raymond Heggheim There were three primary pillars of development for Astra during the design process:<br/><br/>&bull;Embracing a unique, interactive game system and departing from standard attack/defense mechanics.<br/><br/>As passionate and active card gamers ourselves, the two founding members of Paper Planet Games have played countless card games at a competitive level. We noticed parts of each of these games that we loved and wished there was a way to mix it all together. That's where Astra: Vestiges of Deep Space came in. What we came up with was FTL meets Magic: The Gathering. We left behind the idea of attack points and health values and, inspired by Android: Netrunner, imagined something entirely different. Instead, players manage the actions of the Crew Members on their starship while equipping their vessels with powerful weapons to take down the opposing crews.<br/><br/>We also loved the fast, single-turn action from Ashes: Reborn, as well as the expandable nature of Summoner Wars. We took our favorite aspects from the games we love and implemented them with our own unique system, creating Astra: Vestiges of Deep Space.<br/><br/>&bull;No Tokens.<br/><br/>We wanted to design a game that can be easily put in a jacket or backpack pocket. Whether you're two friends at a lunch table on a field trip or a couple playing at the gate of an airport, Astra was going to be a travel-friendly game. Once we settled on the idea of abandoning health points and attack values, we knew there was design space to abandon tokens altogether. Cards, after all, are double-sided, which ended up being the key to our main currency and health system. Crew Members have a Wounded and Healthy side, while rooms of your starship have an Online and Offline side. Players will win or lose by their ability to manage the status of their Crew Members and rooms.<br/><br/>&bull;No Deckbuilding.<br/><br/>While deck-building has great reason of being among the fondest card game mechanics, we took the theme and storytelling of Astra too seriously to add deck-building to the mix. We want each faction of Astra to feel unique, with their own goals and their own play style. Additionally, by eliminating deck building, we knew that balancing the game and expanding the game would be significantly easier at the size of our operation. What resulted is a more narratively focused and fine-tuned strategy game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Inspired by the best-selling book Masala Lab by Krish Ashok, you will prep and serve various Indian dishes while trying to rack up the highest score.<br/><br/>Game 1 - Tiffin, is a set-collection game, where you have to collect food &quot;Items&quot; to make your &quot;Prep&quot;, in a way such that the Items match the recipe of the Prep. An interesting card-overlap mechanism means you need to collect the Items in a particular sequence shown on the recipe. The game ends when the one player collects 5 Prep cards, but the winner is the one who scored the highest! Watch out for penalties for incomplete Prep. A game lasts 20-30 minutes.<br/><br/>Game 2 - Sadya (pronounced sadh-ya, meaning &quot;feast&quot; in Malayalam), kicks things up a notch, and you're competing to serve the best meal at the feast, on banana leaves, as is traditional in some parts of India. The rules build upon Game 1, and add a few more rules and mechanisms to it, namely engine-building and worker-placement. You have access to a &quot;Pantry&quot; in this game, which you access with your workers. Once you've made your &quot;Prep&quot; with &quot;Items&quot;, just like in Game 1, you can use your Prep and your Pantry to &quot;cook and serve&quot; Dishes on to your leaf. Prep and Dishes, both score you points. The first player to reach 40 on the score-track triggers the end-game. Resolve any penalties for players, and the highest scorer will win! A game lasts 45-60 minutes.<br/><br/>Game 3 - Dessert, is played with the reverse side of the playing board. This is a pattern-building game, that will evoke a slight tinge of nostalgia for fans of Tetris. In this game, you're in charge of serving a bunch of fussy guests, each of whom places an order for 4 dishes. But they will only accept your order and give you points, if you place their orders in any of the 5 Tetris shapes! This is a 2 or a 4 player game, that takes about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Soviet Union refused to intervene on behalf of her Arab allies, but the Israeli high command could not be completely sure that Soviet paratroopers might not appear in the skies over Tel Aviv.<br/><br/>Intervention 1967 is a small expansion set for Panzer Grenadier (Modern) 1967: Sword of Israel, based on how such an operation might have played out. The Soviet Army&rsquo;s 103rd Guards Airborne Division is a well-trained and well-armed outfit, in the midst of preparations for the Dnepr 1967 exercises - a complete contrast to the Arab armies the Israelis face in the standard scenarios.<br/><br/>The Soviet parachute battalion of 1967 is very much a light infantry outfit - air-droppable armored carriers would only start to arrive the next year, converting the airborne formations into far more capable all-arms units. To make up for that lack, the battalion wields a large number of support weapons: Sagger anti-tank missiles, heavy mortars, recoilless rifles and the diminuitive ASU-85 assault gun.<br/><br/>Intervention 1967 includes 24 playing pieces representing these troops, plus a couple of new Sword of Israel scenarios for their use.

        "description": "The Werewolves Big Box is a limited edition, that contains the famous Werewolves New Edition and the popular Night Of The Vampires sequel, plus 2 promotional cards. It also comes with a notepad and pencil for the moderator to keep track of all the roles in play. The Werewolves Big Box is a special release for Pegasus Spiele's 30th company anniversary.<br/><br/>In this edition all cards, as well as the box come with a mystic, metallic foil effect, and the box has a reversible cover. The extra-large character cards include a description of the character's ability, which makes the game more accessible for new players.<br/><br/>More about the two games contained in this Big Box: Werewolves is easily one of the most popular party games of all time and the ultimate game for larger groups of all ages. In 2018, Pegasus published a redesigned version of this game, featuring beautiful, atmospheric artwork on large cards that not only tell the players which role they are playing, but also how their role works, so people who have never played the game before don't have to give their secret identity away by asking what they have to do.<br/><br/>Also included in this Big Box is the stand-alone sequel &quot;Werewolves &ndash; Night of the Vampires&quot; that Pegasus released in 2022. It can be played on its own with 6 to 24 players or it can be combined with Werewolves to play with up to 48 players.<br/><br/>Due to the 2 promotional cards in this box - the Stray Cat and the Watchdog - you can even play it with up to 50 players.<br/><br/>The proven game principle remains the same: every night Werewolves and/or Vampires secretly devour a human Villager. The following day, all players discuss who among them could be a Vampire or Werewolf &ndash; and can lynch the most suspicious person after voting. Slip into the role of one the Villagers and unmask the Werewolves. Or play a Werewolf and convince the Villagers of your innocence while you go hunting at night. And wherever werewolves are up to mischief, vampires are not far away!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A swap must decrease either the number of crosscuts or the number of supercuts on the board, and it must not increase the number of crosscuts.<br/><br/>You win if there is a chain of orthogonally connected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color.

        "description": "Loosely inspired on SPI&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Conquerors&rdquo;, The Fate of All is an operational / tactical simulation covering the first four years of the campaign led by Alexander the Great against the Achaemenid Empire ruled by Darius III, and other related conflicts.<br/><br/>The final goal is to give a realistic representation of ancient warfare, without strange salads of godly interventions, auguries and Homeric duels. In the end, players will find that the problems faced were similar to those encountered during the Napoleonic era or the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Counters are 5/8&Prime;, each one representing a formation, from a Macedonian Phalanx Taxis (approx. 1500 soldiers) to a Cavalry Ile (200 &ndash; 300 mounted soldiers). Commanders and naval forces are also represented and will be key elements for the final victory.<br/><br/>Rules are centred on the problems of army organisation, supply and morale: Commanders are essentials, armies must be organised in a balanced way or they will move slowly, cavalry must be used for foraging, raid and reconnaissance, morale must be kept under control using sound military achievements or donations.<br/><br/>Political aspects are also a key element: Actions like Plundering and Sacking will have a negative impact on the local support by the ruling class and population, and both sides will have to use money or threats to gain it back. Last but not least, treason, revolts and dubious allies will be a problem too.<br/><br/>The four maps cover Greece, part of the Balkans, Anatolia, Egypt and the Middle East up to Babylon. The scale is 30 km per hex with monthly turns.<br/><br/>The maps are designed using the latest archaeological studies and findings, but despite centuries of research several things are still only vaguely known: Some examples are the extension and path of the Persian Royal Roads, the location of several important cities and the exact route of Alexander&rsquo;s Army. In these cases, the &ldquo;most accepted theory&rdquo; rule has been used.<br/><br/>Battles can be fought using Strategic Combat, still realistic but quicker, or to their full extent using the Tactical Rules and Map &ndash; probably the best choice for a decisive battle.<br/><br/>All the classical sources and several modern military-focused studies have been used during development. In particular, The Anabasis of Alexander by Arrian was chosen as the main and most reliable classical source for two reasons: Arrian based most of his writing on the now lost Ptolemy&rsquo;s account of the campaign, and he was himself a military commander, thus having a better understanding of the problems and key facts of a military campaign.<br/><br/>Game Highlights<br/><br/>    30 km per hex, one month per turn<br/>    Units representing various formations, from Phalanx to Chariots<br/>    Order of battle and commanders based on primary sources and the most recent historical research<br/>    Realistic supply problems with realistic and possibly violent solutions<br/>    Cavalry Reconnaissance, Foraging and Raiding<br/>    Reaction Movement, not so easy retreats and catastrophic routs<br/>    Attrition and Army Morale, your first problems in the morning<br/>    Naval Warfare<br/>    Satrapies, Taxation and Bribes<br/>    Revolts, Treachery and worse<br/>    Five different scenarios:<br/>        The Anger of Achilles - The four decisive years of Alexander&rsquo;s campaign, 334 BCE<br/>        Ten Thousand, Again - Parmenion&rsquo;s preparatory expedition in Anatolia, 336 BCE<br/>        Arise, Hellas! - The Greek revolt following Alexander&rsquo;s death, 323 BCE<br/>        It All Comes to This - The final clash between Alexander and Darius, 331 BCE<br/>        The Shattered Bonds - The first Diadochi war, 320 BCE<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a board game that recreates the world of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; novel, which unfolds on a grand scale. The player becomes one of the heroes and aims to expand their power with the ultimate goal of unifying the country.<br/><br/>The game begins with the &quot;Peach Orchard Oath&quot; event. This oath happens at the beginning of the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; novel, where Liu Bei, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei exchange vows of brotherhood. Similarly, players choose their alter ego, the ruler, and their first vassal from over 200 characters. Characters have abilities such as valor, strategy, and governance. Military commanders can be relied on in battle, and civil servants play an active role in domestic politics. Since there is a limit to what a monarch can do alone, it is necessary to recruit human resources and make use of them in order to expand the country. This utilization of human resources is a major feature.<br/><br/>In this game, single combat is positioned as a prelude to group battles, and plays a very important role. Strategy is reproduced with 124 cards. There are many military strategies and tactics available, such as the ``fire plan and ``ten-sided burying plan, and even if you are inferior in military strength, it is possible to overturn the tide of the battle by using these skills. However, the success of a strategy depends on the character's abilities.<br/><br/>Various incidents of the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; are simulated, including major ones such the Dengoku Seal and the Northern Yi Invasion, but also the death of a military commander and assassination. There are not only sudden misfortunes, but sometimes a unique opportunity to unify China.<br/><br/>This complete edition is a reissue of the 1986 game. It also includes the contents of expansion kits released later.<br/><br/>The previous version of the basic set included 147 military commanders, approximately 100 destiny cards, and 4 scenarios. With the expansion, 79 new military commander units, 25 destiny cards, and 3 scenarios have been added. In the new version, you can play with all of these additional elements.<br/><br/>The expansion also added many detailed rules on battles, judgment methods, movement, alliances, etc. The most significant change was the combat aspect, with balance adjustments made so that the role of military officers has a greater impact on battles. However, it was difficult to play with both basic and additional rules.<br/><br/>The new board incorporates these new rules into the basic rules, making the overall outlook better. We have also updated/added examples to help you understand the rules.<br/><br/>Of course, the component graphics have also been updated to make them easier to use.<br/><br/>Other changes:<br/><br/>     Changes in the monarch abilities records: in the old version, the monarch's abilities were recorded on memo paper,  in the new one, markers are used.<br/>      Separate volumes: the old version included scenarios in the rule book, the new version has been divided into a rule and a scenario book.<br/>      Scenario updates: with the increase of the number of military commanders in the expansion, military commanders who were supposed to be already dead in the basic set, appeared (such as Dong Zhuo invading the Battle of Guandu). Therefore, in the new edition, we have updated the basic set scenario by adding information on additional officers.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated and adapted)<br/><br/>",

For example, one Exchange-Traded Fund can invest in: Energy, Manufacturing, and Retail industries, while another ETF can invest in: Financial services, Media/Gaming, and Retail.<br/><br/>Each turn one card will be drawn for all players. Event card will resemble some famous real-life event (for example: Covid 19 pandemic, Suez canal obstruction or GameStop short squeeze). On the flip side of the card, event effects are listed. The event effects may increase or decrease values of entire industries in the range of -3 to +3. Before the event effects are revealed, players will have a chance to buy and sell stocks of available ETFs. The starting value of all ETF stocks is 10.<br/><br/>After all players have done all their desired transactions, the event effect is revealed. Upon reveal, adjust the values of all ETF stocks. Some may increase and some may decrease their value. After that, a new event card is revealed. The game is played in this fashion for 5 turns. At the end of the game, after 5 events have been played, the player that has the most value in his stocks and money (combined) wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Player interaction takes center stage, with alliances and conflicts unfolding against the unforgiving backdrop of this world, where loyalties can shift as swiftly as the desert sands.<br/><br/>You are the leader of a group of prisoners. Your goal is to repair a spaceship and escape the planet before the overseers catch on to your plan. But you&rsquo;re not the only one with this idea. Other prisoners will be trying to do the same thing, and they won&rsquo;t hesitate to sabotage your efforts if it means they can get off this rock before you do.<br/><br/>The race is on, and you have only five days to gather the resources you need, repair your ship, and take off before the overseers catch you. You&rsquo;ll need to scavenge for parts, negotiate with other prisoners, and fight off any who stand in your way.<br/><br/>The task ahead of you is daunting, but you&rsquo;re not alone. You have your fellow prisoners to rely on, and together, you might just be able to make it off this planet alive. But be warned: this journey is not for the faint of heart. Death lurks around every corner, and every decision you make could mean the difference between life and death.<br/><br/>Are you ready to take on the challenge? Can you outsmart and outmaneuver your fellow prisoners to make it off this planet before it&rsquo;s too late? The clock is ticking, and the fate of your group rests in your hands.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Explore a different take on the world of The Witcher, and discover the rich tradition of Japanese folklore!<br/><br/>The Path of Destiny leads us to the east. The Witcher in a world inspired by Japanese mythology is an alternative version of the universe created by CD Projekt RED. Illustrations, collectible miniatures, but also a best-selling comic book written by Rafał Jaki.<br/><br/>The Witcher: Path of Destiny RONIN takes you to this alternative world. It is an independent, stand-alone game based on the Path of Destiny, co-created by Rafał Jaki.<br/><br/>The Witcher: Path of Destiny Ronin is a complete game based on The Witcher: Path of Destiny.<br/><br/>Ronin contains all the components needed to play the game, but also includes elements that connect it to the Path of Destiny.<br/><br/>You will be able to take on the role of 7 characters - Geralt, Yennefer, Ciri, Yaskra, Vesemir, and Triss in a brand-new installment. Geralt, Vesemir, and Ciri will be equipped with katanas, Jaskier will move crowds of geisha with the help of a biwa, and Triss and Yennefer will charm many of samurai on their way.<br/><br/>RONIN offers a competitive mode for 1-5 players, but the new expansion puts quite a big emphasis on cooperation. In RONIN, players not only try their best to draft and play cards, but also to cooperate with each neighboring player to get the best shared bonuses.<br/><br/>In this installment of the game, Story cards are replaced by beautifully illustrated Round cards. At the end of a round, contrary to the basic version of the game, players earn Victory Points for the symbol they jointly collected less of, and Experience Points for the symbol they collected more of. This new way of scoring forces players to constantly find balance in their tableau. This means they need to make strategic decisions and blend them with constant interaction with their neighbors at the table.<br/><br/>The variety of characters, Partnership Tracks, as well as the new large deck of Action cards will make each visit to the Japanese Witcher universe a unique and equally engaging one. In the box you will find 5 double-sided Partnership Tracks, which are to be placed between the neighboring players. New symbols and effects on Action cards often require neighbors to determine common tactics for playing cards. New effects allow players to climb up on their tracks, gaining additional bonuses together. Another component that enhances the feeling of building relationships are special Character Ability cards. Some effects from the Partnership track allow you to use the special abilities of your companions sitting next to you. Trust your Partners, but focus on achieving your own goals!<br/><br/>Ronin is designed for 1-5 players. Playing with two players, you will use the help of Automa - an additional player, managed by the game. In solo mode, we will play with two Automa.<br/><br/>Automa plays cards and allows players to use cooperation tracks, but does not collect points by itself.<br/><br/>In the Solo variant, the player chooses a character, neighboring characters and the difficulty level. The goal of the game is to collect Victory Points and achieve a special Victory Condition. The characters, as well as the difficulty level, give you a huge variability in this variant (hundreds of different starting layouts of the game).The Witcher: Path of Destiny RONIN<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the Gamefound campaign<br/><br/>",

The Goblins need to bring sacrifices to their fire beacons to activate them and call upon an ancient dragon. The Undead need the life energy of the other factions to activate runes and open a portal to the underworld. Chaos tries to take control of enemy units to infiltrate the enemy factions. Finally, the Primals try to devour all enemies to evolve one of their little hatchlings into Ultimatosaur.<br/><br/>The factions can complete their rite by summoning unique units, moving them around and defeating other units. While doing so, they can perform special rites to summon powerful commanders and unlock mighty spells.<br/><br/>Whatever the objective, players better watch their step, because a furious Firelord is trying to burn them off his volcano!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Prepare yourselves to navigate the ever-changing and entirely unpredictable multiverse in which we operate. Each planet is likely dissimilar to anything you've ever imagined, a realm where advanced technologies might find themselves intertwined with prehistoric tribes, and where anything can take on different forms&mdash;or not. That's the beauty of the multiverse!<br/><br/>Dreamspace: Mission to Marsylvania is a competitive,dungeon crawler, American-style, board game from 2 to 5 players set in the multiverse. You will become a bounty hunter, so-called Dreamspacer, and live an amazing journey throughout Marsylvania! <br/>Marsylvania is like the Mars planet of the Milky Way, but in this universe, it has been colonized by an ancient human civilization named Nuwa, and it is also suffering from an unknown curse that has turned some of the inhabitants into Werewolves and Vampires. <br/>Due to the planet's lack of rotation, Marsylvania is divided into three main areas: The Nuwa Desert, The Twilight Jungle, and The Dark Land.<br/><br/>Each Dreamspacer is unique and peculiar (such as a humanoids-giraffe professor of the arcane arts) and it has its hunter stats (health, attack, defense, speed, and mana), job title, planet of origin, special abilities, and starting equip or spell.  <br/>During the game, you will gear up with equipment, Spells, Allies, and powerful Relics. You will face adversities and iconic enemies (such as the Androids police of the multiverse, known as The Alliance), unlock new levels and new abilities, and most importantly have fun competing against your friends!<br/><br/>The actual gameplay is relatively simple, it is structured in turns and each turn is divided in 5 phases: Each turn is divided in 5 phases: <br/><br/>     Movement Phase<br/>     Square Effect Phase<br/>     Theft and Exchange Phase<br/>     Encounter Phase <br/>     Recovery Phase<br/><br/><br/>During your turns, you will explore the planet and move throughout its areas until you will be able to reach the Dark Land, the final area where the Vampire Lord is hiding. More closer you are to the Dark Zone, the more hostile the Planet will be toward you! Once you reach this area the Vampire Lord will do its appearance and try to defeat you, so gear up, have luck in rolling, and win!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Exiled includes 3 pairs of characters which thematically fit into the worlds of Valrona, Ukyo and Galactic Throne, and may be added or swapped into teams to create unique battles. Sudden Conflict: Exiled is not playable without one or more Core Sets.<br/><br/>Players engage in intermittent turns, directing one character at a time to influence the dynamics of the battlefield. With each strategic move, you either push your opponent closer to defeat or capitalise on setbacks, accumulating momentum dice. These momentum dice serve as valuable assets, empowering you to shift the tide in your favour in future conflicts.<br/><br/>Each set of Sudden Conflict contains six custom miniatures, six character cards, ten action dice, ten momentum dice, a double-sided battlefield, rulebook and numerous tokens to track various conditions and game states.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Last Year of Carbon is a cooperative AND competitive strategy boardgame. Each player acts as a renewable energy company in a world running on the last drops of non-renewable fuel (gas, coal, etc.).<br/><br/>You must work together to power the planet, while simultaneously building up your infrastructure and convincing the public that you (and only you) are the best company to replace carbon based fuels.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to survive &amp; thrive during the Last Year Of Carbon?<br/><br/>Every game of Last Year of Carbon takes place over 4 seasons, with 12 turns per player (one turn per month in the year) Half way through, a new deck with increased effects is swapped in. Additionally, before every round, NEWS CARDS are flipped causing world-altering effects... but who knows... it might be... good? The Last Year of Carbon is an adventure of discovery. Where each card can make or break your entire strategy. Where one player's actions may change how every subsequent player takes their turn. Where fingers become crossed, hopes become dashed, yet maybe, just maybe, we'll make it to the next season. To start again the nail-biting anxiety of creating a house of cards that may topple at any second. Only one person may stand victorious, but everyone can lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroduction:Hedu (from Old English: Hēah&thorn;u, meaning &quot;height&quot;) is a finite game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the hexes (spaces) of a initially empty hexagonal board. It can be played on a 7&ndash;sized board for long games or a 5&ndash;sized board for short games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stackable pieces of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; A stack is a set of pieces located at the same space, one on top of the other. A single piece is also a stack.<br/>&ndash; The height of a stack is the number of pieces it contains.<br/>&ndash; A group is a set of stacks of the same color and height that are connected to each other. A single stack is also a group.<br/>&ndash; The size of a group is the number of stacks it contains.<br/>&ndash; A region is a set of one or more uninterrupted empty spaces bounded by stones of any color that fill all adjacent places.<br/>&ndash; You control a region by following these steps:<br/><br/>1. Compare the size of adjacent groups of both players. The larger group controls the region.<br/>2. In case of a tie, compare the height of the larger groups. The taller group controls the region.<br/>3. If the tie persists, compare the adjacent groups successively in the same way.<br/>4. In case of an absolute tie, control is given to the group with more stones adjacent to the region.<br/><br/>&ndash; The value of a region is equal to the height of the largest size friendly group that controls it.<br/>&ndash; Increase is adding pieces on top of one or more stacks.<br/>&ndash; Reduce is removing pieces from one or more stacks and taking them off the board.<br/>&ndash; A prisoner is a piece that is removed when reducing a stack and is taken off the board to be placed next to the player of the opposite color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you can either pass your turn or take these actions in the following order:<br/><br/>1. Place a stack of height N of your color in an empty space, where N is not 0 and is equal to the number of adjacent regions.<br/>2. Reduce all enemy stacks, and then friendly stacks, according to the number of adjacent regions each has.<br/>3. Increase all stacks, both friendly and enemy, according to the number of adjacent regions each has.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the game:The game ends when players cannot make any placements. At the end of the game, each player counts his points by adding the value of the regions he controls, plus the number of captured prisoners, plus half a point for the player with the largest size or height group (with the same process used in region control).<br/><br/>The player with the highest score at the final position wins.<br/><br/>To ensure fairness, before the game begins, the first player places a black stack on an empty space, and the second player chooses a side. This balancing method is called the pie rule.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:Special thanks to Coray Clark for his valuable input in improving a crucial aspect of the game, particularly the region control hierarchy, which prioritizes size over height of adjacent groups. Although the original idea was to prioritize height over size, the current idea works out better by providing additional means of retaliation.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

These two new types of Characters represent important personalities of Middle-earth with a vital role in the War of the Ring.<br/><br/>The Sovereigns of the Free Peoples were targeted by Sauron&rsquo;s attempts to bend the will of the peoples opposing him &mdash; using the palant&iacute;ri (the seeing stones), through emissaries, like Gr&iacute;ma, and possibly with other subtle and deceitful means. At the same time, it was crucial for the morale of the Free Peoples to rally around these charismatic figures &mdash; Brand, D&aacute;in Ironfoot, Denethor, Th&eacute;oden, and Thranduil &mdash; to fight against the Shadow.<br/><br/>The new rules, miniatures, cards, and Action dice included in this expansion will allow the players to fully develop this conflict and represent the role of these characters in your War of the Ring game.<br/><br/>This expansion also adds three new Characters, the Dark Chieftains, to the Shadow hosts. Unlike the Ringwraiths, who were fully controlled by the Rings of Power, these powerful leaders of the Shadow Armies had distinct personalities, but ultimately all were subject to the commands of Sauron or Saruman. One Dark Chieftain is included for each of the three Shadow Nations &mdash; the Black Serpent, the Shadow of Mirkwood, and Ugl&uacute;k.<br/><br/>Includes Hunt tiles and Stronghold tiles suitable for use with both the standard edition and limited editions of War of the Ring, as well as for use with the War of the Ring Deluxe Game Mat.<br/><br/>These two expansions can be played together or independently.<br/><br/>This Limited Edition of Kings &amp; Lords of Middle-earth  has a total print run of 2000 copies.<br/><br/>CONTENTS OF THE BOX<br/>1 Rulebook (Lords)<br/>8 Plastic Painted Figures (Lords)<br/>5 Special Action Dice (Lords)<br/>11 Cardboard Counters (Lords)<br/>28 Event and Character Cards (Lords)<br/>2 Reference Sheets (Lords)<br/>1 Deluxe Treebeard Promo<br/>1 Rulebook (Kings)<br/>13 Plastic Painted Figures (Kings)<br/>5 Corrupted Sovereign Rings (Kings)<br/>2 Special Action Dice (Kings)<br/>13 Character Cards (Kings)<br/>19 Event Cards (Kings)<br/>1 Sovereign Corruption Board (Kings)<br/>14 Cardboard Counters (Kings)<br/>2 Reference Sheets (Kings)<br/>1 The Seeing-stones Promo<br/>1 The Fate of Erebor Special Version<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE GAME.<br/>A copy of War of the Ring &ndash; Second Edition  (Anniversary Release or normal version) or of the War of the Ring Collector&rsquo;s Edition is required to play.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Far beyond the Milky Way Galaxy, in the uncharted depths of space, a black hole looms just outside a vibrant galactic cluster. This black hole is enormous, by all standards of the universe, and entirely ungovernable. But its daunting size and power is not unmatched. Other black holes tear through the expanse, fulfilling their one purpose: consume. Like this looming mass, their consumption leads to growth, and growth leads to power. As they expand, they will inevitable confront one another and adopt strategies for handling their unruly adversaries. Ultimately, one black hole will emerge as the most powerful, and more importantly, largest: the &quot;king&quot; of the universe. Or, as the infinitesimally small creatures on Earth call it, ULTRAMASSIVE.<br/><br/>In ULTRAMASSIVE, you play as one of these black holes. Your goal is to become the largest class of black hole known to man: Ultramassive. To do so, you must consume a myriad of other celestial bodies, each with a certain amount of solar mass (points), which is added to your point total. Absorbing enough solar mass causes your black hole to expand, changing the landscape of your board and accelerating your growth.<br/><br/>Like the black holes in our universe, yours is unique. Amass and exchange your resources for Anomalies which augment how your black hole acquires and consumes matter. Each Anomaly improves your abilities in different ways depending on your chosen trajectory to victory. Bolster your strategy with potent Anomaly combinations to counteract and out-pace your opponents. Modeled after skill-trees common in digital RPGs, the Anomaly Board provides a multitude of approaches to engine building, especially for those drawn to experimentation.<br/><br/>Adding to the tools at your disposal, each black hole is equipped with several wormholes which act as bridges across the vast orbit of your black hole. Wield your wormholes with tact to maximize every opportunity.<br/><br/>Isolationist or aggressor, speed orbiter or matter behemoth; decide how you will out-consume your opponents to ultimately become the largest entity in existence and claim your title as ULTRAMASSIVE.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As a ROVE (Results-Oriented Versatile Explorer) you are accustomed to the rigors of space, but the impenetrable darkness of the ocean depths is a brand-new challenge to confront.<br/><br/>Aqua ROVE is a standalone entry in the ROVE series. In this solo spatial puzzler, the player must complete missions by using their movement cards to align ROVE&rsquo;s modules in the proper pattern. Each module has a unique one-time ability that can give ROVE a much-needed boost at a key moment. As ROVE travels further, efficient use of movement points and module abilities becomes paramount to achieve success.<br/><br/>Experienced ROVE players will notice that there are a few changes in Aqua ROVE. For one, movement cards no longer provide generic points that are limited by the modules&rsquo; movement restrictions. Instead, each card provides both the points and the direction of movement, providing a major twist to the original gameplay. All modules have been replaced with new abilities to match this change. However, each pattern now requires two specific fixed modules to complete rather than one. And as befits an ocean adventure, ROVE&rsquo;s missions are now placed vertically rather than horizontally to create a beautiful panorama of your descent.<br/><br/>",

For example, people will tend to associate the nonsense word bouba with a rounded shape and kiki with a spiky shape.<br/><br/>The cards in Bouba/Kiki display a nonsense word on one side, and a simple illustration on the other. In the basic game, you are faced with a set of three of these words and one shape, and must decide which word goes best with the shape. Points are earned by choosing the same target as your teammates.<br/><br/>The game contains eight scenarios that expand on this idea, each containing five missions that gradually increase in difficulty and complexity. Each scenario presents a different communication-based setting, such as spacefarers making contact with an alien race, spirit mediums looking into the beyond, or toddlers playing together at a nursery.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Flatiron Building, originally known as the Fuller Building, is a historic 22-story skyscraper located in Manhattan, New York. It is known for its distinctive triangular shape reminiscent of an old-fashioned clothes iron. Since its construction in 1902, it has become one of the most recognizable icons on the New York City skyline, situated at the intersection of Fifth Avenue with Broadway, East 22nd Street, and East 23rd Street.<br/><br/>In Flatiron, you will be transported to the Big Apple to participate in the construction of this iconic building. Both you and your opponent will need to develop your companies by adding new cards to your personal board, thereby allowing you to perform more and better actions on each of the surrounding streets. The ultimate goal is to earn more points than your opponent, primarily by undertaking construction tasks but also by maintaining an impeccable public image and adhering to the decrees of the New York City Council. When the roof is placed, and everything is ready for the grand opening, the game ends. Victory and recognition will go only to the player who has accumulated the most points.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each card displays one egg, and the three cards in a set have the same back design, so when they are face down, it's not known which of the three values they represent.<br/><br/>Although the action is the same each turn, there are several details to consider. We can potentially deduce which egg we are picking, remember what we had discarded previously, calculate probabilities, and most importantly, take into account the values we possess because the score varies based on whether we have repeated or unique numbers.<br/><br/>It's a simple and fast game that involves deduction and memory skills.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In Card Golf Tour, each hand is like a golf hole and can be either a par 3, par 4, or par 5, just like in actual golf. The par of the hole determines how many cards are dealt to each player. Each hand will also have a &quot;stroke index&quot;, which will make the hand more or less difficult by removing cards from the playing deck. Each card in the deck, which is made up of 54 cards, carries a point value that will range from -5,-2,0-11. Each player is dealt either 4,6, or 8 of these cards face down and try to end up with the lowest point total at the end of the hand. The hand is over when one player has all of their cards face up on the table. When this has happened, each player adds up the total of the points in their hand and records their score for the hand.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo; The 1916 Battle of Jutland was not the only action on the North Sea during the Great War. The battle cruisers of Britain&rsquo;s Grand Fleet and Germany&rsquo;s High Seas Fleet met in the January 1915 Battle of Dogger Bank, and both fleets continually sortied into the waters dividing them.<br/><br/>Jutland: Dogger Bank continues the story we began with Jutland: North Sea 1914. It&rsquo;s a book of history, scenarios and game/historical analysis, all woven together to use Great War at Sea: Jutland Second Edition to tell the campaign&rsquo;s story.<br/><br/>Dogger Bank picks up the story with the Cuxhaven Raid of December 1914, and continues it into the operations of early 1915 - a rarely-if-ever-discussed part of the North Sea naval campaign. You get 28 new scenarios (11 operational and 17 battle scenarios), plus historical articles and analyses all relating the game play to the actual events. We look at how the game simulates the operations, and then we flesh them out with still more scenarios: fast-playing battle scenarios using just the Tactical Map, and additional operational scenarios using the operational map as well to pick up the action at key decision points and discuss why the admirals involved made the decisions that determined the battle&rsquo;s outcome.<br/><br/>Jutland is already a very fine game (our most popular ever, even more than Third Reich) and a good instrument through which to re-play history. Dogger Bank and North Sea 1914 take it even further.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need a copy of Jutland Second Edition to play these scenarios.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Note: This is designed to work with GWAS Jutland Second Edition (the 2023 printing). It relies on the Second Edition core series rules so there may be issues using older editions/printings of GWAS Jutland with this expansion.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this radical reimagining of Amabel Holland&rsquo;s popular Table Battles series, players fight a series of short, snappy battles that are forgone conclusions. One side brings to bear overwhelming advantages while the other struggles to stave off certain doom as long as possible. Eventually, they will weaken. Inevitably, they will break. There is, mechanically speaking, no way for the doomed side to prevail &ndash; no victory condition at all, and no way for the other side not to achieve theirs. But it&rsquo;s not about that.<br/><br/>It's about how hard you fight when you know you&rsquo;re going to lose. During each battle, the doomed side will score points &ndash; a running tally that carries over from one scenario to the next. If by the end of the third battle they&rsquo;ve hit a certain threshold, they win the game. But that threshold increases when you choose which of the game&rsquo;s six battles to fight next &ndash; easier battles raise your threshold more than hard ones. The doomed player also has access to Advantage cards &ndash; once-per-battle powers that let them break the rules in some way. But each of these you take on also increases your threshold.<br/><br/>From the encircled Romans at Cannae to the trapped paladins at Roncevaux Pass, the outmatched French fleet at Trafalgar and the desperate highlanders at Culloden, this expansion spans desperate, hopeless battles from across human history and points toward an exhilarating new direction for Hollandspiele&rsquo;s bestseller.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For example, merging &quot;chocolate&quot; and &quot;baseball&quot; yields the whimsical &quot;chocball&quot;!  Seems simple enough but the difficulty increases as players must solve different lengths of Portmanteaus to win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty hexagonal board. The default board size is 9 points per side, but it can be played on an 11&ndash;sized board for longer matches or on a 7&ndash;sized board for shorter games. Each player has access to a sufficient supply of stones in their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitions:&ndash; The connection part of a group is an arbitrarily chosen minimal connected subgroup containing two edge stones. If the group does not contain two edge stones, its connection part is empty.<br/>&ndash; The surplus part of a group is the stones not in its connection part. This part can also be empty.<br/>&ndash; The value of a group is the difference between (i) the number of stones in its connection part and (ii) the number of stones in its surplus part (the former minus the latter).<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTurns:&ndash; On the very first turn, Black places one stone on any point.<br/>&ndash; From then on, starting with White, the players take turns placing exactly two stones each on empty points.<br/>&ndash; A player is allowed to pass instead of placing their two stones.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnd of the Game:The game ends when both players pass their turn consecutively, and the player with the group of higher value wins. In the case of a tie, their second-largest groups are compared, and so on until reaching a pair that doesn't have the same value.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotes:This is the improved version of the previous Vadus, being much more organic, which was designed by Sa&iuml;d Gadwen and Michael Amundsen in February 2024.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this Roll &amp; Write game, players will try to gain as much profit as possible with their business of lodging renters.<br/><br/>Each turn we will have 3 cards of renters that can range from 1 to 5 people. These are willing to pay an amount of coins for an apartment and even pay extra if the apartment has certain services. We can host up to 5 people per turn (from one or several cards).<br/><br/>At the beginning of the turn we will roll 1 black die and 2 yellow dice, the black die is common for all players, simultaneously each player chooses one of the yellow dice. With the combination of these 2 dice we form the position coordinate where to place a tenant card in our apartment block. We can place adjacent to this coordinate another tenant card if we do not exceed 5 people staying per turn.<br/><br/>The building has broken elevator, community air conditioners and wifi on the top floors, in addition to the apartments on the sides require soundproofing. Throughout the game we will be able to acquire repairs and soundproofing that we will assign to our choice in order not to suffer penalties and to make our rents profitable.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn we draw a card until we have 3 tenant cards again. The game ends when a collection goal is reached.<br/><br/>It includes an advanced mode where you can score by rows and columns completed and suffer penalties for not taking advantage of the space in the apartments by including all the tenants it can accommodate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the combined-arms battlefield, it&rsquo;s the armor that slashes through and the infantry that takes and holds ground. But it&rsquo;s the artillery that destroys, that creates the breakthroughs and crushes attacks before they even begin.<br/><br/>The Book of Armaments is all about artillery in Panzer Grenadier, focused on the Eastern Front games (Fire in the Steppe, South Flank, Burning Tigers, Broken Axis, Gates of Leningrad, The Deluge, Slovakia&rsquo;s War, Armata Romana) and thus on the Soviet, German and Romanian armies (including related forces like Soviet Guards or German Waffen SS).<br/><br/>It comes with 88 new die-cut and silky-smooth pieces: additional artillery units, plus new units for the heavy and medium batteries of corps- and army-level battalions. There are German 170mm and 210mm guns, Soviet 152mm and 203mm batteries, Romanian 155mm guns and so on. And there are more of the artillery batteries already present in some (though not all) of those games, like the German 105mm howitzer.<br/><br/>In Panzer Grenadier, each off-board artillery increment corresponds to an artillery battery and has the same strength as the battery&rsquo;s indirect fire rating (so most German increments have a strength of 16 just like the 105mm howitzer). The Book of Armaments includes Artillery Display Cards for each player, and you&rsquo;ll put your off-board batteries right there on the chart and change their status as you fire them. While it helps keep track of which ones have fired, more important is the coolness factor of playing with artillery batteries on the game board instead of numbers that you write down on paper.<br/><br/>There book also includes some new artillery-centric optional rules to let you do more stuff with the big guns. And of course there&rsquo;s historical background about the guns and their users.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A competitive card game set in a world of crazy superheroes and dastardly supervillains. At the start of each game, all 52 cards are shuffled and dealt out evenly between the players - these will be a mixture of 'Hero' 'Villain' and 'Civilian' cards. There are also two wild cards - Bad Trevor (the ultimate villain) and his arch nemesis Kamikaze Kevin.<br/><br/>Whoever is dealt Kamikaze Kevin places him face-up in the middle of the table - play starts with this person in a clockwise direction. The aim of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand before your opponents do. On their go, a player lays down an 'attack hand' against the next opponent. This is three cards chosen from their hand that are laid face down in front of them. The opponent must then draw one at random.<br/><br/>If a player draws a Villain card, this will screw them over in some way. If they draw a Hero card this will help them. In both instances, they must read the card out loud, place it on the discard pile and then carry out that instruction. If a player draws a civilian card, this can be discarded providing they have a matching civilian card in their hand. If they do have a pair, both can be placed on the discard pile. The player can then chose to carry on as normal by playing an attack hand against the next opponent in line. They can chose to reverse the order of play. Or they can demand a certain civilian from another player by pointing at them and asking for it by name. However, if they ask someone who doesn't have that card, their go is over and play moves to the next person.<br/><br/>If a player draws Bad Trevor from an opponent's attack hand, they must also pick up all the remaining cards from their attack hand as well - adding them to their own. Bad Trevor is the only card in the deck that can never be discarded, so as play continues and more and more cards are placed on the discard pile, the last person left holding Bad Trevor is crowned the loser of the game.<br/><br/>At any point in the game, is someone suspects that a certain card in a player's attack hand is Bad Trevor they can pick up Kamikaze Kevin, slam him on top of that card and say &quot;Take That Bad Trevor!&quot; If that person turns out to be correct, they can immediately leave the game and hand all their remaining cards to their opponent. However, if they guessed incorrectly, their opponent can leave the game instead and hand all their cards to their accuser. Kamikaze Kevin can only be used once in the entire game, after which he must be placed on the discard pile.<br/><br/>",

Wizards may start out focused on discovery and exploration, fighting when necessary for survival or to win possession of some long-lost artefact or grimoire, but such battles can swiftly become intensely personal. Competitors become adversaries and, as the cycle of violence continues, some wizards lose sight of their original goals and focus their efforts on the elimination of their hated foes &ndash; their mortal enemies.<br/><br/>This 96 page paperback supplement for Frostgrave presents rules for creating recurring villains in both competitive and solo campaigns. These characters are unique individuals who return over the course of a campaign to plague the players' wizards, gaining experience, recruiting allies, and becoming more deadly with each appearance. Against such threats, a wizard's base becomes as much hideout as headquarters, and an expanded range of options for enhancing bases is provided, as are rules for defending your own... and attacking those of your rivals!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The heavily fortified German &lsquo;Winter Line&rsquo; ran through the town and was a significant obstacle for the Allies, as it protected an important highway and <br/>blocked their advance on Rome.<br/>The ten day engagement began with a direct attack led by the Fifth Army. After securing the peak of Mount Samb&uacute;caro, an assault on Mount Lungo was planned for the 15th of December. After four successive Allied attacks and German counterattacks, the German soldiers were forced to retreat to more defensive positions to the North. At 12:30 on December 16th, for the first time during the war, Italian and US flags were waving on top of Mount Lungo.<br/><br/>",

As the game goes on, players will shuffle and capture pieces in an attempt to be the last remaining player on the board. A game of Zeno cannot end in a draw.<br/><br/>Equipment: checkers or chess set<br/><br/>Setup: players place all their 8 pieces on their third rank.<br/><br/>Gameplay: starting with white, turns alternate. On a turn you may move one of your pieces in any of the three forward directions one space. At the conclusion of this move, two things happen: you may choose enemy pieces on the rank your piece is now on to advance in the exact opposite direction to your movement one space; any piece that lands on one of your pieces or one of the opponent's own pieces is captured and removed from the game. Following the enemy movement phase, friendly pieces of your choosing on the rank you just moved from can be moved, likewise, in the exact opposite direction one space. Players may make self-capturing moves either off the end of the board or onto any remaining pieces and must do so if no other moves remain. Note: self-capture moves only trigger the backwards movement of friendly pieces as the piece doesn't land on its destination. Passing is strictly prohibited.<br/><br/>Objective: be the last player with pieces remaining on the board. In practice it is polite to resign when it's obvious the players have passed each other and there are fewer moves remaining than the opponent has.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game combines exploration, hidden information and high interaction. Players need to secure precious treasure from the vampire hideout, while rescuing villagers from the grasp of the night creatures. But beware, bites can weaken you and even turn you into a creature of the night yourself! Players explore a vampire infested mansion represented by partly hidden cards, advancing their 2 personal guards (meeples) from room to room, uncovering the hidden content as they enter each room.<br/>Each room, represented by a card, allows you to interact with what is inside by playing items (cards) from a limited hand. These will help your guard inside the room rescuing villagers, evade vampires and hinder rival guards.<br/>Players attempt to reach the garden of the house safely in order to hold one of two available spots that allow a player to claim loot, revealed during exploration.<br/>You win the game with the highest total of gathered points, scored by rescuing villagers, elimination vampires (unique members from the vampire dynasty scoring more points when collected as a set) and getting hold of valuable items.

In El Reviente del Rock edition you will have data on the excesses, parties and fun of the most well-known rock characters in history (or not so well-known but crazy enough to earn a place in this game). Test your knowledge about the most popular musical genre in history.<br/><br/>The deck has 102 cards with questions about rock that are answered with some number. To start, they grab a random card, read it aloud and reveal the answer, that is going to be the starting point in the data row.<br/><br/>On your turn, you are going to grab the first question from the deck and, without seeing the answer, you are going to place it to the left or right of the card you used as your starting point. If you think the answer is a greater number than the one in the data row, you put your card on the left and, if you think it is smaller, on the right. When you have chosen where to put the card, you turn it over to see if you were right. If the card is placed correctly, it's the next player's turn, if it's wrong, you take it out and keep it. If you place two cards wrong, you are immediately eliminated.<br/><br/>Alert! As the game progresses there will be more cards in the data row and you will have to take them all into account when placing the question that comes your turn.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT: You can mix the three thematic editions of Datos No Opiniones and play purely Sex, Drugs and Rock n' Roll.<br/><br/>",

I have played through multiple seasons playing my favorite teams in the CFL and NFL and I'm very happy with the results.<br/><br/>One thing you will find is all of the player and team ratings come from statistics, opposed to subjective ratings. This does make it a challenge with older seasons where statistical data is not as available.<br/><br/>If you own Forty Nine Football, all of the new seasons will still work perfectly with your original game. But, it is being rebranded into two games, Quick Decks Football, and On The Turf Football. Quick Decks is a perfect standalone quick play game where you play through all the plays in a game with realistic stats. On The Turf Football brings in Defensive play calling, and special plays for both Offense and Defense.

There are over 1028 possible positions to create in Phase 1 and hundreds of actions to choose from each turn in the Combat Phase! <br/>Goal of the game is to disable the opponent. That is no surprise, is it? The way to do that is by hitting the opponent&rsquo;s Kill Switch. If you succeed in that, all enemy units are turned off immediately and you win.

It is not wise to underestimate anyone who holds the title of moff, as they are granted considerable authority and dominance over Imperial forces. Moff Gideon would end up proving to be an especially tenacious adversary for the Mandalorian, as he spared no resources in his search for the boy named Grogu, whom he referred to as &quot;the asset.&quot;<br/><br/>In pursuit of this goal, Moff Gideon has activated numerous dark troopers, powerful and sophisticated battle droids that are nearly invulnerable to conventional weapons. With the venerated Dark Sword in his possession, Moff Gideon will not give up his efforts until he has achieved what he wants...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Only by finding the pair of special cards can you uncover the exact location of a treasure or curse; the pair will tell you the row and column of the item &mdash; the intersection of the row and column is the location of the item.<br/><br/>Because these treasures are harder to find, each one has a value of 36! But beware, these cards also introduce an extra curse! At the end of the game, these treasures are awarded out like normal (evenly split between the surrounding players).<br/><br/>Because 4 random cards are replaced, the game now has a variable amount of curses that ranges from 1 to 5.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, these vibrant underwater cities are dying. Climate change and its effect of rising sea temperatures is devastating the colorful algae that give coral reefs their brilliant hues, resulting in coral bleaching. Furthermore, other threats like pollution&mdash;in its various insidious forms&mdash;and overfishing are disrupting the delicate balance of reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>And so, scientists from various fields, along with the researchers studying the ecological complexity and significance of the reefs, are collaborating to address the myriad challenges facing these ecosystems. Your assignment is to take command of a scientific vessel and embark on a journey of reef conservation. Hire the best crew, clean the ocean, and restore the reefs to their former glory.<br/><br/>During the game, players take on the role of researchers and saviors of the oceans. You will sail the seas, hire crew, explore the coral reef, clean the ocean sectors of any pollution, and try to accomplish as many missions as possible.<br/><br/>On their turn players may choose to RECHARGE or TRAVEL. If they RECHARGE, they gain the rewards from the VP track. If they TRAVEL, they may deploy Reef Balls, move their Ship, play Mission cards, and perform various actions. The game is played for a variable number of rounds. When a player has crossed the 45 VP threshold, the end of the game is triggered. After an additional round the final scoring takes place and the player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your attention is drawn to book after book as you scan the pages about different kinds of outcasts and creatures. But then, suddenly, a small book catches your eye. Its title: &quot;Rulebook, Creatures and Outcasts&quot;. When you carefully slide the book towards you from the dusty bookcase, cards fall out. It appears to be an ancient card game about mythical creatures and outcasts. You quickly open the rulebook and begin to read...<br/><br/>In Wednesday: Creatures &amp; Outcasts, 2-6 players play cards on a stack. Each card played needs to be higher than the previous one, and all cards left in your hand when the round ends count as penalty points. Outsmart your opponents by getting rid of the cards you hold as quickly as possible. Should you wait for the right moment to play your highest cards, or take a risk and face major consequences? Stay alert because well-known characters from Wednesday will keep you on your toes. After all, what is a game without some unexpected twists?<br/><br/>After five rounds, the player with the best score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Army of the Potomac: Campaigns of 1862 and 1864 is the second volume in the Civil War Heritage series and the follow-up game to the innovative and acclaimed Rebel Fury. Army of the Potomac uses the same core rules as Rebel Fury, so players familiar with Rebel Fury will be able to jump right into the action. Each battle in Army of the Potomac is quick-set-up, quick-playing, and deeply interactive. The density of counters in each scenario is low, allowing you to see and experience the big picture of the battle.<br/><br/>Army of the Potomac covers the battles of Spotsylvania II, North Anna River, Cold Harbor, and the entire Seven Days battle (McClellan vs Lee), including the prelude Seven Pines (McClellan vs Johnston) when Johnston's wounding brought Lee into the command of the Army of Northern Virginia. Each battle places you, the player, in the role of the Army Commander (Grant, McClellan, Lee, Johnston). You maneuver your army to find the enemy&rsquo;s flanks, concentrate your forces for an attack, and determine where to commit your artillery assets.<br/><br/>Units are portrayed at the Infantry/Cavalry division level. The Civil War Heritage series game system features a new Zone of Influence/Zone of Control mechanic that controls unit formation (March/Battle) based on their proximity to your opponent. As your units close with the enemy, your forces naturally break into battle formation, where they then maneuver the last distance to engage. Unlike most hex and counter wargames, this system allows you total freedom to move units in any order multiple times, unleashing the full range of historical tactics in a simple and clean format.<br/><br/>Combat features a differential combat system with few but significant factors that capture the key features of Civil War division level combat. Units are rated for quality, artillery support, supporting units, and terrain. The game features artillery duels with the occasional Exploding Caisson result. The Civil War Heritage series combat system accurately depicts the ability of units to launch multiple waves of attacks on the same position, capturing the back-and-forth nature of many famous combat duels.<br/><br/>Army of the Potomac also includes a set of campaign rules that allow you to conduct operations from Spotsylvania to Cold Harbor featuring logistics and attrition. Also included are two bonus scenarios to allow owners of Rebel Fury to also fight Spotsylvania II and begin the Campaign scenario from Wilderness to Cold Harbor using their original Rebel Fury map.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>    Five Paper Maps<br/>    Three Countersheets<br/>    Two Player Aids<br/>    Two Off Map Displays<br/>    One Turn Record Track<br/>    Two 10-sided dice<br/>    One custom 6-sided die<br/>    One Rulebook<br/>    One Playbook<br/>    One 2&quot; Box<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Two opposing heroes &mdash; Hector of the Trojans and Achilles of the Greeks &mdash; seek the favor of the gods to lend them support and tip the scales of fate. Only one side will emerge victorious, its hero becoming the legend of the Iliad.<br/><br/>Iliad is a tile-placement strategy game for two-players by Reiner Knizia. On your turn, select one of two tiles from your hand and place it onto the board adjacent to an opponent's tile. Both players have symmetrical pools of tiles, with their strength ranging from 1-5, along with the Dolos tile that mimics your opponent's adjacent tiles). The key to victory lies behind the relentless tension of where and when to commit your tiles. When placing a tile, you may also activate the tile's ability, which can serve to turn the tide of war.<br/><br/>When a row or column is filled, the player with the highest total strength in that line earns the right to select one of the two success tokens at the ends of that row or column; the other token goes to their opponent. Success tokens can earn you the favor of the Gods, and they can earn (or cost you) points. At the end of the game, the winner is the player who has earned the favor of all five Gods. If both players &mdash; or neither of them &mdash; meet this qualification, then the player who has earned the most points wins. Thus, players will face tough tactical trade-offs as they must decide whether to compete for exclusive favor of the Gods or for the most points &mdash; then influence the outcome of the game toward their intended advantage.<br/><br/>Iliad is the first game in the Mythos Collection, a line of two-player titles by Bitewing Games featuring strategy and mythology.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Founders of Reyvick is a 3-5 player economic game of speculation and competition on the newly settled world of Reyvick. Each player controls a company just starting out on the planet that is attempting to amass the most wealth and craft the greatest legacy. Players deploy their partners to collect resources from their assets and complete projects that further research, exploration, and building across the planet.<br/><br/>A game of Founders of Reyvick revolves around assets, which include the districts on Reyvick as well as special assets that differ in each game. Companies compete to own these assets and take advantage of the resources and revenue that they provide, while maximizing their profit by buying low and selling high. Each game round begins by resolving a draw of event tiles. Most tiles place new population, resources like flora and fauna research, or the mysterious &quot;Unobtanium&quot; into the various districts of Reyvick, but some events present setbacks for companies to manage.<br/><br/>While the promise of rich resources have drawn many to Reyvick, the economic climate there is unique. Unlike other planets, Reyvick's Ruling Council uses a radical approach to managing the many companies seeking profits on Reyvick. Every game round, each player must set the price at which they would be willing to sell each of their assets to another player. Players are then obliged to respect their own valuation, so the price must be chosen carefully; if you set it too low, someone else will take over your asset and make a profit, but at the end of the turn you must pay taxes on the price you've set on every asset, so you also don't want to set it too high.<br/><br/>Once prices are set, the Council distributes whatever taxes were collected in the previous turn. Some portion of those taxes will fund public projects, which are placed in districts for the welfare of its citizens &mdash; and companies &mdash; while the rest is distributed to players. Rights to the resources and profits from a district or special asset are always for sale; any company can buy them by paying the price set by the current owner &mdash; and every asset on Reyvick has a price!<br/><br/>Once you purchase an asset, you must immediately set the price as at the beginning of the turn. You can set it to any amount that is higher than what you paid, but the Council will tax you based on what you claim your assets are worth, and those taxes are distributed as incentives in a public/private partnership, so your tax money can end up benefiting your competition.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the greatest combination of wealth, assets, and projects wins. Founders of Reyvick is based on the economic theories of Nobel Prize-winning economist William Vickrey, as well as the writings of Eric Posner and Glen Weyl, especially their book Radical Markets.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Together, you can restore the planet's vibrant beauty. Your task is to complete sky cards with colored dice and recruit tiles from the most talented Sky Painters to achieve this mission. Are you ready for the challenge?<br/><br/>Sky Painters is a strategy game for 2 to 4 players. The game's rhythm is very simple: you place dice to complete cards as contracts. Completed cards grant you spot chips and heart tokens, which you then use to acquire Sky Painter tiles and unlock their powers. The real challenge lies in the players' tension, as there are three ways to win:<br/><br/><br/>     Completing 9 cards in a 3x3 grid.<br/>     Completing a 5-pointed star with 5 Sky Painter tiles.<br/>     Having the most points at the end of the game, if neither of the other two conditions are met.<br/><br/><br/>Who will become first the greatest master of colors?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Descending to the surface in sealed Hovercones, a multitude of scientists and researchers, both human and otherworldly, will spread across this virginal world to study the diverse and often bizarre fauna found in all of its varied biomes. From vast savannahs and scattered pocket forests to the frozen tundra and the mystifying Amoebic Sea, explorers will rise to the challenges of a world teeming with biological wonders. It is, here, on Darwin IV that the human race will begin to fulfill its age-old yearning to explore the universe and understand the intricacies of an alien planet.<br/><br/>Based on Wayne Barlowe&rsquo;s beautifully illustrated book &lsquo;Expedition&rsquo;, players take on the role of human scientists in the year 2358 AD, exploring the alien world Darwin IV in search of new life. Piloting their hovercones across different biomes, scientists will locate and study the unique indigenous species of Darwin IV, in an effort to learn more about the planet&rsquo;s strange and wondrous inhabitants. With the data they&rsquo;ve collected, each scientist will share their work with their benign custodians, the Yma, earning them reputation.<br/><br/>But Darwin IV isn&rsquo;t without its dangers, as scientists must also be cautious with the planet&rsquo;s more aggressive predators, navigate its unpredictable weather patterns, and avoid other deadly off-world threats&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Keep your enemies guessing with bluffs, misdirection, and cunning strategy.<br/><br/>Villains is a 3-5 player game where each player represents a different faction of archetypal villains (players can choose from the invading aliens, an organized crime family, the robot uprisings, invading soviets and more).<br/><br/>Each turn the players secretly set their evil plans in motion by placing face down action tokens in different areas of the city. These tokens allow players to deploy troops, play action cards, initiate battles and use special faction specific abilities.<br/><br/>There are two paths to victory in a game of Villains: be the first player to complete four of your faction's plans or alternatively be the first player to achieve ten victory points by controlling important locations in The City.<br/><br/>",

The rondels provide another tactical layer, including the enemy's devious and challenging AI.<br/><br/>The rules allow you to learn to play in 15 minutes, with a typical game round lasting less than ten minutes, even with up to six players, but deep, strategic cooperation will be required for your band of heroes to make it through to the Abyssal Rift and maybe even come out alive.<br/><br/>Perdition&rsquo;s Mouth is designed to be played as a story-supported campaign over several gaming sessions. In the campaign, you have to fight through at least six increasingly challenging scenarios and the level of success during each adventure has a direct effect on the rest of the story. Can you survive the labyrinth of the insectoid god?<br/><br/>Perdition&rsquo;s Mouth: Abyssal Rift Gamer&rsquo;s Bundle edition contains all and everything the Retail edition does along with two mini-expansions, Hideout and Witch&rsquo;s Grotto.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tri Dimensional Chess, or tri-d chess was inspired by a stage property created by Irving A Feinberg for use in the Star Trek television program. While it appeared or was referenced in six episodes (Where No Man Has Gone Before, Charlie X. Court Martial, By Any Other Name, Whom Gods Destroy (dialogue only), Day of the Dove) no rules were ever developed for the game during the original run of the show. However, it did appear to be a two-player only game played with with standard chess pieces having (when viewed in plan) standard chess moves albeit on a multi-level play area.<br/><br/>The play area consists of three chequered 4x4 boards, called levels, mounted at different heights so that the bottom level overlaps the middle level by 2 rows at one end and the top level overlaps the middle by 2 rows at the other end. Additionally, four 2x2 boards, called attack boards, are mounted on columns that may be fitted at any of the four corners of the three main levels. These attack boards may be moved around during play. Due to the overlap, all the boards are transparent. When viewed from above, the square colour of one level or attack board matches the colour and of those above and below (e.g. colourless above colourless, coloured above coloured; the colourless squares are called white and the coloured are called black in standard terminology). However, in the television series (e.g., By Any Other Name) the top level is oriented so that the left hand square of the side nearest the camera is red while the corresponding square of the middle and bottom levels are both colourless meaning this top down perspective of matching colours above colours was not based on the tv show.<br/><br/>Outside of the tv show, rules for the game were first hinted at in the 1975 Ballantine Books in Franz Josef Schnaubelt's Star Trek Star Fleet Technical Manual but there is nothing close to a playable game explained. Encouraged by Schnaubelt, chess player and Star Trek fan Andrew Bartmess published a full set of rules of play. Since then numerous rule sets have been created including those by Jens Meder which include rules for tournament play (largely meaning rules on arbitration, use of a chess clock, official notation, etc.) and the official rules of the World Tri Dimensional Chess Federation written by military fighter pilot John Hawkins ostensibly partially inspired by aerial combat tactics.<br/><br/>The most notable difference between the various sets of rules are to do with the attack boards and vertical movement of pieces. For example, do the attack boards always stand above the levels, or may they be &quot;inverted&quot; to hang as pendants below the levels? Can they move with just one pawn or with any other single piece?  When viewed in plan, do pieces block movement for all levels or can the moving piece travel on one level if the other piece is on a different level? Can pieces move just vertically or must they always have least some horizontal component? Lesser differences between rules sets include promotion (e.g., does an attack board above the pawn mean the pawn does not promote) and castling (i.e., kings and rooks start on the attack boards, do they just swap spaces or does one piece move to the main level).<br/><br/>While Tri-D chess bears similarity to the 3-D Chess Game from Lynn R Johnson, the first episode featuring the Tri-D chess set aired in 1966 while Johnson's game was not published until 1967.<br/><br/>",

They have fighters that don't need carriers. If the original game had fighters that were like TIE Fighters, these are more like X-Wing. They don't have boarding ships or Titans, but have a new class of ships. The other ships have slightly different stats/costs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Variable, but balanced home systems. Everyone has the same home system for balance reasons. However, knowing what you are going to find is something that has always bothered many people. This will fix that.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Scenario Cards. Around 30 cards and 1 or 2 could be flipped to change the overall galaxy conditions for the game. A couple of these are from the scenario book, but most are new.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Missions. Missions are Resource Cards that can't be just played, but require a player to complete something on the map to gain a larger benefit. Think of the plot of a simple Trek episode.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Deep Space Planetary Attributes. The NPA planets in deep space will now have a bit of personality. Some will be harder or easier to take. Some will really be worth fighting over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Crew Cards. Not everyone will always want to play with these, but they will bring even more personality into the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Facilities Game. Two new facilities are added. This will really complete the facilities game.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Everything else. Extra cards of every type, Starbases, Defense Satellites, Cyber Armor, New Terrain, more terrain to support larger scenarios (more terrain is needed anyway to support larger scenarios so new terrain types are also included).<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player plays a mob boss trying to take over the top spot in New York City. The game is designed to be a low complexity family game and takes about 45-60 minutes to play. The tone is very light and very socially interactive.<br/><br/>The goal is to take control of different places and people in the &quot;Neighborhood&quot;. As you do so, you gain reputation. The first player to reach the reputation goal wins.<br/><br/>Here's the cool part of the game...<br/><br/>The cornerstone to the game is the &quot;Vendetta&quot; mechanic. If I take control of the local Delicatessen, I get some Reputation points. If you then come and Whack (destroy) the Deli, you take the Reputation points I gained from controlling Deli.<br/><br/>But wait!<br/><br/>There's more!<br/><br/>When you Whack my Deli, you must give me some of your Vendetta counters. The specific number is noted on the Deli card. If I attack you in the future, I can spend your Vendetta counters to pump up my attack against your places and people.<br/><br/>So, the more you Whack a player, the more bonuses they have in the future to Whack you back.<br/><br/>This does 2 cool things.<br/><br/>First, you get the whole &quot;Grudge&quot; or &quot;Now it's personal&quot; aspect of mob warfare.<br/><br/>Second, even if a player gets Whacked hard, he still has the resources to make a comeback. Which means until a player wins, everyone has a shot at winning.<br/><br/>The design came together very fast, and the artist, Jerry, is doing a great job of capturing the light feel we're going for.<br/><br/>",

To prevent this, the Deathwatcher sends his curse to hunt the players, killing them on contact. If a player should die, he transforms into a minion of the Deathwatcher. This player can still win by scoring points when he kills other players. Players use standees to move on the gameboard and a charactersheet to keep track of their scores and possessions.<br/><br/>The dungeon is represented by a non-modular map which has several routes of varying length with unexplored rooms that are only revealed when a player enters them and are either a dead end or not. This ensures the need for flexible planning by players. It is up to each player to plot a route through the crypt and modify their plan according to revealed rooms and the actions of other players.<br/>In their turn players must first choose how they move. Either slowly and sneaky to attract less attention and find more treasure or fast and reckless to cover more ground. <br/>Then they roll the dungeon die to see what happens to him or her that round. This will be highly influenced by the choice of movement.<br/>Lastly they must deal with obstacles like traps or combat which occurs when a player draws a monster card or when a player that became a servant of the Deathwatcher catches a still living player.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>From the rear of the box:<br/>The University of Leicester was founded in 1921 as a living memorial to World War I. The aim of the men and women who built the institution was that sacrifices made in in war should be commemorated through education and research that would change the world for the better. Our values reflect our motto Ut Vitum Habeant - 'so that they may have life', and today our University is a lively energetic and global community, in which dedicated and talented people are working towards, and helping people shape, the future.  We are committed to research that saves, improves and enriches lives, and to being a University that is accessible to talented students from all backgrounds.<br/>Whether you are a current Leicester student, graduated years ago or are a member of staff, we hope you enjoy University of Leicester MONOPOLY and it captures the spirit of your Leicester experience.<br/><br/>",

However, the sailors have grown comfortable and neglected to respect Tiamat. In an effort to regain the control she once had, Tiamat has entrapped random sailors in her ever-changing seas of chaos. Forcing these sailors to turn to a life of piracy, they will have to navigate ever changing seas, explore ocean, plunder treasure and fight each other to survive! Only the most successful and rich sailor turned pirate will be set free from her chaotic world.<br/><br/>Players each start with a simple vessel and gradually gain stats to build their vessel in different categories to develop their own strategy to win. Players can upgrade their speed, hull size, defense, and attack. The more treasure you collect, you advance your Pirate Rating. The first player to a Pirate Rating of five, triggers game end. The winner is the player with the highest value of treasure.<br/><br/>The game board is modular. The modular hexagonal tiles consist of different islands and treasure that need to be discovered to come into play. There are islands that contain treasure, repair docks, Merchant ports where you can buy Merchant cards to help you on your travels, or empty islands that complicate your sailing. There are also open ocean tiles and whirlpools. Whirlpools also give you cards, of which most have negative effects on your ship or others. The games starts with everyone on the main island. Once a player starts sailing, they discover the modular game tiles as them move. The tiles are pulled at random from a shuffled deck to keep the gameboard different for every game.<br/><br/>While a player navigates the treacherous waters, they are on the lookout for treasure. Once a player finds their treasure, they will plunder it from an island, and bring it back to the starting Island in which they will bury the treasure for safe keeping.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes the role of a dream-diver trying to study the consciousness of their subject, while also acting as a subject trying to mislead and evade their diver.<br/><br/>Players draft and build 12 card decks from a pool of 97 unique cards. These are Dream cards that they will be trying to hide from their diver, Dive cards that will define their methods of interpreting their subject's cards, and Lucid cards which will shape their overall strategy.<br/><br/>Each player plays as a Diver, trying to find their Subject&rsquo;s valuable cards, and a Subject, trying to hide their valuable cards from a Diver.<br/><br/>Lucid is meant to give all the fun and stimulation of a drafting + deck-builder, in far less time, and with all the sneaky clever moments of a bluffing game.<br/><br/>Quick Rules Overview:<br/><br/>Lucid has 3 card types. Every 12-card deck contains 4 cards of each type. <br/>Dreams - These are the cards you try to hide from your diver. <br/>Dives - These are the cards you use to interpret your opponent&rsquo;s cards, generally searching for dreams.<br/>Lucids - These cards give you a specific bonus while active, and can be resolved for a larger bonus when replaced by another lucid.<br/><br/>Every round each player will:<br/><br/>Draw 3 cards<br/><br/>Prepare 3 cards:<br/>Place 3 cards in front of you face-down, in 3 positions. Outer, Middle, and Inner.<br/><br/>Interpret one of their subject&rsquo;s cards:<br/>Your subject is the player to your left. You interpret one of their cards by flipping it face-up.

While your opponent commands an evenly matched army, they lack your selection of leadership and myriad tactics. Just as one drop in the ocean contributes to the tide, so too shall your Sashimono banners guide your army to ultimate victory!<br/><br/>Players assign Sashimono cards to a row or column in their 3x3 grid of Kumi cards. Based on what Kumi cards are present in that line, they may perform actions listed on the assigned Sashimono card. These actions include manipulating their own grid or starting a battle with an opponent's line of cards. The in-play Sashimono cards also have a puzzle-like scoring condition, and if met, will &quot;Bow&quot; (turn horizontally) into a &quot;check&quot; state. Your opponent then has their next turn to try to &quot;Unbow&quot; your scoring condition. A player wins immediately when they score 3 of their Sashimono cards.<br/><br/><br/>     Historic era subject brought to life by 17th century art, names, banners, and dates.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Use battle to defend your objectives or ruin your opponent's plans.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Minimal components, maximum replay, with 34 different goals.<br/><br/><br/>",

Instead of having half-cabins in the middle of each segment, these blueprints have half-cabins in one of three places&ndash;left, center, or right&ndash;on their tops and bottoms. In order to build a segment into a shuttle, it must make a full cabin with other previously-installed segments.<br/><br/>The Advanced Technologies module introduces upgradeable versions of the technology tiles from the base game; each Technology now has a technology track along the bottom that determines the level of its ability. Each Technology starts with its ability being the same as in the base game, but can eventually become better.<br/><br/>The Advanced Locations module upgrades the locations throughout the game when a certain number of Developments have been built. When a location is upgraded, it grants bonuses to players based on how many Developments they've built adjacent to that location.<br/><br/>There are also new Agenda Cards, new Upgrade Tokens, a new Cockpit and Engine tile, and and 2 new Expert Worker Tiles.

Whilst this game is not a &lsquo;narrative driven&rsquo; game as such, with a little imagination it will provide memorable stories. Some events are randomly generated, but the Player always has at least some degree of control over the level of risk they wish to take and how vulnerable they leave their Tank to these potential Events.<br/><br/>Whilst the Player will be controlling just one US unit (the Sherman) there were of course many other types of US units present in these battles. Those units are not depicted on the game Maps, but US casualties can be suffered and the game includes a mechanism to reflect this. The longer Scenarios take to complete and the more Japanese units there are on the Map, the more general US casualties will be inflicted and this can result in defeat for the Player should those casualties get too high.<br/><br/>This game is a sequel to, not an expansion of, Lone Sherman. It is a standalone game.<br/><br/>The aim of this book game is to present a clear, accessible, and quick to learn game, so that players can get into the action quickly. Each of the 12 Scenarios can be played in around an hour, although sometimes a Scenario will last a much shorter time if your Tank is destroyed! Each Scenario provides plenty of replayability due to the random set up of the initial forces and the many Events and decisions in the game.<br/><br/>This book is a solitaire hex and counter style wargame. You play the game, and the enemy is controlled by the game book (or the Artificial Intelligence or &lsquo;AI&rsquo;). You will need to bring at least 5, but preferably 7, standard six-sided dice. Full colour 'Mission Maps' are included, as are suggested counters which can be removed and mounted on card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is foretold that the last of the Sanctum&rsquo;s champions will stand between the coming terrors and oblivion. That time has finally come to pass&hellip;&rdquo;<br/><br/>Heroes of the Sanctum: The Strategy Card Game is a portable, quest-based solo/co-op adventure set in a dark, post-apocalyptic fantasy universe. In Heroes of the Sanctum, players embark on perilous quests, assembling a party of 4 heroes from a selection of 12 unique characters to confront the creatures of the Rift and achieve their objectives. While traversing hazardous regions, players interact with their surroundings, overcome threats, acquire loot, manage equipment, and advance their heroes while protecting their Sanctum Banners.<br/><br/>During each turn, players draw a Stratagem card that provides the party with Action Points, a temporary effect, and a variety of available actions. These actions can be assigned using distinctive double-sided Hero Tokens. Players are tasked with navigating imminent perils and striving to fulfil the objectives of the Sanctum. However, they must be prepared for the reactive responses of immediate threats and even the environment itself. Victory can only be achieved by meeting the specific conditions outlined on the chosen Quest card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The alliance between House Tully and House Stark is one of the strongest in Westeros. The two have been taking to the field together for generations. In its darkest hour, House Stark knows it can rely on House Tully to be there, sending their best troops to engage the enemy. And those best troops are arguably the Tully Cavaliers, some of the most resilient and well-trained cavalry units in the land. House Stark players will soon be able to add this stalwart unit to their ranks. Let&rsquo;s take a look at what these riders can do.<br/><br/>If there is one thing the House Tully Cavaliers are known for, it&rsquo;s their devastating charges. While cavalry units of all types are known for strong charge attacks, the Tully Cavaliers&rsquo; make any other cavalry&rsquo;s charge seem quaint by comparison. On the tabletop, this is represented by the Cavalier&rsquo;s Lance attack. It rolls six dice whenat full ranks and gains several bonuses when charging, including: 3 extra dice, Critical Blow, and Sundering. So, they have more dice to attack with, gain extra Hits when they roll 6s, and the enemy&rsquo;s Defense Save is reduced. Truly, they can devastate an enemy formation with an attack like that. The Cavalier&rsquo;s best bet is to charge in and wipe out an enemy right away.<br/><br/>However, assuming that doesn&rsquo;t happen, the Cavaliers aren&rsquo;t entirely helpless. Their own Defense Save is a very sturdy 3+ and their Morale is a 5+. The unit will not easily be taking Wounds and will be passing most Morale Tests they make, even if they are given some sort of disadvantage.<br/><br/>The view of a unit of Tully Cavaliers baring down on their enemies is enough to raise the morale of surrounding troops. This is brought to the tabletop via the unit&rsquo;s Embolden ability. It grants other friendly units within Short Range a +1 to their Morale test rolls. This means more of the Stark player&rsquo;s rolls will be successful and fewer models will be removed when a test is made. As such, the Cavaliers are a great centerpiece, literally, to any army.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Part of the tactical revision involved using smaller teams of men going deep into enemy territory. Intelligence gathering was extremely important in Vietnam. Development of the Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol followed. In fact, the concept was not new and similar methods had been used many years before in the American Revolutionary War and in World War II amongst others. In Vietnam, the LRRPs (pronounced Lurps) usually consisted of around six men. They worked closely as a team, were heavily armed and generally did whatever was necessary to get the job done. Their aim was to remain undetected if possible. Working deep behind enemy lines, as well as reconnaissance they carried out a variety of mission types.<br/><br/>In this game you will control a LRRP as they are dropped in the jungle, carry out their mission orders and then proceed to the extraction zone.

Beast cards use their power to attack an opponent's team, while the Grotto cards boost the power or abilities of Beasts.

Challengers are used for the special Jerma Rumble variant of the game, letting players team up with the characters of Jerma985's jermaverse.<br/><br/>As players summon cards from their hand, they add cards to their Summoning Pool while their opponent draws cards from their Summoning Pool.

Whether you are a lifelong baseball fan or just looking for a new spin on game night, Ballpark Classics delivers the fun, excitement, and atmosphere of real baseball right in you own home. You pitch by placing a steel baseball into the pitching pipe and squeezing it with your thumb or fingers. By changing your finger placement and adjusting the force, you can throw fastballs, curves, change-ups, sliders, and even create your own pitches. It&rsquo;s easy to do, but challenging to perfect, just like real baseball. <br/>Batting is all about timing, bat speed, and getting inside the pitcher&rsquo;s head. Ballpark Classics features batting so realistic that you can get called out on a check swing. You can play head-to-head, in teams, or by yourself. Pitching, hitting, walks, strikeouts, home runs, strategy, it&rsquo;s all here, except for the smell of freshly mowed grass. They&rsquo;re working on that. Ballpark Classics, Inc. was recently granted an MLB license and is releasing scale model field inserts of Yankee Stadium, Fenway Park, and others in 2009. Ballpark Classics is developing an ever expanding product line of past and presnt MLB parks. By comparison, the Front Porch Classics baseball game is a one-player mechanical pinball game with an inclined playing surface.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gods of war - Robert E. Lee is a historical wargame, set in time of American Civil War and mid 19th century. <br/>You can play battles from Bull Run to Gettysburg but also from Solferino to Sedan.<br/>The game is part of a series called gods of war. The first was the Gods of War &ndash; Napoleon. The game concerned the Napoleonic wars and was published only in Polish. <br/>Another planned title is Gods of War &ndash; Togo, which will enable naval battles in the period from the Battle of Trafalgar to the Battle of Tsushima. <br/>Each game in the series has its patron, general or admiral who won many battles. In the case of General Lee, he became the patron of the game due to the fact that the project initially concerned only the American Civil War. The game was very well received, so we created its second edition, which allows you to play through various conflicts in the mid-19th century, from the Crimean War to the Franco-Prussian War.<br/><br/>The main rulebook contains lists for the armies of the Union and the Confederacy. <br/>Successive armies and war theaters are issued with add-ons to the game. <br/>The first was the Rule Britannia which introduced two British armies &ndash; the main one and the colonial one. Their organization and armament concern the late 1850s and the first half of the 1860s, so they allow for the hypothetical participation of the British in the American Civil War, but also the 2nd Opium War, the Indian Mutiny, or even the expedition to Abyssinia.<br/><br/>Play the role of the commander-in-chief of an entire army and you will play the battle from this perspective. The game is therefore designed to play the greatest battles of the era, such as Gettysburg, Sedan, or Solferino. Your main task will be to manage your generals. You can have an excellent battleplan, but if you order an offensive to a cautious general or defense, to very aggressive one &ndash; your plan may fail. Imagine Jackson instead of Ewell at Gettysburg and you will get the point. Poor commander won&rsquo;t be able to execute a sophisticated plan, but they may be good enough for a frontal assault or static defense. As a commander in chief you have to bear in mind all of this.<br/><br/>The fog of war is also very important. We use a system of patrol markers, at least half of them are &ldquo;empty&rdquo; (just a patrol) half of them hide corps. Your enemy does not now which patrol marker is just a patrol or a corps. Only when two patrol markers or patrol and a unit close to certain distance, they are revealed. And that&rsquo;s how you again have to thing as a real commander in chief from mid 19th century. Is that hill in the middle a good spot for artillery? So is this enemy patrol marker just an empty marker or maybe his reserve artillery? You have to read terrain, and make a lot of guessing. Make a decisions without a full knowledge of your enemy positions. That&rsquo;s the real mid 19th century warfare!<br/><br/>The game is scaled to easily play huge battles, so one infantry and cavalry stand is one brigade, one artillery stand is on brigade or battalion of artillery. Because of the focus of commanding many things like combat or movement are simplified. As a commander in chief you don&rsquo;t bother about tactics of regiments or individual brigades, but you will watch the performance of entire corps, and divisions.<br/><br/>Recommended for 6mm.<br/>Publisher produce own range of miniatures.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Raise merry hell with the legendary operators of the Special Air Service!<br/><br/>SAS: Rogue Regiment is a WW2 stealth action game for 1-4 players. Taking on the role of SAS soldiers in the pivotal weeks following D-Day, players must carry out acts of sabotage deep behind enemy lines.<br/><br/>Ambush convoys, assassinate high ranking officers, destroy ammo dumps and much, much more in your four man campaign against the Axis war machine!<br/><br/>Strike from the shadows!<br/>Take down enemy patrols and sentries with the vast array of tools at your disposal, from rifles, explosives and grenades to vehicles, traps and your trusty fighting knife.<br/><br/>Leave no trace!<br/>Move quickly and quietly to complete your objectives. Kill silently and hide the bodies to avoid detection. Get spotted, make too much noise or take too long to carry out your objective and the enemy will raise the alarm. Your heavily outnumbered team won&rsquo;t last long in a firefight so when the attack comes, make sure you&rsquo;re in position to make four men feel like a hundred!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each turn, every SAS operator has 4 action points which they can use to move, shoot and carry out tasks. During the &quot;stealth phase&quot; of the game, enemy movement is dictated by patrol lines, sentry points and an event card which is drawn each turn. Each mission has a stealth meter which will slowly fill each time the players arouse suspicion (firing weapons, leaving bodies out in the open etc.) If the stealth meter completely fills the players are detected &amp; the alarm will sound, triggering the &quot;battle phase&quot;. The aim of the game is to carry out the mission objective and escape the area unscathed, the easiest way to do this is to avoid detection for as long as possible.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Because, as every Crewmember knows, the Ship's Emergency Protocols are there to protect the Cargo - they're not designed to protect the Crew...<br/><br/>Players play Action Cards from asymmetric personal decks to race around the ship searching for the elusive cards that will help them survive, in a semi-cooperative action-selection game with elements of deckbuilding built into it.  But hidden amongst those cards is a Pandora's Box of evils from the Sci-Fi universe that trigger when their cards are revealed.<br/><br/>The Crew's first task is to work together to shut down the logic puzzles of the Emergency Protocols (number based on difficulty). This then triggers a twist in which a Big Nasty emerges from the shadows and each player is transmitted a Hidden Agenda. Some Crew are looking for the Smoking Gun that will bring the Company down.  Others are working to protect the Company's interests... All are trying to survive.  Because what doesn&rsquo;t make you stronger will probably kill you!<br/><br/>Everything they do generates Noise, but unlike most games in this genre, Noise can be used to manipulate the Nasties hunting you, sending them in a different direction - or even diverting them towards another member of the Crew!<br/><br/>The game ends when any member of the Crew Decouples one of the escape modules and gets away - but to do that without the other Crew on board, they have to first achieve their Agenda: otherwise they must wait for all surviving Crew to board before the module will let them evacuate the Ship.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

As they play through missions on numerous planets with a variety of biomes, they will discover the true nature of their enemy, and will have the opportunity to unearth the rich story of the world of Phantom Epoch.<br/><br/>A wide range of character choices, including human and alien species which can be combined with a diverse set of classes, allows players to create and grow their own characters to match their own play style. Each mission has its own map, objectives, enemies, and challenges. Every map has a completely unique layout. No two missions will be the same, and players will have to adjust their strategies accordingly.<br/><br/>Outside of missions, players will need to gather resources to repair and restore functionality to the starship that serves as their headquarters. Doing so will unlock facilities to improve their characters with upgraded equipment, attributes, and skills. As secrets from the past are revealed, they will gain combat knowledge in the form of branching advanced classes that allow players to further customize and empower their characters.<br/><br/>Before missions, players prepare their equipment and Action cards that they'll bring with them on a mission. During a mission, players and adversaries simultaneously select Action cards at the start of each round. The selected cards determine the turn order for the round. During their turns the players and adversaries play the selected action cards one at a time. The campaign is made up of 40+ missions, and ends when the final story mission is played. As a fully cooperative game, players win a mission together by completing the mission objective, or lose together when all players are defeated or the objective is failed.<br/><br/>",

Set in a dark fantasy world inspired by XVII century Europe and inhabited by anthropomorphic animals.<br/><br/>Will you survive for the 8 days of the Eclipse as the Darkness tries to annihilate the region of Betel all the while competing with the other Guardians to complete one of the four paths to victory?<br/><br/>The Darkest Doom boardgame puts you in charge of one of four formidable Guardians, each with unique abilities and traits. As you explore the areas of the region of Betel you'll be able to take advantage of each different terrain and use its unique characteristics. You'll increase your Guardian's statistics by completing quests assigned to you by Vicar Percival, adjusting your strategy and attitude towards the game based on the stats you choose to upgrade. During your exploration, you'll also stumble onto ancient relics which will help you satisfy one of four victory conditions. You'll be able to declare Alliances with Citadels in order to gain advantages over other Guardians and battle the Darkness which is slowly bringing the whole region to collapse. Each new round is a new Dawn, and thanks to the Citadel restock you'll always have some help as you replenish the cards in your hand, choosing them from different decks: Equipment, Spells and Traps. The same card has different effects depending on the player using it and the stats they've chosen to increase. Whenever you're required to roll dice, High Priestess Elaine grants you and all other players the power of the Crimsonfate - the Amulet of the Elders - which will let you modify the result of the dice with a result of your choice from the Citadels Supplies cards in your hand. Play by yourself with the Bot Guardians mode, allowing you to play with up to three automated Guardians, or prove yourself by challenging three other players in this Dark Fantasy adventure combining elements of roleplay, exploration, handicap management and traditional boardgames.<br/><br/>",

The player who collects more gold coins or the one who arrives first at the Pot wins. It's a game of pushing your luck and trying to trick your opponents. In each move players will try to guess if the next card is higher or lower than the previous one, to advance one step. Some lightenings are played against the others to try to fool them and make them return to the beginning while clowds are used as a protection. A player collects as many gold coins as the cards of the same color correctly revealed, when he decides to stop.

        "description": "Theme and Victory Conditions:<br/><br/>Sabatu is a light strategy game of ancient conquest set in the plains of Sumer (Mesopotamia) over 4,000 years ago. There are two ways to win a game of Sabatu. You can employ a strategy of speed and be the first player to seize any 3 Capitals and to occupy all 3 of them at the same time. Or you can be the first player to build four Walls around one City. The first player to successfully implement either one of these strategies and is able to hold it until the beginning of their next turn is declared Conqueror of the Known World or as Sargon King of Akkad called himself Sarru-kinu, &ldquo;The Rightful King&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>     A player must begin their turn by drawing one Conquest card and immediately following the instructions on the card.<br/>     The player then rolls 2 dice (3 if using all 9 regions), unless otherwise instructed by the Conquest card, or uses Spoils coins to move around the board toward their objectives.<br/>     When landing on designated spaces such as &ldquo;Spoils&rdquo; or &ldquo;Armory&rdquo; draw one tile from the appropriate bag. If landing on a &ldquo;Destiny&rdquo; space draw one Destiny card and immediately follow the instructions.<br/>     Position your troops, buy Walls, trade, do battle if you wish or build your forces and supplies. It&rsquo;s up to you.<br/>     When you are done pass the dice to the next player, signaling that your turn is done.<br/><br/><br/>Battles:<br/><br/>When attempting to occupy the same space already held by another player on the board or when attacking an opponent&rsquo;s City, the 2 Armies must fight a battle. After each player decides which armor or weapons they will use the players each roll one die and then add the value of the Armory tile to the roll of the die. The Army with the highest total amount is victorious. In the event of a tie, the attacker has the option of continuing the attack or retreat. If discretion is the better part of valor and retreat is the desired course of action then the attacker rolls 1 die and moves away from the defender the number of spaces indicated by the die. As long as a City has one or more walls any army within the walls has a 1 point advantage when fighting a battle, in addition to any Armory tile the defender may wish to play.<br/><br/>No player is eliminated from the game. If a player&rsquo;s Armies have all been eliminated from the game, that player begins their next turn with a new Army at Home.<br/><br/>",

It enabled Royal Flying Corps (RFC) pilots to counter the &ldquo;Fokker Scourge&rdquo;, that had given to the Germans air superiority in late 1915. The DH.2 and similar aircraft carried the burden of fighting and escort duties. Great Aces gloriously piloted this aircraft: Robert Saundby, John Oliver Andrews and Lanoe Hawker.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

The Horus Heresy Book V: Tempest tells of the Word Bearers&rsquo; treacherous attack on the Ultramarines at the mustering world of Calth, and of the cataclysmic was that will soon engulf the entire system, pitching not only the Legions against each other, but also the massed ranks of the Imperial Army militia, and the towering god-machines of the Legio Titanicus.<br/><br/>Lavishly illustrated in full colour, this leather bound 270 page book contains an extensive history of the Ultramarines, unit profiles, and an army list as well as rules for the Primarch of the XIIIth Legion, Roboute Guilliman. To represent their part in the conflict, the rules for the Word Bearers Legion have been updated and new units and characters provided for them. The new Imperialis Militia &amp; Cults army list allows you to field the massed troops and war machines of a range of armies raised on a myriad of worlds, including planetary defence forces and twisted Warp cults, with rules to represent your army&rsquo;s unique background and fighting style.<br/><br/>Additional units for Legiones Astartes and Mechanicum armies are presented within Tempest, such as the Sokar Pattern Stormbird, the Domitar Class Battle-automata, and rules for using the gargantuan Mars Warlord Battle Titan.<br/><br/>Bringing this wealth of source material and game rules together, the Betrayal at Calth campaign lets you refight the apocalyptic battles between the Traitors and the Loyalists, providing missions and rules so you can either fight for Calth, or bring about its utter destruction.<br/><br/>",

It's numerous matches are meant as an introduction to the Heroes &amp; Hirelings system, using only the 88 counters and TWO 11&quot; x 17&quot; map sheets provided. The game is play, rather than story, focused; the Matches are meant to highlight some of the possibilities inherent in the system, rather than to represent any overarching theme or narrative. As such, Heroes might be allies in one Match, and enemies in another.<br/><br/>Heroes &amp; Hirelings is a fantasy skirmish combat game. Players control a Party comprised of two kinds of Characters: Heroes and, you guessed it, Hirelings. Heroes are powerful, named Characters with special abilities. Hirelings are anonymous mooks who give adjacent Characters the benefits (and detriments) of Buffs. The object of a Match is typically to Defeat a certain number of your opponent&rsquo;s Heroes. The game is played with 2 Maps, 88 Counters, Markers, Cards, and several eight-sided dice. That&rsquo;s eight, not six or ten. Everything but the dice is provided.<br/><br/>",

Place them together to form a (4-part, section) game board.<br/>&bull;    Players start at opposite ends of the board with their characters spaced apart.<br/>&bull;    Play rock, paper, and scissors to decide which player goes first. Game play then continues with the player to the left.<br/>&bull;    Shuffle and place face down off to the side of the board within reach of all players the Kaiju Assist Cards. <br/>o    Each player may draw 1 card and keep it hidden from all other players. <br/>&bull;    Each player takes 3 Rampage Counter Cards and places them next to their kaiju. <br/>&bull;    Place 2 Military Vehicles on the game board in the designated areas. Refer to Military Vehicles below for placement/respawn info.<br/>&bull;    If you have a kaiju that can either fly or burrow, take a Burrowing &amp; Flying Counter Card for each kaiju.<br/><br/>Game Round &ndash; After each player has had all of their kaiju go, a round has passed. <br/>&bull;    During a turn, each player&rsquo;s kaiju goes. Players may choose to do nothing with a kaiju on their turn if they wish to not move it or do a battle.<br/><br/>What to do during your Turn<br/>At the start of a player&rsquo;s turn, they must announce which one of the following actions they are going to do to start their turn for that particular kaiju.<br/><br/>Battle &ndash; Each player rolls 2 dice and the highest die roll wins. The defender wins ties.<br/>&bull;    Each Battle Kaiju Card and some select Kaiju Assist Cards have a Wound Counter on them to keep track of when a Kaiju receives a hit. <br/>&bull;    Once a player&rsquo;s Battle Kaiju receives a KO, that Kaiju is no longer in play. Remove that Kaiju from the board and flip over its Kaiju Battle Card. <br/>o    Kaiju Assist Cards: Some require being defeated. Once defeated, follow the same rules as above for Kaiju Battle Cards.<br/><br/>Grab/Throw &ndash; Grab a Building/Vehicle; roll 4+. To throw a grabbed object; roll the die, the die amount rolled is the x number of spaces you may throw that object. <br/>&bull;    Destroying Buildings &amp; Bridges: They are destroyed when a player&rsquo;s Kaiju attacks them.  Attacked Buildings/Bridges are destroyed on a die roll of 4+.<br/>&bull;    Once a Building/Vehicle or Bridge has been attacked or used as a ranged attack they are no longer in that space and are considered destroyed. Place a game logo chip on that space.<br/>Hint: Use objects as ranged attack against other player&rsquo;s Kaiju. A player&rsquo;s Kaiju takes a hit from a building on a die roll of 3+ and a hit from a vehicle on a die roll of 5+.<br/><br/>Melee Attack (Punch/Kick) &ndash; A standard attack against another player&rsquo;s Kaiju. Refer to Battle for info.<br/><br/>Kaiju Battle Card Special Ability &ndash; An attack unique to that Kaiju that can be done against another player&rsquo;s Kaiju.<br/>&bull;    Range Attack Ability: Some characters can perform range attacks. These characters can aim at an opponent&rsquo;s Kaiju that are in line of sight.<br/>o    Line of Sight is an imaginary line drawn from the center of one Kaiju&rsquo;s head to the center of another Kaiju&rsquo;s head. If any part of the imaginary line touches or crosses a Kaiju or a building, the Line of Sight is blocked.<br/>&bull;    Kaiju must wait x number of rounds before they can regain their range ability back; depending on distance they used their attack.<br/>o    Each Kaiju who can perform a Range Attack has a Range Ability Counter on their card to help players keep track of when their Kaiju can perform the ability again.<br/><br/>Movement &ndash; Roll the die and see how many spaces you can move a particular Kaiju. This action can be combined with any of the above on a player&rsquo;s turn.<br/>&bull;    Players can either use regular movement or burrow/fly movement on the board and then either do battle, grab/throw or a range attack.<br/><br/>Sharing Spaces &ndash; Only a player&rsquo;s Kaiju may share a space with one other Kaiju they are using at a time. Other players Kaiju may not move onto space with another player&rsquo;s Kaiju.<br/>&bull;    Tails &amp; Wings: Some Kaiju figures have tails/wings that extend into an adjacent square. The Kaiju is NOT considered to be in the square which its tail/wings occupy. If another Kaiju moves into the tail/wings occupied space, either move it off the side to make room or turn the Kaiju figure in the opposite facing direction.<br/><br/>Military Vehicles &ndash; These vehicles are sent to defend the city against Kaiju. They seek out the nearest Kaiju and battle them.<br/>&bull;    During setup, place only 2 Military Vehicles on the game board two spaces away from the middle and facing opposite ends of the board.<br/>o    There will only ever be 4 Military Vehicles on the board at once.<br/>&bull;    During a player&rsquo;s offensive turn, the other player or players (defense) move the Military Vehicles. Any time a Kaiju moves visible to a Military Vehicle, that Military Vehicle will move two spaces towards that Kaiju. Buildings and other Kaiju block Military Line of Sight.<br/>o    If the Kaiju moves out of view of a Military Vehicle, that Vehicle will not continue to pursue the Kaiju.<br/>&bull;    Military Vehicle Firing (attack) distance: May fire (attack) any Kaiju from a distance of 3 spaces away; long as they are in line of sight.<br/>&bull;    Destroying Military Vehicles: They get hit by a Kaiju&rsquo;s Melee/Ranged Attack, including Thrown Objects or a Kaiju enters the same Space they are in.<br/>o    Military Vehicles will spawn at beginning of every round (unless the max number is already on the board) at one of the game setup locations. Player(s) who destroyed a vehicle the previous round or have the fewer number of kaiju on the board will be the one to place a vehicle on the board.<br/>Hint: Use Military Vehicles as projectiles against other player&rsquo;s Kaiju. A player&rsquo;s Kaiju takes a hit from a Military Vehicle on a die roll of 5+.<br/><br/>Kaiju Assist Cards &ndash; Players can only have 1 Kaiju Assist Card at a time. It can be played at any time, depending on what is written on the card. <br/>&bull;    After a Kaiju Assist Card has been played or is no longer in play, place it in a discard pile. Once all of the cards have been used, shuffle the cards and place them face down like at the start of the game.<br/>&bull;    If a player draws a Kaiju Assist Card that they do not wish to use or hold on to, they can discard it at the end of their turn. At the start of the next round and it is their turn, they will draw a new card like normal.<br/><br/>Rampage Mode &ndash; As a player&rsquo;s Kaiju wins offensive battles, its Rampage Counter will go up 1 level. After Winning 5 Battles that player&rsquo;s Kaiju will reach Max Rampage Level. <br/>&bull;    On your next turn (or any other offensive turn) go on a Total Rampage against the opponent's Kaiju! <br/>&bull;    You have 3 Battle Energy to use within your kaiju&rsquo;s Rampage. A standard Battle (Punch/Kick) is worth: 1 Battle Energy and ability off your Kaiju's Battle Card is worth: 2 Battle Energy.<br/>&bull;    Each player has a Rampage Counter Card next to their Kaiju Battle Card to help you keep track of your Kaiju&rsquo;s Rampage level.<br/><br/>Burrowing &amp; Flying Kaiju Special Abilities &ndash; Some Kaiju have the unique special ability to be able to either burrow or fly. When a player uses this Kaiju&rsquo;s ability, they can ignore Buildings or Bridges that may be in there way.<br/>&bull;    At the start of the player&rsquo;s turn, they must announce which Kaiju they&rsquo;re going to use and if they&rsquo;re going to use the Burring &amp; Flying ability prior to rolling the die for movement.<br/>&bull;    Kaiju cannot end their turn under or top of bridges, buildings or water spaces. A player may end either turn on the same space an ally kaiju only.<br/>&bull;    In addition, a player&rsquo;s Kaiju can do pass through another player&rsquo;s kaiju that is in a space.<br/>o    This ability cannot be used during Capture the Flag scenario.<br/>&bull;    Player&rsquo;s will keep track of when they can use this special ability by using the Burrowing &amp; Flying Counter Card. A player&rsquo;s kaiju will need to wait up to 6 rounds (depending on the x-number of spaces traveled) before using this special ability again.<br/><br/>Water Spaces &ndash; If a Kaiju is passing through water spaces -1 is subtracted from their die movement. Kaiju using the flying ability can ignore this rule.<br/><br/>Military Vehicles, Kaiju Assist Cards and Rampage Mode are all extra optional game features to Godzilla Rampage: Kaiju Unleashed.<br/><br/>",

You are competing for hegemony in the market of illicit products.<br/><br/>​The game is played in two stages: the Action Phase and the Scoring Phase.<br/><br/>​The Action Phase is played in real-time for exactly five minutes. There are no individual player turns. Players perform all actions simultaneously. During this phase, players use their Action cards to deploy Agents and move goods from their sources to the Districts they wish to control. Each District has strict needs the Corporations need to supply.<br/><br/>The Scoring Phase happens after the five-minute Action Phase ends. During that phase, the player with more Agents in a given District is said to control it and has the chance to fulfill the needs of that District, getting points for that or failing miserably. After all Districts are scored, penalties are applied based on the number of Actions cards they have left in their hands, and the winner. is determined.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Once one of your characters reaches the Blue Level of Distinction, you have won the game!<br/><br/>On your turn you may curry favor with the King by playing a Favor Point card. These cards each contain a numerical value. and have different titles representing the various aspects of life in the Royal Court, but all essentially have the same effect - gaining Favor with the King.<br/><br/>In addition to showing off their manners in Court, the most aggressive way for your sponsored heroes to earn the King&rsquo;s attention is to challenge their fellow competitors to duels of honor. There are three basic Duel cards: Attack, Defend, and Counterattack. Additionally, there are Enhancer cards such as Weapons and Spells that will increase the strength of a Character's attack or defense in a Duel.<br/><br/>As the Royal Court acts as the heart of the political system in Fleissen, it is a site of intense competition.

        "description": "Red Winter: Expanded 2nd Edition<br/><br/>This 2nd edition game is more than just a reprint of the 2012 CSR Award winner for best WW2 boardgame. It features an all-new battle, complete with its own map and countersheet.<br/><br/>The Battle of Kelja (December 25-27, 1939) now compliments the original Tolvaj&auml;rvi battle. Kelja presents a challenge that is unique to the game system but certainly not the Winter War: a large-scale river crossing. The length of the new map is bisected by a wide, frozen river that functions as a frozen lake.<br/><br/>Kelja is a logical fit for the game system in terms of length and scale. At three days, it provides a shorter play experience than the five-day Tolvaj&auml;rvi battle. The unit density is only moderately higher than that of the previous battle but still limited to a single countersheet, and the featured river crossing offers a unique game situation, providing both players with plenty of decisions and challenges.<br/><br/>Lest the battle become a &ldquo;one trick pony,&rdquo; plenty of options are available to both players, including variable unit setups, multiple victory conditions, variable reinforcement units, and smaller scenarios including some hypothetical situations.<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/><br/>Central to play is the Action Phase, wherein each unit may choose only one from several possible actions: move/assault, attempt recovery, dig in, or take replacement steps. This makes for some very tense decisions for both players. It also conveniently moves the game along at a brisk pace.<br/><br/>Combat is fast and well integrated. Units may voluntarily perform combats against adjacent enemies (two-way firefights, which utilize a CRT), conduct assaults as part of movement, or make ranged attacks at a distance of two or more hexes. The &ldquo;grand tactical&rdquo; scale of 425 yards per hex yields ranges of 2 hexes for light machineguns, 3 hexes for heavy machineguns and T-26 tanks, 6 hexes for medium mortars, and 12 hexes for heavy mortars. Artillery is somewhat abstracted, being handled as off-map batteries which can strike any hex on the map. Players allocate barrages as they see fit, while keeping an eye on their ammunition.<br/><br/>The rules for night turns provide several layers of strategic depth by means of individually simple mechanics. During each night turn, which simulates a 12 hour period, units have double their normal movement allowances. This means combat units can exploit gaps in the enemy&rsquo;s frontline, cross lakes, or execute wide flanking maneuvers. However, such ambitious units are susceptible to &ldquo;Sub-Zero&rdquo; step losses, simulating frostbite, desertion, and poor morale from the extreme weather conditions. Whether or not each stack (note: stack, not individual unit) receives a step loss is determined by a simple 50-50 die roll. The interaction of these night rules means that ambitious players may be encouraged to push their luck and gain the upper hand during night turns, all while the system simultaneously encourages players to &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; and even huddle their units together into stacks during night turns to reduce total step losses. The end result is that the system nicely mirrors the night actions of the actual battle.<br/><br/>The implications of the night rules don&rsquo;t stop there. Skilled players will plan ahead for a night turn by positioning their units favorably during the preceding dusk turn, so they won&rsquo;t need to relocate and possibly take step losses. This nuance can (and should be) exploited by the Finns, who move second in the turn sequence. The Soviet player has the option to build bonfires to avoid sub-zero attrition losses, but in doing so his units become very inviting targets for Finnish assaults. All this gives both players a lot of choices, without burdening them with cumbersome rules or tables.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As your Garden grows, your plants help and guide you along this path, accelerating your progress while also necessitating thoughtful orientation of new plants in your Garden. But you're not alone; other Gardeners are watching, and working just as hard to create the most productive Garden by the end of Winter - and only one will prevail!<br/><br/>Gardeners begin with a hand of between 1-7 of the 200 unique Plant Cards and work to Sow these into their Garden. As they do so, they will need to Collect resources (Soil, Sun, Water, Seed) to pay for the cards as well as make sure that they have appropriate space where each plant can survive. Taking turns, Gardeners collect resources, gather cards, and Sow plants into their Gardens; as they accumulate more plants and their associated abilities, their capacity to do each of these increases drastically. The game proceeds through the four seasons (rounds) in which each Gardener has a set number of turns, and at the end of each season Gardeners Pollinate their plants to gather Harvest. At the end of Winter, the value of the accumulated plants, resources, various tokens, and more determine the total value of each Garden, and thus the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All is not well in the quiet village of Shadowsfall. People are disappearing and there are reports of strange happenings. With fear and suspicion a rife, the villagers have called for the Witch Hunter. Meanwhile, there is turmoil among the Council of Witches. The High Witch is dead and the witches are fighting among themselves for the right to succeed her. But only the most powerful witch can ascend to such a high status.<br/><br/>Can you gather a coven to take the title of High Witch for yourself, while evading The Witch Hunter hell-bent on burning every witch he meets? In Fate of Witches, 2-4 players compete to create the most powerful coven.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Fate of Witches is played over several game rounds. Each round consists of three phases in which players first draw a Character Card, and then cast an effect or place a Character into their Coven. Once all players have had a turn, the Hunters in play move. The player with The Witch&rsquo;s Coin then resolves an Event Card. The Player with the highest-scoring coven at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Player Rounds<br/>A round is made of three phases: Drafting, Hunters Movement and the Event. To begin the round, the player with The Witch&rsquo;s Coin draws 4 cards from the Village Deck and places them in 4 piles right of the Village Deck face up. These 4 cards are referred to as the Village Square.<br/><br/>Drafting Phase<br/>The player with the Witch&rsquo;s Coin goes first. Players take turns in a clockwise order until all players have had a turn. On your turn, draw into your hand one card from either the Village Deck or the Village Square. Any player can then choose to immediately play a card from their hand: they can either add a Character Card to their Coven (up to a maximum of 5) or cast a Character Card Effect. If an effect is played from a player&rsquo;s hand, that card is resolved immediately.<br/><br/>Hunter Movement Phase<br/>The Witch Hunter and the Hound are in town and might be investigating your coven. If a Hunter is currently in a player&rsquo;s coven they are unable to play certain effects.<br/><br/>Event Phase<br/>After the Hunter Movement Phase, the Event Phase begins. The player to the left of the current Witch&rsquo;s Coin holder will draw an Event Card. That player must keep the Event Card secret, only revealing it once the card has been resolved. There are two types of Event Cards: Scenario and Major Event cards.<br/><br/>Final round<br/>The final round is triggered when the last Event Card is resolved and placed into the Event Discard Pile. You then play one last drafting phase. Once every player has had a turn, this signifies the end of the game. Now added up your total score and subtract any penalties, the player with the highest scoring coven is declared the winner and is crowned the new High Witch.<br/><br/>",

Who among you is skilled enough to weather the vicious storm?<br/><br/>Choose from 8 wildly asymmetrical characters with their own unique magical powers. Will you win by having a strong economy, purchasing powerful Gems and even Dragons? Will you rush them down with red Fire cards?

During the player's turn, they will use the abilities (while avoiding the downsides) of the dice. This will enable them to REFACE (manually change the facing on a die) or REROLL some of the dice in order to maximize the scoring opportunity on their turn.<br/><br/>At the end of their turn, they hopefully get to increase the number on their Blue die.<br/><br/>Then it is on to the next player.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A player might choose to play it safe, and roll only 1 die, or may push their luck and roll 2 or all 3. One of the neat spins in this version of that dice system is the idea of Normal dice and Fatigue dice. Normal dice succeed on a roll of 3+, while Fatigue dice succeed on a 4+, as the race wears on Normal dice are replaced by Fatigue dice, and the risk of having some sort of negative consequence from rolling multiple failures becomes more significant.<br/><br/>Spending the Actions a player gets from their dice allows them to do things, such as move further, turn, attack fellow Charioteers, and more, with complex actions like Sharp Turns and Inciting the Crowd, costing more Actions to perform.<br/><br/>The player that manages to complete a set of laps (decided before the game, and typically two) will win the day.<br/><br/>",

This expansion (just like Hack Slash Loot) comes with a bonus expansion called GAME OVER.<br/><br/>Deities of Time<br/><br/>Deities of Time comes with a new time deck and deity cards. These can help heal you through your exploration, but come with restrictions that your hero must follow in order to stay faithful to your deity.<br/>Village Game Mode<br/><br/>This expansion also comes with a new Village Game Mode for solo players. This allows the player to build a Village in between floors. Each new build comes with special abilities that will help aid the hero throughout their journey. Building these buildings will also give you Crown Points. These Crown Points will give you a score at the end of the game. Try to beat your last score or a friends high score.<br/>Nightmare Mode<br/><br/>There is now a new harder mode for veterans of the game or those of you that enjoy a challenge. Tweaks to the Artifacts, Spells, and even how you attack with different elemental damage will give the player more decisions to make.<br/>GAME OVER<br/><br/>Want more stuff? Well here it is, more stuff. This includes more cards for your decks, replaces (and adds to) your potion deck, and provides 2 new Heroes - The Chanter and Construct<br/>Rainbow Rift<br/><br/>One of the most requested add-ons to the game has been dungeon variety.

The game came out in 2015 and just like the &lsquo;Little Train that Could&rsquo;, this game kept chugging. It truly wouldn&rsquo;t be as well known if it weren&rsquo;t for Geek Gamers and Dungeon Dive. Also, I couldn&rsquo;t give enough thanks to some of this game&rsquo;s biggest fans such as David Waller, bark, Prinz Eugen, Scrap Baby, Hlorridi, Nico Farhat, funkboyg, Dani Miller, Jack the Flowerchild, Away111, LordAmaury, coned, Carol (the love of my life), and so many others. Again, thank you all so much and I truly hope you enjoy the new content. There is truly an infinite amount of replayability in this game now.

        "description": "Age of Hannibal resolves the largest battles of antiquity in a single evening, on limited table space. Unlike many other rule systems available for the period, Age of Hannibal acknowledges the critical nature of pre-battle decision making in ancient warfare, when commanders sought the best possible ground for their armies. An innovative terrain card system allows players to create unique battlefields, while also incorporating elements of scouting, flank marches, or possible ambushes. This pre-game action resolves quickly, allowing you to get to the battle, where you command vast armies of 50,000 men or more.<br/><br/>For players who would rather replay a famous historical battle, many scenarios are already researched and available, as well as a full campaign system for map-based play. Age of Hannibal also includes a chapter on conducting siege battles, allowing you to design your own citadel, or recreate historical epics like Carthage or Syracuse!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Pegs hold the soldiers in place on the massive (20&quot; x 20&quot; X ~8&quot;) 3-D plastic game board. Die rolls and line of sight determine combat results.<br/><br/>One unique, if somewhat destructive, aspect to this game is the provision made for land mines. Each player secretly positions two spring-driven &quot;mines&quot; under the board. When they deem the moment is right, they push a button on the &quot;mine&quot;, releasing the spring. This pushes a round disk up that, in theory, pushes the pegs up and scatters the affected soldiers. In practice, it tends to break the pegs on the soldiers.<br/><br/>",

Board B is for 2 or 4 players.<br/><br/>On the board A, six squadrons (teams) of Harriers compete at a military training area. Each team has a base with a runway and 5 platforms from which aircraft can takeoff and land vertically. In the bases are ammunition depots and anti-aircraft guns. They use training bombs and missiles.<br/><br/>Each player has a task to achieve as many hits as possible in the enemy bases. Every hit and shot down aircraft counts as one point. The game lasts as long as players have planes and bombs. The winner is the player who has the best ratio of given and received hits.<br/><br/>The other board (B) is predicted for two players (or two teams - Hot team and Cold team). Cold team has ships with ski jump runways and 5 smaller ships with platforms (concept of small ships where Harriers can takeoff / land). Hot team has platforms and ski jump runways on land. Each team has 12 planes and two transport helicopters. Helicopters carry commandos and if one of them lands in an enemy base - that is the end and victory. In case that nobody manages to do it, the winner is determined the same way as described for the board A - counting caused and received hits. On the board B are used markers of AA guns (each team has 3 of them) which can be placed anywhere in own territory / waters.<br/><br/>Content:<br/>Box 34 x 24 x 5 cm (13,5 x 9,5 x 2 in); Board A : 94 x 62 cm (37 x 24,5 in); Board B : 64 x 48 cm (25 x 19 in); 2 control panels; 40 pieces (harriers and helicopters in flight); 40 markers (harriers and helicopters on ground); 144 markers (armament); 6 markers (AA guns); 12 markers (damage); 7 dice; and detailed rules.<br/><br/>",

Its nickname comes from the odd shape of the inboard struts, which attached to the fuselage rather than to the lower wing. It was the first British airplane to use a synchronized machine-gun for the pilot &ndash; able to fire through the rotating propeller &ndash; and the first two-seater with a &ldquo;puller&rdquo; engine. It served with both British air services and was also widely used by French aviation.<br/><br/>The Sopwith 1&frac12; Strutter Comic was derived from the two-seater Sopwith 1&frac12; Strutter. The Comic was modified to become a single-seat fighter, used by British Home Defense to defend the British Isles from German bombing raids.<br/><br/>Sopwith 1&frac12; Strutter (Costes/Astor)<br/>Serving in the French Air Service during World War I, Dieudonn&eacute; Costes scored eight victories in the Balkans, becoming a fighter ace.<br/><br/>Sopwith 1&frac12; Strutter (Collishaw/Portsmouth)<br/>Raymond Collishaw, one of the greatest aces of WW I, started his glorious career in this aircraft in 1916, when he successfully dueled against six German airplanes at the same time.<br/><br/>Sopwith 1&frac12; Strutter Comic (78 Squadron)<br/>The 78 Squadron used this aircraft in home defense, exploiting its flight stability and long range capability to defend Britain against the huge German bombers.<br/><br/>Each WW1 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>",

You, your cards, and your opponents will determine what is in the canon - but it is up to you to be the player whose own canon matches the central one most closely and most often, to earn the most points.<br/><br/>Each player begins with a hand of five cards.  Throughout the game, players will collectively play cards into and take cards from a set of seven central canon cards.  Players also play into and take cards from their own personal set of seven canon cards. On a turn, players can draw a card or play a card.  Cards can be drawn from the central canon, personal canon, draw stack, or discard pile.  Cards can be played into the central canon, personal canon, or discard pile.  Matching cards can be placed on top of each other in subsequent turns, which can make it more difficult to remove a card from the central canon or make that stack of cards in your personal canon worth many more points.  The game ends the turn after the draw pile is depleted.  Final scoring is determined by the number of cards in each player's personal canon that match the central canon.<br/><br/>The Old Testament Edition includes passages from the Christian Old Testament and the Jewish Torah.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Castles of Dawnstone is a deck building and worker placement game for 1 or more players where you are trying to destroy your opponents village. Everyone starts with the same deck of 10 cards, but through individual village development and hiring mercenaries from the general pool you hopefully muster a better army than your opponent. In a turn, the active player plays all 5 cards in his hand and gains their benefits. Some cards may produce income to purchase mercenary cards or pay them off to retire so your opponent can't hire them. Other cards will allow you to attack your opponent outright. Some may increase the attack strength of your attacking cards. Others will allow you to build better buildings in your village, or worship at the alter of your Gods to give you the upper hand. There are lots of combinations for you to discover. Once you have played all of your cards, move any idle workers in your village to the designated area and leave the ones still working where they are. Then discard the cards you played and draw a new hand of 5 cards. Now your opponent takes their turn. That's it. Super simple rules with a complex strategy and high replay ability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": " Welcome to Rapture!<br/><br/>The universe of Rapture offers a profund, intricate and coherent story, which is transmitted thorugh a skirmish tabletop game. The complexity of this universe allows a wide range in difference when it comes to the looks, gameplay and stories of the individual factions which clash against each another due to the most different backgrounds, motivations and origins.<br/>The battles will be carried out by specialized characters of different kinds with various skills. The initiation into the game is very beginner friendly, and with more experience more strategic depth becomes available. The game has proven itself to be thrilling and consequential from the first round to the last.<br/><br/>This is guaranteed by balanced factions and a wide range of possibilities when it comes to winning the game. Quick interactions between the players that occur in the own or the opponents turn, in form of flexible and influencable actions, result in a very dynamic game. The gameplay can be expanded and heightened with many optional rules and add-ons.<br/><br/>The universe is in constant expansion and allows for new stories, protagonists and occurrences to appear.<br/><br/> Why Rapture?<br/><br/>Rapture is an action-packed, beginner-friendly skirmish wargame for 2-4 players. Choose between entirely different fractions and play asymmetrical missions.<br/><br/>Exciting, fast-paced games with great tactical depth and an ever-suspenseful outcome await you! Play quick, intensive rounds without having to dedicate an entire day to just one game.<br/><br/>Rapture takes little time to set up and is no more complicated than a board game! Choose between unique fractions, each with their own characteristics and style of play. Assemble your battlegroups from different units such as heroes, squads, and bands. Activate your units in alternating order. Stay alert when your opponent activates their units and react swiftly with our innovative reaction system. Accomplish your own individual mission or keep your opponent from accomplishing theirs. Win by victory points &ndash; even if your battlegroup has been entirely eliminated.<br/><br/> Gameplay Highlights<br/><br/>- Quick and Intense<br/>- Unique factions, individual playing style<br/>- Heroes, Bands and Squads<br/>- Immersive reaction system<br/>- Asymetrical missions<br/>- Engaging addons<br/>- 60-120 Minutes<br/>- 2-4 Players<br/><br/> Gameplay Description<br/><br/>The game is played in six rounds on a 90x90 cm game board. The average game session takes between 60-120 minutes, depending on player experience and add-ons used.<br/><br/>Each player leads a battlegroup into the battlefield, usually consisting of 3-5 units carrying a total points score of 100.<br/><br/>All the units at your disposal for this fall into exactly one of the following three unit types:<br/><br/>The hero, a single-model character. The band, consisting of a leader and one or more apprentices. The squad, which usually includes three models representing the main fighting forces of the fractions.<br/><br/>Each hero, band leader, and apprentice has their own individual name, and each name can only appear once in a battlegroup. Squads are an exception and can be represented twice within the same battlegroup.<br/><br/>Each unit has its own profile card with various attributes such as range, resistance, and number of attacks, as well as its individual skills.<br/><br/>The first activation of each round is dependent on the total initiatives of all remaining units on the playing field. It is thus always clear which player gets to start each round, which can change multiple times over the course of the game.<br/><br/>Special attributes include health points, moral points, as well as action and reaction points. Just like the classic health points, moral points in the game are also represented by a status bar. Both bars can be attacked individually, which, in cases of advanced damage, can carry various bonuses or penalties for the targeted unit. A unit can thus be eliminated in two ways, the difference being that a unit depleted of health points must leave the playing field, while a unit without moral points makes a run for it and escapes. Since certain actions cost moral points, as well, moral represents an important resource in the game.<br/><br/>Equally significant is the number of actions and reactions. Our game allows for every player to actively take part in the proceedings, so that waiting times are kept to a minimum and the playing time is maximized. The units are activated in turn, and for each of your opponent&rsquo;s actions, you can carry out a corresponding reaction. The number of actions and reactions are available independent of each other, meaning using all of your action points does not lower your ability to react.<br/><br/>Complete obliteration of your opponent is obviously an advantage, but it does not automatically lead to victory. Every player has an individual mission to accomplish in order to receive victory points. While eliminating enemy units also brings victory points, the missions are more lucrative in this regard, which means that a completely eliminated battlegroup can still win by victory points.<br/><br/>You can complement the basic rules set with a multitude of additional add-ons to change or amplify the gameplay. Some of these include weather effectsand natural events, times of day and how they change throughout the game,creatures with which you can interact, loot boxes with useful contents, and many more. These add-ons can be used in any combination.<br/><br/>On top of the standard game, there are also alternative game modes with their own special rules to make sure you never get bored. There is SPLAT!, for instance, where you have to mark as many terrain pieces with your team color as possible, or Catch the Shard, where you must catch an abandoned Angel shard on the playing field and try to hold on to it.<br/><br/>Rapture can be played with 2, 3, or 4 players with absolutely no problem. You can find all the rules in the rule and story book!<br/><br/>Story<br/><br/>Rapture is set in the year 2049 on our Earth, in our timeline of mankind. Two years earlier, in 2047, most of humanity was harvested off the planet by an alien civilization. There is now only a small percentage of humanity left on Earth, the part which was not suitable for this harvest.<br/><br/>This has created a power vacuum and various secret societies and factions that have been operating in secrecy are taking their chance to step into the light and want to secure their part of this new world. It should be said that our earth has remained largely undamaged, so the angels have not caused a classic apocalypse. Of course, a few things and facilities go down when there are no humans around to take care of them and to maintain them, but the world is still mostly intact - just a lot more deserted.<br/><br/>With Rapture, we deal with a lot of myths, legends, and also some conspiracy theories, sort of as a &quot;what if.&quot; What if some of them were true or what if some historical event as we know it happened for some unknown and secret reason or cause?<br/><br/>Through these events, conflicts arise among the factions on Earth and especially with the mysterious angels. These &quot;angels&quot; are namely also responsible for the harvest, among other things, and they want to bring their extraterrestrial mission to an end and clean the remnants of humanity from the planet.<br/>But how could it all come to this? And where do the angels come from anyway?<br/><br/>In our prologue, which you can also read in its entirety on our website, the two characters Yssantis and Konstantin introduce us to the overall plot.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

For instance, the Cursed Eternal is still considered a Conquistador for Team Ability cards, but he does not generate any of these cards for the Hero Party, he must rely on the cards that the other Conquistadors bring to the group. Having drank from the Fountain of Youth, the Cursed Eternal is blessed and cursed with immortality. Taking Hits every turn (more so as the Darkness grows stronger on the Depth Track) from the withering effects of the curse, he must fight to stave off the deterioration, consuming the souls of his foes with his magical Ghost Blade to heal. Even if KO&rsquo;d by Wounds, he can automatically Recover at the start of the next turn, rolling for Injury and Healing as normal, and Recovering a Grit, as he stands back up from even the most grievous of injuries! Carrying with him a small amount of the Fountain Water in a bottle, he can drink from it once per Adventure to Fully Heal and remove all Injuries, Mutations, and Status Effects that have built up on him. Of course, Madness is another story.<br/><br/>Includes Cursed Eternal Character Sheet, Game Cards, Upgrade Skill Tree, Rules Sheet, 1 Female Cursed Eternal Miniature, and 1 Male Cursed Eternal Miniature, with 30mm bases.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

You not only control the forces on the field but also play the role of the bard, embellishing the story as you play. Maybe a fog bank rolls in, keeping your rogue&rsquo;s flanking attack concealed. What if that common soldier steps up to lead your forces after his commander is consumed by a wall of flame? Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a shame if a sudden downpour wet the strings of an elven ranger&rsquo;s bow just before she was about to fire a shot? With these narrative elements, no battle will ever be the same.<br/><br/>Anthems of War is a fantasy miniatures skirmish game designed to be played head to head by two players with options for more. Prototyped using 15mm and 28mm miniatures players move their characters on the battlefield, roll dice and try to get the upper hand against their opponents using a variety of different scenarios and goals.<br/><br/>Scenarios can be used to represent single conflicts or they can be linked together in an overarching campaign. With a system that introduces narrative elements to the gameplay and the ability to create any characters you can dream up no two scenarios ever play quite the same.<br/><br/>",

In this 2-4 player game, you will assume the role of a Greek God vying for control of the world and the future of your civilization. Wield divine power using asymmetric abilities and your customizable action deck. There are 13 Gods to choose from, providing a different challenge and experience each time you play.<br/><br/>As a God you exercise your will, represented by various cards and abilities, to build the world as you play. On your turn you will play cards and pay for their scalable effects by exhausting your civilization&rsquo;s cities and temples.  New cities and temples can be built when your population grows, making your action cards more powerful and your turns more efficient.  You&rsquo;ll be able to shape the shared world map as players choose which unique hex-shaped land tiles to add, giving the mortals new areas to grow into.  Each land has its own mix of geographic type, attack and defense bonus, population growth rate, potential build sites, movement cost, and location abilities.  No two worlds will look the same.   You will also guide your Hero and High Priestess to go on quests, use location abilities on land tiles, lead your people to new areas, or convert the non-believers. There are also 12 powerful mythological creatures that can be summoned, each with their own abilities to enhance your strategy.<br/><br/>As powerful as you are, the mortals are not entirely within your control as they have their own free will.  They will pray for various signs, protections, or resources, and answering these prayers will grant you a range of benefits in return.  In addition, at the end of each player's turn the population will move and grow in response to the Mortal die's result.<br/><br/>The game ends after 3 Ages of raising mountains, answering prayers, causing catastrophes, unlocking technologies, warring, and building cities, temples, and monuments. Victory points are awarded for area control of the world, your completed quests and world-building secret objectives, technological discoveries, military victories, Follower's morale, and other achievements. Each God also has their own way to earn VP.  The god with the most VP takes their rightful seat on Mount Olympus.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In each turn, you will try to change the course of events on a dynamically built tableau using your adult or child self. To do your best, however, you must recover from the side effects of time travel and regain your mental strength. To win the game, you will take actions to prevent your future's impending downfall and discover resources or information that will help you save it. But what does &quot;save it&quot; really mean?<br/><br/>All players are given a board that represents their mind and cards in their hands that represent unique events in four areas: food, energy, technology and society. They start with limited resources of time tokens and adrenaline pills. Time tokens represent the time they have to change the course of events as they travel through time. Adrenaline pills can give their mind a temporary boost or buy them gadgets that grant additional abilities. Their adventure lasts for three eras, passing over a space-time board (a tableau building mechanic) where they move their adult and child figures to achieve event chain patterns to earn back the fragments of their mind lost by the side effects of time travel. Due to the space-time continuum, when one player achieves a chain pattern, a series of chain reactions might affect other players, providing them with benefits or additional actions.<br/><br/>Each round has four phases:<br/>1) Meditation phase: Players may place event cards from their hand on their mind board, allowing them to activate additional actions.<br/>2) Perception phase: Players play event cards on the spacetime board to achieve patterns and gain benefits.<br/>3) Intelligence phase: Players take actions to complete a specific side quest related to their dystopian future.<br/>4) Memory phase: Players gain resources and end their turn.<br/><br/>Players earn prosperity points by completing chain patterns and side quest objectives. Event cards on their respective mind boards and adrenaline pills in their supplies also grant additional prosperity points. At the end of the third era, the player with the most prosperity points will be declared the winner and savior of the world.<br/><br/>But because your actions alter the continuity of space-time, the future you remember no longer exists. You may have caused a zombie apocalypse, a pandemic virus, the rise of the oceans, or even something worse... So, grab your time travel gear, buckle up, and Restart! This time you have an extra option; you can start a new game or continue your previous one in the new dystopian future that you created. This way you can create your own time travel series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "WarBirds is a very detailed board game system that recreates aerial combat engagements from 1914 to the present day. Each module covers an important era of development, World War I, Inter War Years, World War II, Korea and the Modern era. Taken together, the full series will show how the aircraft has evolved as a weapons system.<br/><br/>Each module will use the same core movement and combat systems and share basic rules between the modules where appropriate. For example, the same rules are used to cover aircraft movement across all modules. Learn one set of rules and you will be able to play any module with the addition of era specific rules such as RADAR or turbine engines.<br/><br/>Each module uses the same basic rules, chart and table layout. The modules scale has been adjusted to fit aircraft performance of the era. For example, the World War I module has a scale of 100 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per Tactical Game turn and each flight point is 15 mph. The Inter War Years module uses a scale of 200 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per game turn and each flight point is 30 mph. The World War II module uses a scale of 300 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds per game turn and 50 mph per flight point. The Korean module uses a scale of 500 feet per hex, 4.5 seconds and 75 mph per flight point. The Modern rules use a scale of 800 feet per hex, 6 seconds per game turn and 100 mph per flight point.<br/><br/>The game may be played on two levels depending on the level of detail desired, Tactical Combat and Flight Operations. When using the Tactical Combat scale, a map board and counters that represent individual aircraft and ground units are used to play combat engagements. At the Flight Operations scale, the player is responsible for meeting mission requirements and leading his flight to and from the target area.<br/><br/>The WarBirds Game System shows the performance differences between aircraft and technological developments have in tactical combat. For example, the World War I rules show the difference between a Fokker DVII with a 160 hp Mercedes engine and one powered by a 185 hp BMW engine. Weapon synchronization systems have an impact on the rate of fire and number of hits on the target. All aircraft have a safe G-Load rating. Maneuver beyond this load and the aircraft may suffer structural damage or failure. Aircraft carry a limited amount of fuel and ammunition to complete the assigned mission. Aircrew are limited in the number of operations they may perform during the game turn by Task Points. How aircraft and aircrew limitations and technological advances influenced air combat engagements may be experienced while playing WarBirds.<br/><br/>Each aircraft data card reflects the performance analysis of an individual aircraft, each subtype or advanced model will have a dedicated data card.<br/><br/>Canvas Falcons is the first module to be released and covers the air war from 1914 to 1918. Fifty two aircraft data cards representing important types that saw service in the air forces of the nations involved. Fifty two tactical scenarios cover the introduction of the aircraft as a weapon armed with hand held weapons to the end of war types such as the Fokker DVIII. Five Flight Operations missions are provided. Air-to-air, air-to-ground combat rules, and balloon busting, rough running engines, fuel use, negative G facing changes, pilot workload, weapon malfunctions, the affect of weapon synchronization systems on rate of fire, pilot and aircrew quality, new and battle weary aircraft and more are addressed in WarBirds.<br/><br/>",

In turns, they add a new tile to the board pushing it in from an edge and pushing the entire row as far as it will go until all the tiles in that row are collected in a contiguous line touching the opposite edge of the board.  At the middle (4,4) square of the board is an immovable wall which also blocks pushing.  The goal is to create a continuous connected set of tiles in your color which connects opposite sides (either north/south or east/west).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Attempting to make a second crippling strike against the U.S. Navy, the Japanese formulated a plan to draw the enemy out into a vulnerable position. Turning their attention to the small island of Midway, Yamamoto's primary strategic goal was the elimination of America's carrier forces, which he perceived as the principal threat to the overall Pacific campaign. Armed with less-than-full-strength carriers, Admiral Nagumo sought to destroy the U.S. Navy&rsquo;s counterparts commanded by Admiral Fletcher. The Battle of Midway begins with Japanese aircraft poised to demolish the airfield on Midway Island. The Japanese carrier fleet has just moved within range to retrieve the aircraft after their attack, presuming the U.S. fleet is nearby. Knowing the Japanese fleets are within attack range, the U.S. has launched aircraft from Midway to deliver a counterstrike while maneuvering its fleet to launch an all-out air assault against the enemy flattops.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>The Battle of Midway is a two-player game with one player controlling the U.S. forces defending Midway Island and the other player controlling the Japanese forces attempting to sink the U.S. fleet and invade the island.<br/><br/>While the U.S. faces grim odds in this battle, they have one major advantage &ndash; they have broken the Japanese radio code. They know the location and makeup of the Japanese forces; while the exact location and makeup of the U.S. fleet is unknown to the Japanese. The Japanese must first find the U.S. fleet before they can attack it, while simultaneously protecting their carriers from the inevitable counter-attack by U.S. aircraft.<br/><br/>For the U.S. to achieve a decisive victory they must sink 4 of the 5 Japanese carriers, matching the success of the real battle. Sinking 3 Japanese carriers or any combination of 4 capital ships (carriers and battleships) will give the U.S. a major victory. The Japanese will achieve a major victory if they sink 2 of the 3 U.S. carriers and destroy the airbase at Midway, forcing the remaining U.S. ships to retreat; and a decisive victory if they sink all 3 U.S. carriers and destroy the airbase at Midway, which paves the way to land the troops and take control of the island and the Pacific theatre. Alternatively, each unit in the game has been given a Victory Point value. The game can be played to 10 or 12 Victory Points (recommended), depending on the length of game you want. If both sides achieve the required points in the same turn, the side with more points wins the battle.<br/><br/>",

The city has given the CO-OP just a few weeks to clean up its act. The CO-OP needs to raise money to pay back taxes and legal fees, or the city will sell the CO-OP and its assets to MondoMart to pay off the debts.<br/><br/>How can the CO-OP survive?<br/><br/>The CO-OP owners, all HIPPIES, have invited some like-minded business types to help them save the store. These folks, the so-called BIZZIES (BUSIness people: pronounced like biz-zees), will have to work together with the HIPPIES to save the CO-OP. Together, they will run it as a business (and keep it groovy), but they need to try a bunch of crazy things! However, the city's deadline is quicky approaching, so the group will have to try some pretty unorthodox methods to keep the CO-OP both profitable and groovy! They may even have to open the CO-OP to non-members!&quot;<br/><br/>CO-OP: the co-op game is a cooperative, variable player powers, hand management, marketplace card game for 1-5 players ages 12 and up (although kids ages 10 and up can play with their parent's help).<br/><br/>In CO-OP, all players assume the role of someone who works at the CO-OP (each with special powers).  Each player also has a VIBE track, representing how they are feeling today.  A global Money track represents how much money the CO-OP currently has.  To win, the CO-OP needs at least $10, and each player must be Groovy or Awesome on their individual VIBE chart.<br/><br/>Since the CO-OP is a store, the usual way to make money is to sell goods to Customers.  There is a Storefront where the CO-OP stocks goods to sell to Customers.  When the Storefront runs out of goods, the CO-OP can move goods from the Warehouse to the Storefront a variety of ways.   When the Warehouse runs out of goods, the CO-OP has to spend some money with Distributors to get more goods.  CO-OP is all about balancing when to buy, move, and sell goods.  But also staying groovy!<br/><br/>The game is broken up into days.  Each day, three things occur: A Happening, Players Turn, Clean-up.   A Happening at the start of the day sets-up today's challenge.  Then, each player gets a turn, usually playing a card.  These cards can be Customers (who buy goods from the CO-OP Storefront), Distributors (from whom we buy goods for the Warehouse), Instagroove cards (with instantaneous effect), or Continuous Groove cards (with lasting effects).  After each player plays, then we clean-up (doing end of turn maintenance).  And then start to the next day!<br/><br/>The game is over when the Happening card GAME OVER comes out.  At that time, the players either win or lose (if they have enough money and VIBE).<br/><br/>Players usually play cards on their turn, but they can also Meditate (to draw more cards), Frolic (cheer up their VIBE), Share (give cards back and forth with other players), and finally COOPERATE (work with other players).  A sample COOPERATE action is the Car Wash: you can't have a car wash with just one person!  There are limited number of COOPERATE actions, so they must be used strategically!<br/><br/>Players can play in any order on their turn to augment another player's turn: this is called Player Selected Turn Order, but it just means you can play in the order that best helps the players!<br/><br/>CO-OP is a game where players work together to discover the best way to balance VIBE, Money, Goods, and cards (Customers and Distributors).  We have to make enough money to save the CO-OP ($10), but we can't give in to the man ... everyone needs to be Groovy or Awesome!<br/><br/>",

She was subsequently captured by the French ship H&eacute;ros off the coast of Sumatra, in 1782. She was called Petit Annibal to distinguish her from the eponymous 74&ndash;gun Annibal, which was in the same fleet. Admiral Bailli de Suffren took her into his fleet, and she saw service in his five battles against British Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in 1782 and 1783. She was decommissioned in 1787 and used as a hulk from 1792.<br/><br/>This ship pack can also be used to represent the French Portland Class &ldquo;Leander 1798.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Ship pack contains a new ship with base, ship card, ship log, and specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unsolved Mysteries: El Ancora de Fuego is an adventure, survival, mistery and terror game for 1 or 2 players that takes place in Japan in 1902.<br/><br/>It's 2018. William Carter is a Brooklyn detective who reopens and investigates unsolved cases, whose evidence was sinister and inconclusive or potentially supernatural. In his current case several mental patients escaped from an asylum and subsequently disappeared without a trace. Everything becomes darker as the investigation goes deeper and he finds evidence that the Y&ouml;kai, demonic spirits and shadows, live amongst us. The players will be the protagonists of Carter's 1902 unsolved case and will join him on his journey through the darkness to discover the truth.<br/><br/>All the decisions made throughout the adventure will influence the development and the end of it. The game is designed to be played several times, since in a single game you can&rsquo;t discover all its content. The players will choose two characters at the beggining from the three initials, being the story different according to who they play it with and unlocking other characters as the story goes on.<br/><br/>Each chapter of Unsolved Mysteries: El Ancora de Fuego is played on a board, using cards to represent places, interactions, objects and Y&ouml;kai, and six special dices whose result when thrown will determine the possible options to be made, each of them will be read in the adventure book. During their turn, players can explore and interact with their surroundings, move to other locations, use objects and defend themselves or flee from the Y&ouml;kai that will appear. Players should keep in mind their mental state, because the darkness lurks and they may fall into a nightmarish state in which their true personality is revealed. And when death comes, they can use the scarce Destiny Markers to avoid it ... temporarily.<br/><br/>The story goes through several chapters, some of them optional and secret, more than five endings, more than 300 different interactions and more than 50 different proofs to find.<br/><br/>Come and confront your fears in Unsolved Mysteries: El Ancora de Fuego!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This four day battle is one of the more gruesome fights in the Pacific Theater.  This game showcases a unique landing system.  While the fight to capture the island is not really 'in doubt', the Marines have a difficult time of wresting control of the place from the tough Japanese defenders.  The main battle campaign starts with the Marines aboard their transports.  From there they must move onto the landing craft and make their approaches to the beach.  The fire from the Japanese ashore is heavy and, as the Marines dicovered to their dismay, the reef causes a major disruption in the landing plan.  It also creates plenty of easy targets for the Japanese player to hammer.  Once ashore the Marines are going to be hammering away with everything they have and the dugin enemy positions are hard to eliminate.  Securing the island within 4 days is no picnic and playing it safe will not cut it.  The Marines need to be aggressive and willing to take casualties in order to move forward.<br/><br/>In the Landing system all Marines start on their transports.  When they become available on the Wave Chart they are loaded onto their landing craft.  From there they move to the Landing Craft Beach Chart.  From here the Landing Craft determine which hexrow of the beach lane they will enter the map.  This can cause some serious traffic jams.  Then the landing craft make their run ins' to the beach.  This is pretty exciting in itself, but then the Marines find wire and mine obstacles waiting for them in front of the sandy beach.  These cause major problems in landing.  The net result of all this is some very high nervousness about whether the Marines will get a solid bridgehead ashore.  The most problematic beach is RED 1.  The Marines here almost didn't make it and it is where the 'the Issue is in Doubt' quote comes from.  You will do better I'm sure.<br/><br/>There are some small scenarios, focusing on 1 beach, an intro scenario of the 2/8 Marines attacking on 22 Nov, and a 'what if' scenario should the Marine player decide to try his hand landing on the 'Black' beaches.  These beaches were located on the seaward side of the island and were covered by extensive minefields.  Good luck with that.<br/><br/>This game includes:<br/>-(8) 11x17 map sections of Tarawa, (2) 22x34 map equivalents 34&quot; across by 41&quot; top to bottom<br/>-5x Unit counter and marker sheets<br/>-Death Ride - Tarawa Master and Supplemental Rules<br/>-Charts and tables similar to other Death Ride games to support the system; and<br/>-Charts that are specific to support the Amphibious Landing such as the Wave Chart and Transport Chart<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What is Fear of the Dark?<br/><br/>Fear of the Dark is a solo horror skirmish wargame set in the worlds of madness created by H.P. Lovecraft.<br/><br/>Solo as this game is designed to be played alone, just you trying to make your warband survive another day. Although it could be played with two or even three players in cooperative mode, that is, fighting together against the forces of darkness.<br/><br/>This is not an usual wargame (competitive mode / player vs player) with some solo rules designed ad hoc, this is a solo game.<br/><br/>Horror as the supernatural and the mystery will be the common thread of our scenarios.<br/><br/>Our characters will have to face haunted houses, gangsters, supernatural beings drawn from the worst nightmares, groups of cultists who want to awake forgotten gods, mysterious murders, ancient curses, and dusty books that predict the end of the world as we know it.<br/><br/>Skirmish since the games will be played with just a few miniatures on a table with some scenery, although this game is not attached to any specific brand of miniatures and you can use any that you like. Forget about huge armies and lots and lots of miniatures on the table.<br/><br/>Another strong point of this game relies in its narrative aspect. The focus is on the story since the plot in each scenario will have a great narrative weight, not just fighting without any reason or random encounters of wandering monsters. The scenarios will have a story that conects everything, all the events that happen will have a reason, and even may never be known by the player until the scenario is over.<br/><br/>The background of this wargame is set in the worlds of madness created by H,P, Lovecraft, where a strange universe of gods and monsters underlies our reality, twisting our world upside down and throwing ourselves into a bottomless pit of madness.<br/><br/>In this game you will play a group of characters during 1920-40 fighting supernatural beings and their acolytes who unconsciously try to wake up the long dormant evil, exploring ancient ruins, hiding from shadows that could devour you, and struggling to live another day.<br/><br/>This is not going to be easy, but it&acute;s going to be fun... that&acute;s for sure.<br/><br/>The ruleset is a 130 pages book that includes rules, 4 scenarios, cards, tokens and everything necessary to play.<br/><br/>Apart from that two free scenarios have been added (making it 6 scenarios and more than 180 pages), and they are not going to be the last free scenarios...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Delve into an atmospheric and strange world in which all units have an innovative live of their own!<br/><br/>Four tribes pursue their own unique goals on a mysterious island full of magic:<br/>The Vikings are stranded, their ships broken. They need wood to repair them. But almost all trees have shriveled - only a few remain. They set out to fell them and transport the wood back to their ships pulled by their trusty oxen.<br/>The Celts have lived here all their lives, but always on the edge of the island. Now a winter is approaching that seems to get worse than any before. So their queen has decided that they need to fell one of the magical trees and float the wood along the rivers back to their home.<br/>The Druids were part of the celtic tribe, but when their arch druid heard of the Queen's plans, he vowed to defend the trees. Now the druids want to bless the trees to keep them safe from any harm.<br/>Unbeknownst to the others the Dark Faery Maeve was behind most of their troubles. She conjured the nebula that got the Vikings too close to the jagged rocks near the shores, she brought howling winds that foretold of the coming cold and she whispered discontent into the ears of the druids. All to gain her own freedom, for the trees are her prison and to break free, she needs to poison them!<br/><br/>So all of these tribes are about to get in each other's way. But there is one problem more: In the magical trees there lives a ghost dragon. And it wants nobody to touch the trees. It's even suspicious of the Druid's efforts to bless the trees!<br/><br/><br/>     living units: Each unit has a &quot;stance&quot; that determines how it will act when it meets other units. They could want to fight, but they might also want to retreat or make peace with the others. You know what your units will do, but you can only change it after they have had an encounter. So you have to plan around the behavior of your units, instead of making them do what you want!<br/>     living dragon: The dragon moves around the island, guarding the trees. There is a pattern to its movement, but you will never be able to predict it, unless you find a way to influence its movement. Also the dragon judges the behavior of your tribe. Whenever your units act, it might get angrier at you or calmer. This determines the fervor with which it pursues your units specifically and it changes the behavior with which it approaches encounters with your units. <br/>     living world: The different areas of the map have unique effects that hinder your movement or lure you somewhere else. Moving around is somewhat of a puzzle in and of itself!<br/>     Readable Asymmetry: Although the playstyles and goals of the tribes are different, they all concern the magical dragon trees. That way it is easy for everyone to immediately see and understand how far everyone is toward reaching victory, without understanding the nuances of their gameplay. Also you don't need to teach 4 different games. Everyone has the same base mechanics. The asymmetry comes from a plethora of unique unit abilities and special actions.<br/>     A map for each player count: The island is different for each player count. The number of spaces not only shrinks, but the areas are actually different. That means the game is ripe for exciting duels between any two tribes. And with three players there is not the odd one out that wins because the other two were just fighting amongst each other.<br/>     Intro cards: Each tribe has a special one-use intro card that only those players get to use that are playing their very first game of Dragon Dale. This serves as a sort of tutorial for your first game and makes it so that you can even hold your ground against a more experienced player.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Soundtrack Trivia is a new Movie Trivia board game with a companion app that challenges players to guess the movie based on music from its soundtrack. This upbeat party game gets your toe&rsquo;s tapping and fingers snapping while stimulating conversations about Movies and Music. This family friendly game is for movie buffs of all ages and can be played by 1 to 12+ people. Since the game is supported by a companion app, expansion packs can be easily updated as they are released keeping the game fresh and current. Prior to starting a new game our flexible settings allow you to select the movie ratings, genres and decades of movies that suit your playing style. This allows you to tailor the game to best suit your movie knowledge. You can also vary the games&rsquo; difficulty. All of this helps create a nice balance so the game can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels.<br/><br/>Various spaces on the board will have players guessing individually, collaborating (or competing) with a partner or a group. If a player is unsure of the correct answer, they will be able to use one of their six &quot;Cut Cards&quot; which will provide additional hints including the cast, the plot, and a piece of dialogue from the movie. There are also &quot;VIP Ticket Cards&quot; that affect player movement. The goal is to make your way around the board starting at &quot;Action Starts Here!&quot; and successfully ending at &quot;That's a Wrap!&quot; After landing on the final space, you will have to answer one last question correctly before earning the title of the biggest movie buff!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But, if an Unluckable absorbs too much, they turn from playful candy loving creatures into trick playing pranksters.<br/><br/>Adopt Unluckables, play tricks, activate unique abilities and do your best to avoid the perils of Unluck.<br/><br/>The first player to end a round with 13+ Skellies, wins!<br/><br/>(additional win conditions included for increased challenge and excitement)<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Each player will choose a uniquely colored Home card, which always produces 1 Skellie, and set it face up on the table in front of them. This table space will now be referred to as your &ldquo;Home.&rdquo; All adopted Unluckable, as well as certain Luck or Unluck cards with the &ldquo;Hold&rdquo; symbol, will be played into your Home.<br/><br/>Congratulations! If you are the first person at the table to read these instructions, you are now designated as the First Player. Deal 3 Luck cards face down to each player. They may look at their cards, but must keep them secret from all other players. After the first player ends their turn, play will continue clockwise around the table until all players have performed their actions. At the start of each new round the First Player will rotate clockwise.<br/><br/>STARTING THE GAME:<br/>Starting with the First Player, you have 3 actions to perform each round. Available actions are:<br/><br/>Draw: Draw the top card of the Luck deck and add it to your hand.<br/><br/>Play: Play a Item, Trick or Support card from your hand.<br/><br/>Adopt: If you are able to meet the Skellie cost of an Unluckable indicated in the star symbol on the top left of the card, place it into your Home. You must draw and resolve Unluck cards up to the number indicated in the bat symbol on the top right corner.<br/><br/>Release: Discard any number of Unluckables and reduce the cost of adopting by their Skellie value until the end of your current turn. (adopting will require performing another action)<br/><br/>Activate: Perform the ability of an adopted Unluckable with an Activation  symbol. You may only use an adopted Unluckable&rsquo;s ability once per round.<br/><br/>Trade: Trade any number of cards with another player. An action is only performed if another player accepts the trade, allowing you to make multiple offers without risk of losing actions.<br/><br/>After you&rsquo;ve performed all of your available actions, the next player may begin theirs.<br/><br/>HAND SIZE:<br/>Each player starts with a hand size of 5 cards, however there are ways within the game to increase your hand size. Players with more cards than their hand size must discard down, but only at the end of a round. This allows players to hold cards higher than their hand size for a brief, and hopefully beneficial, period of time.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION:<br/>When adopted Unluckables are providing any player(s) with 13 or more Skellies at the end of a round, the player with the most wins!<br/><br/>ALTERNATE WIN CONDITIONS:<br/>Adopt 8 Unluckables in consecutive order of cost (1-8, 2-9 or 3-10) or attach all 6 unique items to adopted Unluckables for an instant win!<br/><br/>Play each win condition independently, or all at once.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

This force is greatly outnumbered by the &Eacute;migr&eacute; French General Langeron&rsquo;s wing of the Army of Silesia, consisting of the IX and X Corps of Russian and Prussian forces.  These two corps, with tremendous artillery support, have an overwhelming superiority in numbers over the French Imperial forces.<br/><br/>The battle, which saw the Coalition forces push the Poles and French out of the Wiederitzsch after three brutal hours of combat, was among the most intensive of any of the battles in the Leipzig cycle.  Historically, the twin villages change hands several times.  Marshal Enterprises has developed special rules to reflect the gruesome nature of the conflict, and the almost mystical determination of the Poles to prevail over their hated Russian neighbors.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/><br/>New rules for the players to consider are the effects of Elite Units, Landwehr skirmishing, Russian Dragoon&rsquo;s abilities, improved towns, dusk combat, the loyalties of certain units, command structures and plundering. Besides the historical battle, four scenarios are included. These provide for a cavalry on cavalry only battle, inspired attacks by von Bluecher and the ability to jump into combat for the struggle of Moeckern itself. This scenario will end whenever a player reaches a threshold casualties and disintegration of order.<br/><br/>",

The goats destroyed that Troll, and ever since that time shepherds have weaponized their herds to become mutated monster goats called Gruffs! Gruff is a tactical combat card game where players duel to the death with custom teams of Mutated Monster Goats! Gruff features unique positional and timing mechanics that create a constant state of attack and counter-play.<br/><br/>Gruff: Whispers of Madness is a stand-alone game that is fully compatible with the Gruff rules system and other Gruff games. Whispers of Madness provides the same visceral competitive experience as Gruff, but adds a new mechanic to the game, Sanity and Madness!<br/><br/>A Brutally Competitive Game- Whispers of Madness' combat mechanics create a constant state of counter-play.

Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging!<br/><br/>An Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!<br/><br/>A Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Whispers of Madness can support a four-player tournament out of a single box!

        "description": "Orange Swan is a strategic game that recreates the war in the Pacific. Orange Swan may be combined with Black Swan<br/><br/>The Call of The Orange Swan<br/><br/>Japan, on the eve of its entry into World War Two, is looking in two different directions. It sees opportunity and it fears defeat. It clamours for modernity and yet it will not, cannot, forsake a history of staid traditions and the rituals of self-slaughter.<br/><br/>Admiral Yamamoto, at the head of a powerful navy, is being driven towards a decision that is not of his making. Those who truly desire war will relinquish neither their swords nor the ethos with which they are imbued, and so even while the likes of Hideki Tojo make their case for the fulfilment of destiny, for the acquisition of empire and the control of an abundance of natural resources, Yamamoto is painfully aware that their contempt for any and all likely enemies, their belief in the cult of the warrior, their very dreams of battle and conquest, belong to an age that is already dead.<br/><br/>Yamamoto sees only one chance &ndash; Japan must strike quickly and with overwhelming and decisive force. If the enemy, first and foremost the United States, is given any pause, any form of reprieve, Japan will almost certainly be crushed.<br/><br/>Chance and mischance play out their themes at Pearl Harbor. Japan wins and loses all in the same instant. The US carriers are not there, and while Japan will conquer for a while, bringing much of the Pacific and SE Asia under its control, it cannot hold what it has gained. The oft-repeated commands to fight to the death are each an admission that they have already lost. It is only a matter of time&hellip;and of blood.<br/><br/>The culmination is at Hiroshima. What good swords at such a time, against such a vast and blinding and terrible fire? Those who hungered for war have no answer. They have never had an answer. Science and industry do not sit well with emperor worship or with archaic notions of sacrifice.<br/><br/>Could it have been different? Chance and mischance are the ultimate reality of every course that every war has ever followed. Orange Swan is your means to experience this.<br/><br/>ORANGE SWAN is a block wargame covering WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945.<br/><br/>As in all other block games, both the Fog of War and Unit strength reduction/increase by rotation, drive the gameplay in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy block until it is revealed in combat.<br/><br/>ORANGE SWAN is a historical game with some fixed starting points, but the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (China, Commonwealth and US).<br/><br/>During any Victory Check (two per each Season, one at the end of the Axis Turn and one at the end of the Allied Turn), the game immediately ends with a Total Victory if either the following conditions are met:<br/><br/>a.    Tokyo is enemy Controlled;<br/>b.    Atomic Bomb Event;<br/>c.    Japan controls 7 Strategic Land Areas or Japan has a Production of 75.<br/><br/>Additionally, a special Victory Check is made at the end of the each year of the Campaign game, or at the end of a Scenario.<br/><br/>Game Introduction<br/><br/>ORANGE SWAN is a historical game that covers WWII in the Pacific from 1941 to 1945. Its name reflects that of its older sibling Black Swan, a game that covers WWII&rsquo;s European Theatre, but also that of the United States&rsquo; plan for fighting Japan, developed long before Pearl Harbor, called War Plan Orange.<br/><br/>Orange Swan uses many of the same game mechanics as Black Swan but with greater focus on the innovative, and mechanically simple, naval systems that were universally praised.<br/><br/>One revision that entirely changes the feel of the game is the addition of the Seaborne Blitz phase. Similar to Black Swan&rsquo;s land based Blitz double turns that made the Eastern Front so dynamic, Orange Swan translates that idea to a double naval turn. The results are highly satisfying from both a gameplay and historical perspective.<br/><br/>Similar to other block games, Fog of War is a core element in ORANGE SWAN, as a player cannot know the identity or the strength of an enemy unit until it is revealed in combat.<br/><br/>While Orange Swan&rsquo;s campaigns and scenarios feature historical starting points, the outcome is completely unpredictable and, despite the historical result, the Axis Side (Japan) can defeat the Allied Side (the United States, the Commonwealth, and China).<br/><br/>The Allied Side can cooperate, so they can stack together, or trace supply accross either a Sea Zone or a Land Area Controlled by an Allied Nation. (Note: Chinese Communists stack only with themselves).<br/><br/>Japan, the United States (US), the Commonwealth (CW), and China are Major Nations. The Philippines and Dutch East Indies (DEI) are Minor Nations controlled by the US and CW respectively.<br/><br/>No Side can enter Land Areas belonging to the Soviet Union or any of the Absolute Neutrals, identified with a white border: Nepal and Butan.<br/><br/>Each Major Nation has its own units (in a specific color), Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.<br/><br/>The Force Pool of a Nation is made up of all units of that Nation that are not deployed on the mapboard and are available to be built (that is, purchased during the Production Phase).  Note that some units have a colored circled number (2, 3, or 4) in one corner, indicating the year when the unit is added to the respective Force Pool. Thus, in 1943 it is not possible to build a Unit marked with a circled &ldquo;4&quot;, as it will be added to the proper Nation's Force Pool in Winter 1944. Elite Units are designated with a darker color background.<br/><br/>Nations of the same Side maintain their own Supply Source (their National Capital) but they can trace Supply using any of their Side&rsquo;s Naval Units, Controlled Land Areas, or Controlled Sea Zones. They can freely enter any Land Area of, and be transported by, the Naval Units of their Side. They can stack, move, and attack together, but each Nation keeps its own Force Pool, Economic and Strategic Power.<br/><br/>China has two kinds of forces: Nationalists and Communists. Both Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communists are always supplied and therefore do not need to trace any supply.<br/><br/>Chinese Communist Units can only stack with other Chinese Communists. They can, obviously, attack any Axis Side Units. Chinese Nationalists can stack (and move/attack) freely with units of the Allied Side.<br/><br/>All Chinese units are restricted to Continental Asia and Hainan and can never be Sea Transported.<br/><br/>National Capitals: Nations have the following Capitals, which also act as Supply Sources:<br/><br/>1.       Japan: Tokyo<br/>2.       US: San Diego<br/>3.       CW: New Delhi and Sidney<br/>4.       Philippines: Manila<br/>5.       Dutch East Indies: Batavia<br/><br/>Nation&rsquo;s have their own blocks of the following color:<br/><br/>1.       Japan: orange<br/>2.       US: green<br/>3.       CW: blue<br/>4.       China: purple<br/>5.       Philippines: light green<br/>6.       Dutch East Indies (DEI): light blue<br/><br/>Minor Nations do not have their own Economic or Strategic Power, nor a dedicated Force Pool. They are controlled by the Major Power they are allied to, which treats them as if they were CW (for the DEI) or US (for the Philippines) units for all game effects. When destroyed, Minor Nations units are eliminated from the game, so they will never go into any Force Pool.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This tabletop card game uses social deduction and hidden roles creating an atmosphere of tentative trust and unsuspected betrayal. The towns&rsquo; days are mostly sweet, sometimes bland, but never spicy. Some would like to see that pattern changed but must assume a sweet exterior to fool the townspeople and gain their vote for office.<br/><br/>Players are assigned a secret political party of sweet or spicy and must work to differentiate their allies from their opponents. Using Lobby Cards, players will help, hinder, support, and discount their fellow candidates.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players will periodically vote for their top candidate. Questionable behavior will impact voting, and your loyal supporter in round 1 may become your enemy in round 3. Will Sweet sweep the competition or will Spicy play dicey?<br/><br/>",

With strong tank-led forces surging northward and other units landing by sea at Inchon, the United Nations rapidly turned their victory into a North Korean rout.<br/><br/>Korean War - Counter Attack is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series based on these fearsome battles. You do not need any other game to play all of its 65 scenarios. Design is by Jay Townsend, creator of our Saipan game.<br/><br/>The North Koreans have a wide array of Soviet-made weapons, spearheading their attack with T-34/85 tanks. The South Koreans are fairly lightly equipped, while their American allies bring the tanks and guns that won the Second World War: M26 Pershings, M24 Chaffees and a blistering helping of air power.<br/><br/>New forces arrive to help out: the U.S. Marine Corps deploys some real armor this time: the the castoffs of the Pacific War, but M26 Pershings of their own. There's also a helicopter (games with helicopters are always better) and the British are here. too.<br/><br/>The game includes four semi-rigid mapboards, with art by Guy Riessen. The maps are fully compatible with all others in the Panzer Grenadier series, and those from Panzer Grenadier (Modern) and Infantry Attacks, too. Plus 517 playing pieces: smooth, scorchless, sootless laser-cut piece, a joy just to hold in your hands. And 62 (sixty-two!) scenarios.<br/><br/>",

As you go, you'll assemble a crazy-looking Dr.Seuess-like horn that branches off in different directions. The pipes of your trumpet will also be adorned with flags, birds, and notes that will help you meet various scoring criteria.<br/><br/>While building your trumpet you'll trigger special bonus actions by covering &quot;King's Favor&quot; scrolls on your player board. These scrolls will let you choose which of the King's Favor bonuses you'd like to receive: take a free premium tile, take two additional actions, or gain an additional Private Goal card. The next time you trigger the same favor, it becomes less powerful and then is no longer available to use. Which favors you use, and when you choose to use them, can make or break your prospects of winning...so choose wisely!<br/><br/>The game ends when either the basic tile stack runs out or a player completely fills their player board. All remaining players take one final turn and then players tally up their scores which include length of completed pipes, collecting sets of flags depicting the various houses of the kingdom, notes surrounding birds, tiles left in hand, public objectives, and private goals. The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>The game includes a family variant which removes the King's Favors and Private Goals to make the game much more accessible to beginners and younger players.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The great sages of Xrathgar, the Great Empire, thousands of years ago created three tests called The Trials of the Mages. The first trial is the Iocus Arcanus, a coliseum where the mages have no control over the magic and its luck that accompanies those destined to continue the path of the sages. The second trial, Draconis Arcanus, the search for the feather of the fenix dragon. And the last test, Arcanum Regem, the hardest and the one that really shows if the apprentices can lead the kingdom of Xrathgar.<br/><br/>The First Trial is held in this crazy coliseum, where the arcane energy transforms from one type to another. The apprentices will obtain different knowledge and the one who is able to learn them all, will win this trial. Of course, the other apprentices will not let you win, throwing away your soul from the coliseum, geting you out of the trial.<br/><br/>Simple rules, funny and full of magic, perfect for a family boardgame night!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, a landslide has forbidden your return home and you will have to stay for a few days. The only inn in town is the infamous Hostil Hostal, known for its intriguing past and deteriorating interior.<br/><br/>Your guests desperately need their rest but it will be hard to come by as you not only need to deal with the dangers of the hostel itself but also the insensitivity of the other guests.<br/><br/>Hostil Hostal is a strategic, entry level, family game. Players take turns placing guests in the beds of the different rooms of the inn. Each room brings different levels of comfort that will change according to its occupancy and deteriorating condition. Additionally, each guest&rsquo;s rest will be affected by different events played in secret by each player. In the end, the player whose guests got the best sleep will be the winner.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Items are placed face down and must be discovered by the players and stored in inventory and eventually used or destroyed depending on their player type.<br/><br/>Zombies will attempt to find newspapers and throw them into one of two water barrels randomly placed on the map. The human player attempts to find pieces needed to make fires, such as newspaper and matches, or a molotov cocktail. When the human player has enough items to start a fire, he must get to one of the fire locations on the map and light it.<br/><br/>To make things even more difficult for the human player, the zombies may also stash other items in their inventory, in which the player can only get back by attacking and winning a battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eternity Wars is a tabletop board game based off Real Time Strategy video games (RTS for short).  Players manage resources, build bases, recruit armies, and engage in strategic combat similar to an RTS video game!  Eternity Wars was developed with an intent to port the same mechanics that make RTS games so enjoyable onto a table top setting.  Veteran RTS players will recognize the Tech Trees, different resources, required micro and macro management, and unit types that are staples in the RTS genre.  Although the game functions very similarly to the video game variant, it includes many new and original mechanics that make playing Eternity Wars a unique and fulfilling experience.<br/><br/>The game has two expansions, the Covenant of Necromancers Expansion Set and the Great Animal Kingdom Expansion Set.<br/><br/>After running a Kickstarter campaign that failed to fund, only 20 units were ever produced.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts out with 8 cards and the object of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all of their cards.<br/><br/>Each card corresponds to a plastic piece. Players may play more than one card on their turn as long as the cards are the same color or wild. If a player tries to play too many cards at once, another player might play the Stop Turn card, which will force the player to discard those cards and draw replacement cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, place cards down for the pieces you intend to play, and place the corresponding pieces on top of each card. With one hand, place each piece one at a time onto the central platform. Once you place all of your pieces, draw a card from the deck to end your turn. If any piece falls off of the central platform, your turn ends. For each piece you didn't finish placing, draw a card from the deck. Instead of drawing a card to end your turn, you must steal a card from an opponent as a penalty.<br/><br/>",

The cogs of the great machine squeal and turn.  <br/>The chants of the mystics of Ovog can be heard like distant thunder rolling in from the north.  <br/>Vehenna, gleaming like a flower in full bloom, sows the seeds of discord to the south.

Long ago, monstrous beasts called Titans roamed the land.  Duelists from all over the world trained and competed in the Wild Hunt, an annual event where hopeful fighters would pit their wits and their gunswords against these powerful creatures.  Now that the Titans are all but extinct, the denizens of Ozora have focused their skills on each other in dueling tournaments.<br/><br/>First, you pick a character from our roster of Duelists. Then, choose a Weapon for them to wield in battle. Every character has a favorite weapon, but these people are experts: they can fight with anything. With five characters and five weapons to mix and match in the Core Set, there are over 100 unique 2-player match-ups right out of the box.<br/><br/>Your Duelist and Weapon will determine the cards in your deck. You&rsquo;ll end up with 30 cards representing your skills in combat. Then you just set out your characters in starting position, shuffle up, and fight!  Using two unique systems to represent the flow of combat, the Momentum resource and a modified Chess movement system, GUNSWORD is a game for all ages and experience-levels to enjoy.<br/><br/>",

Every week is a small portion of an overall larger campaign which will take many, many weeks to come to conclusion. The postcard will include a QR code or website address that will direct you to the weekly adventure document. The document will explain the setup, instructions, and key areas on the adventure map.<br/><br/>A Path of Self-Learning uses simplistic character creation and dice rolls for combat and interacting with the world. There are a series of questions, all of which alter the final conflict of the game in various ways. On the 12th week, the adventure will be completed and to survive is to win.<br/><br/>The Story:<br/>As punishment for a crime committed against humanity, the Lord of the land has sentenced you to a Trial of Character. You must be judged against both physical and mental challenges in which you will discover who you truly are. You will learn about the three principles, Truth, Love, and Courage. You will face moral dilemmas in each of the eight virtues where your answers must be considered carefully. Finally, you will face a mighty foe in one-on-one combat. A foe whose power is a reflection of the choices you have made. Can you prove yourself worthy to earn your mantle back, Avatar?<br/><br/>A Path of Self-Learning is only the first adventure in a larger overall campaign. There are more aventures of different themes and new rules on the horizon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A bird might ride thermals forever above a sea of green that stretches beyond every horizon and never find its borders. A squirrel might run from the Great Iron Tooth to Icepeak Mountain leaping from branch to branch, never touching the ground below. Clearings dot the map where trees as large as castles topple, quickly overgrown by hungry young saplings, eager for light. The twilight world beneath the boughs can match any cavern for gloom or any tomb for silence.<br/><br/>Cartographers distinguish between the Darkwoods and the Eastern Darkwoods, but these are mere lines on mortal maps, fragile and brief. The Darkwoods stood when the world was wrought and will stand when Trudvang ends. The Darkwoods lives and breathes, and while roads and trails might crisscross the land between the trunks, take ten paces off the path in any direction, and you look upon a place that has never known the tread of mortalkind, not since the first of us blinked in the young sun&rsquo;s dawn.<br/><br/>The Darkwoods is not unknowable, but it holds its secrets dear. Even seasoned Elven rangers with centuries behind them will speak of forgotten wonders and unknown horrors concealed in the stillness. It&rsquo;s a hinterland, a wild land, not an enemy to mortalkind, but no friend either for travelers unprepared for its challenges. The Darkwoods does not suffer fools, no matter how kindly intentioned. The Darkwoods watches.<br/><br/>Trudvang Legends: Darkwoods is an expansion that features a brand-new campaign that brings players a branching story inside the large and eerie Darkwoods Forest, a majestic albeit sinister woods where darkness broods. Rumors have it that a demon has taken refuge in its depths, twisting and manipulating creatures, terrorizing all who come near it. It's up to you to investigate the source of this rumours, and to try and survive the expedition itself! In addition, features a brand new playable Class, the Demon Hunter, who masters the dark forces and twists the limits between good and bad.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It's an intense game of strategy and prediction, as each player secretly inputs orders into the AI-powered Blinks game pieces, then watches as skirmishes play out in real time. It's the kind of unique analog/digital hybrid experience that's only possible on Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system. The game started as a post on the Move38 developer forum in early February, and has since been iterated on and perfected with the help of the Move38 team.<br/><br/>In Raid, 2 to 4 players compete to conquer an island made of Blinks. The game requires at least 6 Blinks, and takes 10-20 minutes, depending on the size of the island and number of players. Each round, players close their eyes, then take turns opening their eyes and making an attack on the island with their longboat. Once all players have attack, all eyes are opened and the game calculates the outcome of the round. Armies spread from the coast into the center of the island, competing for a dwindling set of unoccupied territories. When all coastal territories have been attacked and no more longships can land, the game calculates which player conquered the largest territory, making them the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One side (white) plays the attackers, and one side (black) plays the defenders.<br/><br/>heXentafl can be played on a 4x4 or 5x5 hex grid.<br/><br/>The King sits on the central space, the throne, surrounded by three defenders. Six attackers sit on the outer corners of the grid.<br/><br/>The attackers must capture the King in order to win. The defenders must escort the King to any of the six corners of the board in order to win. The defenders usually move first, but either works.<br/><br/>It is recommended that players play in sets of two games, alternating who is the attacker and who is the defender.<br/><br/>All pieces except the King move in a straight line, as many spaces as they like to an unoccupied space (like a rook in Chess). Only one piece at a time can occupy a space. A piece cannot jump over another piece.<br/><br/>The King can move into any vacant adjacent space, moving one space at a time (similar to the king in Chess).<br/>Pieces are captured by surrounding them on two sides.  In the image shown, white moves into position to surround the King and capture it, winning the game.<br/><br/>The corners present an interesting challenge, as they can't be surrounded in the normal manner. Pieces can be captured on a corner by surrounding them in the manner shown.<br/><br/>You cannot &quot;capture&quot; your own piece by moving between two enemy pieces.<br/><br/>The Throne<br/><br/>The central space of the board is the throne.

        "description": "Set at the end of the 17th century Amsterdam Tulip &amp; Rose takes you into the booming flower trade of the period.<br/>The flower market is full of merchants that want to strike the best deals, find rare species for their exceptional collections or earn the best value for their flowers&rsquo; merchandise. In order to do so, a fresh twist of I cut you choose mechanic, used to maximize your profit from the following auctions, is implemented.<br/>You and your fellow players are flower merchants, participating in a two days festival! Think smart, make good use of your coins, decide what you&rsquo;ll keep and what you&rsquo;ll sell wisely and the victory will be yours.<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s a brief description of the game and its gameplay: Players try to get the most points out of the flowers they have gathered and the coins they&rsquo;ve collected. The game is played in two &ldquo;days&rdquo;, and on each &ldquo;day&rdquo; several rounds are played (1 round per player). On each round, one player is the &ldquo;active merchant&rdquo;, and he tries to sell flowers to the rest of the players.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>84 Flower Cards<br/>22 Special Cards<br/>15 Special Orders Cards (these are used in a variant)<br/>5 Scoring Assistant Cards<br/>5 Merchant Cards<br/>70 coins in 3 different values<br/>10 Loan tiles<br/>1 Rulebook<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Before the game starts, each player selects (or is given randomly) a merchant card, a scoring assistant card and some coins.<br/>The flower and special cards are shuffled together, and are placed as a face-down deck on the center of the table.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Each round consists of the following:<br/>- Receive Income: this applies to all players. Each one gets coins from the bank, depending on who his/her merchant is, and what cards he/she possesses (some cards offer income).<br/>- Reveal cards: The active player draws and reveals a number of cards from the deck, arranges them into two or three &ldquo;bouquets&rdquo; and offers them, one by one, for auction. The other players announce their bids (each player can bid more than once), and this continues until someone offers an amount no-one else wishes to surpass. The active merchant then has two options: to give the bouquet to the highest bidder and get the money, or to keep the bouquet to himself/herself, and give the high bidder an amount of money equal to half his/her high bid.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/>At the end of the second day the game ends, and each player counts the points he/she gathered from his/her flower collection and his/her coins. The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seven Fallen is a Fantasy collectible card game from France. <br/>You play as a Divinity and your goal is to destroy your opponent with your best army of Angels and Golems. <br/>Released in 2020 under the name &quot;War of the Kingdoms&quot; the first edition is still going on.<br/><br/>The first goal of the game is to include the players into the process of rules creation and gameplay. It is a game created by players for players. Even the way of selling the games is new and fresh, boosters can't contain starter cards and vice versa, the goal is to mainly enjoy the game with the stress of money, which for a TCG is pretty unusual.<br/>100% of the cards can be played and considered in a deckbuild. There is no vanilla cards.<br/><br/>In the story of Sevenfall there is 7 kingdoms fighting for domination of the world. <br/>Game play is pretty efficient and the game is very well balanced, highly addictive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
